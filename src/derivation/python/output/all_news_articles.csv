0,2004-11-11 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the fourth time this year and left the door open to more increases in coming months. The Fed\'s interest-rate setting committee raised its short-term interest-rate target to 2% from 1.75%, as widely expected. The Fed has boosted the rate a quarter of a point at each of four consecutive meetings since June, when the rate stood at a 46-year low of 1%. Several commercial banks responded by raising the prime rate, a benchmark for commercial and consumer loans, to 5% from 4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee said, as it did after each of its past three increases, that it can raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured,"" leaving the door open to another increase at its Dec. 14 meeting. Economists are split on the likelihood of such an increase. ""If they see evidence hiring is holding up and consumer spending isn\'t tanking despite high oil prices, they\'ll not be too concerned,"" even if oil prices rise some more, said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, who expects a December rate increase. But Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor now working for the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers, said the Fed sees little momentum to economic growth at present. ""If the economy is stuck in this [trend] for another quarter or two, they are going to pause in December."" One wild card is the dollar. ""Even with the rate hikes, the dollar has been weakening,"" noted David Malpass, chief global economist at Bear Stearns. A lower dollar raises the prices of imports and thus puts upward pressure on inflation. Though yesterday\'s meeting was devoid of surprises, it appears to mark a transition. The past four increases have been motivated mostly by the Fed\'s desire to lift rates from emergency levels that were appropriate when deflation was more of a concern than inflation. For almost two years, the ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, funds rate had been negative, and Fed officials considered that to be a recipe in the long run for accelerating inflation. Though 2% is still below neutral, it is now above the underlying inflation rate of 1.4%, based on the Fed\'s preferred price index. Neutral, in Fed jargon, means a level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth, and commonly is estimated at 3% to 5% in the long run. ""Now that the real fed-funds rate is out of [or very close to being out of] negative territory, the [interest rate] path is expected to become more data dependent,"" Morgan Stanley economist David Greenlaw wrote in a note to clients. The strength in employment and declines in oil prices have led markets to expect a rate boost in December, but signs of weaker consumer or business spending or another jump in oil prices could change that. The statement accompanying the rate decision gave little hint of the Fed\'s plans. It said, ""Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, despite the rise in energy prices, and labor-market conditions have improved."" The assessment was a bit more upbeat than the one issued in September, when the Fed said output growth had regained ""some traction"" and the job market had improved ""modestly."" The Fed also said, ""Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained."" And once again, it stated that the risks to both inflation and growth in the next few quarters were balanced. Because the Fed signaled no inclination to pause in its rate increases, futures markets continued to put about 80% odds on a quarter-point increase in December. Still, some Fed officials may want to pause. Just 10 of the Fed\'s 12 regional banks requested a quarter-point increase in the little-used discount rate to 3% before yesterday\'s meeting, whereas all 12 had asked for the three prior increases. The San Francisco and Dallas regional banks didn\'t ask for an increase before yesterday, though San Francisco did so after the meeting. The president of the San Francisco bank, Janet Yellen, recently has been more cautious on the economic outlook than her peers. The Dallas bank\'s president, Robert McTeer, resigned last week to take another job, but that was well after his bank\'s board last met. Regional-bank boards send requests to change the discount rate, which is charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. Those requests usually reflect the monetary-policy recommendation of the bank\'s president. Though all 12 voting members of the 19-member FOMC supported yesterday\'s rate increase, neither Ms. Yellen nor the acting Dallas president, Helen Holcomb, have a vote this year.

1,2006-08-09 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- By leaving interest rates unchanged yesterday after two years of steady increases, the Federal Reserve sought to balance the risks of a sharp slowdown and rising inflation -- an effort many economists said might not succeed. Reflecting the difficulty of the Fed\'s task, economists -- like the Fed\'s policy makers themselves -- aren\'t unanimous about what the central bank should do as the economy sends mixed signals. Some economists feel the Fed has raised rates too far already, while others say it hasn\'t raised them enough. In keeping its target for short-term interest rates at 5.25%, the Fed acknowledged that ""readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months."" But, reiterating Chairman Ben Bernanke\'s forecast last month, it added: ""Inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary-policy actions and other factors."" That sentence suggests the Fed feels it has done enough, or almost enough, to rein in economic growth and nudge inflation down to a more acceptable level. Still, as it did in June, the central bank left the door open to further rate increases, saying that ""some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional [increases] . . . to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth."" Yesterday\'s decision was widely, though not universally, expected. Stocks initially rallied on the news, but ended the day lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 45.79 points at 11173.59. Bonds were little changed on the day. The Fed is entering what has traditionally been one of the most delicate phases of the business cycle. The economy has reached full strength and inflation pressures have built. There are signs that higher interest rates are slowing the economy, but it remains unclear if they have slowed it enough -- or too much. The Fed paused at a similar point in February 1995 and in May 2000. The first time, the economy had a ""soft landing"" -- slow growth followed by five more years of expansion. The second time, it fell into recession. If economic data ""do signal some relief on the inflation front and further softening in the economy this could be the end of the [rate-raising] cycle,"" said Al Broaddus, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. ""And if they\'re lucky and timed it right, that would reduce the risk that the Fed causes the economy to weaken too much."" But by retaining its bias toward raising rates, the Fed has discouraged investors from driving down long-term interest rates and made it easier to raise rates again if needed, Mr. Broaddus added. In recent months, inflation has risen above the Fed\'s informal ""comfort zone"" of 1% to 2%, excluding food and energy. The Fed attributes the rise primarily to companies passing higher energy costs on to consumers, and it believes inflation will drop back so long as energy prices stabilize and growth doesn\'t exceed ""potential"" -- the rate at which the economy can grow without straining the available work force and industrial capacity. Meanwhile, it expects economic growth to remain steady as businesses and exports offset a slowdown in consumer spending. Recent data, however, haven\'t fully supported that view. Economic growth slowed to a 2.5% annual rate in the second quarter in part because of a surprise drop in investment on business equipment. Payroll growth was sluggish, and the jobless rate rose in July. Moreover, inflation pressures appear to have been bubbling longer than previously realized. The Labor Department said yesterday that growth in nonfarm business productivity -- or output per hour worked -- in the second quarter slowed sharply to a 1.1% annual rate from 4.3% in the first quarter, and was 2.4% in the four quarters ended in June. Wage-and-benefit costs per unit of output grew 4.2% in the second quarter, and were up 3.2% from a year earlier. Unit labor costs fell in early 2004, but began growing late that year. Since then, those costs have accelerated and now are growing fast enough to eat into profit margins, which could encourage companies to raise prices. Pat Henry, executive vice president of operations at RehabCare Group Inc., a St. Louis provider of rehabilitative health services, said a shortage of physical, occupational and speech therapists is driving up wages for those positions and forcing the company to rely on costly contract labor. Last year, RehabCare raised contract rates to clients an average of 3% to 4% to compensate for higher wages. This year, Ms. Henry estimates around 50% of the company\'s contracts will see price increases. ""Labor costs keep going up, so we keep having to go back to our clients and say, ""Hey, we can\'t do this anymore at this price,\'"" she says. In its statement yesterday, the Fed didn\'t repeat its assertion in June that ""ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs."" After three years in which monetary-policy decisions were relatively simple, economic crosscurrents have made the Fed\'s decisions much trickier and views within the central bank have diverged. Yesterday\'s was the first meeting since Mr. Bernanke succeeded Alan Greenspan as chairman on Feb. 1 that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee wasn\'t unanimous. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, favoring another quarter-point rate boost. Mr. Lacker has been worried about the pace of inflation, inflationary psychology, and the Fed\'s anti-inflation credibility. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in mid-June, he expressed concern at how much inflation expectations, as measured by inflation-indexed Treasury bonds, had fluctuated in response to new economic data. ""That\'s evidence of some residual uncertainty about our intentions regarding inflation,"" he said then. In theory, those expectations wouldn\'t move much if the markets thought the Fed would always keep inflation stable and low. Inflation expectations rose in late April, after Mr. Bernanke broached the possibility the Fed might pause in its rate increases. They later declined after the Fed talked tough on inflation and raised rates in June, and have since moved higher again, on both new data and yesterday\'s rate decision. The Richmond Fed is traditionally one of the more hawkish of the Fed\'s 12 regional banks. Mr. Broaddus, Mr. Lacker\'s predecessor, speculated that Mr. Lacker wanted another increase for ""additional credibility insurance. I probably would have gone the same way."" Futures markets now put only about a 20% probability on the Fed\'s raising rates at its next meeting Sept. 20. They see no additional increases beyond that. Economists, however, are deeply split on what the Fed should do. ""There was a strong case for pausing at 4.5%,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. ""There was already plenty of evidence the previous hikes had begun to soften growth."" He predicted the Fed will start to cut rates by next April. Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers, said the Fed shouldn\'t have paused, and predicted it will eventually raise its short-term rate target to 5.75%. ""You can\'t fight inflation without risking overkill on the economy,"" he said. ""That is a risk, and it\'s a risk they should take."" Though unhappy with the current level of inflation, Fed officials also realize the economy can change direction suddenly, especially when prices of assets -- such as stocks or homes -- fall sharply. Inflation and labor costs were both rising in 2000 when the Fed halted its previous cycle of rate increases. As it later became clear, however, the slump in stocks and business investment had already set in motion a slide into recession the following year and a big drop in inflation. Fed officials acknowledge that a key risk to their forecast is that the housing market could fall harder than they expect, with ripple effects on consumer confidence, spending and investment. Avoiding such a low-probability, high-cost event may have been a motivation for pausing. Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University and author of a popular economics blog, said it is already too late. ""The Fed should have tightened earlier to avoid a festering of the housing bubble early on. The Fed is facing a nightmare now: the recession will come and easing will not prevent it."" --- Christopher Conkey contributed to this article. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can read economists\' reactions to the decision, plus see how the Fed\'s statement compares with the one it released in June, at WSJ.com/OnlineToday.

2,2006-08-09 00:00:00,"['The dollar struggled back to end a bit below day-earlier levels after declining and then reversing course several times in the wake of the Federal Reserve\'s decision to leave its benchmark federal-funds rate unchanged. The dollar plunged in a knee-jerk reaction to the central bank\'s decision and policy statement, hitting an intraday low of 114.55 yen while the euro jumped as high as $1.2899, only to retrace its losses shortly thereafter. The pause in the Fed\'s rate-tightening campaign was largely expected, as was the tone of the policy statement which left the door open for future rate increases. After 90 minutes of choppy trading, the dollar ended the North American session close to its predecision levels, as many analysts had predicted. Volatile currency trading isn\'t unusual following an announcement from the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee because investors always adjust their positions as soon as the decision is made public. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.2848 from $1.2835 immediately before the decision and from $1.2841 late Monday. The dollar was at 115.10 yen from 115.22 yen predecision and 115.11 yen late Monday, while the euro was at 147.77 yen from 147.87 yen and from 147.82 yen late Monday. The dollar was trading at 1.2244 Swiss francs from 1.2259 francs late Monday, and sterling was fetching $1.9092 from $1.9069. ""The rate pause was as expected,"" Marc Chandler, global head of foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman, said. But ""the [dollar\'s] initial knee-jerk reaction"" came as investors were ""revising down their expectations of a September rate increase."" Following the release of the central bank\'s decision, the market upgraded its expectation for a September rate increase from 44% to just under 50%. In its accompanying policy statement, the Fed said that ""inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,"" though ""some inflation risks remain."" Officials reiterated that they remain on guard for any signs of inflation, citing factors such as ""high levels of resource utilization"" as well as energy and commodity prices. ""The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information,"" the central bank said. The move to keep the Fed funds rate, governing overnight interback loans, unchanged at 5.25% -- a 9-to-1 decision -- breaks a string of 17 straight quarter-point increases since June 2004. Yet the decision and policy statement were so close to market expectations, that the dollar\'s knee-jerk drop was short-lived and it quickly strengthened to levels close to those predecision. The as-expected statement from the Fed is therefore unlikely to change the market\'s general dollar-bearish tone, analysts said. Investors are now awaiting June wholesale inventory data slated for release today, as well as June trade data tomorrow. More important, however, the market will be looking for the July retail-sales report Friday.

3,2007-08-08 00:00:00,"['The dollar was down versus the yen and stronger against the euro after the Federal Reserve acknowledged recent turbulence in financial markets but didn\'t stray too far from its tightening bias. The Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its benchmark federal-funds rate at 5.25% as expected. All eyes were on the Fed statement, which said ""downside risks to growth have increased somewhat,"" although inflation is still the ""predominant"" concern. The Fed also added language saying ""financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing."" Some investors -- particularly in the stock market -- had been hoping the Fed would signal a more dovish position in light of the recent credit crunch. Equities dropped sharply immediately after the statement and this sent the yen higher versus the euro and the dollar. Later on, however, stocks bounced into positive territory and the Japanese currency ceded its gains. ""The Fed didn\'t really say enough to calm market volatility, and as long as markets remain volatile, I think that risky assets will continue under pressure"" and lend strength to the yen, said Sophia Drossos, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.3750, down from $1.3783 late Monday, while the dollar was at 118.71 yen, down from 119.09 yen. The euro was at 163.37 yen, down from 164.05 yen, while the pound was at $2.0228, down from $2.0301. The dollar was at 1.1960 Swiss francs, up from 1.1922 francs. With the Fed still clinging close to its central scenario that inflation is its main concern, the statement did little to move the dollar versus the euro. ""It\'s kind of a tough-love message from the Fed,"" Ms. Drossos said. ""The Fed doesn\'t want to interfere with the risk repricing process, and though it recognizes some downside risks to growth . . . it\'s not enough to cause the Fed to veer from its path.""

4,2003-09-17 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as a government report that showed underlying inflation at a 37-year low kept the central bank on alert for inflation falling too much. The Fed, as expected, left its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, at 1%, its lowest since 1958. It also said, as it has since May, that the risks to economic growth are balanced, but there is a greater risk of an ""unwelcome fall in inflation"" than of an increase. It also said that rates could remain low for a ""considerable period."" The statement accompanying the unanimous rate decision by the 12 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\'s policy-making body, was almost identical to the statement after its Aug. 12 meeting. ""They don\'t want to do anything to upset the markets in terms of changing the communications strategy,"" said Janet Yellen, a former Fed governor. Indeed, there was almost no reaction in bond or stock markets. By contrast, when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan tried in previous statements to convey that the Fed would take its time about raising interest rates, bond prices plunged and yields shot up. Still, the overall tone of the message and the minor changes the Fed did make underlined its caution on the economy and falling inflation. Despite recent strong economic data that have prompted private economists to expect growth at more than a 4% annual rate in the second half of this year, the Fed merely acknowledged, as it did last month, that ""spending is firming."" It actually struck a more pessimistic note about employment, which it said has been ""weakening,"" than it did a month ago, when it said job indicators were ""mixed."" The biggest question hanging over Fed policy is what it means by a ""considerable period."" The phrase was added last month to underline that with inflation already so low, the Fed doesn\'t need to raise interest rates as quickly as it has in previous recoveries to head off surging price pressure. The Fed\'s concern about inflation falling too low got some support from yesterday\'s Labor Department report that the consumer price index rose 0.3% in August from July, almost entirely as a result of a 2.7% jump in energy prices. Excluding food and energy, ""core"" prices rose just 0.1% and were up only 1.3% from a year earlier, the lowest annual increase since 1966. The so-called chained consumer price index, which better reflects shifting spending patterns than the regular index, shows an even lower core inflation rate of 0.8%. Either way, inflation is near the bottom of the 1% to 2% range that many Fed officials think is ideal. Below that range, there is a heightened risk that a shock to the economy could turn low inflation into deflation, or generally falling prices. Deflation can undermine the economy by squeezing heavily indebted borrowers and making it difficult for the Fed to stimulate spending. --- Journal Link: WSJ.com subscribers can see the latest economic reports, at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

5,2003-09-17 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- On a day when Federal Reserve policy makers deliberated interest-rate policy, the focus of foreign-exchange markets was very much on a central bank from a different country: Japan. With the yen surging 1.2% yesterday against the dollar and 2.1% against the euro, investors were waiting to see whether Japan\'s Ministry of Finance -- which has been a dominant force in the markets of late -- would once again step in to stop the yen from getting too strong and derailing the country\'s export-led recovery. In the end, Japan\'s government was apparently a no-show. And while the dollar strengthened against its European counterparts, its lack of good fortune against the yen reflects the fact that currency speculators were betting Japanese authorities would be hesitant to intervene heavily to support the dollar ahead of this weekend\'s meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations. ""We\'re in a highly dangerous situation,"" as far as the yen\'s exchange rates are concerned, said the senior dealer at a Japanese bank in New York. ""It\'s a very difficult market to trade right now."" Against this backdrop, investors largely ignored a decision by the Federal Reserve to leave benchmark rates on hold at a 45-year low of 1%, as expected. Once again, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said rates will remain low for a ""considerable period."" While noting that monetary policy and productivity growth is ""providing important ongoing support to economic activity,"" the FOMC did shift slightly from language used after its last meeting on Aug. 12, in noting that the labor market ""has been weakening."" The dollar softened slightly in a knee-jerk reaction to that statement, said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange at ING Barings Capital Markets in New York. But he and other traders called the decision a nonevent for currency markets, and the euro quickly slipped to a low of $1.1155. Meanwhile, the yen reached its strongest level in nearly two weeks against the dollar at 116.13 yen, and a week high against the euro at 129.81 yen. Late Tuesday in New York, the euro was trading around $1.1178, down from $1.1286 Monday. The common currency was at 129.80 yen, down sharply from 132.56 yen on Monday while the dollar was at 116.18 yen, also much weaker than 117.50 yen late Monday in New York. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was quoted around 1.3897, up from 1.3803, while sterling was trading at $1.5880, from $1.6013. The yen\'s strength was supported by an improved economic outlook for Japan and a continued influx of foreign capital. But traders said the apparent discovery in Asian trading that much-discussed bids placed with banks on behalf of the BOJ had been pulled, fueled the rally. As a result, the market pushed the yen higher still, in the process extending the already massive outstanding long yen positions. Certainly, this is the way almost the entire spectrum of foreign-exchange-market participants -- speculators, momentum funds, technical traders and longer-term global investors -- is positioned. Merrill Lynch\'s latest survey of fixed-income fund managers yesterday showed managers more bullish on the yen now than at any time in the past 10 years. Deutsche Bank\'s Russell Mellon equivalent last week showed yen bullishness to be at a nine-year high. And the latest data from the International Monetary market on the Chicago futures exchange show net yen long positions at a four-year high. However, some traders suspected the Bank of Japan, acting on behalf of Japan\'s Ministry of Finance, had a hand in keeping the dollar above 116 yen. But that was only after a loss of about 1.5 yen on the day for the dollar, and nearly a 3-yen decline by the euro. ""The yen strengthened based on the fact that people perceived the BOJ wouldn\'t be around, and probably they weren\'t,"" said Mr. McCarthy, adding that the euro and dollar probably bottomed because the selling spree simply ran out of gas. Foreigners have been heavy buyers of Japanese stocks, and the Nikkei closed up 1.6% at 10,877.03 yesterday after the BOJ upgraded its assessment of the domestic economy. Demand for Asian stocks -- and upward pressure on region\'s currencies -- remains strong, according to the latest client equity flows data from UBS Investment Bank. The Asia-Pacific region enjoyed a net $262 million inflow in the week ended Sept. 12. Meanwhile, this weekend\'s G7 meeting in Dubai has become the market\'s biggest focus, with currency policy expected to be high on the agenda. Calls on both sides of the Atlantic have grown louder for China to remove or loosen the yuan\'s peg to the dollar, which officials see as supporting Chinese exports by keeping the currency artificially undervalued. Yet while the G7 communique isn\'t considered likely to specifically target China\'s foreign-exchange policy, analysts expect it to echo comments made by U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow on his recent trip to Asia in support of flexible and market-based exchange rates. The discussions could be sticky for Japan, which has pumped just under $80 billion into the market in the first seven months of the year to keep the yen from appreciating too rapidly, with market participants estimating there has been another $15 billion or more of intervention so far in September.

6,2003-06-26 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar advanced against its widely traded counterparts in the afternoon, taking back some of the day\'s earlier losses after the Federal Reserve decided to trim U.S. interest rates less aggressively than many had expected. Prior to the Federal Open Market Committee\'s announcement of a reduction of 0.25 percentage point in the federal-funds target rate, the dollar had slipped sharply on a flurry of last-minute positioning that sent a slew of currencies to highs for the day against the dollar. Some investors had shifted to higher-yielding currencies such as sterling and the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars to guard against a more aggressive 0.50-percentage-point cut that would have further widened interest-rate differentials and made dollar-denominated assets even less attractive. The euro had also benefited against the dollar, while the yen remained relatively steady, with fears of intervention by Japanese monetary authorities capping any pre-FOMC tendency for the yen to appreciate and covert Bank of Japan action believed to have supported the dollar after the rate announcement. ""This certainly wasn\'t as dramatic a move as it could have been, and at the margin it\'s positive for the dollar, providing we see positive U.S. growth numbers continuing to come through,"" said Tim Stewart, chief currency strategist with Morgan Stanley in New York, referring to the Fed\'s decision. Late yesterday, the euro was trading at $1.1542, well off its day\'s high of $1.1621 and down from $1.1595 moments before the rate announcement, but still up from $1.1517 late Tuesday. The dollar was trading at 117.97 yen, up from 117.54 yen before the Fed news, and little changed from 117.92 yen late Tuesday. The dollar was also buying 1.3287 Swiss francs, steady from 1.3282 francs on Tuesday. Sterling was at $1.6720, up sharply from $1.6643 on Monday. Meanwhile, the dollar also managed to recover some of its losses against its Canadian counterpart following the Fed decision. Late yesterday, it remained well below Tuesday\'s close of C$1.3592, but had retraced substantially to C$1.3459 from session lows of C$1.3385.

7,2005-05-04 00:00:00,"['With both economic growth and inflation taking a turn for the worse, the Federal Reserve signaled that for now, inflation is its priority. The Fed yesterday raised its target for the federal-funds rate to 3% from 2.75%, its eighth quarter-percentage-point increase in as many meetings, and said it planned to keep raising rates at a ""measured"" pace -- taken to mean no more than a quarter-percentage point per meeting. The widely expected move brings the rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to its highest level since the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s interest-rate panel, faces conflicting trends. Job growth, retail sales and business investment all softened in March. Such developments normally call for looser monetary policy. At the same time, inflation has risen, as companies pass higher energy and raw-material costs on to consumers. That would normally call for tighter monetary policy. In its action and words yesterday, the Fed demonstrated that while it is concerned about both trends, it puts more weight on inflation. Spending growth has ""slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices,"" the Fed said. That suggests the Fed considers the slowdown temporary: Energy prices have declined in recent weeks, and claims for unemployment insurance declined in April. The Fed said job-market conditions ""apparently continue to improve gradually."" On inflation, the Fed repeated a line from its March 22 statement that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident."" But it omitted a sentence from March 22 that said higher energy prices had yet to feed through to consumers. The omission follows two months of elevated gains in consumer prices that have lifted inflation excluding food and energy, according to the Fed\'s preferred price index, from 1.2% early last year to 1.7% in March. That\'s at the top of the 1.5% to 1.75% range Fed officials had forecast for later this year. As it did after its four prior meetings, the Fed said inflation expectations are ""well contained."" But in an unusual error, the statement first issued at 2:15 p.m. EDT didn\'t include that sentence. Wall Street analysts at first pounced on the omission as evidence of even greater inflation worries, noting a recent University of Michigan consumer survey found higher expected inflation. ""Any time a central bank removes a phrase that long-term inflation expectations remain well contained from a statement, we should take notice,"" J.P. Morgan Chase initially said in a note to clients. The Fed corrected the statement at around 4 p.m. A Fed spokeswoman said the sentence was in the actual draft statement that FOMC members discussed in their meeting. The omission occurred inadvertently when Fed staff were preparing it for public release, she said. The omission was noticed by a Fed staffer and corrected immediately, she said. The gyrations of markets and analysts in response to the error and subsequent correction attest to the enormous impact just a few of the Fed\'s words now carry. Changes to the federal-funds rate ripple out to rates charged on a variety of consumer and business savings-and-loan rates. Commercial banks announced that they were raising their prime lending rate, the benchmark for many loans, to 6% from 5.75%. The Fed also raised its less-important discount rate, charged on short-term central-bank loans to commercial banks, to 4% from 3.75%. Eleven of the 12 voting members of the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee voted in favor of the rate change. Governor Ben Bernanke has recused himself from FOMC deliberations as he awaits confirmation to become chairman of President Bush\'s Council of Economic Advisers. Fed officials have puzzled over why the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is lower now than it was when the Fed started raising rates last June. Yields, which reflect in part expectations for where the federal-funds rate will be, normally rise when the Fed tightens. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in February called low yields a ""conundrum,"" suggesting that he thinks the federal-funds rate would go higher this year than the 3.75% the futures market now expects. His remarks helped send the Treasury yield from below 4.2% to above 4.6% during the winter, but it has since returned to below 4.2%. ""The markets are always a little ahead of the Fed,"" said Peter McTeague, interest-rate strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ""It\'s less of a conundrum why rates are here because the trajectory of the economy is different from what it was a few weeks ago."" ""The bond market is telling us the risk of recession is higher than the Fed thinks,"" Kevin Hassett, economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told a panel discussion hosted by the institute. Inflation isn\'t the risk that the Fed seems to think it is, Mr. Hassett said, because it reflects global, not U.S., demand for oil and other commodities. Data in the next eight weeks, including Friday\'s jobs report, will help determine whether the Fed or the bond market is right. Continued softness could force the Fed to reconsider its hawkish stance and its ""measured"" pace. The use of ""measured"" has been a source of growing debate inside the central bank. Some officials believe the phrase limits their flexibility, and gives investors a false sense of certainty about the Fed\'s actions. Most officials feel it gives the markets useful information but acknowledge that as inflation pressures mount and the federal-funds rate approaches a more normal level, the sentence will have to go. But the word survives in part out of worries that dropping it would elevate expectations of an imminent shift to bigger rate increases. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\'s trading desk asked bond dealers last week if they expected ""measured"" to change, and how they would interpret such a change. Bank of America chief economist Mickey Levy said that rather than scrap ""measured,"" the Fed can ""just use more and more descriptive language to describe economic and inflation conditions and let that more colorful language supersede the importance of the term measured."" Mr. McTeague said minutes of the Fed\'s March 22 meeting ""suggest measured could mean anything. . . . They watered down the meaning of it, but the fact they left it in there probably comforts some people in the markets."" --- Journal Link: WSJ.com subscribers can see a graphic scrutinizing the Fed\'s statement and read economists\' reactions to the rate increase, at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

8,2005-05-04 00:00:00,"['Financial markets accustomed to the Federal Reserve\'s fine-tuned communications strategy got a rude awakening yesterday, when the central bank issued a late amendment to its policy statement that appeared to modestly alter its assessment of inflation. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which had slipped modestly in the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s original statement, ended the day higher, while shorter-dated issues managed to pare their losses after the Fed reinserted into its policy statement the line that ""longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained."" The apparent dropping of that line in the FOMC\'s earlier statement, issued at 2:15 p.m. EDT, had been pounced on by many in the markets as evidence of a more-hawkish bent from the Fed, as well as proof that it didn\'t intend to pause at any point in its monetary-tightening cycle. The correction, released just before 4 p.m., seemed to alter that view, fueling gains in bond prices. ""As a further irony, the bond-market rally after the Fed\'s revision to the statement has been larger than would have been the case if the Fed had left the sentence in to begin with,"" said Alan Ruskin, head of research at financial consultancy 4Cast in New York. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face value, at 98 19/32. Its yield fell to 4.178% from 4.196% on Monday. The 30-year bond was up 11/32 at 113 11/32 to yield 4.495%, down from 4.515%. Economists\' reactions to the Fed\'s stumble were more measured than participants in the financial markets, where mistakes cost money. Andy Brenner, head of institutional fixed income at Investec in New York, blasted the Fed for its mistake and for when the correction was announced, given that markets had little time to fix bad positions. He noted ""there is mass confusion"" about what the Fed was trying to accomplish. The bank said the wording was ""dropped inadvertently."" The topsy-turvy market moves came despite a sense that the Fed\'s underlying message remains unchanged from its last policy communique, in March: it intends to continue to raise interest rates against a backdrop of higher inflation. ""The confirmation from the FOMC that they were unable to complete a `cut and paste\' and inadvertently excluded the comment on long-term inflation expectations fits with the evidence that inflation expectations are at least as contained as they were back at the March meeting,"" said Mr. Ruskin. In the end, noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich in Greenwich, Conn., the Fed turned out to be ""exactly where we thought (they were) albeit two hours later than expected: the growth assessment was downgraded, but the core inflation outlook is more threatening."" The confidence was further underlined by a narrowing of the benchmark-Treasury yield curve, with the difference between the two- and 10-year yields flattening to 0.53 from 0.55 percentage point. That is a level not seen since March 2001 and underscores the bond market\'s faith that the central bank will keep inflation pressures contained by staying on the path of measured rate increases. ""Inflation is more of a concern, but they are not panicking and the Fed is saying that although economic growth is somewhat slower, they are staying on the path of measured rate hikes,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. With another quarter-point rate increase set to arrive in June, Mr. Konstam expects the yield curve to grind flatter, toward the 0.40-percentage-point area. Over the past 16 months, the curve has experienced a strong flattening trajectory -- kicking off from around 2.50 percentage points in January 2004 -- against the backdrop of a rising federal-funds rate and relatively low levels of inflation.   --- Shayna Stoyko, Michael Mackenzie and Michael Derby contributed to this article.

9,1989-08-23 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar sank, hampered by weak fundamentals, a general move to marks and sterling, and a U.S. durable-goods report that fell short of market expectations. Durable-goods orders fell 1.9% in July, following a revised 1.4% drop in June. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report predicted orders would be unchanged in July, and the poor showing opened the door for dollar-dumping in New York after the U.S. currency had been flagging in Asia and Europe. In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.9395 marks, down from 1.9577 marks late Monday, and at 142.20 yen, down from 143.10 yen. Sterling was at $1.5890, up from $1.5725. In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar opened for trading at 142.30 yen, down from Tuesday\'s Tokyo close of 142.78 yen. Terri Reid, an investment officer with Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago, said talk of a ""fairly large"" order for marks in that city may have pushed the dollar below critical technical support at 1.9500 marks. ""Once we broke below 1.9510 marks, the market hit sort of a black hole. There were simply no dollar bids until we moved down to about 1.9460 marks."" At that point, traders said, a rash of stop-loss sell orders expedited the dollar\'s decline to around 1.9400 marks. Traders said the action was more a reflection of strength in sterling and the mark than dollar weakness. Sterling is benefiting from optimism ahead of today\'s British current account report, which is expected to show improvements in July for the trade and current accounts. Pound strengthening started Friday, and shows no signs of abating -- at least against the dollar -- until the current account report appears. Sterling\'s strong advance has some dealers worried that disappointing current-account results could lead to widespread profit-taking and major losses for holders of the British currency. But Cynthia Johnson, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at Lloyds Bank in New York, doesn\'t entirely agree. While a partial pullback may occur, she says firm technicals and an improving outlook on British interest rates will provide the safety net in the event of lackluster trade numbers. ""Sterling\'s smooth rise above $1.5800 and 3.06 marks -- both were tough resistance -- was evidence of the pound\'s technical strength,"" she said. Meanwhile, the feisty mark posted impressive gains against all currencies save the pound amid persistent rumors in Europe and later in New York that the West German Bundesbank was planning to raise interest rates when the bank\'s Central Council resumes its regular meetings tommorrow after a summer recess. Generally, however, traders and analysts say they don\'t expect the Council -- the German equivalent of the U.S.\'s Federal Open Market Committee -- to make any major decisions this month. Said one trader at a West German bank in New York: ""These rumors would have made sense if the dollar were reaching new highs against the mark. But as we stand now, there\'s no basis for a {Bundesbank} rate hike."" The West German central bank last raised interest rates June 29, boosting the discount and Lombard rates by one-half percentage point to 5% and 7% respectively. Some rumor-supporters pointed to the Bundesbank\'s announcement that West Germany\'s M3 money supply growth accelerated to an annualized rate of 4.9% in July, up from 4.3% in June, though just below the central bank\'s 5% growth target for 1989. M3 consists of cash in circulation, sight deposits, time deposits under four years, and most savings accounts. But the increase in M3 growth was widely expected by West German economists surveyed by Dow Jones, who said the repeal of a 10% witholding tax on interest income on July 1, which was announced in April, temporarily slowed money growth in June. Additionally, July\'s rate is down from May\'s 5.3% growth, and a robust 6.1% expansion rate in April. As for the FOMC, which convened to consider credit policy at the U.S. Federal Reserve, traders don\'t expect a monumental change in monetary approach while the U.S. economy continues to hum along at a gentle pace and inflation remains under control. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367.90 an ounce, down 50 cents. Estimated volume was a light 1.3 million ounces. In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $366.65 an ounce.']",Dollar Fall Tied to Weak Fundamentals And Decline in Durable-Goods Orders,1989-08-22,The Wall Street Journal
10,2003-12-10 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar sank against its major rivals after the Federal Reserve affirmed its reluctance to raise interest rates anytime soon. But the U.S. currency managed to claw back from yet another record low against the euro. Apparent intervention by Japan\'s Ministry of Finance late in the day also shored up the dollar against the yen after it had fallen through a key support level to its worst showing in three years, although for many dealers, the reprieve seemed temporary. The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, issued yet another nuanced official statement on its monetary policy, but clearly signaled it isn\'t prepared to raise its federal funds target of 1% anytime soon. ""The things that changed weren\'t necessarily what people thought would change,"" said Jason Bonanca, currency strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Currency traders had expected the Fed to drop the phrase ""considerable period"" when describing how long the Fed would keep rates low for, as a nod to the improving economic landscape. Instead, the Fed kept that language, but instead de-emphasized the threat of falling inflation, a risk first flagged by the central bank back in May. In its official statement, the Fed said ""the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation."" Low inflation and slack in the economy allow the Fed to keep short term interest rates low for ""a considerable period,"" the FOMC said. ""We\'re left with a slightly more hawkish Fed,"" said Mr. Bonanca. But it is ""still much move dovish than what we see on the central bank landscape,"" given recent tightening of monetary policy in Australia and the United Kingdom. This should continue to weigh on the dollar, he said. Lower interest rates in the U.S. have weighed heavily on the dollar this year and are likely to continue to encourage investors to park funds elsewhere, which could further erode the dollar\'s value. Some analysts believe the Fed would have to raise rates by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, before the dollar could find its footing against its major rivals. ""Persistently low interest rates erode the greenback\'s reward potential,"" noted Ashraf Laidi, chief currency strategist at MG Financial in New York. In late trading, the euro was fetching $1.2254, down from a fresh record high of $1.2278 hit earlier in the session, but above Monday\'s $1.2226. The dollar, meanwhile, recovered from its worst levels of 106.82 yen touched soon after the FOMC statement, to trade at 107.03 yen, down from 107.37 yen Monday. Dealers said the Tokyo branches of large Japanese banks -- familiar agent banks for the Bank of Japan, which intervenes in currency markets on behalf of the Ministry of Finance -- aggressively bought dollars when the dollar traded as low as 106.74 yen. ""They quickly started bidding it there,"" said a dealer at a Japanese bank in New York. Japanese authorities have sold more than 16 trillion yen ($148.9 billion) so far this year in an attempt to stem the yen\'s rapid appreciation, which they contend undermines the competitiveness of Japanese goods on global markets and threatens the country\'s export-led recovery. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was trading at 1.2626 francs, up from the new seven-year low of 1.2598 francs established earlier in the session, but down from Monday\'s 1.2666 francs. Sterling also hit an 11-year high of $1.7466 in the aftermath of the Fed meeting as that currency looked particularly attractive with the Bank of England already raising rates in the U.K. In late trade, sterling eased back to $1.7464, up from $1.7329 late Monday. Earlier in the global session, the euro spiked to a new all-time high of $1.2278 for the eighth consecutive trading day. The new highs in the euro and the pound, however, convinced some hedge funds they should book some hefty profits, a move that began in the higher-yielding currencies and then spilled into the European currencies. --- Jamie McGeever contributed to this article.

11,1991-12-18 00:00:00,"[""NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it named William J. McDonough executive vice president of the bank and manager of foreign operations for the Federal Reserve System. Mr. McDonough, 57 years old, succeeds Sam Y. Cross, 64, who retired earlier this month. Mr. McDonough, who begins work Jan. 6, will be in charge of the bank's foreign group, which consists of the foreign exchange area and the foreign relations area. The New York Fed maintains relationships in the U.S. with foreign central banks, and Mr. McDonough will be the senior officer for the New York Fed in dealing with these banks. He also will be manager for foreign operations of the System Open Market Account. As such, Mr. McDonough will make recommendations to the Fed and the Treasury about intervening in the foreign exchange markets, and then will supervise the intervention under the direction of those authorities. He will report to the Federal Open Market Committee and Congress on intervention matters. Mr. McDonough retired from First Chicago Corp. and its bank, First National Bank of Chicago, in 1989 after a 22-year career there. From 1986 until his retirement, he was vice chairman of the board and a director of the bank holding company. Prior to that, he was executive vice president and chief financial officer of the bank. Since leaving First Chicago, he has been an adviser to the World Bank and International Finance Corp., special adviser to the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, and chairman of the Illinois Commission in the Future of Public Service.""]",New York Fed Picks McDonough to Lead Foreign Operations,1991-12-17,The Wall Street Journal
12,2006-06-30 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the 17th consecutive time, but its words suggested growing prospects for a pause in rate increases, helping to spark a rally in stock markets. As widely expected, the central bank boosted its short-term interest-rate target to 5.25% from 5%. But for the first time since it began raising rates from a low of 1%, in June 2004, the Fed didn\'t explicitly say another rate increase was under consideration -- and markets took that as a welcome signal. ""The extent and timing of any additional"" rate increases ""will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth,"" the Fed said in a statement. By contrast, the Fed\'s last statement, on May 10, said ""some further"" rate increases ""may yet be needed."" The language shift reflects Fed officials\' decreased confidence that they know now what they\'ll do next, given how much rates already have risen, its view that the economy is slowing and its concern over an unexpected rise in inflation that it nonetheless hopes is temporary. The new language doesn\'t rule out another rate increase, but gives the Fed added flexibility to base its decision more on coming economic data than on any previous guidance it gave to markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up about 80 points before the statement was released, soared to close 217.24 points higher, a gain of about 2%, its best day in more than three years. The Nasdaq Stock Market was up 3%, its biggest one-day rally since March 2004. Long-term bond yields edged down. ""The Fed was not as hawkish as investors expected, and we\'re seeing a \'relief rally\' here,"" said David Ader, a strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. Futures markets lowered the odds of a quarter-percentage point increase at the Fed\'s next meeting, on Aug. 8, to 60% from 80%. The Fed statement acknowledged, as many Fed officials have in the last month, that recent measures of inflation have been ""elevated."" But it softened the sting by suggesting the Fed expects inflation to edge lower as the economy slows. ""Economic growth is moderating,"" the statement said. ""Although the moderation . . . should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the (Fed) judges that some inflation risks remain."" Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, termed it ""a favorable statement from the market\'s perspective, but it\'s a risky statement from the Fed\'s perspective."" Inflation is likely to accelerate over the next few months, reflecting the lagged impact of strong economic growth in recent years, he said, and that could force the Fed to raise rates again. Economists, investors and even some on Capitol Hill have lately begun to worry the Fed might raise rates too much, tipping the economy into recession. That concern has been helping roil markets in recent weeks. In a new Wall Street Journal survey, 12 of 56 economic forecasters said they saw a possible Fed ""policy mistake"" as the biggest risk to the U.S. economy in the next year -- a greater threat than a housing downturn, inflation, an energy-price crunch or avian flu. Six months earlier, only eight economists cited a Fed mistake as the biggest risk; a housing downturn was at the top of the list. Some Fed officials share the worries about raising rates too far. All 10 voting members of the 17-member Federal Open Market Committee agreed to raise the target for the Federal funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. Two committee seats are vacant. But two of 12 reserve banks did not request an accompanying increase in the less-important discount rate, which is charged on Fed loans to commercial banks. Their presidents -- Janet Yellen in San Francisco and Thomas Hoenig in Kansas City -- have recently warned of the risks of raising rates too much. The Fed\'s statement attempts to balance the competing risks of slowing growth and rising inflation. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the economy grew at a robust 5.6% annual pace in the first quarter. Economists believe growth slipped below 3% in the current quarter under the weight of higher oil prices and interest rates. At the same time, inflation has edged above what Fed officials sometimes call their ""comfort zone."" After a period of rising interest rates, the economy often decelerates while inflation rises for a while. But that creates a challenge for new Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who faces the task of demonstrating he will be as tough on inflation as his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. Mr. Bernanke suffered a setback in that effort when he first raised the possibility of a pause in interest-rate increases in April, causing some investors to question his anti-inflation resolve. To compensate, he and numerous other Fed officials in the past month have unleashed a rhetorical broadside, labeling recent inflation developments ""unwelcome,"" ""beyond acceptable,"" ""corrosive"" and ""unhinged,"" raising market expectations of monetary tightening. ""Bernanke\'s a new Fed chairman and his credibility is on the line as an inflation fighter,"" said Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo &Co. ""That might push him to raise rates higher -- higher than Greenspan would have had to."" The Wall Street Journal survey doesn\'t see a Fed mistake as the most probable outcome. ""That\'s a risk, that\'s not the expectation,"" said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. More than half of the economists in the Journal survey -- 31 of the 56 surveyed -- think the Fed will be able to control inflation without damaging the economy. Only a quarter believe the Fed will overshoot. Mr. Bernanke likely will elaborate further on the Fed\'s view of the economy and interest-rate outlook when he testifies before Congress on July 19 as part of his semiannual monetary report. Economists generally have a high opinion of Mr. Bernanke, who this week oversaw the Fed meeting for the third time. Survey respondents gave him a B-plus for his interest-rate decisions, a bit lower than the ""A-minus"" they gave him in an early May survey. Lehman Brothers chief U.S. economist Ethan Harris, who gave Mr. Bernanke an A, also gave the media a C for misinterpreting the Fed chairman. Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman, said the latest statement, by raising the prospect of a pause, seems inconsistent with the hawkish rhetoric of the past month -- and as a result, the Fed could ""get caught in another credibility issue."" Yesterday, expected inflation, as implied by the behavior of inflation-indexed bonds, rose three-hundredths of a percentage point. Following the Fed decision, commercial banks raised their prime rate, a benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 8.25% from 8%. --- Serena Ng contributed to this article. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can read economists\' reactions to the decision, plus see how the Fed\'s statement compares with the one released in May, at WSJ.com/OnlineToday.

13,2006-06-30 00:00:00,"['Treasury bond prices rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve increased rates by a quarter of a percentage point but gave investors hope it may soon pause its money-tightening campaign. Bonds rose across all maturities, sending their yields lower. The 10-year Treasury note gained 11/32 point, or $3.44 for every $1,000 invested, to 99 12/32. The two-year note rose 5/32 to 99 27/32. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped 0.04 percentage point to 5.21%, while the yield on the two-year note fell 0.08 percentage point to 5.20%. It was the first time in three weeks that yields on 10-year Treasurys, which generally carry more risk because of their longer terms, had even slightly exceeded yields on their 2-year counterparts. The Federal Open Market Committee hiked the Federal Funds target rate to 5.25% from 5.00%. The central bank has now lifted the funds rate 4.25 percentage points since June 2004. The tone of the committee\'s announcement took some of the wind out of expectations for another quarter point rate increase at the Fed\'s Aug. 8 meeting and sparked gains in the battered Treasury market, which has suffered in the past two weeks on concerns that inflation was worsening, and the Fed would extend its hiking campaign to fight it. ""It was a reasonably favorable announcement, which opened the door to a pause and put away the bears who were talking about a 50 basis point hike,"" said Robert G. Smith, chief investment officer of Smith Affiliated Capital Corp., a New York fixed-income money manager. Over the past two weeks, some investors had expressed worries that Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and other officials might approve a 0.5 percentage point increase. The market also took the view that another hike in August was less likely. Jerry Webman, director of fixed income at OppenheimerFunds, said yesterday\'s Fed statement means ""continued uncertainty and markets that continue to price with uncertainty in mind."" Still, he said, the bond markets are likely to have a smoother ride than the stock market, because the Fed appears to be committed to continued vigilance against inflation. The bonds of Embarq Corp., a Kansas telecommunications company, rallied Thursday as buyers snapped up the securities, which have been largely under water since the telecommunications company sold the debt in May. Yields on 10-year bonds sold by Embarq were 2.05 percentage points higher than Treasurys with the same duration, and yields on 30-year Embarq bonds were 2.76 percentage points higher. David Novosel, investment analyst at Gimme Credit, an independent research firm specializing in corporate bonds, said the Embarq bonds were due for relief after being hammered after they were issued. ""It was a bit overdone in terms of selling,"" he said. The successful sale Wednesday of junk-rated bonds from Windstream Communications -- also a land-line phone company -- reminded investors that Embarq\'s bonds had become oversold. Embarq, which focuses on the land-line sector of the telecommunications market, sold $4.485 billion of bonds on May 12, preparing to spin off from Sprint five days later. Investors lined up for the bonds that offered attractive yields, placing as much as $17 billion in orders. The risk aversion that swept through financial markets in the weeks that followed, however, weighed on the securities, with shorter-term investors quickly exiting their positions before their profits turned into losses. The 30-year bond traded as wide as 3 percentage points over Treasurys on June 21 and the 10-year piece as wide as 2.3 percentage points over Treasurys last week.

14,2004-08-11 00:00:00,"['FOR TWO YEARS, Alan Greenspan has stood on the deck of the American economy under a banner reading ""Mission Accomplished."" In that time, the Fed chairman has been eager to take credit for stewarding the economy through a financial bubble and its turbulent aftermath. Two years ago, in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he said it was ""reasonable"" to assert that ""no low-risk, low-cost, incremental monetary tightening exists that can reliably deflate a bubble."" Perhaps. But, controversially, he went further, arguing that it appears there isn\'t even a Federal Reserve policy that ""can at least limit the size of a bubble and, hence, its destructive fallout."" Cut to last month, when he testified before Congress with a full-throated endorsement of the strength of the economy. Even as oil prices pressed higher, employment flagged and consumer spending trickled down, Sir Alan dismissed concerns, saying that the economy has hit merely a ""soft patch"" that would be ""short-lived,"" and that the current condition ""bodes well for consumer spending."" Mr. Greenspan and the Fed have boxed themselves in. After a few strong payroll reports and some inflation numbers that topped expectations earlier this year, the Fed\'s pledge of ""patience"" and ability to wait a ""considerable period"" went out the window. The Fed then went on its current measured course to raise rates to maintain price stability and seemingly won\'t be deterred, even in the face of a sputtering economy. Therefore, the sluggishness must be defined as temporary. So the federal-funds rate went up a quarter of a point to 1.5% yesterday, with little substantive change in the Fed policy makers\' description of the outlook. They are raising rates into a slowing economy because they have said they were going to. To not have raised interest rates yesterday risked seriously wrong-footing the markets and eroding credibility. But the Fed and its chairman aren\'t just in that one box. They are in the middle of a Russian doll of their own making. Mr. Greenspan must now raise rates, because, for Mr. Greenspan\'s legacy, the economy must be on a steady expansion path. It must be so because he has asserted that he dealt with the bubble and its aftermath correctly. For that amount and duration of stimulus -- coupled with the enormous tax cuts from the Bush administration -- not to revive the economy would mean that the Fed\'s ""Deal With Bubbles After They Pop"" policy isn\'t a successful course. Goldman Sachs economist Bill Dudley thinks the Fed has ""fundamentally underweighted the importance of the bursting of the bubble."" It is difficult for Mr. Greenspan to say the bubble is the reason for the current lackluster conditions ""because then they have to say the bubble had real consequences, not just financial consequences. It forces them to take responsibility."" Mr. Greenspan could have mitigated this problem by not declaring victory prematurely. He could have been more cautious about the sustainability of this fragile economic expansion. The Fed needs to keep an eye on inflation, but it needs to do less jawboning and more plain speaking. The Federal Open Market Committee shouldn\'t have been cheerleading for the economy in its statement yesterday, and it probably should have waited out this soft patch before raising rates again. Mr. Greenspan might take satisfaction that he is now being criticized by some economists and Wall Streeters for raising interest rates, when only a couple of months ago, he was being lambasted by other investors for being hopelessly behind the inflation curve. But just because different factions have equal and opposite critiques of your tenure doesn\'t mean you are doing a good job. It is true that corporations are in shipshape, with strong balance sheets and high margins. The tide of the global economy is rising. If Mr. Greenspan turns out to be right and the economy starts to pick up steam again, he will -- again -- look brilliant. If not, start bailing. --- Send questions and comments to longandshort@wsj.com. Select letters appear most Mondays at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

15,2004-08-11 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the second time in two months and, suggesting that the recent economic slowdown was temporary, signaled that more rate increases remain in store this year. The Fed\'s policy-making committee increased its target for the federal-funds rate -- the rate charged on overnight loans between banks -- to 1.5% from 1.25%. It began lifting that target in June. It had cut it 13 times, to 1% from 6.5%, in the prior four years. Explaining its reasoning, the Fed said that ""in recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in labor-market conditions has slowed"" -- developments that it blamed on ""the substantial rise in energy prices."" Some recent economic reports have been downbeat, in particular a surprisingly weak increase of 32,000 nonfarm jobs in July. That report, together with a softening in consumer spending in June triggered largely by higher oil prices, has prompted some economists to warn that the economic expansion could be in danger. The Fed doesn\'t share that view. In its statement, it said: ""The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward."" Morgan Stanley economist David Greenlaw called the inclusion of such an explicit forecast in the Fed\'s statement ""highly unusual"" and ""a clear indication that the Fed feels the recent incoming data represent a temporary soft patch."" The statement suggests that the Fed is more likely than not to raise interest rates at its next few meetings, including Sept. 21, the last meeting before the election. It remains to be seen whether the Fed\'s optimism is well-grounded. For one thing, something other than high oil prices may be undermining consumer spending. If so, economic data in coming months could prove disappointing. Another risk is that oil prices may ratchet higher. If either happens, the Fed would have to consider a halt to rate increases. Still, the Fed seemed to go out of its way to suggest that its previous plan remains largely on track. It repeated that it expected to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace and retained its caveat that it would modify that course as necessary to preserve ""price stability."" The Fed first inserted that caveat in June as a warning that more robust growth or inflation numbers could force it to switch to half-point or larger moves. It did say that the likelihood of higher or lower inflation was about even, as were the risks of stronger and weaker economic growth, for the next few quarters. Even so, recent remarks by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues clearly show they are more worried about breeding inflation by leaving rates low, than they are about aborting the expansion by continuing to raise them. Yesterday\'s rate move was approved by all 12 voting members of the Fed\'s 19-member Federal Open Market Committee. All 12 reserve banks had also requested a quarter-point increase in the more-symbolic discount rate, which is the rate charged on short-term advances to commercial banks The moves had divergent effects on stocks and bonds. Stocks sold off initially, then rallied to close on their highs, heartened by the Fed\'s optimistic outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 130.01 points to 9944.67. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction to yields, sold off in anticipation of higher short-term rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.3% from 4.25%. ""I hadn\'t anticipated the explicit vote of confidence in the continuing underlying thrust of the expansion,"" said Michael Prell, a former top Fed staffer and now a consultant in Arlington, Va. ""Many in the [bond] market were hoping for a more neutral message."" Paradoxically, higher interest rates, which a sitting president normally deplores, might be good news for President Bush\'s re-election hopes. The Fed\'s optimistic outlook, ratified by the stock market\'s rally, will give credence to Mr. Bush\'s assertion that the economy is improving and hurt challenger John Kerry\'s claims to the contrary. In response to the Fed\'s raising the discount rate to 2.5% from 2.25%, several banks raised their prime lending rate to 4.5% from 4.25%. Other savings and loan rates will probably respond in coming days. Over time, higher rates discourage business and consumer borrowing, and thus keep the economy from overheating. The Fed\'s action and statement affirmed its overall strategy, first rolled out in May: to raise the funds rate at a ""measured"" pace, a euphemism for quarter-point moves. Fed officials say the 1% funds rate in place before June made sense only with last year\'s tepid growth, extreme business caution and risk of deflation, which is defined as generally falling prices. With the Fed confident that the expansion is entrenched, its goal now is to get rates back to a more normal level to avoid planting the seeds of inflation a year or two down the road. Before Friday\'s jobs report, that suggested the Fed would raise rates at most of its remaining meetings this year: in September, November and December, even if growth slowed a bit along the way. The weakness in July\'s employment report raised the possibility that growth had softened more than the Fed was willing to tolerate. Many analysts speculated that the Fed wouldn\'t change rates in September in part to avoid controversy close to the Nov. 2 election, although Fed officials say the election would have no bearing on their decision. To be sure, the Fed\'s acknowledgment of recent weakness does make coming rate increases a bit less certain. Futures markets late yesterday put the odds of a quarter-point increase in September at 68%, down from 78% Thursday but above 60%, where they stood before the Fed meeting yesterday. A key measure of credit conditions is the ""real"" interest rate, which is the interest rate minus the inflation rate. For almost three years, the real federal-funds rate has been negative. Many Fed officials, in particular some reserve-bank presidents who heard growing reports of price increases from local business contacts, are anxious to make the real funds rate positive again (implying a nominal rate of 2% or higher), fearing that leaving it negative would inevitably fuel price pressures. Some Fed governors in Washington were less concerned, believing the recent inflation jump to be transitory and confident that still-high unemployment would contain inflation pressures. Mr. Greenspan himself has edged closer to the inflation hawks lately. One of his concerns is that a major bulwark against inflation in recent years -- strong productivity growth, which enables firms to boost wages and sales without raising prices -- is fading. Yesterday, the Labor Department said growth in nonfarm business productivity slowed to an annual rate of 2.9% in the second quarter from 3.7% in the first. That\'s still a healthy pace but down from the exceptionally high 4% average of the prior three years. Slower growth in output per hour, coupled with brisk growth in hourly wages and benefits, caused labor costs per unit of output to grow 1.9% in the second quarter, the fastest pace in two years. --- Question of the Day: How many more times do you think Fed policy makers will raise rates before the end of the year?

17,2001-10-03 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar shrugged off a widely expected interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, ending the day slightly weaker against the euro and slightly higher against the yen as heightened political risk continued to weigh on the currency. Sterling, meanwhile, weakened sharply against its major counterparts after U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair gave his strongest endorsement yet to joining European Monetary Union during the five-year lifetime of his current Parliament. As expected, the Fed cut its overnight federal-funds rate target (which governs overnight interbank loans) to 2.5% from 3.0%, its lowest level since 1962. It also lowered the discount rate (a key benchmark) by the same amount, to 2%. The Federal Open Market Committee reiterated that ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" This was exactly what currency markets had been expecting, a fact that sparked a slight selloff in the dollar in the aftermath of the rate decision, but not much price movement. In late New York trading, the euro was at 91.88 U.S. cents, up from 91.41 cents in London and from 91.71 cents in New York late Monday. The dollar was at 120.83 yen, up from 120.75 yen in London and above 120.27 yen late Monday in New York. Sterling was trading at $1.4692, off its intraday low of $1.4625, but well weaker than $1.4794 in New York Monday. The dollar was at 1.6191 Swiss francs, up from 1.6168 Swiss francs Monday. The fact that the Fed indicated it stood ready to ease again was another factor the market had been hoping to hear, but again, had already priced into the dollar. Increased war rhetoric from Mr. Blair at the Labor Party conference in Brighton, England, as well as another refusal yesterday by Afghanistan\'s ruling Taliban to surrender Osama bin Laden without proof he was involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks kept currency markets focused on the political risk to the dollar. From a pure monetary policy perspective, the Fed rate cut further widens the interest-rate differential between the U.S. and euro zone, a factor that should lead to some euro strengthening, said Mike Rosenberg, head of foreign-exchange research at Deutsche Bank in New York. On the other hand, the fact that the Bank of Japan has been almost as aggressive as the Fed in easing policy likely points the way to further dollar strength against the yen, he said. Sterling weakened sharply against both the dollar and euro, however, as traders sold it heavily after Mr. Blair said the U.K. should join the common European currency this Parliament if the economic conditions are met. Elsewhere, the Swiss franc lost some ground, partly on the back of Swissair Group\'s  decision to ground all its planes because the company failed to make payments for fuel and other expenses. Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial in New York, said Swissair\'s announcement had ""lowered the Swiss franc to attractive low levels,"" although prospects of a deal between the airline and its bankers ""may also help the franc."" Elevated risks of near-term military action and/or further terrorist attacks should allow the Swiss franc to continue to benefit from its safe-haven status, however, Mr. Laidi added.']",Dollar Shows Little Reaction to Fed Rate Cut,2001-10-02,The Wall Street Journal
18,1988-11-02 00:00:00,"['Stock and bond prices languished yesterday, while central bank intervention slowed the dollar\'s fall. Investors were reluctant to make major moves early in a week full of economic uncertainty and seven days away from the presidential election. Although most Wall Streeters assume their choice, George Bush, will win next week\'s election, traders said that with stock prices at the upper end of a yearlong trading range there isn\'t much incentive to bid prices higher, nor any reason to sell. Investors would ""rather see that the question has been resolved before going out on any big limbs as far as committing new funds is concerned,"" said Christine Callies, a Dean Witter Reynolds analyst. The lack of action was apparent in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed up 2.31 at 2150.96 after swinging in and out of negative territory. With few exceptions, takeover stocks moved higher. Arbitragers employed the additional buying power they gained from Monday\'s $7 surge in Kraft\'s stock price on the news of its weekend agreement to be acquired by Philip Morris for $106. Kraft itself weakened 5/8 to close at 102 7/8. Some arbitragers began worrying whether the government might force an extension of the mid-month deadline for Philip Morris\'s offer by seeking a fuller antitrust review of the proposed merger. Among the gainers yesterday, Pillsbury rose 1 1/4 to 61 1/4 amid rumors that the company will be auctioned to the highest bidder, rather than go to Grand Metropolitan under the $60 a share offer it extended late last week. Interco shot up 4 to 71 3/4 after a Delaware judge barred its poison pill defense against the Rales group\'s hostile $74 offer. Other takeover target gainers included Holly Farms, which rose 1 to 53 1/4, well above Tyson\'s $52 offer price. West Point-Pepperell rose 7/8 to 45 1/2, and First Boston 1/2 to 49 3/4. Stock and bond buyers searched for hints of action taken by the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Bank, yesterday. While the committee\'s decisions aren\'t disclosed, analysts said the most likely course was one calling for no immediate change in monetary policy. Meanwhile, investors are awaiting the announcement today of the Treasury\'s quarterly refunding plans and the release Friday of the government\'s report on October employment. The refunding plans are especially important to the bond market because it still isn\'t clear if the refunding will include a new 30-year bond. Although Congress recently granted authority for new long-term debt, President Reagan hasn\'t yet signed the bill into law. In major market activity yesterday: Stock prices were mixed in light trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 151.3 million shares. Although blue-chip issues edged higher, declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 743-717. Government bond prices eased. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond fell 3/8 of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. The issue\'s yield rose to 8.78%. The dollar was off slightly. In late New York trading, the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.7815 marks and 125.00 yen, down from 1.7868 marks and 125.65 yen.']","Stock Prices Languish; Bonds Ease --- Investors Await News Of Jobless, Election; Dollar's Slide Slows",1988-11-01,The Wall Street Journal

Individual investors took money out of taxable money-market funds with both government- and nongovernment-focused securities. But institutional investors put $20.32 billion into taxable funds the past week, nearly all of it in government funds whose holdings include Treasurys and agency bonds. As lending rates eased last week, notably the London interbank offered rate, interest rates on short-term money-market funds rose. For example, seven-day yields for institutional government funds advanced to 0.95% from 0.83%, while the 30-day yield continued falling, dropping to 0.91% from 0.94% as investors continued flocking to safe-haven investments. Retail investors also pulled $2.43 billion from tax-free money-market funds, while institutions added $469.1 million. Yields on seven-day funds tumbled nearly three-quarters of a percentage point for the second straight week, while 30-day yields tumbled similarly after changing little the prior week. Yields on money-market funds have fallen significantly as the Federal Reserve\'s Federal Open Market Committee has continued cutting interest rates -- on Wednesday rates were reduced another one-half percentage point to 1%.

20,2008-10-30 00:00:00,"['The euro remained stronger against the dollar, even though U.S. stocks reversed a rally, after the Federal Open Market Committee fulfilled Wall Street calls for a rate cut. The Fed cut its fed-funds target rate half a percentage point, to 1%, the lowest level since June 2004. Initially, the euro and equities markets declined in the wake of the announcement. The market had expected the cut, and traders took profits on bullish positions in advance of the announcement. But the Fed in its statement noted it was adopting a range of extraordinary measures to pump liquidity into the credit markets and signaled that it was open to further cuts. This helped U.S. bank stocks bounce in a late-day rally characteristic of volatile markets over the latest weeks. In turn, currency traders went back to their higher-yielding, riskier bets. When the equities rally then reversed, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close down 74.16 points, the euro held on to its lead on the dollar. However, the dollar slipped and was slightly lower against the yen. Late Wednesday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.2941 from $1.2699 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 97.18 yen from 97.63 yen. The euro was at 125.76 yen from 123.98 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.6393 from $1.5898 and the dollar was at 1.1326 Swiss francs from 1.1567 francs Tuesday. Earlier in the session, the dollar fell to its lowest level this week against the euro as markets geared up for the rate cut, U.S. stocks rose and crude-oil futures prices sank. The euro hit an intraday high of $1.2993. Nevertheless, analysts said financial-market uncertainty persists, especially as the Fed\'s economic outlook was more dire than many in the market expected. ""The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures,"" the statement said. The financial crisis, it added, ""is likely to exert additional restraint on spending."" As a result, said Ron Leven, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York, position reduction continues to be the driving force of markets, which leads to dollar demand. The dollar is considered among the most liquid and safe assets, the reason it is a reserve currency. That high demand led the Fed Wednesday to also announce temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Singapore to improve liquidity in global financial markets. The Brazilian real and Mexican peso narrowly advanced on the news. The facilities will support the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity in amounts of as much as $30 billion each by the four non-U.S. central banks. Volatility in these countries and the consequent exit of investors back to funding currencies have been a big part of the dollar\'s recent strength. The Fed already has swap lines with several major central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Reserve Bank of Australia. The move by the Fed ""broadens cooperation with a wider net of countries, and it should limit the extent to which money-market instability creates currency instability that becomes destabilizing for all asset classes, eventually hurting U.S. exports,"" said Alan Ruskin, international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.

21,1990-11-14 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar ended slightly higher against its European counterparts though stronger against the yen, after being caught between interest rate concerns and uncertainty in the Persian Gulf. Lacking definitive news to drive either an aggressive sell-off or buying spree, the greenback remained bound in tight trading ranges, taking a back seat to the mark as the main market-mover. A robust German economy and widespread expectations of a firm, if not tightening, monetary policy by the Deutsche Bundesbank is fostering the sentiment in the market that ""one can hold marks against everything,"" said Albert Soria, first vice president and foreign exchange manager at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki in New York. While the high costs of reconstructing the former East Germany might normally be perceived as a strain on the German economy and currency, the market is apparently interpreting it the opposite way. Germany\'s massive need for capital amid a global credit shortage suggests that to attract the necessary funds, the Germans will coordinate a firm interest rate policy and the architecture for a strong mark, said Marc Cohen, vice president of corporate foreign exchange for Fuji Bank in New York. This optimism over the mark, coupled with the speculation of a further cut in U.S. interest rates, sent the dollar to yet another historic low against the German unit of 1.4735 marks. The previous low was 1.4753 marks set in intraday European trading Monday. Expectations of a U.S. rate reduction were heightened because of yesterday\'s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making body of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The perceived federal funds target rate is currently at 7 3/4%. Another 25 basis point cut is widely expected by the market, participants said. Several traders said that expectations of a Fed easing the same day as the FOMC meeting were premature. Nevertheless, it appeared that many participants had sold off the dollar in expectation of money market intervention by the Fed yesterday. When no such activity materialized, however, disappointed participants took back some dollars, traders said. Mounting evidence that U.S. interest rates will have to come down soon to bolster an ""economy dripping with recessionary fears"" continue to encourage taking slightly short positions, said Joseph Cambria, foreign exchange manager at Banque Paribas in New York. Participants are expecting an easing of monetary policy as early as this week, traders said. But, because a small relaxation in monetary policy already is factored into the market, ""we could see a spike in the dollar just after the move if it comes in {as expected} at 7 1/2%,"" he added. Meanwhile, the rhetoric out of the Persian Gulf seemed to blow alternately hot and cold, leaving participants unwilling to buy dollars in expectation of war and equally reluctant to be extremely oversold on the U.S. unit. Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.4785 marks, up from 1.4780 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 129.69 yen, up from 128.33 yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.9630, down from $1.9655 late Monday. In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 129.47 yen, up from Tuesday\'s Tokyo close of 128.77 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was quoted at about 1.4798 marks, up from Tuesday\'s Tokyo close of 1.4755 marks. Tokyo\'s markets were closed Monday for a holiday. The White House insisted that it seeks a ""peaceful resolution"" of the Iraq crisis and that the suggestion that Congress be recalled to debate offensive military action was unnecessary. As a result, many traders felt that the threat of an immediate flare-up in the Gulf was lessened, traders said. Other traders, however, may have concentrated on more menacing comments, such as U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\'s statements that she believes Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is close to acquiring nuclear weapons, and that force must be used unless Iraq ends its occupation of Kuwait. The net effect of belligerent and conciliatory rhetoric was effectively to keep participants unsure as to how the Gulf-factor would affect the dollar. Much more attention was consequently paid to non-dollar foreign exchange trading. Yesterday was generally a day of broad mark strength and yen weakness. The mark ended New York dealings at around 87.72 yen, up from 86.83 yen late Monday. The mark also gained against the Swiss franc, finishing at 0.8465 Swiss franc, up from 0.8437 Swiss franc Tuesday. Sterling also stumbled against the mark, changing hands at 2.9023 marks, above its intraday low of 2.8985 marks, but down from 2.9050 marks late Monday and well below its central European Monetary System rate of 2.9500 marks. The yen lost not only against the mark, but also weakened against sterling and the Swiss unit. Sterling was quoted at 254.58 yen, above 252.23 yen late Monday. The Swiss franc was at 103.63 yen, up from 102.91 yen late Monday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $386 an ounce, up $3.70. Estimated volume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces. In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $385.50 an ounce.']","Dollar Closes Slightly Higher, but Takes A Back Seat to the Market-Moving Mark",1990-11-13,The Wall Street Journal
22,1990-11-14 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Bond prices shot up yesterday as strong bullish sentiment, fueled by perceptions that both interest rates and inflation are declining, continued to lure buyers into the market. The benchmark 30-year bond ended one point higher yesterday in U.S. trading when compared with Friday\'s closing levels. The advance translates into a gain of $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue\'s yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to 8.53%. Corporates, tax-exempt municipals, mortgage-backed securities and junk bonds also posted solid gains. Some traders argue that the advance in the Treasury market wasn\'t that spectacular considering prices of government notes and bonds had been surging overseas long before the U.S. market opened. The U.S. bond market was essentially closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day, although many domestic investors purchased U.S. Treasury securities on Monday in London. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/8 point in London on Monday. Michael Moran, manager of government trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said trading yesterday amounted to ""catch up from overnight"" trading in overseas markets. ""We came in at these levels but were not able to make substantially new highs,"" due to profit taking. Mr. Moran said the profit takers dominated trading for much of the morning. That, combined with rising oil prices and disappointment that the Federal Reserve didn\'t reduce interest rates yesterday, constrained the market\'s upward potential. But traders said the mood in the market remains decidedly bullish. Although the Federal Reserve did not reduce short-term interest rates yesterday, market players are ""optimistic that the Fed will ease in the next few days,"" said James Capra, a senior vice president at Lehman Brothers Government Securities Inc. He said inflationary expectations also are improving, largely because investors believe that oil prices will soon resume their downward drift as the fear of war in the Middle East recedes. The Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday to discuss the direction of interest rates. Many investors expect the central bank to loosen its monetary stance as early as today. Treasury Securities Treasury prices rose sharply from Friday\'s closing levels, but were up only modestly from levels reached on Monday in London. The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late yesterday in New York at 102 8/32, up from 101 8/32 late Friday in New York. The bond was quoted late Monday in London at 102 3/32. The benchmark bond\'s yield ended domestic trading yesterday at 8.53%, down from 8.62% in New York on Friday. Prices of short-term securities also rose. The price of two-year notes ended at 100 9/32 to yield 7.57%. That was up from Friday\'s price of 100 8/32 to yield 7.59%. The government sold $20.1 billion of Treasury bills yesterday at its regular weekly auction. The average discount rate for three-month bills was set at 7.05%, while 7.02% was the rate set for six-month bills. The rates were down from last week\'s auction, when they were 7.07% and 7.05%, respectively. The 7.05% rate on the three-month bills was the lowest at an auction since the average of 6.94% at the Aug. 8, 1988 auction. The average rate on six-month bills was the lowest at an auction since the average of 6.99% at the July 11, 1988 auction.

Corporate & Junk Bonds More than $1.4 billion of investment-grade debt was offered yesterday, including a $500 million issue of 40-year bonds by Hydro-Quebec, a Canadian state-run utility. The debentures were priced by underwriters led by First Boston Corp. to yield 9.556%, a spread of 1.03 percentage points above the Treasury\'s 30-year bond. The Hydro-Quebec issue is one of the few long-term bond offerings to hit the market in the fourth quarter. Prior to Hydro-Quebec\'s offering yesterday, only $750 million in long-term corporate debt had been priced this quarter. With so few long-term fixed-income securities to choose from, analysts said that investors snapped up the Hydro-Quebec securities, which are rated double-A-3 by Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. priced an issue of 250,000 units through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. Each unit consists of one three-year 8.20% note and one warrant which is exercisable between June 19, 1991 and July 10, 1991 into one 8.20% note three-year note. Other corporations that tapped the market yesterday included Pennzoil Co. and Phillips Petroleum Co. In trading yesterday, the investment-grade corporate debt market ended 3/4 to 1 point higher. Junk bonds ended 3/8 to 1/2 point higher. Municipal Bonds Municipal-bond prices ended 1/4 to 5/8 point higher. In new-issue dealings, PaineWebber Inc. officials reported that an unsold balance on an issue of $303.3 million New York State general obligation bonds would be released on Wednesday. The single-A rated bonds, won via competitive bid, are priced to yield from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.40% in 2016 to 2020. Several New York traders said Tuesday that the state paid virtually no penalty for its current fiscal problems on the price of the bonds. Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority\'s 7.20% securities of 2018 were 3/8 higher at 99 3/8 to yield 7.24%. No large new competitive deals are expected to be priced today. Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities Mortgage-backed securities ended between 3/8 and 1/2 point higher yesterday. Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities for November delivery, for example, were up 14/32 at 100 3/32. There were no new mortgage-backed or asset-backed offerings announced. Foreign Bonds Spain\'s debut in the French franc eurobond market was given a rousing welcome yesterday. The three-billion-franc ($601 million) offering of eight-year bonds was the largest raised in a single transaction in the fixed-rate Eurofranc market. And Spain was the first sovereign borrower to tap the sector all year. ""Spain wanted to make a splash, and it\'s done exactly that,"" said a syndicate manager of a French bank. Credit Commercial de France won the mandate for the Spain Eurobond after intense competition among five banks. The issue was sold to investors at a fixed price of 99.27 to yield 10.64%. The bonds were freed to trade minutes after pricing and closed at a price of 99.28 bid, 99.38 offered. The yield was about 0.40 percentage point above the comparable French Treasury issue, the low end of expectations. In trading, seasoned Eurodollar bonds were quoted about 3/8 point higher, but spreads between yields on Eurobonds and U.S. Treasurys widened because the Euromarket lagged the U.S. Treasury market\'s gains.']",Bond Prices Climb Sharply as Bullish Sentiment Is Encouraged by View That Inflation Is Easing,1990-11-13,The Wall Street Journal

24,2002-03-20 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at a key policy meeting, but it laid the first, tentative groundwork to possibly reverse an unprecedented string of rate cuts last year and start lifting rates later this year. As expected, the central bank left its target short-term interest rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% yesterday, and in a break with the past, it also disclosed that all 10 members of its policy-making body voted in favor of that decision. More significantly, the Fed declared that risks are now evenly balanced between economic weakness and inflation, the first time since November of 2000 that it hasn\'t seen risks tilted toward weakness. The shift in its assessment of risks, which could signal that the recent era of declining rates is over, follows a spate of signs lately that the economy is recovering more quickly than Fed officials had anticipated. ""The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee indicates that the economy, bolstered by a marked swing in inventory investment, is expanding at a significant pace,"" the Fed said in a statement. In January, Fed officials generally expected the economy to expand 2.5% to 3% over the course of the year, and unemployment to top 6%. But some now acknowledge those figures are conservative. Private-sector forecasts put growth at 4% or better, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.5% in February from 5.8% in December. The change in risk assessments was widely anticipated by analysts, who predict the Fed will soon start reversing some of the 11 rate cuts undertaken last year to counteract the recession and the fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The economy\'s speedy rebound suggests that, at 1.75%, the Federal funds rate is too low for the expansion to continue without eventually generating inflation. Long-term rates, such as on mortgages, have risen this year in anticipation of such a reversal. Futures markets put high odds that the Fed will raise rates a quarter of a percentage point in May and an additional quarter point in June, though yesterday they trimmed those odds slightly. The Fed did allude to the low level of rates, saying ""the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative."" But it also underlined the continued risks to the expansion by noting: ""The degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" That suggests an increase in rates could still be further off than investors expect. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that a boost to growth from inventory replenishment could peter out without a follow-through from business and consumer spending. Although auto and retail sales have held up, and business spending also appears to have turned the corner, Mr. Greenspan has also warned that some of stimulants to growth could be temporary, such as the boost to purchasing power from falling energy prices, which has since begun to reverse, and mortgage refinancing, which has cooled with the recent climb in long-term rates. With Fed officials still seeing no imminent outbreak of inflation, they can afford to wait several months to be sure the recovery is sound. Like the Fed, central banks in Europe slashed rates last year to stave off recession. The formal end to that cycle of monetary easing took place yesterday, when Sweden\'s central bank became the first major central bank to raise interest rates. The much-larger European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 12 nations that use the euro, is signaling that interest rates won\'t fall further, but that they will not rise anytime soon either. For the most part, though, the euro zone economy does appear well on the way to economic recovery. For the Fed, the assessment of the ""balance of risks"" -- something it makes at each meeting of policy makers -- is part of a new disclosure policy adopted in January 2000, which replaced the old ""bias"" to raise or lower interest rates. Fed officials made the change out of concern that the bias was too often interpreted as a commitment to raise or lower rates. The balance of risks was designed to be less constricting, by removing any direct linkage to rates or to any specific time period. Thus, the shift to balanced risks doesn\'t mean a rate increase will follow soon. On the other hand, the Fed could also raise rates without first tilting risks toward inflation. By releasing how members of the Federal Open Market Committee vote on the funds rate, the Fed is taking another step to make its decision-making more transparent. In 1994, it began releasing a statement when it changed the funds rate. At its December 1998 meeting, the FOMC decided also to announce immediately major shifts in its policy bias. Beginning in 2000, it began releasing a statement after every meeting. With yesterday\'s change, the Fed will disclose immediately if any member of the committee, made up of the board\'s seven governors (two of whose seats are now vacant) and five of the 12 regional bank presidents, dissented. That had been disclosed in the meeting\'s minutes, released after the subsequent FOMC meeting. --- G.

25,2004-05-05 00:00:00,"['In many ways, it is not the most logical or convenient time for the Fed to be raising interest rates. After all, there are more than 500,000 fewer private-sector jobs today than there were at the recession\'s end in November 2001. And an army of young people is floating in school or at home with mom and dad -- many of them discouraged and no longer reflected in the official labor-force totals -- waiting for a better job market. The headlines are filled with stories about outsourcing of jobs to Asia, while others reflect fears that interest-rate hikes could undermine the housing market. To top it off, a heated presidential race is under way and, well, it\'s largely about the economy. Don\'t worry. The Fed\'s not going to hike rates unless the economy is poised for sustained above-trend growth. Moreover, inflation is not going to force its hand. After all, the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee yesterday characterized the risks to price stability as balanced, and found inflation expectations to be benign. Although some analysts and investors hit the panic button when the March CPI spiked -- and when that same report rippled through the GDP deflators -- the Fed would have none of it. In contrast, Fed policy makers expressed relief that inflation may be stabilizing, easing their earlier worries about deflation risks. They also noted that the economy is far from fully employed. But the economy will surpass expectations, just as it has in the past year. Investors have caught the scent and so has the Fed. If Fed officials seem less ""patient"" after yesterday, it\'s not because growth thus far provides a compelling case for tightening. Rather, it\'s because they recognize the economy\'s impressive momentum. For sure, the hiring pace is nothing to write home about yet, but the trend-like 171,000 monthly payroll gains in the first quarter are beginning to look like a transition to a stronger job market. If both investors and the Fed appear to be increasingly open to the prospect of monetary-policy tightening, it is because the U.S. economy persistently outperformed consensus forecasts over the past year, producing faster than expected growth and slower than expected inflation. Even following the recent round of upward revisions to 2004 forecasts, it is likely that these same errors are being repeated. As a result, further upward adjustments to consensus growth forecasts are in store, while remaining doubts about the expansion\'s durability will fade. As new data confirm the economy\'s strength, the Federal Reserve\'s prospective path for withdrawing its monetary stimulus will appear to be both more straightforward, and less threatening. Already, investors have discarded earlier concerns that upcoming U.S. elections would discourage the Fed from implementing appropriate policy adjustments. Current uncertainties about whether the Fed should follow a gradual or aggressive tightening path also will tend to fade, as improving growth prospects will make the prospective policy moves implicit in current forward prices seem to be somewhat cautious. Although the U.S. economy has been growing for the past two and a half years -- and since mid-2003 at an annual pace of more than 5% -- doubts had lingered about the expansion\'s speed and durability. For example, consensus estimates currently anticipate GDP growth in this year\'s second half at an annual pace of 4%, slowing to 3.5% annual pace by next year\'s second half. As most Fed officials consider a 4% growth pace to be sustainable in current circumstances, it hasn\'t been clear why the Fed would be expected to hike rates if growth was expected to slow soon to a below-trend pace. Recognition is growing that sluggish employment growth mainly has reflected outsized productivity gains. The unstated implication is that the economy\'s growth potential has been higher than understood previously, as few observers would claim that the labor force is fully employed already. Despite analysts\' doubts, however, advance signs of persistently strong growth have been accumulating. The powerful combination of solid gains in household demand, record profits and unprecedented corporate liquidity represent the classic building blocks of business expansion. All have been present to a striking degree for at least the past few quarters. In fact, investors implicitly anticipate a sharp shift in the outlook. In particular, current prices are consistent with a 25 basis point hike in the funds rate target at the FOMC\'s Aug. 10 meeting. Moreover, the structure of rates today points to a series of Fed rate hikes that would put the funds rate -- currently 1% -- at about 3.5% by the end of next year. Nonetheless, consensus forecasts still are likely to underestimate growth prospects, as the widely cited potential roadblocks to sustained rapid growth are far from convincing. Undoubtedly, expectations will key off job gains. This stands to reason: Accelerating employment growth will represent a more powerful influence on household spending than either the absence of new tax measures or the end of mortgage refinancing. If job gains accelerate to a monthly average pace of 200,000 or more in the coming quarters -- as seems highly plausible -- it is reasonable to expect that 2004 growth forecasts will be raised to more than 5%, while 2005 growth forecasts will rise into a 4% to 5% range. With growth firmly above trend, the case for monetary policy tightening will be compelling, even in the absence of heightened inflation pressures. A series of Fed rate hikes beginning in August would seem appropriate, with the Funds rate hitting around 4% by the end of next year. The implications for long-term interest rates of stronger growth are less certain. Investors already anticipate an eventual return of consumer price inflation to at least a 2.5% annual rate. However, it is likely that inflation will continue to fall short of consensus worries. It is difficult to envision a significant acceleration in inflation with unit labor costs stable or falling. The moderate recent rise in the Employment Cost Index, and the wide gap between current job totals and the pre-2001 employment peak, suggests that unit costs are not likely to accelerate quickly. The Fed may be tightening as the Democrats and Republicans gather for their national conventions in Boston and New York late this summer. But before that happens, the economy and job market are going to demonstrate more strength than we\'ve seen to date. --- Mr. Lipsky is chief economist at J.P. Morgan.

26,2004-05-05 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Long-dated Treasurys plummeted on fears that the Federal Reserve isn\'t acting aggressively enough to avert a rise in inflation. But two-year notes, which often weaken quickly amid concerns about Fed policy tightening, scarcely moved, reassured by the Fed\'s apparent pledge to move only gradually in raising interest rates. ""The market doesn\'t agree with the Fed\'s assessment"" on inflation, said Gerald Lucas, head of U.S. Treasury and agency strategy at Banc of America Securities. After concluding its meeting yesterday, the Fed\'s policy setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement that ""at this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."" That was ""a very, very benign statement,"" said Bill Quan, economist at Mizuho Securities in Hoboken, N.J. Treasurys initially rallied after release of the Fed statement, largely on relief that the wording, at first glance, didn\'t appear to suggest a rate boost was imminent. Yet, as the market digested the Fed\'s stance, it began to question that conviction also. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 12/32 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face value, at 95 22/32. Its yield rose to 4.551% from 4.502% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was down 25/32 point at 100 17/32 to yield 5.337%, up from 5.282% Monday. For holders of longer-dated issues, or those beyond a maturity of five years, inflation is the primary enemy as rising prices erode the value of investing in a fixed sum for a long period of time. Two-year notes were unchanged to yield 2.319%. In other markets, mortgage-backed securities weakened across the board, with Fannie Mae\'s 30-year, 5% issue off 6/32 at 96 19/32. Interest-rate swaps spreads widened to levels not seen since early September, reflecting the selloff in long-dated Treasurys. Analysts noted that the Fed could still raise its federal-funds target rate -- which it left unchanged yesterday at 1% -- at its next meeting, in late June, if data continue to point to robust growth and accelerating inflation. But looking at the Fed\'s statement, policy makers don\'t seem to think that will occur, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. ""The Fed is slowly moving to unravel their dovish sentiments of recent statements,"" Mr. Konstam said.   Corporate and Junk Bonds Stock floor-trading ""specialist"" firm LaBranche &Co. sold $460 million of senior Rule 144a notes via Credit Suisse First Boston: $200 million of five-year notes, noncallable for three years, priced to yield 9 1/2%, and $260 million of eight-year notes, noncallable for four years, priced to yield 11%. The issue was rated single-B by Standard &Poor\'s. Moody\'s Investors Service has a Ba1 rating on LaBranche\'s senior unsecured debt. The yields are exceptionally high for single-B-rated bonds, and in fact were a quarter percentage point higher than expected. That was enough to attract blue-chip high-yield money managers, who comprised a majority of the issue, said a person familiar with the allocations. The sale was seen as crucial for the company. In March, LaBranche warned it probably wouldn\'t be able to repay $100 million of senior notes due in August without a refinancing or asset sale. Meanwhile, BMW Motor Credit\'s $1.5 billion auto securitization was priced at what were said to be the tightest overall interest rate spreads ever for a prime auto issue, according to bankers at joint lead manager J.P. Morgan Securities. --- Simona Covel and David Feldheim contributed to this article.

27,2005-08-10 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the tenth-consecutive time, lifting its short-term rate target to 3.5% from 3.25%, and signaling more increases to come. Analysts and markets are raising their estimates of how much further the Fed will go, because the economy is strengthening, inflation a bit less favorable and long-term interest rates remain unusually low. ""Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since late winter, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the Fed said in a statement accompanying its decision, affirming that the spring soft patch is over. Inflation, excluding food and energy prices, ""has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated."" The Fed repeated its view that rates would likely continue to rise at a ""measured"" pace, which has come to mean no more than a quarter-point per meeting. The 12 voting members of the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest-rate policy, agreed unanimously on the increase in their target for the federal-funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. The Fed also raised its less-important discount rate, charged on central-bank advances to commercial banks, to 4.5% from 4.25%. Wells Fargo Bank and other commercial lenders raised their prime rates, the benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 6.5% from 6.25%. The Fed has raised the funds rate a quarter-point at every policy meeting since June of last year, when it stood at a 46-year low of 1%. In the last six weeks, futures markets have raised the expected year-end funds rate to between 4% and 4.25% from below 3.75%. Economists have followed suit. Bill Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., recently revised upward his forecast for the funds rate next spring to 5% from 4.5%. ""The growth outlook has improved, and the labor market is tighter,"" said Mr. Dudley. For the last year, Fed officials have characterized their actions as raising rates from a level that was still stimulating spending to a ""neutral"" level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. The Fed has no specific interest rate in mind for neutral, but assumes it will have arrived when the economy is using all readily available labor and capital without straining capacity. But some economists see a risk that economic growth could soon outstrip capacity, putting upward pressure on prices and wages. ""The question the Fed should start to ask is whether neutral is the appropriate end point,"" said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. ""An economy that continues to grow 3.5% to 4% will require not just neutral, but restrictive policy."" There aren\'t any signs of strain yet. The Labor Department said yesterday that productivity -- that is, output per hour -- of workers outside farms and government rose at a 2.2% annual rate in the second quarter, down from 3.2% in the first, but still in line with the brisk performance of the past decade. Productivity growth enables firms to expand sales with the same amount of labor, containing costs. Growth in labor costs adjusted for productivity also slowed to 1.3% in the second quarter, the lowest in a year, from 3.6%. A narrower measure of productivity, which includes only incorporated, nonfinancial businesses and is watched closely by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, is more encouraging. That measure rose a sharp 5.4% in the year through March. (Second-quarter figures aren\'t available yet.) Labor costs also grew much more slowly by this measure. By either measure, productivity growth is strong, said Martin Baily, a scholar at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. ""This is good news in terms of keeping . . . inflation down,"" and should comfort the Fed, he said. On the negative side, annual productivity growth was revised down to an average of 3.7% from 2002 to 2004, from 4.2%, and labor-cost growth has been revised up to 0.3% from negative 0.2%. The Commerce Department already had revised up inflation this year, according to the Fed\'s preferred price index, to 2% from about 1.6%, which some analysts said would encourage tighter monetary policy. However, the revisions were primarily technical and didn\'t unsettle Fed officials, as their reference in yesterday\'s statement to ""relatively low"" inflation suggested. Ironically, the more markets price in additional Fed tightening, the less likely such tightening becomes. That\'s because as markets price in more Fed increases, long-term bond yields have risen, to 4.4% now from 4% in late June. If they rise enough, that could cool the economy, especially housing prices, without more action by the Fed. For now, Fed officials feel their actions haven\'t tightened overall credit conditions much, and thus plan to keep raising short-term rates. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can see how the Federal Reserve\'s statement compares with the one in June, and read the full text of the Fed\'s statement, at WSJ.com/OnlineToday.

28,1990-08-22 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Bond prices gyrated in nervous trading, reacting to changes in interest rates and news reports out of the Middle East. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly 3/4 point in early trading, but rebounded during midday to end slightly lower. The yield on the bond ended at 8.94%, slightly higher than Monday\'s 8.93% closing yield. Mortgage and tax-exempt municipals underperformed the Treasury market and posted modest losses. But junk bonds posted moderate to sharp declines, taking their cues from the troubled stock market. Most top-tier junk bonds posted declines of 1/2 to 3/4 point, while prices of many middle-tier and lower-tier bonds sank one to two points. The bond market opened lower on rumors, later denied, that a U.S. warplane had been shot down over the Persian Gulf. The prospect of war between the U.S. and Iraq alarmed investors because it raised the chances that oil prices would rise further, which in turn, would put more upward pressure on inflation. But as the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond exceeded the psychologically important 9% level, the market began to bounce back. ""The market was getting ahead of itself on the sell side,"" said Steve Ricchuito, economist at Barclays De Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. ""When the yield went above the 9% level, the market started to attract interest from investors,"" he said. Bonds continued to rebound when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein hinted that he may be willing to reconcile differences with the U.S. ""We had some indications that the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait might be negotiable,"" said Lincoln Anderson, economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. ""That contributed to the bond market rally."" Oil prices, which lead bond prices in the inverse direction, fell after Mr. Hussein\'s remarks, giving the fixed-income market an added boost. A decline in the closely watched federal funds rate also sparked some modest buying in the Treasury market. The decline in the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans occurred shortly after the Federal Reserve executed $2 billion in customer repurchase agreements. The rate fell from 8% to as low as 7 3/4%. The intervention came as a surprise to the market. Although many economists said the Fed action was probably technical in nature and designed to offset reserve shortages in the banking system, ""many people think there may be a Fed ease afoot,"" said an economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. One reason investors may have been suspicious is that members of the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday to discuss monetary policy and consider whether the time is right to lower short-term rates. Adding speed to the upward swing in bond prices was buying on the part of speculators who had taken short positions by selling borrowed securities in hopes of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference. When the market rose instead, these investors scrambled to unwind their short positions. Dealers said trading dried up in the afternoon, with government securities drifting at slightly lower levels. Treasury Securities The benchmark 30-year bond ended slightly lower at 97 30/32, compared with 97 31/32 Monday. Short-term securities also posted small declines. The latest two-year notes ended at 99 21/32, down from 99 23/32 on Monday. The yield on the two-year notes rose to 8.17% from 8.14%. Treasury bill rates were slightly higher when compared with Monday\'s average auction rates. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was 7.58% yesterday for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.82%, while the rate on six-month bills ended at 7.48% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.86%. Corporate Issues The junk bond market mirrored the stock market, falling sharply as equity prices plunged. Top-quality high-yield names ended 1/2 to 3/4 point lower, while middle-tier and lower-tier junk bond issues were battered even more and tumbled more than one point. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 52.48 points to end at 2603.96. Among the issues that were hard hit yesterday: RJR Nabisco\'s 17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, which ended down 2 3/8 points at 108 1/2 after falling as low as 108 on the New York Stock Exchange. RJR\'s 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures closed down 2 1/2 points at 84 3/4 after sinking as low as 82 5/8. Because equity arbitrage accounts are heavy investors in RJR\'s pay-in-kind bonds, the securities tend to plunge whenever the stock market tumbles, and they surge when equity prices soar. Recession-prone junk bonds continued to take a beating yesterday. American Standard\'s 12.875% senior subordinated debentures, maturing in 2000, skidded 1 3/4 points to 88 1/4 after losing three points Monday. In a recent report, Citicorp Securities Markets Inc. said the company would be negatively affected by higher interest rates and surging energy costs because it relies heavily on energy in making plumbing ceramics. Junk bonds of another building materials manufacturer, USG, also sank. The company\'s 13.25% senior subordinated debentures closed at 51, down two points. Meanwhile, junk bonds of AmBase plummeted after Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. said it has changed the direction of its review of the company\'s debt ratings to possible downgrade from uncertain. Ambase\'s 14.875% senior subordinated notes lost 8 3/8 points to close at 71 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange after plunging nearly 15 points in active trading last week. Foreign Bonds Yields on some West German government bonds exceeded 9% as international investors continued to dump their holdings. Among new issues, West Germany issued 10-year bonds yesterday for its postal agency that had a coupon rate of 9%. That was the highest coupon seen on government or government agency debt in eight years. Although domestic investors were big buyers of the postal bonds, statistics compiled by the nation\'s central bank show that foreign investors have been selling large amounts of West German bonds this year. The Bundesbank said international investors sold a net 8.4 billion marks ($5.37 billion) in the first six months of 1990, a sharp reversal from the 22.5 billion marks of bonds they bought in 1989. The selling was sparked by fears stemming from monetary union between East and West Germany. It comes just as West Germany\'s borrowing needs are expected to soar because of East German-related expenses. Private economists see net public sector borrowing around 80 billion marks this year and 120 billion marks in 1991, significantly above pre-monetary union forecasts of 40 billion marks for this year. The last time foreigners were net sellers of West German bonds was nine years ago, when they sold a comparatively paltry 1.45 billion marks of bonds. In trading, West German bonds ended modestly lower. The benchmark 8 3/4% bond due in 2000 fell 0.17 point to 98.60 to yield 8.96%. The 8 1/2% bond due in 2000 fell 0.07 point at 96.70 to yield 9.01%. Municipals Municipal bonds ended as much as 3/4 point lower. A rise in Treasury market yields above 9% and oil price declines pushed tax-exempt issues into a tailspin, traders said. While Treasurys later recovered, municipals were unable to reverse the downward trend. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority\'s 7.20% issue of 2018 was 3/8 point lower at 97 5/8 bid to yield 7.37%. ""We\'re just catching up to governments,"" one trader said. ""We weren\'t trading off as much as Treasurys had been, and we just had some people selling because they thought the market was going to go weaker"" because of the Persian Gulf crisis, he added. Mortgage-Backed Securities The mortgage securities market posted losses after staging a considerable rebound from the most depressed levels of the day in sympathy with the gyrations of the Treasury market. After being down as much as 5/8 point, 9 1/2% pass-through securities for September delivery issued by all three agencies were down 7/32. The volatility has kept many inactive, market players say. Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. is offering $501 million of floating-rate and inverse floating-rate funding note pass-through certificates through Lehman Brothers. The issue is the agency\'s third funding note certificate offering. But it is the first time that a transaction in the secondary mortgage market has been structured with recombinable inverse floater classes. Also, $218 million of home-equity loan pass-through certificates, priced to yield 9.26%, are being offered through Shawmut National Remic Trust 1990-A by Morgan Stanley & Co. Shawmut Bank is the seller of the underlying home equity loans, and Connecticut National Bank is the servicer. Both banks are units of Shawmut National, based in Hartford, Conn.']","Bond Prices Rebound From Early Drop to Finish Slightly Lower; Rate Moves, Mideast Stir Market",1990-08-21,The Wall Street Journal
29,1990-08-22 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve System almost always finds itself in some sort of box. Some people will want the central bank to ease money while others will urge it to tighten up. Usually, the Fed finds a way to work itself out of such trouble. This time, however, it may have waited too long. Until March, things seemed to be going fairly well. The economy had slowed, but recession forecasts were few. The Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of academic and business economists often critical of the Fed, said at its semiannual meeting, ""Monetary policy remains consistent with moderate recovery and declining inflation."" That\'s about as nice a comment as it ever makes about the Fed. But things soon began to change, and not really for the better. Nearly everyone realized that the 8.2% spurt of the consumer price index in the first quarter, on an annual-rate basis, was a temporary phenomenon, produced by cold-weather increases in food and energy costs. These factors faded in the second quarter, but new price difficulties arose. Labor costs, which had been unusually quiet through the long business expansion, were climbing. Even before the Mideast crisis sent oil prices soaring, analysts were predicting rising inflation the rest of this year. So far, that looks like a good forecast. As the real Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday, it had to ponder that consumer prices rose at an annual rate of close to 5% in July -- when energy prices were falling. That compared with a 3.8% rise for the full second quarter. Ordinarily, the Fed\'s next move would seem automatic. Inflationary pressures are growing, so the inflation-hating Fed tightens up, right? Not necessarily. Administration officials for weeks have been reminding the Federal Reserve that it has some responsibility for the health of the economy. The rise in the inflation-adjusted gross national product slowed to an annual rate of 1.2%, and the Mideast oil shock has increased talk of recession. Treasury Secretary Brady and other officials argue that the Fed should cut the federal funds rate, the fee charged on short-term loans of bank reserves. The Fed had been expected to reward the administration and Congress for a budget-deficit cut by reducing the funds rate. But the deficit cut, never anything like a sure thing, now seems even more unlikely in the wake of the Mideast military buildup. So the funds rate has been allowed to edge downward by only a quarter-point in the face of the weakening economy. It was a difficult exercise, not without its ridiculous aspects. The Federal Reserve uses the funds rate to signal its monetary policy. The funds rate does have some influence on other short-term rates, but its influence on long rates is limited. But as the economy has weakened in recent weeks, short-term rates have tended to decline. To keep the funds rate from declining more than the Fed wanted, the central bank has had to pull reserves out of the banking system. Got that? The Fed has not only been resisting pressures to ease by reducing the funds rate, but it has moved in the opposite direction by tightening bank reserves. That leads to the Federal Reserve\'s current unhappy situation. The central bank can\'t move against the increased inflationary pressures without, in all probability, triggering a recession. If the Fed, instead, moves significantly to spur the sagging economy, the bond market and analysts generally will assume the Federal Reserve has caved in to administration pressure and inflation will take off. Is there anything the Fed could have done to avert this debacle? It could have paid more attention to bank reserves. Reserves have been flat-to-declining all this year. Talk about credit crunches; without reserves, banks don\'t make loans. The Fed should have permitted reserves to grow steadily at a modest rate, accepting cheerfully any federal funds rate declines that went along with such a policy. What should the Fed do now? If it chooses to ease, the inflationary pressures increase. If it chooses to tighten, the recessionary pressures increase. Easing, of course, offers no guarantee of avoiding recession. It may merely ensure that inflation will rise so high that everyone will find it intolerable. The result could be a deep recession like 1981-82. Similarly, tightening is not a perfect solution. The Federal Reserve presumably would prefer to move gradually, with the result that the recession\'s anti-inflation benefits will be delayed. In 1981 gradualism was urged on Paul Volcker, then chairman of the Fed, as a cure for double-digit inflation. Mr. Volcker decided gradualism wouldn\'t work and moved quickly. History could repeat itself. The best bet is that the Fed will mark time, hoping for some development in the domestic economy that will make the appropriate action more readily visible. Monetary policy in the next few weeks is likely to be shaped by events, not by new Fed policy. There are times when nothing is the best thing a government agency can do. There\'s no telling what those events might be. Real war in the Mideast might make the recession worries disappear in an inflationary blur. Congress might return from vacation, notice that the Fed hadn\'t moved, and take a small step toward budget control, even in the midst of the Mideast situation. One thing is certain. As a Federal Reserve economist said privately last week, ""We should keep a closer watch on bank reserves."" It would have been nice if that thought had occurred to someone three or four months ago.']",Speaking of Business: It May Be Too Late for the Fed to Ease,1990-08-21,The Wall Street Journal
30,1989-12-20 00:00:00,"['Stock prices stabilized and were widely mixed after Monday\'s skid, and other financial markets were moribund in pre-holiday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 1.92 points to 2695.61 in active trading. Long-term bond prices were off slightly, while the dollar posted modest gains against the other major currencies. Early action in the stock market looked as if Monday\'s steep slide, touched off by the gloomy outlook for both commercial and residential real estate, would continue. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 42 points Monday in a broad-based sell-off. Analysts had predicted that the selling would spread as institutions moved to lighten their portfolios. By midmorning yesterday the Dow industrials were off another 31 points. But a round of buy programs related to stock index arbitrage, as well as some bargain hunting, turned around the market by noon and resulted in some brief afternoon gains. Late selling pulled the average back down at the close. However, the selling was again broad-based, with declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange leading advancers by a nearly two-to-one margin. ""You don\'t usually get sustained moves at this time of year,"" said A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research. ""Certainly the news Monday pounded on investors\' sensitivity, but seasonal strength took over yesterday."" He said most tax-related selling has been done by this time and money managers are usually content to hold their positions at least until the new year begins. Beyond that, anticipation of a market rise in January as new investment money comes available contributes to an underlying strength in the stock market, he said. Bond traders said the pre-holiday quiet has pervaded that market, making extreme moves unlikely. There was some selling around noon after the Federal Reserve made it clear it wasn\'t allowing short-term interest rates to drop. The Fed yesterday ended its regular meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. In major market activity: Stock prices were widely mixed in active trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 186 million shares. Declining issues on the Big Board outnumbered gainers 1,021 to 513. Bond prices eased a bit. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond lost less than an eighth of a point, or less than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield was unchanged at 7.83%. The dollar rose. In late New York trading the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.7368 marks and 143.69 yen compared with 1.7223 marks and 143.60 yen Monday.']","Stock Prices Stabilize, Bonds Ease --- Dollar Posts Gains; Equity Issues Slide Before Recovering",1989-12-19,The Wall Street Journal
31,1989-12-20 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Concerns about bad real-estate loans continued to depress the debt of some Northeast banks, causing the securities to trade at junk-bond levels. In recent days, the bonds of Bank of Boston and Shawmut National Corp. have been hit so hard that yields have soared to double-digit ranges. The long-term senior securities of Bank of New England, which were downgraded by Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. to ""speculative"" grade on Monday, were offered yesterday at a price to yield about 16%. ""The current pricing reflects considerable uncertainty"" about the ability of the nation\'s regional banks to cope with mounting loan losses, said James McDermott, a banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. He said selling pressure on bank debt is likely to continue until analysts comprehend the extent of the real estate problem. New England banks have been suffering from troubled real estate loans for months, but the problems are expected to spread to the mid-Atlantic region and even the Midwest and California. Shawmut National\'s 9.85% subordinated capital notes due in 1999, which traded at par as recently as last week, were quoted yesterday at a price to yield 14%. Midlantic Banks Inc. securities, which had yields of about 10% last week, now are quoted at prices to yield 11 3/4%. Although the mid-sized regional banks are being hurt the hardest, some traders said the weakness has spilled over into the high-quality banking sector as well. In the Treasury market, bond prices ended little changed. Traders said prices were virtually unchanged during the morning, before slipping at midday as it became apparent that the Federal Reserve had not decided to ease credit conditions as some investors had expected. ""There\'s disappointment that there was no movement out of the Fed,"" said Robert Chandross, a vice president at Lloyds Bank PLC. Some investors thought the central bank might wrap up its two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting yesterday by signaling a monetary policy easing. Thus, when the Fed did not add reserves to the banking system during its normal pre-noon intervention period, bond prices came under selling pressure. But David Jones, a senior vice president and economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., said such expectations were premature. However, he added, ""the Fed will be scrutinized in coming days to see if a decision to ease was made at the meeting."" Uncertainty about the timing of the Fed\'s next policy move took its toll on the Treasury\'s two-year note sale. Investor participation in the note sale was below par, as evidenced by the low 2.31-to-1 bid-to-cover ratio. The ratio, which reflects the number of bids the Treasury receives for each one it accepted, is used to measure investor demand. The average bid-to-cover ratio at the 12 previous two-year note auctions was 2.72-to-1. Another indication of weak demand was the ""tail,"" or the difference between the average yield and highest yield accepted at the auction. The highest yield was 7.73%, slightly above the average yield of 7.71%. Since there wasn\'t enough demand at the average yield, the Treasury was forced to accept some bids at higher yields to complete the auction, thus accounting for the ""tail,"" analysts said. The average yield at the two-year note auction was the lowest for such a sale since March 1988, explaining why individual inventors turned a cold shoulder to the auction. Non-competitive tenders, which come mainly from individual investors, totaled $609 million. That was the lowest noncompetitive bid at a two-year note auction in over a year. In when-issued trading, the new two-year notes traded at a price to yield 7.72%. Junk, Corporate Issues Junk bonds finished the day about 1/8 point lower while investment-grade corporate issues ended 1/8 point to 1/4 point lower. Junk bond traders said they continued to see selling pressure in selective actively traded retail issues. R.H. Macy & Co.\'s 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due in 1998 were being bid for at 92, off 1/2 point, while the retailer\'s 14 1/2% subordinated debentures due in 2001 dropped one point to 85 1/2. Macy bonds have been hurt since the company reported a first-quarter loss of $33.1 million last week. Highly volatile junk bonds of RJR Holdings Capital Corp. have also been battered during the market\'s recent downturn. RJR\'s 13.71% convertible pay-in-kind debentures due in 2009 slipped one point to close at 89, while RJR\'s 13.71% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures due in 2007 slid 3/4 point to finish at 76. Treasury Securities Treasury bond prices were little changed in quiet pre-holiday trading. The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 103 7/32 compared with 103 6/32 on Monday. The issue\'s yield was unchanged at 7.83%. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 100 20/32 to yield 7.76% compared with 100 19/32 to yield 7.77%. Short-term rates rose. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.66% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.90% compared with an average discount rate of 7.62% and yield of 7.88% at Monday\'s auction. The discount rate on six-month Treasury bills ended at 7.48% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.86% compared with an average discount rate of 7.43% and bond yield of 7.83% at Monday\'s auction. Here are details of yesterday\'s auction: Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it.

Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities ended unchanged to 1/32 higher in light trading. Government National Mortgage Association\'s 9% securities for January delivery finished at 99 9/32, up 1/32, after changing hands between 99 6/32 and 99 10/32. Ginnie Mae\'s 10% securities ended at 103 11/32, up 1/32, while Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.\'s 9% issue was unchanged at 98 4/32. Federal National Mortgage Association\'s 9% issue was quoted at 98 22/32, also unchanged. The Fannie Mae 9% issue was trading at an unusually wide premium above the Freddie Mac issue because of a scarcity of the Fannie Mae issue. Dealers noted a modest squeeze in the Fannie Mae 9% issue last week ahead of the regular December settlement. Foreign Bonds Newspaper reports that the Bank of Japan was planning to raise its discount rate at least half a percentage point to 4.25% slammed the Japanese bond market, but it recovered somewhat by the end after the central bank and Finance Ministry denied the stories. At the Tokyo Stock Exchange close, the benchmark 4.8% issue due in 1999 was trading at 95.46, down 0.65 points, for a yield of 5.64%. Elsewhere: -- In West Germany, prices reverted to their fixing levels after rising 0.10 point in early trading. The 7 1/8% issue due 1999 was unchanged at 99.85 to yield 7.13%. -- British government bonds showed modest gains. The benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 10/32 to 111 6/32 to yield 10.19%. Municipal Issues The tax-exempt market was little changed in a session in which more than $561 million in new debt was priced. In one of the largest offerings of the week, a PaineWebber group tentatively priced $288 million Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority revenue bonds to yield from 6.10% in 1993 to 7% in 2005-2008. On the competitive front, a Citicorp Securities Inc. group had the winning bid for $110 million Build Illinois sales tax revenue bonds, due 1990-2010 and 2019. The issue appeared to be off to a strong sales start, with a balance of about $20 million remaining, according to the lead underwriter. The bonds were reoffered to yield from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.04% in 2019. Bonds due in 1990 were not formally reoffered. A PaineWebber group priced an issue of $88 million New York State Dormitory Authority various bonds. Preliminary pricing set yields between 5.70% for special obligation bonds due in 1990 and 6.90% for FHA-insured bonds due in 2000.']",Yields Soar on Debt of Some Northeastern Banks As Worry Spreads Over Bad Real-Estate Loans,1989-12-19,The Wall Street Journal

Tokyo\'s Nikkei index was up 113.77 points to close at 33423.48. The index gained 119.33 points Wednesday. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section was up 11.29 at 2489.31. First section volume was estimated at 550 million shares, down from 666 million Wednesday. In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose another 113.76 points to 33537.24. External factors kept large domestic investors out of the market, brokers said on Thursday. Investors are cautious ahead of U.S. employment figures due out Friday and any change in the interest rate outlook resulting from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the U.S. Wednesday and Thursday, brokers said. The stronger yen in Tokyo encouraged investors, but brokers said lingering uncertainty about the direction of the currency market dampened the effect of a firmer Japanese unit. The market opened firmer on the stronger yen, and was bolstered by further index-buying by large investors setting up investment trust funds, brokers said. Brokers characterized morning trading as ""rotational"" as investors shifted attention to lagging sectors and issues. Electrical power, textiles and mining issues were among the laggards sought. These issues remained strong into the afternoon. Buying of large-capitalization stocks such as steels and shipbuilding pushed these issues higher in the morning, but they were sold off in the afternoon, brokers said. Nippon Steel was up 9 yen at 819 yen ($5.91), Kawasaki Steel was down 4 at 903, and NKK was flat at 811. Electrical power issues made strong gains. Tokyo Electric Power was up 270 to 5,890, Chubu Electric was up 90 to 4,090, and Kansai Electric was up 170 to 2,540. London prices sagged in the afternoon to end the session slightly lower, pulled down mainly by the negative influence of Wall Street in a thinly traded market. The Financial Times 100-share index closed 1.7 points lower at 2161.2. The 30-share index was down 3.3 points at 1794.7. Volume totaled a respectable 565.3 million shares, but this figure was inflated by a large morning trade of narrowly capitalized third-line stocks. By comparison, turnover Wednesday amounted to a light 347.4 million. Shares moved up from the outset of trading, buoyed by Wall Street\'s rebound Wednesday from its lowest levels. In addition, unconfirmed takeover rumors, particularly in the food manufacturing sector, injected a bit of enthusiasm into an otherwise directionless trading session. The dollar also made its presence felt, following the U.S. currency\'s sharp slide Wednesday. Despite the dollar\'s slight rebound Thursday, the market took a dim view of internationally oriented stocks, most of which declined on the day. The London market again followed Wall Street on Thursday, rising to its best level after the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened higher but dropping back late in the day as the Big Board moved lower. The U.S. is expected to dominate London trading again Friday, as participants await the release of U.S. employment data for June. The data are being closely watched for signals on the interest rate outlook. The major gaining stock was Ranks Hovis McDougall, which rose 24 pence to 481 pence ($7.82). The stock was bolstered in moderate volume by unconfirmed rumors that Sunningdale Holdings, a group connected to British investors Jacob Rothschild and James Goldsmith, was about to make a bid for the U.K. food manufacturer. Sunningdale already holds 29.9% of Ranks Hovis. Other food stocks were pulled higher by the takeover talk. United Biscuits gained 8 to 381, and Cadbury Schweppes moved up 9 to 373. Frankfurt prices closed narrowly lower after a day of hectic, see-saw trading. The DAX index, which was nearly 11 points lower in the early part of the session, closed down 2.06 at 1493.29. Investors took profits on the strong gains made earlier in the week and drove down the market early in the session, traders said, especially after the federal statistics office published an upward revision in West German inflation figures for June. ""One shouldn\'t overestimate this one figure, but it shows that inflation is still a major issue here,"" one broker at a Frankfurt bank said. The Bundesbank raised its discount rate only last week, but many analysts expect another rate increase this year because of the continued inflationary trend. But buying set in at the lower levels, and following a second wave of profit-taking around midday, the market ended near its day-earlier close. Foreign investors appeared to be interested in German shares in hope that a rise in the mark against the dollar will yield foreign-exchange gains, brokers said. At the end of the day, automobile shares had the largest losses amid worries that the lower dollar will cut into the export earnings of the major car makers. Porsche, which exports half of its luxury sports cars to the U.S., tumbled 14.50 marks to 770 ($409), and Bayerische Motoren Werke dropped 7.5 to 554. Volkswagen slid 5 to 422, and Daimler-Benz eased 0.50 mark to 703. Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Brussels, Stockholm, and Paris, lower in Amsterdam and Zurich and mixed in Milan. Stockholm prices closed at a record high in moderate trading on pent-up buying interest in the major shares. Brokers were surprised by the relatively high volume when they had expected a slow market in the summer doldrums. Among Pacific markets, shares closed higher in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Manila, were lower in Seoul and Taipei, and little changed in Wellington.

The central bank\'s policy-making committee met Wednesday and again yesterday to set credit policy for the coming weeks. But even before that meeting concluded, the bellwether federal funds interest rate began to drop. That suggests Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan may have used his discretionary authority to bring down interest rates slightly in advance of the policy meeting, laying the groundwork for further Fed easing today. ""I think they are clearly leaning in the direction of ease,"" said Steven Wood, a money market economist at Bank of America. ""I would expect definitive signs of a Fed ease to occur"" today after release of the June employment report, said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. The most likely result of the Fed\'s move is that the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge on loans to each other, will fall to 9 1/4% from its recent level of about 9 1/2%. But the Federal Open Market Committee also may have given Chairman Greenspan authority to drop the rate another quarter percentage point in the coming weeks if there are more signs the economy is weakening. The Fed began easing its credit policy last month, reversing a year-long drive to push short-term interest rates up more than three percentage points to fight inflation. That move came after a spirited battle between Fed governors who favored an easier policy and several district Fed presidents opposed to easing. In recent weeks, more signs of an economic slowdown have begun to appear, apparently convincing Fed officials that further easing was needed. ""There are a lot of signals around that the economy is softening,"" said Scott Pardee, co-chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. and a former Fed official. Citing slow money growth and falling commodity prices, Mr. Pardee said: ""All these suggest an easing would be in line. The economic figures justify it, the monetary figures justify it, and there\'s been some signs of abatement in inflationary pressures."" Expectations of the Fed\'s move are so widespread in the financial markets that it may prove anticlimactic and have only a small effect on interest rates other than the federal funds rate. Several traders said bond prices already reflect an assumption the Fed will cut the funds rate imminently. As of late yesterday afternoon, Treasury bond prices were up about 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 8.09%.']",Greenspan May Have Moved to Ease Credit Before This Week's Fed Meeting,1989-07-06,The Wall Street Journal

35,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks fell, but managed to weather the storm in the U.S. stock markets because of strength in biotechnology and other technology shares. Still, the small-cap picture isn\'t much brighter than the large-cap one. The Russell 2000 remains at four-year lows, and the Standard & Poor\'s SmallCap 600 index finished just two points above its one-year low. But market trackers are giving small-caps some credit for holding up on a relative basis in an environment plagued by profit disappointments, a sluggish economy, and the threat of war. The Russell 2000 Index ended down 2.10 points, or 0.59%, at 356.58, while the Standard & Poor\'s SmallCap 600 Index dropped 1.11 points, or 0.6%, to 183.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index of both large and small stocks finished down 2.76 points, or 0.23%, at 1182.17. While most of Wall Street wasn\'t surprised with the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision to leave the federal-funds rate unchanged at 1.75%, there were hopes that the Federal Reserve\'s comments could provide the market with some optimism. Those hopes were dashed, however, after the Fed acknowledged the deepening slump in the labor market, a continuing decline in stock prices, and added more concern about the heightened geopolitical risk\'s effect on expected pickup in production and employment. While the broader market sold off sharply on the comments, small-caps managed to keep losses relatively small. Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke LLC, said action among small caps is more influenced by their valuation compared with large caps, the strength of the dollar, and whether the economy is coming out of a recession. Biotechs were the strongest performers of the session. Lehman Brothers initiated coverage on the sector with a positive stance, saying the sector has dropped 45% this year and may be heading into a period of heavy product launches by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Credit Suisse First Boston initiated coverage with an overweight rating. Abgenix jumped $1.02, or 18%, to $6.81, and Cell Therapeutics added 52 cents, or 12%, to 4.86. Precious metals rose as the price of gold climbed on the back of the weak equity markets, a soft dollar, and a rally in oil prices, spurring speculative and safe-haven buying of gold. Meridian Gold gained 23 cents, or 1.2%, to 19.73 as TVX Gold climbed 14 cents, or 0.9%, to 14.89. Semiconductors were also among the session\'s top performers on an oversold bounce. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange fell Monday to levels not seen since 1998, spurring some bargain hunters to come back into chips. Skyworks gained 45 cents, or 10%, to 4.94. Asyst Technologies added 21 cents, or 2.8%, to 7.70. But investors weren\'t so kind to diversified technology-services stocks after analysts downgraded Electronic Data Systems and raised questions about its cash flow and weak earnings outlook. The pessimism spread to smaller-cap stocks in the group, even though analysts said much of EDS\'s problems are company-specific. KPMG Consulting dropped 1.12, or 15%, to 6.24. Airlines stocks fell a second consecutive day. Crude-oil prices rose to their highest level in more than a year, and investors remained cautious about the health of the industry and the possibility that UAL\'s United Airlines will file for bankruptcy-law protection. UAL fell 22 cents, or 9.4%, to 2.12, and Atlantic Coast Airlines shed 64 cents, or 6.9%, to 8.69. U.S. Physical Therapy shares hit a 52-week low, making the company one of the top percentage decliners on the Nasdaq Stock Market after warning that third-quarter earnings would be lower than expected because of a slowdown in patient visits. The stock tumbled 3.99, or 27%, to 10.77. Radiologix of Dallas also fell to a 52-week low, after the company cut its 2002 earnings estimate, citing lower procedure volume in July and August and an unexpectedly high level of physician vacations. Radiologix (AMEX) dropped 3.35, or 41%, to 4.85. Shares of small-cap Newport, which makes semiconductor capital equipment, shed 2.34, or 17%, to 11.56 after Credit Suisse First Boston downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral, saying slower-than-expected semiconductor recovery will affect the company\'s growth. Six Flags fell 27 cents, or 6.5%, to 3.90 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to underweight from overweight. While preannouncement season has been pretty dismal so far, a number of companies bucked the trend by raising their financial forecasts. Marvel Enterprises (NYSE) raised its revenue and earnings forecast for the third quarter and full year, primarily because of a ""substantial"" upfront cash payment and minimum revenue guarantees from a 10-year games contract with Vivendi Universal. The stock gained 68 cents, or 11%, to 6.83. Anadigics gained 20 cents, or 10%, to 2.21 after the company said it is on track to meet its previous third-quarter projection for a loss of 33 cents a share before items, on revenue of $21 million, in line with analysts\' views. The company also plans to lay off 10% of its 450 employees.']","Small-Stock Focus: Abgenix, Meridian Gold and Skyworks Post Gains",2002-09-24,The Wall Street Journal
36,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Prices of U.S. Treasury securities settled moderately higher yesterday, with sentiment for government debt buoyed by signs that the door to further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve has opened a little wider. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 15/32 point, or $4.6875 per $1,000 face value, at 106 1/32. Its yield fell to 3.64% from 3.69% late Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 29/32 point at 111 22/32 to yield 4.63%, down from 4.68% on Monday. The trading session focused on the monetary policy meeting of the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee. As expected, the FOMC left its target short-term rate unchanged at 1.75% and maintained that risks are still tilted in favor of further economic weakness. However, two members of the FOMC, Federal Reserve Governor Edward Gramlich and Dallas President Robert McTeer, dissented from the decision and sought a rate cut, and the policy statement flagged geopolitical risks. It was the first dissent by a Fed governor since 1995. The news helped to send stocks lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 189.02 to 7683.13. Buying in Treasurys was concentrated in the 10-year note, pushing its yield briefly below 3.60%, a level not seen since 1958. Vinnie Verterano, a trader at Nomura Securities International Inc., said heavy buying in the form of short covering was seen from dealers immediately after the Fed\'s announcement, but no retail activity. Mr. Verterano said the market rallied because ""two people wanted to ease"" and a sign emerged that a rate cut is imminent if the economy shows further weakness. Although the market subsequently pulled back from its highs, the move was attributed to profit taking and traders said renewed weakness in stocks and expectations of a rate cut would sustain the overall bid tone for government debt. ""The Fed is keeping the door open to an easing, but they are reluctant to cut rates as long as equities remain unstable,"" said William Strazzullo, market strategist at State Street in Boston. However, the current climate of poor economic data, weakening corporate earnings and geopolitical concerns are likely to force the Fed\'s hand in the coming months, he said. ""They will be dragged to an ease when the market has already priced in such a move,"" he said. Some fixed-income analysts saw the two dissents as a sign that the FOMC itself is heading back toward another round of rate cuts in the months ahead. The dissents are likely to spark a new debate about a renewed rate-cutting campaign by the Fed, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""The point now is no longer if, but when the Fed will cut rates,"" said Mr. Konstam. ""We now expect that when the Fed starts to ease, it will likely be a cycle of several rate cuts."" Mr. Konstam expects to see the two-year Treasury note -- widely seen as a barometer of Fed expectations -- trade below the current 1.75% Fed-funds rate as those expectations get priced into the market. John Ryding, chief market economist at Bear Stearns, said the two dissenting FOMC votes were surprising. However, ""do I think the Fed will be more likely to cut by the end of the year,"" given the two dissents at the FOMC meeting? ""No,"" he said. That will largely rely on the next two unemployment reports, he added.  Agency Securities Fannie Mae\'s repurchase of $846 million in debt securities yesterday will help a bit to correct a large mismatch between its assets and liabilities, but market professionals say it\'s only a drop in the bucket compared with what needs to be done if interest rates don\'t rise. The buyback is Fannie\'s first since June, representing the longest lag between Fannie Mae debt repurchases since the government-sponsored enterprise implemented the program in March 2001. After announcing plans earlier yesterday to buy as much as $1 billion in longer-term debt, Fannie Mae accepted offers totaling $846 million in notes with maturities between 2009 and 2012. Corporate Bonds Consumer-products manufacturer Gillette Co. sold $500 million of five-year notes at a spread of 0.85 percentage point above comparable Treasury securities. The issue was increased in size from an originally planned $300 million. The lead manager was Lehman Brothers. Meanwhile, postage-meter company Pitney Bowes Inc. sold $400 million of 10-year notes at a spread of 1.02 percentage points above comparable Treasurys. The joint lead managers were Deutsche Bank Securities and J.P. Morgan. The issue had been boosted in size from $350 million. Neither Gillette nor Pitney Bowes is a significant issuer of debt, and, as a result, their issues have scarcity value in the eyes of some investors. Meanwhile, El Paso Corp. faces the prospect of downgrades to its investment-grade credit ratings following a judge\'s recommendation on Monday that the company pay penalties for withholding natural-gas capacity during California\'s energy crisis. Moody\'s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\'s put El Paso\'s debt on review, citing concerns about the ruling and declining cash flow at the Houston-based natural-gas producer and pipeline company. --- Tyler Lifton, Julie Haviv and Michael C.

37,2002-12-11 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Treasurys ended mixed as investors shifted from shorter maturities to 30-year bonds after Federal Reserve policy makers left the target for the overnight borrowing rate unchanged at a 41-year low. Although the Fed\'s action was in line with market expectations, the statement in which it announced the decision didn\'t highlight the economy\'s weakness as much as many had expected, traders and analysts said. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 4/32 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 face value, at 99 17/32. Its yield rose to 4.058% from 4.042% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 14/32 point at 107 to yield 4.912%, down from 4.940% Monday. Fed policy makers voted unanimously to leave the federal-funds, or overnight lending, rate target at 1.25%. They also left the largely symbolic discount rate unchanged at 0.75%. In a statement, the Fed said the risk of a renewed downturn remains ""balanced"" with the risk of inflation. That was interpreted by people in the market as suggesting no need for additional rate cuts by the Fed. ""The committee continues to believe that this accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity,"" the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee said. ""People were expecting a more accommodative comment from [policy makers] in terms of focusing on the weak economy,"" said Paul Calvetti, head of Treasury trading at Deutsche Bank in New York. ""But they seemed to signal that the current level of rates is enough to get through the soft patches."" But some in the market said there was very little new information in the Fed\'s statement in terms of whether it is done easing. Merrill Lynch fixed-income strategist Jim Caron said there is still a risk the Fed will ease one more time next year if the economy doesn\'t pick up. Michael Cheah, portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, N.J., said the Fed had missed an opportunity to assure markets that it isn\'t in a hurry to raise rates, given current high labor productivity. The Fed announcement sparked some light selling in Treasurys -- centered on shorter maturities -- while the 30-year bond\'s price gained some. As long-term yields dropped in relation to short-term yields, the margin between short- and long-term rates narrowed. That trend may continue, with more people shifting out along the maturity spectrum to 30-year bonds, some said. Despite talk of hefty fiscal stimulus, which had been pressuring long-term yields higher, tax cuts are a longer-term prospect, said David Ging, fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Meanwhile, the fact that Fed policy is expected to stay on hold immediately influences where investors are looking to place money, he noted. Anthony Crescenzi, market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, said the Fed seemed to be agreeing with sentiment in the markets this fall. ""The two-month rally in equities, the fall in Treasurys, the narrowing of credit spreads and the rise in commodity prices are predicated in part on the notion that the economy is emerging from the slowdown that began in the summer,"" he said. Economic data yesterday had little effect on trading. Wholesale inventories fell 0.3% in October after a revised 0.4% gain in September. Private economists had forecast a rise of 0.3% for October. Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\'s index of manufacturing shipments fell to minus-one for November from positive-six in October.  Corporate and Junk Bonds Five of the investment companies in an unofficial group seeking to block Qwest Communications International\'s nearly $13 billion debt exchange offer were identified in court documents filed this week. They are Elliott Associated LP, Franklin Mutual Advisers LLC, Metropolitan Life Insurance, Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC and MFC Global Investment Management, according to an amended complaint filed with the court. The five represent about $773 million of the notes subject to the exchange offer, which would enable Qwest to reorganize about half of its debt without filing for bankruptcy. The group, whose members hold about $3 billion of the bonds subject to the exchange, allege in the complaint that the swap offer and its documents violate securities law and breach the company\'s fiduciary duties to bondholders. ""Other members of the committee for a variety of reasons are not in a position to publicly identify themselves as plaintiffs and have a federal and constitutional right to remain anonymous and to proceed with this litigation as a committee,"" the amended complaint said. ""Defendants have demanded public disclosure of the names solely to harass members of the committee and to interfere with their right to protect themselves from the defendants\' illegal exchange offer and other violations of law and breaches of fiduciary duty."" Qwest spokesman Steve Hammack said: ""We believe we have the right to know the names of the parties who are suing us and we intend to abide by any guidelines the courts put forth with regard to discovery."" Qwest has said it intends to file a motion to dismiss the complaint and believes claims in the complaint ""are without merit.""

38,2003-03-19 00:00:00,"['Though Vanguard Group continues to warn against piling into bond mutual funds, investors seemingly won\'t be deterred. For more than six months, the second-largest fund group in terms of assets -- after Fidelity Investments -- has repeatedly warned investors not to pile into fixed-income funds. Vanguard\'s worry: Many investors looking for safety and higher returns might falsely assume bonds are riskless investments, not realizing that even a modest increase in interest rates would take a serious bite out of fixed-income values. Safety-seeking fund shareholders have kept throwing money at the firm\'s bond portfolios, anyway. Bonds historically have lower returns than stocks, but bond portfolios have trounced stock funds for three consecutive years, largely thanks to several years of cuts that have dropped interest rates to near historic lows. At their regularly scheduled meeting yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his Federal Open Market Committee colleagues decided to keep short-term interest rates at their ultralow levels. But it will be painful for bond investors whenever the Fed eventually does reverse field and begins to boost rates. As bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions, such moves will depress prices of bonds sitting in fund portfolios. A bond-risk primer posted on Vanguard\'s Web site in October warned that the value of a long-term bond fund might fall 20% if rates went up just two percentage points. Earlier, the firm cautioned investors about bond-fund risks in an August article titled ""Irrational Exuberance in the Bond Market."" More recently, Vanguard Chairman and Chief Executive John J. Brennan noted in a January market commentary that interest rates are likely to rise this year. Ian MacKinnon, head of Vanguard Fixed Income Group, chimed in, too, warning that rising rates would hurt current bond values during an October news conference in New York. Bonds might not cool on his watch, though; Vanguard announced yesterday that Mr. MacKinnon will retire June 30 after 21 years with the firm. Mr. MacKinnon will be succeeded by fellow Vanguard veteran Robert A. Auwaerter. In addition, George U. Sauter, leader of Vanguard\'s quantitative equity group and manager of the $65.7 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund, was given added duties, becoming the firm\'s chief investment officer, a new position. Despite its persistent warnings, Vanguard\'s bond offerings netted more than $23.7 billion last year, compared with $14.3 billion for its stock funds, according to fund consultants Financial Research Corp. The $28.9 billion Vanguard GNMA Fund, for example, netted a combined $11.3 billion in 2001 and 2002, according to FRC. The fund has averaged a 9% annual gain over the past three years, compared with a 15% annual loss for the Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index, according to researcher Morningstar Inc. Meanwhile, the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund, which was launched at the end of June 2000, has already $3.5 billion in assets, nearly three times the size of the average taxable bond fund. The fund returned 16.6% last year. Vanguard, however, isn\'t changing its tune on the risks connected with bond portfolios. ""We\'re feeling that it\'s not the time to encourage investors to make major commitments to bond funds,"" says Vanguard spokesman Brian Mattes. ""We never want people to invest based on past performance that is unlikely to be repeated."" Vanguard watchers note the fund group, based in Malvern, Pa., could do more to discourage investors from putting more money into bond funds if it chose. ""I give them credit for warning people,"" says Dan Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, adding that they could shutter the funds to new investors. ""If their convictions were strongly held, they do have a way to deal with it. [But] what they don\'t want to do is send people packing to Fidelity."" Vanguard\'s Mr. Mattes says the firm has no current plans to close any of the bond funds. The firm is used to seeing its admonitions largely falling on deaf ears. Vanguard warned investors that stock gains seemed overheated in a shareholder newsletter at the end of 1999.

Yet the dollar may suffer bouts of weakness in the weeks ahead amid the vicissitudes of war, analysts warned. ""The market is pricing in right now a slam-dunk victory,"" for U.S.-led forces in Iraq, said Andrew Weiss, a strategist with AIG Trading Group in Stamford, Conn. ""But I think there could be plenty of hairy moments ahead that could easily take the steam out of the current dollar rally."" Mounting tension ahead of the expected outbreak of hostilities have swept aside -- for now -- economic factors as a key catalyst for the dollar, although a Federal Reserve policy-setting statement that unusually refrained from offering guidance on the economic outlook could later haunt the U.S. currency, some said. The dollar appeared to take in stride a report showing U.S. housing starts declined by 11% last month to the lowest level since last April. For now, the dollar ""is being driven by the shadow of military activity . . . much more than by the data,"" said Lara Rhame, senior economist with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading at 118.84 yen, up from 118.46 yen late Monday. The euro was at $1.0635, down from $1.0637 late Monday, but well above its next important support level, around $1.0550. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.3833 francs, up from 1.3797 francs late Monday. The pound was at $1.5665, down from $1.5710. Sterling\'s retreat came on the heels of the resignation of three of British Prime Minister Tony Blair\'s ministers this week in protest over British involvement in military action against Iraq. ""You\'re starting to see some early signs of political risk premiums coming into sterling,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, a currency strategist with Putnam Investments in Boston. ""While Blair\'s stature is intact at the moment, his position seems a bit more tenuous.""

40,2003-03-19 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, but, in an unusual move, declined to give any hint of what it was likely to do next -- a sign of how the conflict with Iraq has muddied the outlook. The Federal Open Market Committee left its target for the federal-funds rate at 1.25%; the rate is charged on overnight loans between banks. But the Fed didn\'t give its usual assessment of whether future risks to the economy were tilted toward inflation, economic weakness, or were balanced between the two. Instead, it said it couldn\'t ""usefully characterize the current balance of risks"" until geopolitical uncertainties lifted. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll taken after President Bush\'s speech to the nation on Monday night showed the American public equally uncertain about war\'s economic effects. A 44% plurality said military action in Iraq would have a negative effect on the economy, while 40% said it would have a positive effect. The remaining 16% envisioned no effect or weren\'t sure. The Fed\'s unusual decision reflected the huge role that central-bank officials believe war with Iraq will play in determining how the economy performs. The Fed said in a statement accompanying its decision that economic data have been ""mixed"" and jobs data ""disappointing."" But it stuck to the view it has held since September that it was the Iraq situation that is holding back the economy. ""The hesitancy of the economic expansion appears to owe importantly to oil-price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties,"" the Fed said. ""As those uncertainties lift . . . the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will . . . engender an improving economic climate over time."" Last month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that only after uncertainties related to Iraq lifted would the central bank know if something else was holding back growth, requiring more interest-rate cuts. With war likely at any time, Fed officials apparently decided they could wait a bit longer for an answer. If the war goes badly, stocks plummet, oil prices soar, or a wave of terrorist attacks strike the U.S., the Fed could cut rates immediately. It said that ""in the current circumstances, heightened surveillance is particularly informative."" Still, markets lowered the odds of a rate cut on or before the Fed\'s next meeting on May 6. Economists had expected the Fed to shift the balance of risks toward weakness from neutral, and some expected a quarter-percentage-point rate cut. Many also had expected the Fed to say it would ""closely monitor"" economic developments, words that foreshadowed rate cuts it made between its regularly scheduled meetings in January and April of 2001. The Fed, in effect, signaled its readiness to cut rates without cementing such an expectation. Indeed, officials are far less certain than they were in 2001 that their next move is to lower rates. When the fed-funds rate was cut to 1.25% from 1.75% last November, Mr. Greenspan described it as insurance against the ""quite small"" possibility that the economy was poised for ""significant decline."" Tom Gallagher, policy analyst at investment research firm ISI Group, said the Fed\'s willingness to cut now is much more conditional on events, such as the outcome of war with Iraq. There was also speculation that the omission of the balance of risks reflected disagreement among Fed officials about how weak the economy is and the urgency of rate cuts. Indeed, some Fed officials disagree with Mr. Greenspan that war worries are behind the economy\'s woes; they suspect something else, perhaps the burst stock bubble and excess investment of the 1990s. If the war goes well and the economy still doesn\'t show the expected rebound, officials will be ready to cut rates, and probably by a half percentage point. ""I think there was some disagreement"" on where the risks are, said Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Peter Hooper, and the Fed came up with ""an innovative response to a sticky problem."" Indeed, the Fed\'s 12 voting policy makers were unanimous in their decision. But omitting the bias was also a recognition of reality. Ordinarily, policy makers have a forecast and can quantify where and what the risks to that forecast are. With so much riding on the unknown outcome of the war, however, officials evidently didn\'t feel confident about any forecast or the risks to it. --- Journal Link: See the full text of the Federal Reserve\'s statement, in the Online Journal at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

41,1989-05-17 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Both the stock and dollar rallies fizzled while bond prices marked time ahead of more inflation data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 10.44 points to 2453.45 in moderate trading, ending a three-day rise of more than 97 points. Intervention by the Federal Reserve helped lower the dollar from its 29-month high. Long-term bond prices were up modestly. Traders said they had expected a temporary halt to the stock market\'s feverish rally as some investors took profits. But they pointed out that the decline was held in check by continued buying interest from other investors fearful of missing any further gains. ""People are beginning to look at the market more positively,"" said Harold MacKinney, head of the investment policy committee at Fleet National Bank in Providence, R.I. ""Their cash hoards are making them nervous, and they\'ve been looking for something to buy."" Investors bid bond prices higher despite concern about what the consumer price index will disclose about inflation tomorrow. The average estimate calls for consumer prices in April to have risen about 0.6%, or an annual rate of more than 7.2%. But bond traders hope that the surprisingly low 0.4% increase in wholesale prices in April may set the stage for more modest consumer price increases, too. Bond traders looking for signs the Federal Reserve is easing were disappointed yesterday. Although the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s policy-making arm, met to set short-term monetary goals, government officials said it is still too early to begin easing interest rates. Most analysts expect the Fed to wait for more evidence the economy is slowing before making any policy change. But the Fed was active in the foreign exchange markets, selling dollars for West German marks and Japanese yen in an effort to drive the dollar down from its recent highs. Traders said the dollar was already weakening before the intervention pushed it lower. The early weakness was attributed to traders reducing their dollar holdings before this morning\'s report on the nation\'s merchandise trade balance in March. The average estimate calls for the trade deficit in March to total about $10.2 billion, down slightly from the $10.5 billion deficit in February. In major market activity yesterday: Stock prices fell. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 173.1 million shares. Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers, 791 to 678. Bond prices gained slightly. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond rose a little more than a quarter of a point, or more than $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the issue was 8.82%. The dollar weakened against most currencies. In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.9368 marks and 136.78 yen, compared with 1.9385 marks and 137.15 yen.']",Rallies Fade For Stocks And Dollar --- Bond Prices Edge Up; Fear of Missing Out Checks Equities' Fall,1989-05-16,The Wall Street Journal
42,1997-08-20 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged, amid further evidence that economic growth is moderating and prices are being held down. Yesterday\'s gathering of the Federal Open Market Committee was the third straight time that the policy makers opted not to raise rates, following a quarter-point increase in late March. And while some economists continue to argue that economic conditions -- tight labor markets and signs of greater consumer spending -- could force another rate increase this year, many analysts now believe that the central bank may stay on hold for a time. ""This is a case where the physician, having done the physical exam, finds perfect health and therefore has no need to prescribe any change in medication, diet or exercise,"" said Neil M. Soss, chief U.S. economist for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. ""You\'ve got growth, you\'re providing jobs, there\'s low inflation -- what more could you ask?"" A string of recent data affirming that perspective has been released in recent weeks, and still more came out yesterday morning. The Commerce Department said housing starts were flat in July, keeping pace with June\'s high level but showing no signs of accelerating. Separately, the Labor Department said prices for imports fell 0.2% last month, after staying flat for two months. Low import prices -- because of the strong dollar and falling energy prices -- have been a big factor in keeping inflation low. Although the Fed decision was long anticipated by analysts, the stock market rose sharply yesterday, seeming to shake off, for now at least, the inflation fears that have dragged down prices in recent days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day at 7918.10, up 114.74. Following tradition, a Fed spokesman said only that the policy makers met yesterday and had ""no further announcement,"" and Fed officials would give no explanation for their decision. The inaction means that the Fed\'s target for the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- remains at 5.5%. The main question likely shaping Fed policy in the coming months is whether economic growth remains around the moderate pace of the second quarter or accelerates again to the rapid levels reached at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. Clear evidence of a pickup, most economists believe, would likely lead to inflationary pressures and force the central bank to raise rates. ""They will have to implement some further monetary restraint to rein in excessively strong demand,"" said Brian M. Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. ""We think there will be 3% to 4% growth for the rest of the year, and that renewed acceleration of demand will hit an economy that has little slack."" But others say that, while consumer spending is increasing, companies are likely to cut back inventory spending sharply in the coming months, moderating growth. Besides, ""there are no signs of inflationary pressures"" despite the high growth rates registered earlier this year, said Mickey Levy of NationsBanc Capital Markets Inc. ""Looking forward, I see no need for the Fed to do anything through the first half of 1998."" The Fed\'s open market committee has three more meetings scheduled for this year, the next on Sept. 30. The housing sector ""is almost like the economy,"" said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. ""We feel like we\'re moving pretty much sideways at the maximum sustainable pace."" The July and June rate of new home building -- a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,447,000 units -- marked a rebound from a May dip, but remained a bit below the pace set between February and April. Housing starts in July dipped from June in every region except for the Northeast, where business jumped 41% from the previous month. Excluding oil, import prices declined 0.1%, mainly because of a fall in computer prices. Oil prices fell 0.7%. These figures aren\'t seasonally adjusted. Export prices fell 2.3%, dragged down by a 19% plunge in agricultural exports. Nonagriculture export prices rose 0.1%.

43,1997-07-03 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged, confirming that its fears of imminent inflation have subsided. But economists are divided over whether the central bank will still have to tighten monetary policy in the coming months to damp growth. Yesterday\'s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was the second consecutive time that Fed officials chose to leave monetary policy alone after pushing through a controversial quarter-point increase in the federal-funds rate in March. The Fed\'s target for the federal-funds rate, or the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, remains at 5 1/2%. Although the inaction was widely anticipated, the stock market rallied after the decision was disclosed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down nearly 20 points just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, ended the day up 73.05 points to close at 7795.38. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 12/32, or about $3.75 for a $1,000 bond, to close at 98 27/32. The yield fell to 6.71% from 6.73%. The Fed\'s decision to keep interest rates at current levels stems from two recent economic developments. First, numerous signs indicate that economic growth in the second quarter slowed from the red-hot 5.9% pace of the first period. Just yesterday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that factory orders fell 0.7% in May, reversing a 1.4% jump in April. The second trend giving comfort to the Fed has been inflation\'s moderation, despite strong growth earlier in the year and an unemployment rate below 5% -- a level most mainstream economists consider likely to trigger higher wages and prices. The main questions facing policy makers as they look ahead is how long that environment can last. In his last public comments on the economy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made clear in an early May speech that he felt there was ""little slack in our capacity to produce,"" and any hints of strain on the economy\'s capacity would push him into a more aggressive anti-inflation stance. A raft of data to be released before the Fed next revisits monetary policy on Aug. 19 will help show whether the economy continues to wind down to a level Mr. Greenspan is more comfortable with, or whether it is once again skirting close to what he perceives as the edge. Today, the government gives its first detailed look at the June economy with its monthly labormarket report. A sharp increase in job growth or another drop in the unemployment rate -- now at a quarter-century low -- would likely fuel speculation that the Fed will have to lift rates next month or in September. In a recent survey of Fed watchers by Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, 11 of the 18 participating economists said they expected the Fed to raise rates again sometime during the summer. ""We\'re going to see a good rebound in personal consumption in the third quarter,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with the St. Louis forecasting firm. ""While it\'s clear the economy has slowed from the first-quarter pace, it\'s still growing at trend or slightly above trend,"" he added. ""There\'s a very good case to be made that more tightening is in order."" Others say that growth is likely to slow enough to prevent overheating. ""I don\'t think there\'s significant pent-up demand for household durables left, and there are signs that capital-goods orders have slowed,"" said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities Inc. While he doesn\'t think another rate increase is needed, he added that ""it\'s still possible because the Fed has to ask what sort of risk it wants to take."" Some analysts argue that, even if rapid growth resumes, the basic workings of the American economy have changed enough so that conditions that might have sparked inflation in the past are no longer worrisome. Mr. Greenspan himself, despite his constant public warnings of looming inflationary dangers, leans toward this camp. His decision to push up interest rates just once in more than two years shows a greater experimental flexibility than prior Fed leaders would have accepted. ""The economy is now capable of sustaining higher growth rates without higher inflation,"" said William T. Wilson, an economist with Comerica Inc. in Detroit. ""Nobody in manufacturing, nobody in the service industries has any power to raise prices,"" he added. ""Pricing power has reached an all-time low."" The Fed, as is its custom, didn\'t explain the rationale behind yesterday\'s decision. Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to give a public update of his thinking on July 22, when he gives his semiannual economic outlook to Congress. The drop in May factory orders was accentuated by a surprisingly big 0.7% drop in orders for nondurable goods, like food and paper, after a 0.8% rise in April. Orders for durable goods -- products designed to last several years, such as cars and computers -- also fell by 0.7% in May, following a 1.8% jump in April. Earlier, the Commerce Department had estimated durable-goods orders had fallen by 0.6% in May. Unfilled orders were flat in May, indicating that backlogs -- a sign of potentially inflationary bottlenecks -- aren\'t growing. All figures in the report are adjusted for seasonal factors, but not for inflation.  Here are the Commerce Department\'s latest figures for manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.

The Fed also raised the less-important discount rate, charged on central-bank loans to commercial banks, to 3.5% from 3.25%. Many commercial banks responded by raising their prime rate, a benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 5.5% from 5.25%. The Fed\'s message yesterday, nearly matching its statements since November, reflects two things. One is that economic growth and inflation have behaved as expected recently. While some Fed officials were alarmed at signs of inflation in December, those fears may have been allayed as the dollar has stopped falling, commodity prices stopped rising, and anecdotal reports of businesses raising prices became less widespread. The second is the importance the Fed has put on being predictable. It has told markets it would raise rates at a ""measured"" pace. As a result, investors expect the funds rate to rise to 2.75% at the Fed\'s March 22 meeting, 3% on May 3 and to about 3.5% by year\'s end. As long as the Fed is satisfied with those expectations, it may be reluctant to change its message unless compelled to by significant shifts in the economy. Economist David Greenlaw of Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients that concerns about inflation and speculative activity are probably growing at the Fed, but ""are not yet sizable enough to alter the gradual tightening approach."" Like other analysts, he said it\'s up to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to elaborate on these issues when he testifies before Congress on Feb. 16 and 17. Despite the unchanged Fed statements, some important shifts are under way in how the Fed views the world, though it isn\'t clear how these moves, taken together, will affect interest rates. First, the economic expansion is clearly firmly entrenched, and in as little as a year from now, it may have used up the spare capacity left over from the 2001 recession. In an economy operating at full strength, companies will find it easier to raise prices. That prospect would keep the Fed focused on raising rates. Second, growth in productivity, or output per hour worked, has slowed. That means companies must add more workers than before to boost sales, and may try to pass the added labor cost on through higher prices. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Bill Dudley wrote in a recent report that while such a slowing is normal at this stage of the business cycle, it nonetheless ""would likely lead Fed officials to push up the federal-funds rate target by more than expected."" But against those factors, interest rates are no longer abnormally low. At 2.5%, the funds rate is above inflation of 1.5%, according to the Fed\'s preferred measure (though below the 3.3% rate recorded by the better-known consumer-price index). It\'s also higher than the official rate of many foreign central banks. ""At some point the FOMC will need to alter [its] language to say that policy has become less accommodative or no longer accommodative,"" said David Rosenberg, Merrill Lynch &Co.\'s chief North American economist, in a report yesterday.

45,2005-02-03 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate increase gave the Treasury market the green light to pursue its favorite activity: flattening the yield curve. This trade favors longer-dated Treasurys such as the 10-year note and the 30-year bond over shorter-dated peers, which are more vulnerable to tighter monetary policy. The Fed\'s quarter-point increase in the federal-funds target rate sent shorter-dated Treasurys lower by the end of active trade, but investor preference for longer-dated securities pushed the 30-year bond into positive territory. Yield on the long bond exited active trade at 4.581%, its lowest closing level since July 2, 2003. Yields move inversely to prices. The similar wording of the statement accompanying the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision to increase its federal-funds target to 2.5% enhances the popularity of the curve-flattener trade that has ruled Treasurys for months. Not only did the FOMC retain the ""measured pace"" language used to convey its intention to raise rates gradually, but the February statement was nearly identical to the one released at its last meeting in December. For traders, that meant the long end of the market still is the safest place to park funds. Longer-dated securities are more sensitive to the corrosive effects of inflation. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 2/32, or $0.625 for each $1,000 invested, at 100 27/32. Its yield stood at 4.145% from 4.140% Tuesday. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 9/32 point at 112. After the Fed announcement, some banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wachovia, raised prime lending rates, the base rates for many corporate and consumer loans, to 5.5% from 5.25%. Although many market participants had expected the Fed to stick with its measured outlook on rates, some feared the minutes from the December meeting released last month pointed to an emerging hawkish tone from the central bankers. ""The FOMC statement was more benign than some investors feared,"" said Michael Cheah, portfolio manager at AIG Sun America Asset Management in Jersey City, N.J. Glenn Haberbush, economist at Mizuho Securities in Hoboken, N.J., said additional quarter-point increases ""are to be expected at the March 22 and May 3 FOMC meetings."" With the FOMC meeting over, investors now turn to the other two big events on the calendar: the monthly employment report scheduled for release tomorrow and the bulge of new supply coming down the pipeline next week. A tally of 200,000 new jobs is forecast for January. The average monthly payroll increase for the past 12 months has been 186,000, solid but not enough to push long-dated Treasury yields sharply higher. The Treasury Department announced earlier yesterday it will sell $51 billion of new securities in its quarterly refunding next week to refund $11.44 billion in maturing issues and raise $39.56 billion. The refunding will comprise $22 billion three-year notes maturing Feb. 15, 2008, to be sold Feb. 8; $15 billion of five-year notes maturing Feb. 15, 2010, to be sold Feb. 9; and $14 billion of 10-year bonds maturing Feb. 15, 2015, to be sold Feb. 10.

In late trading, the euro was at $1.3035, from $1.3046 late Tuesday. The euro, which rose to $1.3090 overnight, has been in the $1.2920-$1.3130 range since Jan. 20.

48,2005-03-23 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve\'s admission for the first time in years of concern about inflation has solidified a truism in the Treasury market: Higher yields are here to stay. The Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to 2.75%, and stuck to its intention to keep lifting the rate in ""measured"" increments as the economic recovery gains strength. But Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, shot higher, spooked by the central bank\'s worry that ""though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident."" The statement marked the first formal admission of concern from the Fed about inflation and appears to contrast with remarks from a host of central-bank officials of late. The government bond market\'s reaction was to push prices down and yields higher, with the benchmark 10-year yield breaking above 4.60% for the first time since July 2004, as the market braced for the possibility of the Fed raising rates more aggressively than had been expected. The 10-year yield is now above where it was before the Fed started raising rates last June. The inflation concerns in the statement ""are getting us ready for a change in the risk assessment,"" said Gerald Lucas, head of agency and Treasury strategy at Banc of America Securities. At 4 p.m. yesterday, the benchmark 10-year note was down 25/32 at 95 2/32. Its yield rose to 4.627% from 4.525% Monday. The 30-year bond was down 1 4/32 point at 106 29/32 to yield 4.901% from 4.828% Monday. The warning about inflation didn\'t encourage everyone to sell Treasurys: California-based bond-fund behemoth Pimco picked up $500 million of 10-year Treasurys, managing director Bill Gross told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. Although the purchase represents only 0.1% of the total $450 billion of assets under management at Pimco, Mr. Gross said ""it still reflects an attitude that things are better than they were."" Pimco has been an opportunistic buyer and seller of Treasurys since last year, using a broad range between 4.0% to 5.0% on the 10-year yield to locate where valuations look more or less attractive. Mr. Gross said he estimates fair value for the 10-year note is around 5.50%, but he says ongoing buying by foreign central banks will prevent the benchmark yield from reaching that mark. In fact, he said investors should brace for a tamer bear market than past experience has taught them as a result of official purchases from Japan and China as well as a Federal Reserve that has kept interest rates accommodative, despite the 1.75 percentage point cumulative rate hikes. Mr. Gross said the influence of the Fed and the Asian central banks on prices cannot be ignored. ""I wish they [Asian central banks] were out of the game and I wish the Fed were back to its standard practice in terms of higher real short term interest rates,"" he said, referring to the fact that inflation-adjusted interest rates remain historically low. The Fed\'s rate hike comes into a bond market that\'s arguably much more reflective of the Fed\'s tightening cycle than at the last policy-setting meeting at the beginning of February. Back then, the 10-year note was yielding around 4.11%; it went as low as 3.98% on Feb. 10. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan famously dubbed the resistance of long-term yields to the pull of gravity of the Fed\'s rate hike cycle a ""conundrum,"" during Congressional testimony last month. He subsequently explained that it was ""utterly unprecedented"" for long-term interest rates to go down when the Fed was pushing short-term rates higher. The bond market paid attention, and since Mr. Greenspan mentioned his concerns, has pushed the yield on the 10-year note up over 0.6 percentage point. The Federal Open Market Committee\'s statement will likely prompt investors to push yields even higher, arguably rendering returns in the bond market more attractive for money managers who have shunned government bonds for over a year. ""I think there\'s very little doubt Greenspan intends to wake up the bond market,"" said Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who now teaches economics at Princeton University. The central bank\'s latest statement, Blinder said, ""took a big whack out of the `conundrum.\'"" ""The Fed has launched a wonderfully targeted torpedo at the bond market"" and by extension the housing sector ""in order to resolve the conundrum,"" of low long-term rates, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. The December three-month eurodollar future contract late yesterday was pricing in a 4.00% federal funds rate by the end of the year, up from a recent estimate of 3.75%. ""Fundamentally, the 10-year is heading above 5%,"" said Mr. Konstam. A test of last year\'s peak for the 10-year yield of 4.90%, could usher in more buyers. ""The bond market is a lot more attractive at that level versus stocks,"" said Jim Cusser, portfolio manager at Waddell &Reed in Kansas City, Mo. ""It might become a more lucrative bond market for investors."" --- Joseph Rebello and Michael Mackenzie contributed to this article. ---   License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service']","Yields Continue Upward March As Inflation Concerns Mount --- Ten-Year Note Tops 4. 60%, A Higher Level Than When Rate Increases Were Started",2005-03-22,The Wall Street Journal
49,2005-03-23 00:00:00,"['The dollar rose across the board, touching a one-month high versus the euro and a five-week high against the yen after the Federal Reserve lifted rates and issued a moderately hawkish statement. The dollar was modestly lower against the euro and little changed against other major currencies before the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee announced its decision. Traders had earlier brushed off a slightly above-consensus report for the February producer-price index. Yet although the Fed lifted its target rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75% as expected, the dollar rallied sharply after the FOMC statement noted stronger inflationary pressures. In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.3088 from $1.3170 late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 105.56 yen from 105.09 yen Monday. The dollar was fetching 1.1879 Swiss francs from 1.1777 francs. The pound traded at $1.8852 from $1.8987. Versus the yen, the euro was at 138.19 yen from 138.37 yen late Monday. Analysts said the Fed\'s statement, while it maintained its intention to lift rates at a ""measured"" pace, expressed heightened vigilance about inflation. That may increase market expectations of faster rate increases later this year, which is supportive for the dollar. ""It was a more hawkish characterization of the state of the economy, which surprised the market. In addition, the [Fed panel] also seemed to be striving for increased flexibility, as the discussion of the [economic] risk-assessment is less forward-looking than in the past,"" said Sophia Drossos, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley. As a result, Ms. Drossos said the Fed\'s statement is bullish for the dollar, since risk-averse investors are likely to move investments back into dollar assets as a safety measure. Ms. Drossos expects the dollar to rally, causing the euro to test the $1.30 mark in the days ahead. Not all analysts, however, were convinced the dollar was set to extend its gains. ""We are getting this slightly more hawkish message from the Fed on inflation, and that might be driving some of the knee-jerk move higher in the dollar,"" said Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Barclays Capital. ""But ultimately, some of the message it sends -- the jump up in yields and the fact that the Fed might end up behind the curve on inflation, could cause people to rethink what they\'re doing -- that could probably lead to some more dollar weakness,"" he said.

50,2006-02-01 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve reached a turning point in both leadership and interest-rate policy as it raised short-term interest rates for the 14th consecutive time but suggested that further increases are no longer assured. In its last policy meeting with Alan Greenspan as chairman, the Fed yesterday raised its short-term interest-rate target to 4.5% from 4.25% and left a free hand to his successor, Ben Bernanke, for deciding the next move. In a statement accompanying the rate increase, the Fed said, ""Some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep growth steady and inflation low -- a signal that another rate increase is still on the table. But it was less definitive than the statement after the Fed\'s Dec. 13 meeting, which said such action was ""likely to be needed."" The wording change suggests that prospects for an increase at the Fed\'s March 28 meeting and after depend on incoming economic data. The Fed expressed no alarm over a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, but it remained wary of inflation. Though economic data have been ""uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid,"" it said. Underlying inflation ""has stayed relatively low,"" but ""possible increases in resource utilization, as well as elevated energy prices, have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" The shift in language coincided with the end of Mr. Greenspan\'s 18 1/2-year tenure at the central bank, during which the U.S. economy experienced the longest expansion on record and just two mild recessions. At the start of yesterday\'s meeting, Mr. Greenspan was greeted by a standing ovation by other Fed policy makers. Afterward, he went to a lunch reception attended by 180 Fed staff and policy makers. They presented him with a chair with his nameplate from the Fed\'s board room, a baseball glove signed by each of the 12 reserve-bank presidents, and the Fed flag that had flown over the building during the meeting. ""I know this institution will go on doing extraordinary things, and I will look on from the sidelines and cheer,"" Mr. Greenspan said, according to a Fed official. After that, he went to a reception in the atrium of the Fed with about 1,500 retirees and staff. ""We have a very special mission,"" he told them. ""We are in charge of the nation\'s currency, and the central bank, because of that, is involved in everyone\'s daily lives. We are the guardians of their purchasing power."" The 79-year-old Mr. Greenspan plans to set up a consulting firm in Washington, give speeches and write a book. As the Fed meeting ended, the U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm Ben Bernanke to succeed Mr. Greenspan. Mr. Bernanke, 52, was most recently chairman of President Bush\'s Council of Economic Advisers. He was a Fed governor from 2002 to 2005. He is to be sworn in at 9 a.m. today. Yesterday\'s decision to raise the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, was unanimous among the 10 voting members of the 17-member Federal Open Market Committee. (There are two vacancies.) The Fed also raised the less-important discount rate, charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to 5.5% from 5.25%. In response, many U.S. commercial banks raised their prime rate, the benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 7.5% from 7.25%. Stock and bond markets showed little reaction to yesterday\'s move, evidence of how transparent and predictable the Fed became in Mr. Greenspan\'s later years. Still, with yesterday\'s statement, the Fed signaled that its recent period of exceptionally clear guidance is ending. When it began to raise the rate from a 46-year low of 1% in 2004, it sought to avoid the turmoil that accompanied its rate increases in 1994 by telegraphing its intentions. Its statements from that May until last November said rates were ""accommodative,"" that is below some neutral level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth, but that rates would rise at ""a pace that is likely to be measured,"" which came to mean no more than a quarter of a percentage point per meeting. That interest-rate guidance eliminated most of the guesswork and volatility that used to accompany Fed rate changes. Some economists say that is one reason investors have been willing to accept very low returns on long-term Treasury bonds. Their yields, at around 4.5%, are about where they stood when the Fed began to tighten monetary policy in 2004. Economists said that by suggesting another rate increase isn\'t automatic, Fed officials have left Mr. Bernanke more latitude on where to direct rates. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can see how the Federal Reserve\'s statement compares with the one in December, and read the full text of the Fed\'s statement.

51,2006-02-01 00:00:00,"['Short-term Treasurys exited yesterday\'s session on a weaker footing, while longer-term Treasurys gained after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates. For borrowers with floating-rate debt, such as some types of home-equity loans, the Fed\'s 14th consecutive rate increase spells higher interest payments. Commercial banks yesterday began to raise the prime rate, the benchmark rate for certain types of corporate and consumer credit, to 7.50% from 7.25%. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 3/32 point, or 93.8 cents per $1,000 face value, at 99 26/32. Its yield fell to 4.523% from 4.533% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The two-year note lost 1/32 to 99 23/32 to yield 4.528% as short-term interest-rate futures see odds of 80% that the federal-funds rate will rise to 4.75% from the current 4.50%. In what was Alan Greenspan\'s final day as Fed chairman, the Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, raised the federal-funds rate by a quarter-percentage point. The Senate yesterday confirmed Ben Bernanke as Mr. Greenspan\'s successor. Market attention focused on the changes in the accompanying policy statement, which were in line with expectations. The statement omitted the word ""measured"" to describe future policy changes and said that further rate increases ""may be needed"" to keep inflation in check and growth on track. The policy statement reflects the uncertainty over how the FOMC will end its series of rate increases, which began in June 2004 when the federal-funds rate was 1%. ""They have to tread carefully, they don\'t need to raise rates so they become restrictive as there is no inflation, so they are fumbling for a neutral funds rate,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Still, with the Fed showing a ""bias to tighten policy,"" the funds rate could easily reach 5% or higher, he added. The FOMC statement changes little in terms of investment strategies, which along with future Fed interest-rate moves will remain highly dependent on coming economic data for direction. ""From the fed funds to the two-year note out to the 10-year note, you\'ve got rates that are virtually on top of each other,"" said Colin Lundgren, a portfolio manager at RiverSource Investments in Minneapolis, which has about $100 billion in fixed income under management. ""As an investor, what attracts you to one versus the other has a lot to do with the economic outlook."" With investors expecting data on Friday to show a healthy gain of 250,000 jobs in January and anywhere from $46 billion to $50 billion in new supply next week, the bias remains to the downside for Treasurys, Mr. Lundgren said. ""I expect it could be some tough sledding here for bond investors,"" Mr. Lundgren said, adding it ""appears the Fed is leaving the door open for another hike on March 28, but beyond that, who knows.""

52,2008-05-01 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar declined against the euro Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and hinted, but didn\'t directly state, that it plans to take a break from more rate reductions. The Federal Open Market Committee cut its benchmark federal-funds rate by another quarter percentage point to 2.0% after its two-day meeting, which markets were expecting. In a statement after the decision, the FOMC noted ""substantial"" easing of monetary policy to date -- suggesting it is reluctant to cut further. But there wasn\'t a decisive ""all-clear"" announcement on more possible rate cuts, which have been continuing for months and have been a big factor in the dollar\'s sharp declines. The committee noted ""further"" softness in U.S. labor markets and financial markets\'""considerable stress."" ""Our sense is that the market was looking for . . . a stronger signal of a policy pause,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Bank. ""We suspect it is that lack of that direct signal that is contributing to the dollar\'s dip after the announcement."" The euro climbed to an intraday high of $1.5642 against the U.S. currency after the FOMC statement. Late Wednesday in New York, the euro was at $1.5615, up from $1.5566 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 104.00 yen, down slightly from 104.02 yen. The euro was at 162.40 yen, up from 161.91 yen. The British pound was at $1.9884, up from $1.9687 late Tuesday, and the dollar was at 1.0361 Swiss francs, down from 1.0375. Despite the dollar\'s modest losses against the euro, the dollar still ended April firmer than where it began, the first month it has done so this year. Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, N.J., said that with no huge surprises in the FOMC statement, currency markets will now turn their attention back to data, including a U.S. jobs report for April due Friday. ""We got a major status quo statement,"" Mr. Trevisani said. ""We\'re now back to looking at economic statistics, and the market wants to sell the euro but they\'re not going to do it until there\'s proof, a change in U.S. economic data."" Prior to Friday\'s jobs report, currency investors will keep their eye on a nationwide U.S. manufacturing report out Thursday. The Institute for Supply Management\'s monthly survey of manufacturing activity is likely to show another modest contraction in April, according to economists\' forecasts. The FOMC\'s rate cut reversed the dollar\'s earlier gains against major rivals on the back of a quarterly U.S. economic-growth report that met expectations and suggested the economy continues to avoid a technical recession. The Commerce Department reported a 0.6% gain in the initial reading for first quarter U.S. gross domestic product. Sterling also rose against the dollar Wednesday as the FOMC statement deflected attention away from data overnight that showed United Kingdom house prices posted their first year-on-year fall for 12 years in April. --- Nicholas Winning in London contributed to this article.

Initially, traders embraced the Fed\'s statement as a signal it was finished cutting rates. The Fed cut its target overnight bank rate to 2%, the lowest since November 2004, in an 8-2 vote by the Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed highlighted the ""substantial easing of monetary policy to date,"" saying that should help spur ""moderate"" economic growth, implying more rate cuts might not be necessary. ""One way to look at this is that the Fed\'s slowly starting to turn this ship around, but it\'s a very, very small increment,"" said Sean Simko, head of fixed income management at SEI Investments. ""They want to note that they\'ve done a lot, and they\'re going to let the data guide them over the next few weeks."" April is the kindest month, at least for the blue chips: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.5% in April, its best monthly percentage gain since last April. The S&P 500 rose 4.8%, its biggest monthly point gain since April 2003 and its biggest percentage gain since December of that year. ""Foods, fuel, inflation, employment, credit are all serious concerns, [yet] optimism is alive and spreading,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard &Poor\'s. Shares of companies sensitive to commodity prices retreated, and Home Depot was one of the weakest performers on the Dow, off 56 cents, or 1.9%, to $28.80. Citigroup fell 1.05, or 4%, to 25.27, the biggest decliner on the Dow, after the largest U.S. bank by assets went back to the capital markets, raising $4.5 billion in a follow-on sale of shares. Altogether, Citi has raised about $40 billion in the recent past from investors as it seeks to shore up reserves against bad loans. General Motors was the biggest percentage gainer on the Dow. GM added 2, or 9.4%, to 23.20 even after swinging to a first-quarter net loss of $3.3 billion as overseas growth offset difficulties in its North American lending and auto business. Another Dow component sensitive to commodity costs, Procter &Gamble added 1.15, or 1.8%, to 67.05 -- well off its high on the session. The maker of consumer staples like Pampers diapers, Gillette razors and Folger\'s Coffee said fiscal-third-quarter profit surpassed the mean analyst estimate. P&G\'s peer Colgate-Palmolive shed 5.08, or 6.7%, to 70.70 despite robust growth in the first quarter. The maker of toiletries and pet food warned margin growth may be flat or only slight, amid rising commodity costs. American depositary shares of German business-software maker SAP declined 2.22, or 4.2%, to 50.23 after it reported a drop in first-quarter profit, hurt by costs associated with its acquisition of French concern Business Objects. Also on Wednesday afternoon, commodity stocks regained some of the momentum lost earlier this week when traders sold them in fear that the Fed would clamp down on inflation. American depositary shares of Harmony Gold Mining rose 47 cents, or 4.2%, to 11.69. International Paper fell 1.14, or 4.2%, to 26.17, however, after the paper maker said higher costs for energy and raw materials drove down first-quarter profit. Lower land sales also hurt results. A trio of food producers topped Wall Street estimates with first-quarter results, in part because they succeeded in passing on higher commodity costs to customers. Shares of Velveeta cheese maker Kraft Foods rose 86 cents, or 2.8%, to 31.63; milk supplier Dean Foods added 72 cents, or 3.2%, to 23.24; and cereal maker Kellogg shed 81 cents to 51.17 after trading higher early in the session. Garmin (Nasdaq) fell 5.54, or 12%, to 40.90 after the maker of global-positioning navigation devices disoriented investors by missing the Wall Street estimate for its first-quarter profit. First Solar (Nasdaq) rose 7.07, or 2.5%, to 291.99 after the maker of ""thin film"" solar panels outshone analyst expectations with its first-quarter profit. Time Warner fell 42 cents, or 2.8%, to 14.85 after the media giant said it would step back from its interest in Time Warner Cable. Growth in that business was solid in the first quarter.

The Federal Reserve\'s explanation of monetary policy yesterday struck the kind of cautious rhetorical balance more often associated with election-year politicking: simultaneous bids to assure both those who worry more about economic growth and those more spooked by inflation. In keeping its benchmark interest rate at the 2% level set in April, the Federal Open Market Committee made the kind of slight linguistic alterations that Fed watchers like to study as closely as Kremlinologists once scrutinized who stood next to whom on May Day. The FOMC still sees U.S. economic activity expanding but views softening labor markets and the persistent ""considerable stress"" in financial markets as potential threats. And FOMC members regard ""tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and elevated energy prices"" to be just as burdensome on future economic growth as they did in June. But the FOMC moved a key part of its June and April statements from the section about its policy leanings to the part where it describes its view of the economy: ""Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth."" Meanwhile, descriptions of inflation more alarmingly expressed in the present tense in June merited less urgent syntax in yesterday\'s statement. ""Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated,"" the Fed said. And ""the committee [still] expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year,"" even if ""the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain."" Thus, ""although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee,"" the Fed said -- straddling the fence of conflicting economic worries as much as at any time in the recent past. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues -- only one of whom voted against yesterday\'s actions out of preference for an anti-inflationary increase in the cost of borrowed money -- aren\'t alone among the world\'s conflicted central bankers. Elevated energy and food prices have stoked inflation fears everywhere, but few economies are out of the credit-crunch woods or immune to contagion from American economic ills. A German news report suggests official figures due out next week will show that country\'s economy contracted in the second quarter, as the Financial Times reports. A key reading of Japan\'s economic health fell in June, contributing to that government\'s pronouncement of a ""worsening"" view of the economy, as the Nikkei reports. In the U.S., investors nonetheless took heart from the Fed\'s statement and sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 300 points in hope, as The Wall Street Journal puts it, that ""the worst could be over for stocks."" Of course, ""this was hardly the first time since the bear market began in October that stocks have staged a strong rebound,"" the Journal notes. And it adds that skeptical investors warned ""this could be another false start,"" with a potential recession looming, housing prices continuing to fall and the financial system still in disarray. --- Cracking a Global Identity-Theft Ring U.S. authorities yesterday charged 11 people with stealing more than 40 million credit-card and debit-card account numbers off the computers systems of Barnes &Noble, TJ Maxx, Sport Authority and other retailers, in what Attorney General Michael Mukasey called ""the single largest and most complex identity-theft case ever charged in this country."" The case took three years to crack, and brought investigators to three continents, bringing home what the Los Angeles Times describes as ""the global nature of the Internet\'s underground economy as agents tracked leads from China to Ukraine and picked up suspects in Turkey and Germany as well as the U.S."" One reason it took so long, The Wall Street Journal adds, is that the man identified as the ringleader, Albert Gonzalez of Miami, had been a confidential informant for the Secret Service. ""His indictment states that during the course of his \'cooperation,\' he obtained \'sensitive\' information that he used \'to warn off conspirators and ensure that they would not be identified and arrested in the course of that investigation,\'"" the Journal reports. Mr. Gonzalez and alleged conspirators are accused of locating ""retailers\' wireless networks by driving by with a laptop with Wi-Fi installed,"" and then hacking ""into the networks and [installing] sniffer software to collect payment card numbers as well as password and account information as the data was passing through the retailers\' networks,"" Women\'s Wear Daily reports.

55,2009-08-13 00:00:00,"['We\'re beginning to wonder if the Ben Bernanke Federal Reserve isn\'t populated with French existentialists. A la Jean-Paul Sartre, they have a ""no exit"" strategy when it comes to unwinding their extraordinarily easy monetary policy. At least they gave no signs of restraint in yesterday\'s statement after their August Open Market Committee meeting, keeping short-term interest rates close to zero and again promising to maintain current policy for an ""extended period."" The Fed is keeping the money pumping even though it also conceded that ""economic activity is leveling out,"" which is an acknowledgment that the recession is all but over. This policy is justified, the FOMC statement said, because the economy still has ""substantial resource slack"" that will keep cost pressures under countrol ""for some time."" Unsaid by the Fed, but understood by everyone, is that Mr. Bernanke isn\'t about to tighten money while he\'s still auditioning for re-appointment to a second four-year term as Chairman. Fed chiefs who tighten money tend to be unpopular with Wall Street and the political class, though not with the middle class. The one hint of discipline was the Fed\'s suggestion that it won\'t expand its program to buy $300 billion in Treasury debt. The Fed will stretch out its purchases for an additional month into October, but this is probably to reduce the chance of market disruptions when it stops its purchases. The good news here is that the Fed seems to be admitting that this decision to directly monetize the national debt by buying long-end Treasurys was a mistake. It failed to keep rates down and may even have helped increase them as holders of U.S. debt wondered about the Fed\'s independence from the politicians at Treasury and on Capitol Hill. Overall, though, the Fed\'s policy is to keep pressing the money accelerator to the floor. We agree it\'s hardly time to put the brakes on. But the Fed would be wiser to at least begin slowing to, say, 160 miles per hour from its present Indy car speed of 200 mph. It\'s a lot safer to slow down gradually than have to screech to a halt to avoid another asset bubble.

56,1990-12-19 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar fell quickly late yesterday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announced a long-awaited cut in the U.S. discount rate to 6.5% from 7%. Coming at the end of an otherwise staid trading day, the Fed\'s announcement caused traders to scurry into action, dropping the U.S. currency across the board. Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.4762 marks, down from 1.4870 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 132.62 yen, down from 133.15 yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.9430, up from $1.9305 late Monday. In midmorning trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 133.20 yen, up from 133.03 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. The Fed said the reduction was made to address credit constraints in the weak U.S. economy and slow growth in monetary aggregates. It also was taken to realign the discount rate with market interest rates, the Fed said. With federal funds at 7 1/4%, there wasn\'t much leeway for a further relaxation of U.S. monetary policy unless the discount rate was cut. The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges member banks for loans, while the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans. An eventual drop in the discount rate, therefore, had been widely expected. With the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meeting Monday and yesterday, many traders commented that a rate cut this week was likely, but few expected it to come yesterday. Fueling speculation of a rate cut during the day was the improved inflation picture shown by the U.S. consumer price index for November. Showing only a 0.3% rise, compared with increases of 0.6% in October and 0.8% in September, the figures were perceived as giving the Fed added maneuverability to lower rates -- leeway that had been narrowed by last Friday\'s disheartening 0.5% rise in November producer prices. Nevertheless, because of the thinness of the market, traders weren\'t bothering to risk the exposure of positioning for a potential rate cut. Before the rate reduction was announced, one New York trader commented that ""people might be thinking about {a discount rate cut} but very few people are acting on"" that suspicion. Because the Fed dropped the news into a calm, highly illiquid market, it\'s hard to gauge how sharp a sell-off the dollar ultimately will suffer, said Al Shealy, foreign exchange manager at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. ""It\'s certainly bearish news for the dollar,"" but the dollar has withstood bearish news in the past, said Mr. Shealy. Predicting the downside potential of this one impulse is difficult, traders said. If the easier credit conditions stimulate the U.S. economy, they eventually could benefit the U.S. unit. Before the Fed stole center stage with its rate reduction, the market was serene, tucked in tight ranges and already focused on the coming holidays, traders said. The dollar had fallen slightly on an unexpectedly wide U.S. trade deficit but was supported by the market\'s nagging apprehension over a war in the Persian Gulf. ""Nobody wants to be either a hero or a goat . . . squandering everything they\'ve made all year in the last week,"" said Alfonso Alejo, assistant vice president in corporate foreign exchange at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank in New York. Many participants already have closed their books for the year, content to lock in whatever profits or losses they have sustained, rather than risk exposure in the thin illiquid market. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $376.50 an ounce, down $1. Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.

57,2003-05-07 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar fell hard, with the euro leaping above $1.14 for the first time since January 1999, after the Federal Reserve flagged deflation as a possible risk and Treasury Secretary John Snow appeared to signal a benign policy. In the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s announcement, the dollar stumbled quickly, with the euro shattering resistance around $1.1395. The dollar also hit a four-year low against the Swiss franc, a 5 1/2-year low versus the Canadian dollar and three-year lows against the Australian dollar. It also touched two-month troughs versus the yen and sterling. Comments by Mr. Snow didn\'t seem to slow the dollar\'s decline. In an interview on CNBC, he said that the U.S. administration has had a position ""going back many years to support a strong dollar."" But he added ""we recognize that the dollar\'s value is best set in an open competitive currency market."" The fact that Mr. Snow\'s statement came on a day when the euro hit a fresh four-year high was viewed by some in the market as a significant endorsement of a more benign policy by the Bush administration toward the dollar. Meanwhile, ""the Fed is giving more emphasis to deflation concerns than ever before,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ""The Fed believes the economic rebound they see won\'t be strong enough to head off deflation."" Late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 117.52 yen, down from 118.67 yen late Monday in New York but above two-month lows of 117.31 yen hit earlier in the session. The euro was trading at $1.1437, sharply up from $1.1282 late Monday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.3243 francs, down from 1.3425 francs late Monday. Sterling was at $1.6135, up compared with $1.6063 Monday. Some analysts said the euro may not be able to hold on to these gains however, particularly given the speed of its climb. The Canadian dollar hit its highest level in 5 1/2 years after the Fed\'s decision reinforced expectations that the interest-rate divergence between Canada and the U.S. would continue to widen in the Canadian currency\'s favor. Late yesterday, the U.S. dollar was trading at C$1.3924, from C$1.4120 late Monday. --- Robert Flint and Michael Deibert contributed to this article.

58,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"['The dollar surged after U.S. stock markets cheered the Federal Reserve\'s decision to cut interest rates less than expected. Currency traders weren\'t convinced immediately that the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision was positive for the dollar. The greenback waffled for a while, briefly dropping below 98 yen. But as U.S. stock markets began to rise after the FOMC\'s decision to reduce its key lending rate by 0.75 percentage point to 2.25%, instead of the expected one percentage point, the dollar also took a liking to the move. As sentiment began to emerge that the Fed perhaps is getting a handle on U.S. economic problems, many investors betting against the dollar didn\'t ""have the mettle to hang in,"" said Jeff Gladstein, global head of foreign exchange trading at AIG. As a result, the euro dropped to an intraday low of $1.5633 after the FOMC decision, while the dollar pushed as high as 99.71. Late yesterday in New York, the euro fell to $1.5636 from $1.5747 late Monday, while the dollar was at 99.56 yen from 97.38 yen. The euro was at 155.67 yen from 153.35 yen. The British pound was at $2.0081 from $2.0007, and the dollar moved up to 1.0017 Swiss francs from 0.9858 franc Monday. In general, lower interest rates by the Fed are a knock on the dollar, because they lower returns on dollar-based investments and lead investors to buy foreign currencies. But yesterday\'s cut was less than forecast, so it was considered positive for the dollar. Perhaps as important to the dollar as the rate cut was the Fed\'s economic-outlook statement that accompanied it, said Michael Woolfolk, a senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. ""The Fed indicated that it was giving increased attention to elevated inflation levels, thereby signaling that an end to the current rate cut cycle was fast approaching,"" Mr. Woolfolk said. This, he said, lays ""the groundwork for a bottom in the fed funds target rate at 1.75%-2% in the second quarter, and helps to restore stability to the beleaguered dollar by midyear."" The dollar needs any help it can get. In recent days, it has fallen to record lows against the euro and the Swiss franc, and a 13-year trough against the yen as markets fretted over a U.S. economy that may be in a recession. The gains were broad after the FOMC\'s decision, even reversing earlier losses against higher-yielding currencies such as the British pound and the Australian dollar.

59,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"['Crude-oil futures ended 3.5% higher after the Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate reduction prompted a late-session surge.    Light, sweet crude for April delivery settled at $109.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange, a gain of $3.74 for the day. The contract expires today. The day\'s gains nearly erased Monday\'s drop, which was the biggest one-day percentage loss since August.    Futures rose by about $2 yesterday morning and spent most of the day at that level, with activity light as the market awaited the Fed\'s decision, which came just 15 minutes before the close. The three-quarter pecentage-point cut failed to match widely held expectations of a full-point move. Nevertheless, crude soared above $109 on the news -- in large part because investors drawn to the market by monetary policy had nowhere else to go, said Addison Armstrong, an analyst with TFS Energy in Stamford, Conn.    ""The funds who are clearly in charge of these markets really don\'t have any other way to play it at this point,"" Mr. Armstrong said. ""They can\'t find a return anywhere else other than commodities markets, where there\'s momentum and there\'s liquidity.""    The Fed\'s moves are closely watched by commodities traders for their effect on the dollar. Cuts to interest rates tend to weaken the U.S. currency, which in turn tends to buoy oil prices as investors seeking a hedge flood into commodities.    The dollar weakened slightly against the euro and the yen after the cut was announced, but later strengthened.    The Fed\'s actions may have given the crude-futures market renewed strength, enough to overcome Monday\'s big drop and resume the two-month-old rally, said Peter Donovan, a vice president at Vantage Trading in New York. ""This is definitely going to put [talk of a correction] on the back burner,"" Mr. Donovan said.    The market\'s attention now turns to the Department of Energy\'s weekly oil and product inventory data, which is expected today. Crude-oil and gasoline stockpiles are expected to have increased in the week ended last Friday, while analysts forecast that distillates, which include diesel and heating oil, decreased.

60,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve continued its two-front attack on the credit crunch with a steep rate cut, and hinted at more to come.     The cut was less than financial markets wanted. But in a sign the Fed\'s prior efforts to boost lending through unconventional means may be getting some traction, stocks soared, buoyed by earnings reports from two big investment banks.     The Fed cut its short-term interest-rate target 0.75 percentage point to 2.25%, not the full point that markets had been expecting. It was the largest disappointment the Fed has delivered to markets since the central bank began cutting rates in September. the move was also a signal that because of the Fed\'s concerns about inflation, it expects its other initiatives to bear more of the burden of stimulating growth.     For at least a day, investors cheered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 300 points ahead of the rate cut on a growing conviction the Fed\'s prior efforts to funnel cash to credit markets would work. Though stocks lost a chunk of their gains right after the 2:15 p.m. rate-cut announcement, they surged back to close up 420.41 points, or 3.5%, at 12392.66.     Financial stocks did especially well. Shares of   Lehman Brothers Holdings, under sharp pressure lately, soared more than 46%.   Goldman Sachs shares rose over 16%. Both reported first-quarter earnings that, while off more than 50% from a year ago, were better than expected, prompting descriptions of the market surge as a relief rally.     The dollar improved against both the euro and Japanese yen after the Fed announcement. The U.S. currency has fallen sharply in recent weeks as global investors questioned the Fed\'s commitment to resisting inflation, a worry that has sent money pouring into gold, oil and other inflation hedges. Oil sold off briefly after the announcement but then rose to close up $3.74 a barrel at $109.42.     Though less than expected, the interest-rate cut was substantial. Yesterday was only the second time the Fed has cut so much since it began announcing its rate moves in 1994. The central bank now has cut short-term interest rates a full three points since September, the fastest pace of easing in decades.     This reflects the speed with which a slump in housing and subprime mortgages has spiraled into a broad credit crunch, weakening financial institutions and making it harder for a broad swath of businesses and households to borrow. Most economists now think the U.S. is in a recession, with the debate shifting to how deep it will be.     Recognizing that, the Fed signaled in its end-of-meeting statement that the prospect of more rate cuts remains on the table. ""The outlook . . . has weakened further,"" it said. ""Consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth."" It said ""downside risks to growth remain,"" and the Fed will ""act in a timely manner as needed.""     Nonetheless, the Fed has increasingly come to the view that lower rates alone won\'t restore order to the financial markets and prevent a severe recession. It has rolled out ever more creative and aggressive attempts to infuse cash into market corners where it normally doesn\'t operate, culminating in Sunday\'s decision to lend to investment banks from its ""discount window,"" a privilege previously reserved for commercial banks. Chairman Ben Bernanke also has publicly backed action to use public money to stem a tide of mortgage defaults and foreclosures.     The Fed\'s actions are among several aggressive steps throughout the federal government that are coming to a head this week and could prove critical in combating the crisis. Today the regulator of Fannie Mae and   Freddie Mac, which provide the bulk of funding for home mortgages, is to announce an easing of their capital requirements and the companies are to pledge to raise more capital, people familiar with the matter said. Those steps should enable them to back more mortgages.     Meanwhile, the Bush Administration which has so far resisted using large amounts of public money to save borrowers and lenders from bad loans, may be ready to compromise with Democrats on a more activist approach to the housing crisis. The Fed is ""running out of pages in its playbook to address the growing crisis of credit and confidence,"" Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, who has proposed the Federal Housing Administration insure up to $400 billion in troubled mortgages, said yesterday. Now the Bush administration should be ""equally aggressive.""     Yesterday, the Fed expressed more concern about prices than after its Jan. 30 meeting. ""Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen,"" it said. While the Fed still expects inflation to ease as commodity prices plateau and as higher unemployment blunts wage and price gains, it said that ""uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.""     With the economy continuing to weaken, the Fed remains concerned about what some officials describe as an ""adverse feedback loop"" of economic weakness, tighter lending and further weakness. It is thus likely to cut interest rates again.     But the elevated concern about inflation in the statement suggests the Fed does think it\'s getting close to the bottom in interest rates. Some analysts speculate the Fed could trim rates before its next scheduled meeting on April 29-30, but many think that\'s unlikely unless the outlook or markets get markedly worse.     The futures markets reduced the expectation they are showing for additional cuts. The futures now see the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, easing to between 1.5% and 1.75% by year\'s end. Before yesterday\'s move, futures investors were betting the rate would fall to 1.25% to 1.5%.     The Fed also lowered the rate charged on direct ""discount window"" loans it makes available to banks and -- since Sunday -- to investment banks. It slashed the rate to 2.5% from 3.25%, keeping it a quarter-point above the federal-funds rate. Commercial banks began lowering their prime interest rates, to which some variable-rate loans are tied, to 5.25% from 6%.     Highlighting the depth of the Fed\'s inflation concerns, two of the 10 voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted against the 3/4-point cut. Charles Plosser and Richard Fisher, presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Dallas, ""preferred less aggressive action at this meeting,"" the Fed said.     A worsening of both inflation and economic growth in the past month has made FOMC decisions more fractious. Each of the past five rate-cut decisions has triggered at least one dissent -- one favoring a bigger cut and the others favoring less. Yesterday\'s was the first meeting with two dissents since 2002.     Messrs. Plosser and Fisher have been the most outspoken about inflation risks, but most other Fed policymakers are also uncomfortable with the recent deterioration in inflation psychology. The decision to trim the federal-fund rate less than markets expected appears, at least in part, a way to convey both that the Fed isn\'t panicking and that the central bank is weighing consequences of its actions on inflation psychology.     The economy is hardly out of the woods. Investor confidence remains fragile just days after the Fed made an unprecedented loan to prevent the collapse of   Bear Stearns Cos., exposing how deeply the credit squeeze had penetrated the U.S. financial system. Sunday\'s statement that the Fed would lend to investment banks, and on the same terms as to commercial banks, was the boldest step the central bank has taken so far to employ its own balance sheet to take some riskier debt off the hands of financial institutions.     The stresses in the credit markets have kept some of the Fed\'s rate-cutting efforts from filtering through to borrowers. The average rate on 30-year mortgages fell to 5.5% in December from 6.4% in July when the crisis began; but then the rate went above 6% in February, even though the Fed had been cutting short-term rates since September.     After the Fed a week ago said it would lend up to $200 billion in Treasury securities to bond dealers in return for mortgage-backed securities, mortgage rates fell to 5.74% from 6.2%, according to Bankrate.com.     Rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages above $417,000 -- until recently, the biggest that could be guaranteed by Fannie Mae and   Freddie Mac -- are higher now than in July, because banks have trouble finding investors to buy securities backed by such loans. The Fed\'s move a week ago to lend to bond dealers also knocked down rates on jumbo loans, to 7.02%.     Bank Credit Analyst, a financial research service, said a decline in rates other than those on super-safe Treasury bonds ""would be the key indication that conditions are finally improving. If that does not happen, then the Fed will be forced to consider more drastic action, including direct purchases of securities.""

61,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve\'s three-quarter-point rate cut yesterday was less than some forecasters had predicted, but it was more than some at the central bank were comfortable with. Two of the 10 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee opposed the cut, preferring ""less aggressive action,"" according to the Fed statement. Those two -- Richard Fisher of the Dallas Fed and Charles Plosser of Philadelphia -- have been warning about inflation for some time. And yesterday, the Fed did at least acknowledge in its statement that ""inflation has been elevated."" No surprise there, since the entire yield curve out to the 10-year bond currently pays less than the inflation rate. The last time the Fed cut rates below 3%, it was October 2001, oil was at $19 a barrel and falling, and a Fed Governor (now Chairman) named Ben Bernanke would soon give speeches about how to prevent a deflation. When it kept going to 1% in June 2003, the Fed created the subsidy for credit that produced the housing bubble. Nobody\'s much worried about deflation today. But the Fed is placing a heavy bet that commodity prices and other leading indicators of inflation will come down on their own, aided by a slowing economy. Yesterday\'s policy statement, while allowing that ""uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased,"" reiterates Chairman Bernanke\'s view that slower growth and lower ""resource utilization"" will bring inflation back into the Fed\'s comfort zone. Good luck with that. To the extent that the Fed has recently taken extraordinary actions, such as opening up the discount window, to reliquify troubled financial markets, it is doing what is necessary to avoid a financial meltdown. But keeping its eye on price stability is the Fed\'s main obligation. The silver lining in the Fed\'s continued accommodation to easier money yesterday is that at least two Fed Governors behaved as if they still believe that.

63,2003-01-30 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Disappointment that the Federal Reserve left interest rates and its economic-risk assessment unchanged helped drive prices of Treasurys broadly lower. Some analysts also cited coming Treasury auctions as an important factor in the selling. The Treasury is expected next week to announce sales of five- and 10-year notes. ""In general [the selloff] has not a lot to do with the Fed\'s decision, but an overhang of supply,"" said Jim Caron, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. In addition, the market was particularly vulnerable yesterday because many people had been purchasers of Treasurys because of rising international tensions, he added. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 face value, at 99 23/32. Its yield rose to 4.033% from 3.967% Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was down 24/32 point at 106 29/32 to yield 4.918%, up from 4.871% Tuesday. Most investors had expected the Fed\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to leave its interest-rate target unchanged yesterday, at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting. Still, some thought the Fed might shift its policy stance to an easing bias from neutral. When the Fed stood pat, that triggered some liquidation of so-called long positions, or trades made in expectations that prices would rise, said Paul Calvetti, head of government-securities trading at Deutsche Bank in New York. ""The neutral directive in today\'s policy statement validates the notion that the Fed expects the economy to perform well in the coming months,"" said Tony Crescenzi, chief market analyst at Miller Tabak in New York. So, ""though the Fed may have disappointed some investors by sticking with a neutral directive rather than shifting to an ease directive, the neutral directive is a bullish statement on the economy."" Among those disappointed were some people who had bought two-year notes in a Treasury auction yesterday ahead of the Fed announcement in hope of benefiting from any Treasurys-friendly outcome, analysts said. The Treasury awarded $27 billion of two-year notes at a rate of 1.710%, in line with market expectations. The results of the auction were ""respectable,"" considering that the sale took place just before the Fed announcement, said David Winter, a government-securities trader at Zions First National Bank in Jersey City, N.J. Meanwhile, the Treasurys market faces a spate of economic data today. Those include an advance report on growth in fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which is seen as having slowed to a rate of 0.6% from 4% in the third period. The fourth-quarter employment-cost index is seen up 0.9% after a third-quarter rise of 0.8%. Also crucial to the Treasurys market will be the direction of major stock indexes, analysts said. In recent months, Treasurys frequently have traded inversely to stocks as declines in stock indexes prompted flight to the relative safety of government securities. At the end of this week, if the Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index isn\'t meaningfully above 860, stocks could see another leg down, pushing Treasurys prices higher, said William Strazzullo, market strategist at State Street Global Markets in Boston.   Corporate &Junk Bonds Crown Cork &Seal Co. plans to sell $1.75 billion in senior secured notes as part of a refinancing of more than $3 billion aimed at pushing back debt maturities. It also hopes to raise an additional $325 million through a sale of convertible bonds and a debt-for-equity swap. Additionally, the company said it was in talks with banks for $1.05 billion in secured credit. Crown Cork &Seal said the package, which it hopes to complete this quarter, would replace a $2.266 billion credit facility and ""result in substantially all of the company\'s debt having stated maturities in 2006 and beyond."" Citigroup and Deutsche Bank are leading the refinancing. Backed by second and third liens, the notes to be sold include a $1.25 billion eight-year portion and $500 million 10-year part.

64,2003-10-29 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and soothed investors by repeating its inclination to keep them low for a long time, even as new reports showed business investment accelerating and consumers\' job fears easing a bit. The Fed left its target for the federal-funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks at a 45-year low of 1%, as widely expected. It also said risks to economic growth were balanced, but that it was more concerned about a fall than rise in inflation. The risk of falling inflation, which could ultimately lead to deflation, would be the ""predominant"" concern for now, the Fed said in a statement accompanying its decision. Most important, the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\'s policy-making body, reaffirmed the commitment that low interest rates could be maintained ""for a considerable period."" Chairman Alan Greenspan first made the commitment in July, and committee statements repeated it in August and September. The latest statement was almost identical to those issued the previous two months, except for a slightly more upbeat assessment of the labor market, which it said is ""stabilizing."" In September, it said the labor market was ""weakening."" The latest statement also said demand is ""firming"" and business pricing power is ""muted."" The Fed\'s cautious tone comes despite expectations that government statisticians will report tomorrow that the U.S. economy grew at a blazing 6.2% annual rate in the third quarter. The Fed is maintaining easy monetary policy in the face of such upbeat data to ensure that the expansion, after a false start last year, uses up the idle business capacity and high unemployment that are now putting downward pressure on wage and price increases. Underlying inflation is running at about 1%, at the bottom of the 1% to 2% range many Fed officials prefer. Some Fed officials have been uncomfortable with making a commitment to low rates for fear that it will be inappropriate if the economy takes off or inflation resurfaces. Indeed, reports of those concerns in The Wall Street Journal, along with upbeat economic data, had prompted some investors to expect the Fed to drop or alter the ""considerable period"" commitment. That it was repeated in yesterday\'s statement shows that most on the committee remain comfortable with the words. Furthermore, the FOMC is generally unified on rates: All 12 voting members agreed to keep the rate unchanged. The lack of any shift in language relieved some investors. Bond yields declined, stocks rallied, and futures contracts based on the federal-funds rate suggest investors pushed out their expectation about the Fed\'s first rate increase to May from March. Even that seems too early, economists at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients yesterday, given that Fed officials have stressed they don\'t need to pre-emptively tighten monetary policy as in previous expansions. Mr. Greenspan is unlikely to change the ""considerable period"" commitment until he is confident the likely resulting rise in long-term interest rates poses no threat to the expansion. The Fed hasn\'t addressed ""when and how to change the language, but that\'s for another day,"" former Fed Governor Laurence Meyer said. He predicted the central bank could drop its warning of low inflation and the ""considerable period"" language in January or March, although an actual increase in rates may not come until January, 2005. The Commerce Department yesterday said new orders for durable goods, those designed to last three or more years, rose 0.8% in September from August, the fourth increase in five months. An important category of orders, capital goods excluding defense and aircraft, soared 3.9%, the biggest increase since March. They are now up 5% from a year earlier. Business investment has been the primary source of economic weakness since the economy slid into recession in 2001 and struggled out at the end of that year. Economists and the Fed believe the expansion won\'t be assured until business investment takes the burden of growth away from consumers. Fed officials have also worried that lack of job growth this year could weigh on consumer spirits, undercutting spending and the expansion. But in recent weeks, job creation has picked up, and yesterday the Conference Board reported signs that that is lifting consumers\' spirits. The New York business research organization\'s monthly index of consumer confidence rose to 81.1 in October from 77 in September, though it remains in the same narrow range it has been in since April. In October, the proportion of surveyed consumers saying jobs are plentiful rose to 11.8%, the highest since May, from 9.9% in September. The proportion saying jobs are hard to get edged down to a still high 33.8% from 35.1%.

65,2003-10-29 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Led by short maturities, Treasurys rallied after Federal Reserve policy makers issued an assessment of economic and interest-rate prospects that was very similar to one issued in September. The Fed left its federal funds target rate unchanged at 1.0%, as expected. What did surprise investors was the fact that the Fed changed so little in the wording it used to describe the U.S. economic outlook, particularly its view that falling prices represent a riskto future growth. That phrasing sparked quick buying in Treasurys -- though much was by investors and traders rushing to reverse positions taken in expectation of a different Fed statement, analysts said. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 16/32 point, or $5 per $1,000 face value, at 100 13/32. Its yield fell to 4.198% from 4.260% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 17/32 point at 103 31/32 to yield 5.103%, down from 5.139% Monday. In its statement yesterday afternoon, the Fed\'s policy setting Federal Open Market Committee said, ""The committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future"" even though upside and downside risks for sustainable growth ""are roughly equal."" Bond investors and traders had speculated that the Fed would tone down its worries about disinflation, the slowing of price increases, to signal a subtle change in its thinking on monetary policy, in a sort of ""exit strategy"" from its current accommodative monetary-policy stance. As a result, many people had sold government securities, particularly in the short end of the market, which is the most sensitive to expectations about monetary-policy changes. ""The market had focused on an exit strategy, and in doing that, took its eye off the inflation ball,"" said William Sullivan, economist at Morgan Stanley. Once they saw the Fed statement, investors and traders scrambled to buy shorter maturities. Craig Coats, head of fixed income at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods in New York, said by citing disinflation concerns, the Fed also encouraged investors to undertake another strategy that involves borrowing funds in markets where interest rates are lower and using the money to buy Treasurys. ""People are putting carry trades back on,"" said Mr. Coats. Earlier in the session, Treasurys languished amid stronger-than-expected economic data. The government reported that orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three years or longer, rose 0.8% to $176.26 billion in September. Although the September rise was a little smaller than the 1.3% rise Wall Street had expected, actual shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose a strong 2.5%. Bear Stearns economists noted that for the third quarter as a whole, durable-goods orders increased 14.9% at an annual rate, the strongest quarterly showing since the April-June period in 2000. ""These data represent further evidence of a cyclical upswing in manufacturing,"" the economists said. ""Additionally, regional manufacturing surveys released so far for October point to an acceleration in factory activity at the start of the fourth quarter."" The Conference Board, meanwhile, reported a higher-than-expected consumer-confidence reading for October as modest improvements in the labor market buoyed optimism. The headline index rose to 81.1 from an upwardly revised 77.0 in September.   Foreign Bonds The upgrade earlier this month of Russia to investment-grade standing by Moody\'s Investors Service was justified by the country\'s ""willingness and ability"" to pay off foreign debt, said Jonathan Schiffer, Moody\'s lead analyst on Russia. The upgrade came well before the Russian government last weekend arrested OAO Yukos Chairman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, fanning renewed fears of political risk. News of the arrest hit Russian stocks and the country\'s Eurobonds. ""The consensus view is that structural reforms are moving slowly,"" Mr. Schiffer said. ""But the point is that slow movement hasn\'t undermined the government\'s willingness or ability to pay off its debt."" Moody\'s was the first of the three big international ratings firms to lift Russia\'s foreign debt ceiling to investment-grade, in a two-notch upgrade to Baa3. Standard &Poor\'s rates Russia double-B and Fitch Ratings rates it double-B-plus. Late yesterday in the U.S., Russia\'s issue due in 2030 was quoted at around 94% of face value, about the same as Monday, but down from about 95.5% Friday. --- Emily Barrett, Tom Sullivan and Sonja Ryst contributed to this article.

66,2005-12-14 00:00:00,"['The prices of Treasury securities strengthened modestly after the Federal Reserve\'s Open Market Committee raised interest rates and altered its policy statement. In a fully expected move, the FOMC raised its federal funds target to 4.25% from 4%, the 13th such increase since June 2004 when the overnight borrowing rate was 1%. In its accompanying statement, the FOMC dropped the phrase that policy remains ""accommodative."" ""They are signaling they are not too far from finishing their tightening by dropping accommodative,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. That was enough to push Treasury prices a little higher, yet the move lacked conviction, as the Fed at the same time affirmed it will continue tightening policy because of concerns about inflation. The market reaction was ""more noise than anything else,"" said Anton Pil, global head of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York, adding that investors are back to watching economic data for clues as to future policy moves. The FOMC said ""some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance."" At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 9/32 point, or $2.8125 per $1,000 face value, at 99 26/32. Its yield fell to 4.523% from 4.557% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was up 13/32 point at 109 17/32 to yield 4.723%, while the two-year note, the most sensitive to monetary policy changes, barely budged, adding 2/32 to 99 22/32 to yield 4.413%. Interest-rate futures continued to price in a further quarter-point rate increase at the January meeting of the FOMC, with opinion split as to whether the funds rate will reach 4.75% in March. Commercial banks raised their prime rate to 7.25%, further squeezing borrowers whose interest-rate payments are tied to the prime rate -- for instance, payments on certain types of home-equity loans. Mr. Pil said the FOMC is likely to raise rates to 4.75% by March and then pause at that level, when Ben Bernanke will have taken the reins from retiring Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. The spread between two-year and 10-year note yields was steady at 0.11 percentage point. Further rate increases should compress this relationship close to zero and possibly invert the yield curve, if the 10-year yield falls below that of the two-year note, Mr. Konstam of CSFB said. ""The curve typically inverts right at the end of the tightening cycle,"" he added. However, a key ingredient for pushing the yield curve into inversion would be a slower economic growth next year -- a pace below 2.5% compared with this year\'s 3.5% pace -- as the Fed continues to tighten policy, Mr. Pil said.   Emerging Markets Brazil said it will pay off loans from the International Monetary Fund two years ahead of schedule, making for the biggest single repayment to the IMF. The government said it will make a $15.46 billion early payment, directly from Brazilian foreign reserves, eliminating Brazil\'s debt with the multilateral lender by the end of the month. The move, the government said, reflects the strength of Latin America\'s biggest economy. According to Finance Minister Antonio Palocci, owing to the early payments, Brazil will save some $900 million in interest expense in 2006 and 2007. Mr. Palocci said Brazil expects to continue ""close and friendly"" relations with the IMF. Risk premiums on Brazil dollar-denominated debt tightened on the news, narrowing 0.10 percentage point to 3.07 percentage points over comparable U.S. Treasurys on the J.P.

67,2004-07-01 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve began the long climb back from a historic period of cheap money by raising its target for short-term interest rates to 1.25% from 1%. In a statement, the Fed suggested it will continue to raise the federal-funds rate a quarter-point at a time, saying it can move ""at a pace that is likely to be measured."" But it included a caveat that policy makers ""will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."" That is a warning that the central bank is apt to move to half-percentage-point increases if inflation accelerates. Both the rate increase and accompanying statement were largely as markets expected, thanks to an unprecedented Fed effort to telegraph its plans over recent months and minimize any shock to the markets. It succeeded: Stock and bond prices barely reacted in the first half-hour after the announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 17 points just before the announcement, finished the day up 22.05 points at 10435.48. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a benchmark for long-term borrowing, stood at 4.63% just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, then rallied late in the day to end at 4.59%, down from Tuesday\'s close of 4.69%. The Fed\'s action was as surprising as getting ""a tie for Father\'s Day,"" UBS AG trader Art Cashin said on CNBC. The Fed noted that recent inflation readings were ""somewhat elevated"" but added that ""a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors."" It said risks to economic growth and inflation in coming months are balanced. ""Output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor-market conditions have improved,"" it said. All 12 voting members of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee backed the increase in the federal funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. In a related move, the central bank also raised its discount rate, charged on its short-term advances to commercial banks, by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%, acting on requests from all 12 reserve banks. Several commercial banks responded by raising their prime lending rate, the benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 4.25% from 4%. Before long, the Fed\'s rate increase should start rippling through to credit-card rates, adjustable-rate mortgages and, for savers, to money-market account yields and CD rates. But for many businesses and consumers, borrowing costs started to rise in April when investors began to anticipate the Fed\'s move to tighter monetary policy. Although bond yields fell yesterday, they are up almost a percentage point from their March lows. Mortgage rates and corporate-bond rates have followed suit. As a result, applications to refinance mortgages -- a major source of extra spending cash in recent years -- have fallen by about three-quarters since March. However, applications to purchase homes, though down a bit from May, remain well above last year\'s levels. Economists consider a ""neutral"" funds rate -- which neither stimulates nor restrains the economy -- to be between 3% and 5%. Investors expect the funds rate to reach 2.25% by the end of this year, and 3.75% by the end of 2005. Having restated its plans to be ""measured,"" the Fed likely will be reluctant to raise rates more than a quarter-point at its next meeting on Aug. 10. Fed officials believe the credibility of their communications strategy depends on matching their words with actions. Abandoning ""measured"" rate increases right after reiterating the policy, even with a caveat, could weaken that credibility. But officials also realize that with inflation near the top of the 1%-to-2% inflation zone they informally define as price stability, they have less margin for error than they hoped for a few months ago. The 12-month inflation rate, by the Fed\'s preferred measure, excluding the more volatile food and energy components, jumped unexpectedly quickly from January to May, to 1.6% from 1.1%. Moreover it is running at a 2.3% annual rate in the last six months. (Inflation as measured by the better-known Consumer Price Index, including food and energy components, is running at 3.1% in the 12 months through May.) Indeed, by noting yesterday that a ""portion"" of the increase in inflation was transitory -- a likely reference to higher commodity prices, which have eased a bit lately -- the Fed implied a portion also reflected changed economic fundamentals, such as job and wage growth. Since the funds rate has a long way to go to reach neutral, the Fed would have to quickly switch to more aggressive rate increases if it discovered it has been too sanguine about inflation. ""We\'re one bad inflation number away"" from the Fed having to raise interest rates by one-half a percentage point in August, instead of a quarter-point, said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. The Fed last raised the funds rate in May 2000, to 6.5%, to cool an economic boom fueled by a bubble in stocks and technology investment spending. Over the next three years it cut the rate 13 times to 1%, the lowest since 1958, first in response to those bursting bubbles, then to a wave of corporate-accounting and governance scandals and the build-up to the Iraq war, which restrained business confidence. As those traumas subsided and job creation took off in March after a year of stagnation, the case for easy policy rapidly melted away. Some critics worry the Fed has waited too long. The funds rate has been below the annual inflation rate for 20 straight months. That\'s the longest such stretch of negative ""real"" interest rates since 1974-76, a period in which the Fed is now widely acknowledged to have been too lax, leading to the double-digit inflation of that era. The real funds rate has averaged 1.8% since 1954. Throughout the Fed, a growing number of people have been fretting over these developments. Last month, the Cleveland Fed\'s research director, Mark Sniderman, published alternative lyrics to Bob Dylan\'s ""The Times They Are a-Changin\' "" in a bank publication, titled, ""The Rates They Are A-changin\'."" They began: ""Come gather \'round people wherever you roam/Recognize that inflation around you has grown."" The Fed may get some extra breathing room from signs that economic growth slowed a bit in the last two months, such as an unexpected slowing in manufacturing activity in the Chicago area, according to a purchasing managers\' report yesterday. Still, former Fed governor Laurence Meyer said he doubts the economy will slow enough to prevent an August rate increase. It\'s more likely, he said, that an inflation scare will put a half-point increase on the table. He noted that growth has slowed while job gains have accelerated, which means growth in productivity is slowing and labor costs accelerating -- a trend Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is watching closely. Anecdotal information also points to continued upward pressure on prices: In May, 28% of restaurants identified rising food costs as their top challenge, up from 22% in April, according to a survey released by the National Restaurant Association yesterday. If the choice between quarter-point and half-point moves is close, election considerations may tip the Fed toward the smaller move, Mr. Meyer said. Fed officials have historically tried to lower their profile in the run-up to elections to avoid being drawn into controversy. In a recent study, New York Fed economist Rebecca Hellerstein looked at FOMC members\' votes from 1973 to 1994, and concluded there is a ""dead spot"" in the year before presidential elections in which FOMC members are 12% less likely to vote to raise rates for a given forecast of the economy. Both parties have begun spinning higher interest rates in their favor -- Republicans as evidence of a healthy economic recovery, Democrats as evidence that President Bush\'s large budget deficits are driving up the cost of borrowing. But neither Mr. Bush nor his Democratic challenger, Sen. John Kerry, is likely to criticize the Fed itself. Mr. Bush just reappointed the 78-year-old Mr. Greenspan to a fifth term. Mr. Kerry backed that decision.

68,2004-07-01 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve\'s first rate hike in more than four years proved to be anticlimactic for financial markets, as it was about as well-advertised as these things can be. The Fed\'s move was anything but trivial, however, as it kicked off a policy transition that gradually will end the Fed\'s sustained stimulus that began back in 2001. There are good reasons to anticipate a relatively muted investor response, however: Market prices already anticipate that short-term interest rates will be pushed back to more normal levels over the coming year. In contrast, the Fed\'s previous policy tightening, in 1994, triggered a massive global bond selloff, as investors were surprised repeatedly by Fed actions in response to an unexpectedly robust economic expansion. --- The market\'s uneventful response to the Fed\'s rate increase makes it easy to miss the key implications of recent developments. In broad terms, the power of monetary policy action to combine both long-term inflation goals with short-term stabilization tasks has been confirmed, even in the context of globalized and deregulated financial markets -- and a series of unusual shocks. It\'s easy to forget that only one year ago, the threat of deflation was judged widely to represent the United States\' most immediate economic danger. In fact, many analysts and investors predicted at that time that the Federal Reserve was about to conduct ""unconventional"" policy easing -- that is, buying securities directly from private investors -- something that had been attempted only once, when the Fed pegged all interest rates during World War II. It didn\'t happen last year, but the worries about low inflation weren\'t illusory -- the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) chain price index dipped below 1% last winter on a rolling 12-month basis for the first time since the measure\'s inception in 1959. From today\'s vantage point, the U.S. economy\'s renewed economic vigor is a reminder that monetary policy remains a potent short-term stabilization tool. Not only were deflation worries building a year ago, but many expressed concern that Fed policy would be inadequate to overcome the allegedly irresistible contractionary impact of the late 1990s economic and financial imbalances. The classic skeptics\' image of the Fed pushing on a string once again became cliche. Nonetheless, the current U.S. upturn overcame a series of shocks as potentially threatening as those of the late 1920s. The restoration of robust U.S. growth while avoiding deflation should not obscure the Fed\'s success in reaching its key long-term goal of price stability. Twenty-five years after the Federal Reserve -- under Chairman Paul Volcker -- administered draconian rate hikes to combat double-digit inflation, Alan Greenspan was able to describe the U.S. economy as having entered a ""zone of price stability."" Over most of the intervening span, Fed policy could be described as one of ""opportunistic disinflation."" That is, the Fed didn\'t set out to create downturns. However, when slumps occurred -- thereby ratcheting down inflation -- the Fed would act preemptively to hold onto the inflation gains. In practice, this sustained strategy eventually achieved price stability amidst two long economic booms and an unprecedented bull market in financial assets. Of course, the Fed had no intention of triggering a recession when it tightened cautiously in 1999 and early 2000. In that sense, the 2001 economic downturn was an accident. Presumably, the Fed would not have tightened at that time had policy makers known what was coming. Nonetheless, the result was the final step to price stability, as the economy contracted in 2001, Thus, the Fed\'s task has become one of preserving -- not establishing -- low inflation. By implication, a new policy approach will be needed to supplant opportunistic disinflation. For now, the Fed is on a path to end its current stimulus by renormalizing short-term interest rates. Despite claims by some observers that the Fed has waited too long to begin tightening, the Fed\'s move yesterday marks one of the earliest ever undertaken, when judged using the factors that typically guide such actions, including the current inflation rate and the likely margin of excess capacity. For example, the Fed rarely has begun to withdraw its stimulus before employment has returned to its pre-slowdown peak. Today, however, total employment is 1.3 million lower than at the recession\'s onset in early 2001. In other words, Fed officials appear to be intent on preserving price stability, now that it has been attained. The FOMC\'s policy statement made it clear that the Fed ""will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."" Investors may be confused about the Fed\'s intentions, because the earlier cut in the Fed funds rate to 1% was unprecedented. However, the funds rate is no more stimulative today than in other, similar periods when judged in real (that is, inflation-adjusted) terms. For example, today\'s 1.25% nominal funds rate -- with the year-on-year increase in the Fed\'s favored core PCE price index at 1.5% -- is no lower in real terms than the 3% funds rate was a decade ago when inflation was close to 3%. Presumably, the Fed\'s aim is to withdraw its stimulus at a pace that will return short-term interest rates to neutral by the time the economy reaches full employment. That likely will require the funds rate to be raised to around 4%. Even if it takes a year or more to reach that point, the persistence of substantial slack in the economy ought to keep inflation in check. Gradual Fed tightening well ahead of schedule signals that the central bank is moving its sights back to its primary long-term goal of price stability. In practice this is likely to mean keeping inflation in the 1% to 2% band for year-on-year increases in the core PCE deflator that has been maintained since 1996. Although the Fed has never acknowledged any specific target range, by implication a sustained 1% to 2% year-on-year increase in core inflation would represent a fair approximation. Such an outcome likely would match the Fed\'s fundamental goal of keeping inflation low enough that it does not distort investment decisions. If the Fed is successful in allowing the economy to return to full employment while maintaining price stability, the result will be a positive surprise for investors. Although financial market participants appear to have assumed that the Fed will be tolerant if inflation rises into at least a 2% to 3% range -- a conclusion that is consistent with surveys of inflation expectations -- the Fed\'s early transition back to normal short-term rates contradicts that claim. Securing price stability therefore will establish a constructive backdrop for financial assets. Obviously, equity investors are nervous about the prospect of higher Fed interest rates. However, vigorous noninflationary growth creates a more positive environment for corporate earnings than the slower growth that originally motivated the Fed to lower interest rates to emergency levels. Naturally, long-term interest rates would be expected to rise as the economy improves, but long-term rates have climbed significantly in anticipation of Fed tightening. In this context, the Fed\'s resolve to maintain price stability is the best way to keep bond yields relatively low. --- Mr. Lipsky is chief economist, and Mr. Glassman senior economist, at JP Morgan.

69,2000-11-16 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Bond prices rallied, even as Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, amid growing signs the U.S. economy is slowing. Investors have begun to bet that the Fed\'s next move will be to lower rates, as long as the economy keeps cooling off.    In late trading, the 10-year Treasury note rose 11/32, or $3.438 for a bond with $1,000 face value, at 100 7/32. The bond\'s yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 5.702%. The price of 30-year Treasury bonds rose 23/32, to yield 5.765%, while two-year notes was unchanged at 5.885%.    The Fed left the fed-funds rate, or its target Fed funds overnight interbank rate, at 6.5%, and also kept in place it bias toward a ""risk of heightened inflation pressures"" and the higher interest rates that would be needed to fight such pressures.    The Fed\'s decision was widely anticipated, but while some investors were disappointed the Fed kept its so-called bias tilted in favor of further rate increases others took heart by the wording in the Fed\'s statement accompanying its announcements, figuring the chances for a rate cut down the line had been raised.    In its statement, the Fed acknowledged softer ""business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets"" over recent months, and said those factors ""suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce.""    ""The FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] now recognizes that the economy is growing below the speed limit, and it also recognizes the risks of a greater slowdown,"" says Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, adding, ""If signs of slowing growth continue and if the labor market begins to loosen up a bit in the next month, we could well see a shift to neutral at the Dec. 19 meeting.""    ""They opened the door"" toward a neutral stance on rates, agreed Henry Wilmore, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York, adding, ""They\'ll probably do it in the first half of next year, though lowering rates might be in the second half of the year.""    The federal-funds futures contract for February traded at a yield of 6.43% late yesterday, unchanged on the day. That suggests about a 30% chance that the Fed will lower rates by the end of February, according to traders.    The little-changed outlook for Fed policy makers helped push the yield curve, or the plot of yields compared with maturities in the Treasury market, into a flatter, or more inverted, position.    Traders said the yield-curve flattening was a reversal of steepening trades that had been put on by speculative traders in recent days, in bets that the Fed would somehow alter its outlook for interest rates.    Treasurys across the yield curve got a further modest boost after weaker-than-expected U.S. industrial production data were released at 9:15 a.m. EST, showing output declined 0.1% in October. An afternoon downturn in stocks also was seen as a supportive factor for bonds.    Some traders pointed to a troubling announcement by two big banks, Bank of America Corp. and First Union Corp., that it may classify sizable loans to a single borrower as nonperforming. The move, and a fall in shares of many banks yesterday, could suggest problems below the economy\'s surface that will soon appear. If such problems emerge, it could reduce pressures on inflation, loosen the labor market and encourage the Fed to lower rates.    Indeed, some traders said the Treasury market, which has been strong in the past two days, has more room to rally.    ""A lot of money managers have cash to put to work, and there\'s not a lot of hope for stocks right now,"" said Michael McGlone, market analyst, Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. ""I like the momentum in the market.""    While the primary arena of the investment-grade corporate-bond market was flush with fresh supply, the secondary market remained directionless, with uncertainty weighing on investors\' minds.    Yield spreads to Treasurys ended weaker, with the bank sector hardest hit on the back of concerns over loans by First Union and Bank of America to a company, widely believed to be Sunbeam Corp.    Levels on bonds of Bank of America and First Union gapped wider by as much as 0.20 percentage point during the session, traders said.    The broader market was marginally weaker, but it largely shrugged off the Fed\'s decision to leave interest rates and its bias unchanged, which market observers expected.    In the primary arena, Brooklyn, N.Y.-based utility KeySpan Corp. sold $1.65 billion of debt in three parts.    The $700 million five-year notes were priced at a yield margin of 1.60 percentage points over Treasurys, the $700 million 10-year at 1.90 over Treasurys and $250 million of 30-year debt at 2.15 over Treasurys.    The offering was multiple times oversubscribed, which reflects investors\' preference to stick to high-quality credits in defensive sectors, said Bob LoBue, head of North American high-grade debt syndicate at J.P. Morgan Securities, the book runner on KeySpan\'s deal.    Capital One Bank brought a $1.25 billion offering of asset-backed credit-card securities with some unusual features. Although planned at $750 million, the issue was increased in size because of strong investor demand, said an official at lead manager Chase Securities.    One unusual aspect was a swap transaction in which the issuer exchanged floating-rate for fixed-rate debt. Usually, a seller of fixed-rate debt looks to swap into floating.    A Chase official said in the current market climate, Capital One found it could sell floating-rate notes at more favorable terms.    Alex Roever, head of ABS research as Banc One Capital Markets, which was one of the co-managers, said the swap transaction was included in the issuing trust in accord with requirements of the new accounting standard FASB 133, which deals with gain on sale accounting.    Mr. Roever said the pricing of the three-year triple-A-rated notes was quite good at a spread of 0.10 percentage point over the one-month London interbank offered rate. He noted that last week, a similar transaction from Providian Bank commanded a spread of 0.12 percentage point over Libor.    ---    Shella Calamba and David Feldheim contributed to this article.

70,2008-01-31 00:00:00,"['The euro shot up to a new two-week high against the dollar, within reach of its historical record, after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark lending rate by a half percentage point, and ended with a record close.    The euro intraday passed $1.4900 -- an important technical barrier, just more than a half cent shy of its highest-ever $1.4968, reached intraday Nov. 23, 2007. The common currency rose as high as $1.4910 in the aftermath of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision.    The dollar bounced up and down in a narrow range against the yen in the aftermath of the widely expected decision, in step with volatile equity performance.    The Fed\'s overnight target rate now stands at 3%.    ""While the dollar is down against the euro and the yen, and a return to recent lows remains on the cards, it has proved reasonably resilient considering the 125 [basis points] of Fed cuts in the last [eight] days. A slower pace of Fed easing going forward should prove a less challenging environment for the buck,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co. in New York.    Yesterday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.4882 -- a closing record -- from $1.4773 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 106.43 yen from 107.08 yen. The euro was at 158.39 yen from 158.19 yen. The British pound was at $1.9912 from $1.9896, while the dollar was at 1.0832 Swiss francs from 1.0929 Swiss francs late Tuesday.    Last week, the Fed enacted an emergency between-meeting rate cut of three-quarters of a point.    In the statement accompanying the FOMC\'s latest decision, Fed officials signaled they are willing to ease still further in coming weeks, although they did suggest that the cumulative 2.25 points of policy easing over the past four months may be enough to keep the economy on track.    Gross domestic product rose at a seasonally adjusted 0.6% annual rate in October through December, the Commerce Department said yesterday in its first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. The estimate was below the third quarter\'s racing 4.9% growth and economists\' expectations for a 1.2% fourth-quarter increase.    Just prior to that, payrolls titan  Automatic Data Processing Inc. and consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers released a strong labor report that showed U.S. private-sector jobs jumped by 130,000 in January, beating forecasts by big margins.    The net effect of the conflicting reports on the dollar was range-bound trading, especially before the Fed\'s decision.    The job report is a precursor to tomorrow\'s government report on job creation in January. Economists are forecasting nonfarm-payroll growth of 63,000, compared with a slight increase of 18,000 in December.    Overnight, expectations of a FOMC rate cut helped lift the British pound to a fresh high for the year above $1.9950, leaving it poised to reach the psychological $2.00 mark.    ---    Dan Moliski contributed to this article.

71,2008-01-31 00:00:00,"['Seeking to nip an incipient recession in the bud, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time in nine days, in one of its most aggressive campaigns in decades to boost the nation\'s economy.    The Fed lowered its target for short-term interest rates by 0.5 percentage point to 3% yesterday, and left the door open to further cuts.    In its statement accompanying the move, the Fed said ""downside risks to growth remain,"" and that the central bank would ""act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks."" Investors widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark rate again in March by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75%.    Yesterday\'s rate cut comes as the latest news suggests the economy continues to skirt recession despite a steep slump in housing and the continuing credit crunch, but financial markets remain fragile.    Stocks rose on news of the cut, which some investors had expected to be smaller, but the market tumbled late in the day after a downgrade of Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. by Fitch Ratings intensified worries about the credit ratings of bond insurers, which insure about $2.4 trillion of debt. Such downgrades could leave banks exposed to additional losses on the mortgage-backed debt they hold, further eroding their capital and limiting their ability to lend.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up as much as 201 points after the Fed announcement, ended the day down 37.47 points at 12442.83.    The government reported yesterday that the economy grew at a slower-than-expected 0.6% annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2007. Most of the weakness stemmed from companies trimming inventories, which makes future production cuts less likely. Consumer spending slowed, though to a still-respectable pace.    A private payroll survey also found employment jumped in January. That led some economists to expect the Labor Department tomorrow to report robust job growth for the month, after a slump in December.    Last week, on the heels of a global stock selloff, the Fed made a surprise 0.75-percentage-point cut in its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. That it went ahead with yesterday\'s rate cut despite some encouraging economic data underlines its worries that slumping housing prices and associated losses on mortgages could yet drag the entire economy down. The Fed\'s 2.25 percentage points in rate reductions since September roughly equal the initial pace of cuts in early 2001 -- following the bursting of the tech bubble -- as the most rapid in two decades.    The big question now facing the Fed is whether it has done enough. Officials yesterday signaled continuing concerns about growth.    ""Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households,"" the Fed said in its statement. ""Recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets,"" it added, echoing previous comments. But yesterday\'s statement also dialed back the sense of urgency, dropping the ""appreciable"" from what it said last Tuesday were ""appreciable downside risks to growth.""    The latest statement included a reminder of how much the Fed has done to date: ""Today\'s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.""    Some analysts took that to mean the Fed doesn\'t expect to cut rates as low as 2.25%, as markets currently anticipate. ""While the Fed certainly left the door open for further action, the policy assessment did seem to tilt toward reining in expectations of significant additional action,""  Morgan Stanley economist Dave Greenlaw said in a note to clients.    But Tom Gallagher, an analyst at brokerage ISI Group, said, ""You can\'t be confident the Fed is done until you feel the market has a good handle on the extent of the financial crisis,"" which it clearly hasn\'t yet.    Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who celebrates his second anniversary in the job tomorrow, now faces a delicate challenge. If his policy is successful, the economy will escape recession, few additional rate cuts will be needed and, paradoxically, his actions to date may end up looking excessive.    ""If we end up worrying about inflation later this year that could well be the good outcome for the Fed because odds are it will mean that the economy has stabilized,"" said Peter Fisher, a former Fed official who is now co-head of fixed income for money manager  BlackRock Inc. ""It may end up looking like the pre-emptive easing was unnecessary . . . but that\'s the point of taking out insurance against the downside.""    If so, that would require the Fed to quickly reverse some of its rate cuts. ""They acted aggressively on the way down; that suggests they\'ll act as aggressively on the way up,"" said Vincent Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer now at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.    But the Fed, like most of Wall Street, has already been fooled by several false dawns since the current credit crisis began in August. That means it\'s unlikely to sound the all-clear while financial markets remain jittery and credit markets remain tight. Yesterday\'s statement, while less dire than last Tuesday\'s, made it clear the next Fed move is far likelier to be a rate cut than an increase.    Until this month, the Fed had expected the troubles in housing and mortgage markets wouldn\'t spill over to the broader economy, and that inflation pressures would continue to percolate. That led it to release statements that continued to play up the risks of inflation, implying that rates might not fall much more.    That changed in January with news that consumer spending, employment and manufacturing activity had all downshifted. Concerns in the financial markets grew, as signified by the sharp drop in stocks at the start of the year.    The possibility that falling house prices will lead to more defaults and foreclosures, loss of bank capital, tighter lending and yet further declines in prices is now Mr. Bernanke\'s dominant concern. Yesterday afternoon, rating firm  Standard & Poor\'s downgraded or threatened to downgrade more than 8,000 mortgage investments.    Mortgage rates have dropped in the past month, and that has enabled many borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages either to refinance into fixed-rate mortgages or see their current mortgages adjust to rates one to two percentage points lower than would have been the case several months ago, says Doug Duncan, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. He said while that means foreclosures may be less than expected, the drop in home prices means many borrowers will be unable to take advantage of lower rates, limiting the benefit.    If home prices fall 10%, a mortgage that was originally 95% of the home\'s value is now about 105%, and ""you may be required to bring some equity to the table in order to refinance,"" Mr. Duncan said.    Yesterday, many commercial banks responded to the Fed\'s action by lowering their prime rate, a benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 6% from 6.5%. But long-term bond yields rose in anticipation that the rate cut would boost growth and the risk of inflation. That could lead to higher, rather than lower, mortgage rates in coming weeks.    Both last week\'s and yesterday\'s Fed statements played down concerns about inflation. The Fed ""expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.""    That view isn\'t universally shared at the Fed. Nine of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s 10 voting members approved yesterday\'s rate cut; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher dissented, arguing for no cut. Three of the Fed\'s 12 reserve banks didn\'t ask for a corresponding half-point reduction in the discount rate, charged on direct Fed loans to banks, to 3.5%.    Indeed, in the past few weeks, expectations for inflation a few years from now, as measured by the behavior of Treasury-protected bonds, have risen by a quarter percentage point.    While Mr. Bernanke won\'t welcome that, he will likely conclude that the weaker economy he now expects, together with stable to lower energy prices, will help suppress those inflation pressures.

He gets in his race car and accelerates right through the curve. With yesterday\'s 50 basis point interest rate cut, following last week\'s 75 point emergency reduction, we are certainly off to the monetary races.    Readers of these columns know we prefer more careful driving by the Fed, and judging from yesterday so do the markets. The long bond fell more than a percentage point, while every other economic indicator that signals a weaker dollar and higher inflation also rose. Gold hit $942 an ounce, and the dollar fell ever closer to 1.5 euros. But the most intriguing reaction came in equities, which typically cheer a Fed rate cut, but this time sold off on the Fed news.    Perhaps they were reacting to the Fed\'s statement that accompanied the rate cut, which suggested the central bankers stood ready to ease even further if events require. Or perhaps they noticed the jolting inflation numbers in yesterday\'s fourth-quarter GDP report, which had the core price deflator (not counting food or energy) rising by 2.7%, which is well above the 1% to 2% level that the Fed says is (or at least was) its comfort zone.    No worries, added the Fed statement, because, ""The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters."" We hope it\'s not impolite to point out that this is precisely what the Fed was saying a year ago. Perhaps we need to recheck the definition of ""moderate.""    The Fed is trying to forestall a recession, and what it fears would be the cascading impact of job losses on top of the credit crunch on top of the housing crash. And we\'ll admit Mr. Bernanke is in a fix, partly of the Fed\'s own making. Yesterday\'s report of 0.6% fourth quarter growth was disappointing, though some of the decline was attributable to inventory drawdowns that could be made up this year. In other words, a recession is far from a sure bet.    Mr. Bernanke\'s calculation seems to be that by easing now he can help the financial system ride out the current storm, and then the Fed can pull back on the throttle later this year if growth re-accelerates -- with no harm done. We hope he knows what he\'s doing, but our advice is that everyone bring a crash helmet in case he misses a turn.

Light, sweet crude for March delivery rose 69 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $92.33 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. This is the fifth consecutive rise for the front-month contract.    Crude\'s rally began Jan. 24, two days after the Fed orchestrated an emergency three-quarter percentage-point reduction in its benchmark interest rate in the face of a troubling U.S. economic outlook. In cutting its federal funds target rate by another half-percentage point to 3% yesterday, the U.S. central bank signaled it is willing to trim more as necessary.    ""The language is all positive,"" said Tom Bentz, a broker and analyst at  BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York. ""It\'s just adding to the upside potential of the oil markets right now.""    Amid concerns an economic slowdown would chill oil demand, Nymex oil futures have eased back from their $100 highs earlier this month. The Fed\'s moves in the last two weeks have since raised hopes that the U.S. may steer clear of a recession.    ""The view is if lower interest rates can help boost the economy in any way, it\'s going to be reflected in more energy demand,"" Mr. Bentz said.    Oil markets rose despite U.S. data released earlier yesterday showing crude and gasoline stockpiles grew more than expected last week.    U.S. and global oil inventories are likely to figure into discussions among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries delegates when they meet in Vienna tomorrow. OPEC President Chakib Khelil said the group would make the right output decision based on a weakening global economy and second-quarter demand, as well as healthy oil stockpiles.    ""Right now, stocks are at a good level and second-quarter demand is going to be lower and the economy is not doing so well so I think OPEC is going to make the appropriate decision,"" Mr. Khelil said.    The oil minister of Saudi Arabia, Ali Naimi, called current global oil market fundamental forces ""sound,"" offering little indication that the OPEC will alter production tomorrow.

74,2002-05-08 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Market watchers were holding their breath, hoping against all hope that stocks would actually be able to hold on to some of the sharp gains made in the session. But that was not to be. After climbing more than 110 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to finish the session just north of the baseline while the Nasdaq Composite Index ricocheted back and forth before settling in negative territory. It was a game of wait-and-see for much of the session on Wall Street as traders kept a close eye on what the Federal Reserve would say about interest rates and the economy. But it turns out the Fed\'s decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 1.75% and its continued cautious stance on the state of the economy could have been a replay from the last meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee maintained its balanced risk assessment and said that the economy has received an upward impetus due to the swing in inventory investment. But final demand continues to be an uncertainty for the economy. Many market watchers said the Fed\'s decision, while positive, was a nonevent for the market and wouldn\'t provide the catalyst needed to boost the indexes out of their funk. ""There had been a bunch of people waiting for Godot in waiting for the FOMC\'s decision,"" said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James. ""But what we\'re seeing is that the strength we have seen in the economy of late was due to an inventory buildup and final demand is still questionable going forward. We\'re not going to double-dip but I think we\'re seeing that recovery will be muted."" But Mr. Saut added that while indications are for a muted recovery, prices for stocks in the aggregate continued to trade at levels suitable for a sharp rebound. For that reason, investors continued to advocate being conservative and as the session wound up, conservative trading turned more to jittery trading, with the Dow closing up 28.51 points, or 0.29%, to 9836.55 while the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 4.66 points, or 0.3%, to 1573.82 and the Standard & Poor\'s 500 Index dropped 3.18, or 0.3%, to 1049.49. The NYSE Composite Index closed at 565.35, down 2.33, or 0.41%. Mr. Saut said some of the jitters, particularly among technology issues, came in anticipation of Cisco Systems\' fiscal third-quarter earnings that were released after the closing bell. Cisco had been trading higher for most of the session as rumors circulated that the company would beat analyst estimates. As it turns out, there was some basis to those rumors. The stock closed up 19 cents to 13.08. After the bell, the company reported third-quarter earnings, before items of 11 cents a share, two cents better than estimates. Blue chips buoyed the Dow yesterday. Honeywell International was the strongest performer on the Dow, rising 1.80, or 5%, to 37.80. Analysts said investors were bidding up shares of Honeywell due to its relatively cheap valuation, as well as the belief that conglomerates might react favorably to the Fed\'s decision to leave interest rates unchanged. United Technologies also was seen benefiting from continued low interest rates due to its economically sensitive businesses. United Technologies gained 81 cents to 68.15. While unchanged interest rates may have played a role in the strength of some conglomerates, it didn\'t do much for others. General Electric fell 32 cents to 30.65 and the much-beaten-down Tyco continued to trail lower, down 35 cents to 19. International Business Machines was active among the Dow 30, although its strength seemed to defy some discouraging words by Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano. He delivered a gloomy outlook for technology spending to employees late last month and suggested there will have to be cost-cutting by Big Blue to adjust to the sluggishness, The Wall Street Journal reported. Still, IBM managed to rise 50 cents to 76.50. The newly merged Hewlett-Packard climbed as the company boasted that it and recently acquired Compaq Computer won $5.3 billion in new contracts in the three months leading up to the deal\'s completion. The announcement yesterday came as the combined company\'s management teams and continuing product lines were presented to employees and customers. H-P gained 19 cents to 18.41. Microsoft was another winner among blue-chip names. The software giant closed higher on word that it offered to buy Danish software company Navision for $1.3 billion. The move would be a significant step into the European enterprise resource planning, or ERP, market for Microsoft. Microsoft rose 85 cents to 49.47. A number of independent power producers were dragged lower as the specter of Enron continued to wreak havoc on the market. News that Enron may have artificially inflated California power prices last year cast doubt on the sector as a whole and investors were not willing to give companies active in the California market the benefit of the doubt. Among the decliners, Williams dropped 1.61, or 8.7%, to 16.90, Dynegy fell 2.59, or 17%, to 12.26 and Mirant shed 1.34, or 12%, to 9.75. Shares of communications chip maker Broadcom also were under pressure on word that one of its customers, Motorola, penned a deal with Broadcom\'s rival Texas Instruments. Motorola announced that it selected Texas Instruments to power its newest cable modem product. Broadcom\'s stock fell 5.22, or 17%, to 24.72 on concerns that if Texas Instruments managed to get all of Broadcom\'s Motorola business, that would have an 8% to 9% impact on Broadcom\'s revenue. Motorola rose 25 cents to 14.69 while Texas Instruments fell four cents to 27.51. Xerox continued to struggle with more worries after Merrill Lynch analyst Shannon Cross downgraded the stock\'s near-term rating to neutral from buy. The analyst said the stock should continue to trade sideways for awhile as the market grapples with the renegotiation of Xerox\'s $7 billion revolver, as well as the filing of its restated financials from 1997 through 2000 and its 2001 10K and first quarter of 2002 results. Xerox shares tumbled 22 cents to 7.50. Insurance company Metlife helped keep the insurance sector among the top decliners of the session. The company reported first-quarter earnings, before items, of 61 cents, three cents better than expectations. But on its conference call, Metlife said its individual business remains under pressure with flat top-line premium growth. In addition, the company said while it expects to cut operating expenses by $200 million in its individual business, it sees increased costs of about $60 million related to its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Metlife shed 2.29, or 6.7%, to 31.86. Providian Financial shares climbed higher after analysts increased their 2002 earnings estimates for the company following the news that the credit-card issuer beat first-quarter estimates and was selling some of its high-risk assets. Providian reported first-quarter continuing operations earnings of two cents a share, above the average analyst estimate of a loss. The stock closed up 54 cents, or 8.5%, to 6.89. Apparel retailers were also strong, aided by AnnTaylor Stores. Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to overweight from equal-weight, citing a strong summer line and the possibility of stronger same-store sales comparisons, as well as higher earnings.

75,2002-05-08 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Treasurys, led by short maturities, rose modestly, as a day filled with economic data, Treasury auctions and a Federal Reserve policy meeting ultimately couldn\'t push the market out of its recent trading range. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 6/32 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 face value, to 98 22/32. Its yield fell to 5.046% from 5.073% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price also gained 6/32 point, to 97 24/32, for a yield at 5.530%, down from 5.545% Monday. The Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its target for the federal-funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% and signaled that it isn\'t inclined to raise that overnight-lending benchmark for a while. In a statement, policy makers cited concern that the rebound is still tentative and could run out of steam. ""The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee confirms that economic activity has been receiving considerable upward impetus from a marked swing in inventory investment,"" the Fed panel said. ""Nonetheless, the degree of strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" Bonds reacted little, but already had recovered from early losses. The rebound came as many who had sold Treasurys before the five-year Treasury-note auction made offsetting purchases in expectation of the Fed decision. ""The decision from the Fed had been so widely expected for so long that we didn\'t see much reaction after the fact,"" said Vince Boberski, managing director at RBC Dain Rauscher in Chicago. As part of its quarterly refunding, Treasury sold $22 billion in new five-year notes, a record in the maturity. It will sell $11 billion of 10-year notes today, reopening an issue originally auctioned in February. The five-year note auction was awarded at 4.375%, in line with gray-market trading levels just before. When the jumbo offering came in as expected, it quelled some fears that the auction would send the market into a tailspin. ""At the last minute, people were able to get the auction where they wanted it to be, and that made for a good buying opportunity,"" said Donald Galante, government strategist at Mizuho Securities in Princeton, N.J. Analysts said that recently, five- and 10-year notes had lagged behind a rally in two-year and shorter maturities. That was because of trades that involved selling longer-dated issues and buying short-dated ones, as expectations for near-term Fed rate increases have diminished. Thus, the five- and 10-year notes being sold this week ""look cheap vs. twos and other short instruments,"" said Gemma Wright, head of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York. ""That is helping to lure investors."" It may bode well for the 10-year note auction today, analysts said. In when-issued trading -- where dealers trade ahead of the auction -- the 10-year note was fetching 5.06%. Early in the day, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity surged 8.6% in the first quarter, well-above market expectations of 7%, and the fastest rate in 19 years. But the bond market reacted with ambivalence, as people were mostly focusing on the five-year note auction later. The productivity report is ""good news for corporate profitability, but it will take some time before we see the results in terms of better corporate earnings,"" said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley.  Corporate and Junk Bonds Investment-grade and junk bonds weakened, even though the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged. Investors cited varied concerns, ranging from continued fallout from Enron\'s collapse to worries about whether some companies can maintain access to capital. ""The price of money isn\'t the problem so much as the question, `Can companies roll their debts?\' "" said Vic Thompson, director of global capital markets at State Street Global Advisors. In new issues, Western Resources Inc. sold $765 million of five-year notes under Rule 144a via Salomon Smith Barney. A secured, $365 million part was priced to yield 3.42 percentage points over Treasurys, or 7.875%. It is rated Ba1 by Moody\'s Investors Service and triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor\'s. An unsecured, $400 million part was priced to yield 5.29 percentage points over Treasurys, or 9.75%. Ratings are Ba2 by Moody\'s and double-B-minus by S&P.

76,1989-02-09 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar finished lower after a second day of narrow fluctuations, inhibited by uncertainty about President Bush\'s budget, concern about interest rates, and fear of central bank intervention. In thin trading, the U.S. currency moved less than a pfennig against the mark and stayed within a very narrow range against the yen. In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 129.40 yen, down a bit from Wednesday\'s close of 129.50 yen. The dollar drifted lower Wednesday during Asian trading, hitting an intraday low of 1.8667 marks near the close of activity. At the end of European trading, the dollar briefly challenged, but failed to break, resistance of 1.8750 marks. The dollar traded within that tight band for the rest of New York trading, with some dealers citing Mr. Bush\'s budget address, scheduled for late Thursday, as the factor slowing activity. Other dealers said fear of intervention blocked the dollar from reaching its topside, while the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates firmly supported the currency. ""The central banks put a curb on enthusiasm to bring the dollar higher,"" said Francoise Soares-Kemp, vice president at Credit Suisse in New York. Stephen Leach, currency adviser at Chemical Bank in New York, said the central banks ""have put a lid on the dollar, but haven\'t screwed it tight. There\'s a lot of uncertainty in the market where to go from here."" The best news that could come from Mr. Bush\'s address, would be decisive measures to cut the budget deficit, said Earl I. Johnson, vice president at Harris Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago. A clear plan to narrow the deficit would send the dollar soaring, he said. Mr. Johnson said he sees a technical drop to 1.8500 marks, possibly as low as 1.8200 marks. ""Around 1.80 marks is a very solid floor. The dollar is in no danger of collapsing,"" he said. The 1.9000-mark level is widely perceived as the upper limit the central banks will tolerate. Some market participants worry that higher European interest rates might reduce the premium U.S. rates carry, diminishing the attractiveness of the dollar and dollar-denominated assets. However, some dealers caution that a batch of European rate increases combined with a firmer monetary policy from the Fed could lead to a continuing cycle of global rate increases. The Fed\'s policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded two days of meetings yesterday, but until there is a significant move in short-term rates, market participants won\'t know if any policy changes were made. Minutes of the meeting won\'t be released for six weeks. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery jumped $3.90 to settle at $396.20 an ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces. In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $394.15 an ounce.']","Dollar Is Pushed Lower by Uncertainty About Bush Budget, Fear of Intervention",1989-02-08,The Wall Street Journal
77,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"['Rising fears of inflation are fueling an investor rush into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds holding Treasury inflation-protected securities. So far this year, more than $17 billion has poured into funds that invest in TIPS, government-issued bonds whose principal grows with rising inflation, according to estimates from research firm Morningstar Inc. That compares with estimated net cash inflows of almost $10 billion for 2008. Their popularity reflects worries that massive U.S. government spending will eventually lead to high inflation, which could erode the value of stocks and ordinary bonds. But if inflation stays at current low levels longer than some investors expect, TIPS may not add much juice to a portfolio -- and could even drop in value. That said, many investors aren\'t in it for the yields, but for the protection they hope the bonds will provide if inflation suddenly surges. For now, TIPS buyers are brushing aside the prospect that the bonds won\'t do well if that much-feared inflation doesn\'t materialize. Indeed, many TIPS have been bid up to prices exceeding their face value. Total net assets for TIPS-focused mutual funds and ETFs were approximately $51 billion at the end of 2008. The mutual funds have gained an average 7.4% total return this year through Sept. 21, according to Morningstar. That showing, while nothing like the dizzying run-up in junk bonds, is much better than that of ordinary government bond funds, which have returned 2.6% so far this year. Richard Seelig, a retired high-school math teacher in Pelham, Mass., bought shares of the iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund last December for his Roth individual retirement account. ""I looked at the amount of money the government was spending that it didn\'t have, and I thought, well, that is going to come back to haunt us,"" he says. The Barclays fund, an ETF, has gained 8.2% this year through Sept. 21. TIPS pay a fixed interest rate every six months, known as a ""coupon,"" similar to ordinary Treasurys. But unlike Treasurys, TIPS\' principal value fluctuates with the inflation rate. Over the life of the bond, increases in the value of its principal aren\'t paid out, although investors who own TIPS outside of retirement accounts do pay taxes on any interim gains on the principal, as well as on any interest. When the bond reaches maturity, the inflation-adjusted principal is returned to investors. (If deflation were to occur, the adjustments to the principal would be negative, though a TIPS bond held to maturity will never return less than its original principal.) TIPS mutual funds, by contrast, pay out interest and principal gains on a regular basis. Like Treasurys, TIPS are exempt from state and local taxes. TIPS are issued in maturities of five, 10 and 20 years. A plain-vanilla 10-year Treasury currently yields about 3.5%, while a 10-year inflation-protected security yields about 1.6%, before inflation. The yield gap between 10-year TIPS and Treasurys, now about 1.8 percentage points, is called the break even rate and implies an expected annualized inflation rate of about 1.8% over 10 years. If inflation averages more than 1.8% over the period, then TIPS will outperform standard Treasurys. The lower the break-even rate is, the easier it is for TIPS to outperform the regular variety Treasury. But inflation alone doesn\'t determine how well TIPS perform. Supply and demand also play a role. And demand for TIPS is driven by inflation expectations, rather than actual inflation. Such expectations could drive TIPS prices higher, thereby shrinking yields, since price and yield move inversely. ""There has been a ton of money flowing into TIPS year to date, yet there\'s no inflation,"" says Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston. Instead, money keeps pouring into the investments based on the expectation that inflation is ahead. If the break-even rate widens, that would imply investors foresee higher inflation. But once the Federal Reserve begins to address inflation, it will raise short-term interest rates, and that would push down the value of existing bonds. In that case, there would be two counterforces acting on TIPS: rising inflation or expectations of inflation pushing up demand and thereby pushing up prices; and rising short-term rates driving down prices. If the Fed pushes rates up faster than inflation rises or raises rates before inflation picks up, TIPS could rack up losses for their owners. They could also decline if inflation turns out milder than investors\' original expectations. Some investors say they want to wait to buy TIPS until they actually start to see the Fed raise interest rates, says Debra Brede, who runs D.K. Brede Investment Management Co., an investment-management firm in Needham, Mass. The risk: If inflation is already escalating when investors decide to buy TIPS, ""the bonds might be more expensive at that point,"" she says. Of course, given the anemic economy and high joblessness, any resurgence in inflation may be distant. ""Certainly not in the next couple quarters,"" says John Canavan, a research analyst at Stone &McCarthy Research Associates in Skillman, N.J. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced that it decided to leave interest rates unchanged. In its accompanying policy statement, the Federal Open Market Committee noted that it ""expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time."" One caveat is that TIPS, which have been around only since 1997, don\'t have a track record during a period of sustained high inflation. Investors do have some other choices. If both inflation and economic growth are high, assets such as commodities and equities could outpace TIPS, says Dan Dektar, chief investment officer of Smith Breeden Associates\' investment management group in Durham, N.C. Investors can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. Treasury at TreasuryDirect.gov without incurring brokerage fees; some brokerage firms also allow clients to purchase new-issue or secondary-market TIPS without incurring fees. The next TIPS auction is for bonds with a 10-year maturity and is scheduled for Oct. 5. Many planners recommend that individual investors hold TIPS in retirement accounts, particularly if the client is in a higher tax bracket. ""TIPS are not tax-friendly,"" said Doug Flynn, a certified financial planner at Flynn Zito Capital Management in Garden City, N.Y. ""You\'re not buying these for tax efficiency, you\'re buying because you\'re scared of inflation."" For those who prefer mutual funds, which provide diversification and professional management, there are a variety of funds that invest in TIPS and a handful of exchange-traded funds. Allianz SE\'s Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, has unveiled three new TIPS ETFs this year, targeting different maturities. One popular TIPS mutual fund is Vanguard Group\'s Inflation Protected Securities Fund, which aims to outdo the Barclays Capital U.S. TIPS Index and has about $25 billion in assets under management. The fund distributes both interest and any inflation adjustment to the principal on a quarterly basis, though most investors choose to reinvest distributions, said Ken Volpert, who heads Vanguard\'s taxable bond group and co-manages the fund. Keep in mind, though, there are circumstances in which an income distribution may not occur, such as when the rate of deflation exceeds the yield before inflation.']",Investors Seek Inflation Haven In TIPS Funds --- But Treasury Securities Tied to Consumer Prices Carry Their Own Risks,2009-09-23,The Wall Street Journal
78,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve, in a move aimed at keeping interest rates low for home buyers through early next year, decided to extend and gradually phase out its purchase of mortgage-backed securities. The Fed\'s action signals its belief that the economy, while in recovery, remains fragile and that housing, which has seen some improvement in recent months, has only started to pull out of its slump. ""We definitely need help from the government,"" says Lee Barrett, president of Century 21 Barrett, a real-estate brokerage firm in Las Vegas. ""I don\'t think the market can make it on its own."" He also hopes Congress will extend tax credits for home buyers due to expire at the end of November. The central bank left its interest-rate target unchanged at zero to 0.25% and maintained its expectation that the federal-funds rate, or the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, would remain low ""for an extended period."" ""Economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn,"" the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday in a statement after a two-day meeting. Though conditions in financial markets and the housing sector have improved, household spending ""remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit,"" the Fed said. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities rose in price Wednesday, sending yields lower. Stocks slumped. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly moved above the 9900 level following the Fed\'s afternoon statement, making some investors think about a possible return to 10000, it sagged late in the day and finished down 81.32 points, or 0.83%, at 9748.55. It was the biggest one-day point and percentage decline since Sept. 1. Mainly because of heavy government intervention in the mortgage market, interest rates remain near their lowest levels in decades. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages currently average 5.24%, down from a recent peak of 5.81% in June but up from the year\'s low of 4.84% in late April, according to HSH Associates, in Pompton Plains, N.J. Sales have increased in California, Florida and some other areas from the very depressed levels of a year ago, largely driven by investors and first-time home buyers chasing bargains on foreclosed properties. But the market remains weak amid worries that new waves of foreclosures will add to supply as banks sort through mountains of paperwork from distressed borrowers seeking easier loan terms. Not all of those borrowers can be saved. That leaves an unknown number of foreclosed homes -- estimated by some analysts to total several million -- to likely hit the market over the next few years. The risk that those foreclosures will depress prices further may keep some potential buyers on the sidelines. ""Nobody seems to know how big that overhang is,"" says Tom Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va. Data on existing-home sales for August will be reported Thursday, and Mr. Lawler is bucking the consensus in predicting a decline. He notes tax credits induced many people to buy homes earlier this year, and sales may fall in the near term now that most of those tax-related purchases have been completed. In one sign that the housing market hasn\'t fully recovered, luxury-home builder Toll Brothers Inc. this week announced a nationwide sale on new homes. The specials being offered by Toll include lower prices on options, including custom tile and appliances, and mortgages with initial rates as low as 2.875%. With so many empty houses sitting on the market, some builders say they still have no way to make a profit with new construction. ""Why build new when people can go out and buy for less than it cost?"" says Mark Connal, vice president of realty at Michael Crews Development, a developer and builder in Escondido, Calif. An early end to the Fed\'s purchase program ""could potentially have reduced the demand for housing by 10% to 20% and that could have slowed the recovery,"" says Glenn Boyd, head of U.S. asset-backed securities research for Barclays Capital. ""This is certainly a positive and adds to our confidence in the ultimate recovery for home prices."" The Fed is about two-thirds of the way through its mortgage-purchase program, which was launched late last year to support mortgage lending, housing activity and broader credit markets. The central bank\'s decision to complete the full $1.25 trillion in purchases of mortgage-backed securities -- rather than ""up to"" that amount, as it said in August -- ended speculation that it might stop short, as a handful of policymakers have suggested. The Fed still plans to buy up to $200 billion in debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates were expected to rise throughout the fall and winter as the Fed wound down its program to buy the mortgage-related securities. Even if they inch up, now they\'re less likely to increase as sharply, given the Fed\'s longer time horizon that stretches to March. ""The Fed wanted to exit with as little disruption as possible to the market,"" says Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. ""Doubling the length of time you\'re going to make the purchases allows for a pretty smooth transition."" --- Ruth Simon, E.S. Browning and Conor Dougherty contributed to this article.

79,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"['The dollar managed to gain against the euro, recovering from a slide to a 12-month low against the common currency in a knee-jerk reaction to the Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate decision. The euro briefly spiked higher after the Federal Open Market Committee announced it wouldn\'t change ultralow interest rates, but painted a somewhat rosier picture of the U.S. economy in the accompanying statement. U.S. stocks initially rallied on the Fed statement, pulling the euro along to a 12-month high at $1.4845 before reversing those gains as stocks fell back in late trading. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.4743 from $1.4800 late Tuesday. The dollar was at 91.31 Japanese yen from 91.20 yen. The euro was at 134.61 yen from 134.97 yen. The pound was at $1.6357 from $1.6371, while the dollar was at 1.0264 Swiss francs from 1.0233 francs. By pledging to keep interest rates low for an extended period, the Fed sustained the dollar\'s use as a currency to fund bets on higher-yielding assets, or the ""carry trade,"" said Tom Fitzpatrick, global head of currency strategy at Citigroup in New York. ""They\'ve reiterated that rates will be exceptionally low for an extended period,"" he said, supporting the very reason the market was short dollars going into the meeting. At the same time, the Fed offered some support of those riskier assets by indicating there are signs the U.S. economy is improving, Mr. Fitzpatrick said. The euro could top out around $1.50, said Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Because the U.S. economy is likely improving at a faster tick than the euro-zone economy, economic fundamentals don\'t support the euro going much higher, he said. Meanwhile, the ruble hit a nine-month high against the dollar as the Russian currency, almost written off by investors at the start of the year, appeared ripe for the carry trade. The ruble pushed through the psychologically important level of 30 rubles to the dollar for the first time since January, strengthening to 29.9586 before slipping back for a New York finish of 30.021. A nascent Russian economic revival is luring cash into local stocks and bonds and easing concerns the government will flood the foreign-exchange market by increasing spending. Elsewhere, the Norwegian central bank left its key rate unchanged at 1.25% Wednesday, as expected, but said it considered raising rates as an alternative. The expectation that Norges Bank would be one of the first central banks to begin raising interest rates has been a factor in keeping the krone strong, analysts said. --- Andrew Langley contributed to this article.

Vanguard has filed with regulators for Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. Small-Cap Index Fund, which it says is the first mutual fund to track an index of international small-capitalization stocks. The firm will also launch an exchange-traded fund based on the index. Both funds are expected to be introduced early next year. ""From a diversification point of view, it makes sense to have to this exposure,"" said Duane Kelly, co-manager of the new fund. The index will comprise more than 3,300 stocks of companies in 47 countries. The fund will approximate, rather than replicate, the index, Mr. Kelly said, by holding between 1,000 and 1,500 stocks from both developed and emerging markets countries. International-stock funds have been badly hit by both poor performance and heavy redemptions. International funds are down 46.5% so far this year, according to research firm Lipper Inc., and saw net outflows of $22.5 billion through Nov. 30 -- about 2.5% of the category\'s total assets at the start of the year. Small-cap international funds have fared even worse, down 51.9% and suffering $2.5 billion of net outflows, or about 5% of assets, said Lipper. But despite the poor recent results, Mr. Kelly is unconcerned. ""This [fund launch] has been in the works for a while,"" he said. ""Timing isn\'t a factor -- people want access to this asset class."" The fact that the market is down may also work in the fund\'s favor in the eyes of investors. ""I\'d be more concerned about them coming out with a fund like this a year or two ago,"" said Dan Culloton, senior fund analyst at investment researcher Morningstar Inc. ""Then it would have seemed like a crass attempt to gather assets in a hot area."" Mr. Culloton said that while many investors are scared by international stocks right now, ""over the long term it makes sense to have exposure"" to the area. What\'s more, he said, ""this could be a contrarian time to invest in a fund like this."" There aren\'t many options for investors looking for small-cap international index funds. Those available, notably Vanguard International Explorer (VINEX), Oakmark International Small Cap (OAKEX) and Dimensional Fund Advisors\' International Small Company Portfolio (DFISX), are all actively managed, Mr. Culloton said. This year, those funds are down 49.5%, 50% and 46.2%, respectively. The only index-linked offering that has the broad, go-anywhere approach of the Vanguard fund is SPDR S&P International Small Cap ETF (GWX), Mr. Culloton said. ""The hardcore Vanguard investors have been asking for this fund,"" said Mr. Culloton. ""It fills a hole in their lineup."" Rate Cut to Pressure Money-Market Fees The Federal Reserve\'s move to cut a key lending rate to a record-low range will likely put pressure on the fees that money-market mutual funds charge and could force some smaller players to reconsider their money-fund businesses. The Federal Open Market Committee voted Tuesday to cut the target fed-funds rate for interbank lending to a range of zero to 0.25%, the lowest since the Fed started publishing the funds target in 1990, from 1%. Connie Bugbee, managing editor at iMoneyNet, which tracks money-market funds, noted that some money funds that invest in Treasurys have already had to lower their fees. As money has poured into these funds, yields on government debt have fallen dramatically and some funds have barred new investors or waived a portion of their fees so that their expenses don\'t outweigh their income. In fact, Vanguard said Tuesday that it will not open new accounts or accept additional investments in its Vanguard Treasury Money Market and Admiral Treasury Money Market funds from financial advisers, intermediaries or institutions, though existing clients may continue to invest. -- Daisy Maxey License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service']",New Index Fund: Small and Foreign --- Is Vanguard's Offering Novel or Mistimed?,2008-12-16,The Wall Street Journal

The decision from the Federal Open Market Committee fueled a jump in big financial companies, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group, while also driving gains for consumer companies as traders bet that the possible stimulus for banks could find its way into other areas of the economy. The Fed voted to reduce the fed-funds rate from 1% to a range of zero to 0.25%, the lowest since the Fed started publishing the fed-funds target in 1990. The Fed also said it will keep rates ""exceptionally low"" for some time during a period of waning price pressures. ""This will ensure corporate debt and corporate properties won\'t go the same way residential went,"" said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management. ""The big movers will be big banks, and that comes from confidence this action will put a stake in the heart of the credit crisis,"" he said. J.P. Morgan closed up $3.72, or 13%, to $32.35, while Citigroup rose 83 cents, or 11%, to 8.23. Goldman Sachs also helped pace the gains for banks, closing up 9.54, or 14%, to 76. Although the bank swung to a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss on broad market declines that hurt investments and trading, its operating business beat expectations, analysts said. Morgan Stanley, set to report its quarterly results Wednesday, rose 2.49, or 18%, to 16.13. Consumer names rallied alongside the banking sector. Helping the gains was a report that U.S. consumer prices posted a second consecutive record decline last month, helping consumers\' purchasing power. Among the gainers was Best Buy, up 4.21, or 18%, to 27.68. The gains came as the U.S.\'s largest consumer-electronics chain became the latest retailer to cut planned store openings and capital expenditures in response to sliding consumer spending after posting a fiscal third-quarter net income drop of 77%. Also helping pace the market\'s gains was a surge by insurers, with some of the more beaten-down names in 2008 leading the pack. Hartford Financial Services Group rose 3.31, or 24%, to 17.28. General Electric rose 97 cents, or 5.7%, to 17.92, after it shelved plans to sell its consumer and industrial unit and dropped quarterly earnings projections as it provided its 2009 outlook. The conglomerate also forecast higher margins next year despite a potential drop in group revenue as it shrinks its financial-services business. On the deals front, Satyam Computer Services, India\'s fourth-largest software exporter by revenue, said it board approved acquisitions of infrastructure-development companies Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties in a move to ""derisk"" its core business of software services for a total cost of $1.6 billion.

The Federal Open Market Committee\'s acknowledgment that the economy is picking up steam partly overshadowed its commitment to keep interest rates near zero ""for an extended period"" in its post-meeting statement. As the FOMC decision and statement were largely in line with market expectations, the dollar\'s rebound was limited and it failed to climb above 90 yen or push the euro below $1.45. ""The Fed was a little more upbeat on the economy than anticipated,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Conn. By recognizing the improvement of the labor market, the FOMC did ""tell us that we are a step closer to monetary tightening,"" he said. Late Wednesday, the euro was at $1.4534 from $1.4536 late Tuesday. The dollar was at 89.79 yen from 89.63, while the euro was at 130.50 yen from 130.30. The pound was at $1.6340 from $1.6266.

The FOMC\'s decision came on the heels of interest-rate increases by central banks in Europe, including a surprising hike by Norway, which reinforced investors\' expectation that as the global economy emerges from its worst recession in decades, policy makers will begin to exit some of the stimulus programs that pumped extra liquidity into the markets. Higher-Yield Demand ""We saw the ECB already winding down those liquidity operations, so overall it appears that the Fed is starting to move down the same path,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, foreign-exchange strategist at Wells Fargo in New York, referring to the FOMC\'s statement, which said, among other decisions, that it is working to close temporary liquidity swap arrangements by Feb. 1. Demand for higher-yielding currencies dictated most of the trading session ahead of the FOMC statement, with the euro climbing as far as $1.4591 on the back of economic data Wednesday that showed inflation has returned to the euro zone, as well as an improvement in manufacturing and services activity in the area. Greece\'s Downgrade Greece\'s credit-rating downgrade by Standard &Poor\'s to BBB+ from A- did little to dent support for the euro ahead of the FOMC\'s decision as the downgrade ""was widely expected,"" said Jacob Oubina, currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, N.J. ""The initial put on negative [CreditWatch] earlier last week had more of an impact on the euro than when S&P actually cut the rating,"" he said. The lack of surprises in U.S. consumer inflation and housing starts in November also failed to change investor sentiment. November U.S. housing starts rose 8.9% to a 574,000 annual rate, while U.S. consumer inflation rose 0.4% in November, the Labor Department said Wednesday. That compares with an increase of 0.3% in October. However, one typical beneficiary of better risk appetite, the Australian dollar, was the biggest underperformer among major currencies, dropping 0.6% to $0.9002, after the country\'s third-quarter gross domestic product showed 0.5% growth, much less than the 1.2% implied by the Reserve Bank of Australia\'s own forecast. To make matters worse, RBA deputy governor Ric Battelino suggested that the central bank mightn\'t need to increase rates again in February as many had expected. Meanwhile, the Norwegian krone jumped higher against the euro and dollar after Norway\'s central bank delivered a surprise increase in its benchmark interest rate to 1.75% from 1.5%.

83,2006-10-26 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve held short-term interest rates steady for its third consecutive meeting as it continued to bet on a moderation of both inflation and economic growth. Even as it left rates at 5.25% yesterday, the Fed again warned that it is worried about inflation. Since Ben Bernanke became Fed chairman in February, he has faced, first, the threat of rising inflation and then a housing-led economic slowdown. The latest data, and the statement released by the Fed after its meeting yesterday, suggest that the central bank sees the risks on both sides diminishing. That makes it less likely that rates will change in either direction in coming months. Both the rate action and statement were largely expected. Bond prices rallied and bond yields, which move in the opposite direction to prices, fell, apparently because investors had expected more hints of a possible rate increase. Futures markets\' expectations of Fed actions have swung sharply in the past month, from betting on several rate cuts starting as soon as December to seeing a small probability that the Fed might raise rates. In its statement, the Fed said growth has slowed in part because of a ""cooling"" housing market. ""Going forward, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace,"" it said, a notable addition to its statement released after last month\'s meeting. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, remains ""elevated"" but inflation pressures are likely to moderate thanks to lower energy prices, ""contained"" inflation expectations, and the impact of previous rate increases, the Fed said. ""Some inflation risks remain,"" the Fed said, but whether rates would rise again depends on the outlook and ""incoming information."" For the third straight meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker cast the lone dissent among the 11 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee. He argued in favor of a quarter-percentage point rate increase in the target federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. (One voting seat is empty and seven other members don\'t vote.) Mr. Bernanke has faced shifting challenges since taking office. Core inflation has risen to 2.9% from 2.1%, the highest level in a decade. Although inflation by the Fed\'s preferred price index is lower, it, too, is above the 2% level many Fed officials have said they are comfortable with. That led the Fed to raise rates at its first three meetings under Mr. Bernanke. Then later economic growth, under the weight of falling home and automobile sales, began to slow, to an estimated annual rate of about 2% in the third quarter. That would be the second-lowest level since 2003. The official growth figure will be reported tomorrow. In recent weeks, though, both inflation and growth worries have eased. Energy prices have plunged, and the Fed expects the indirect impact of that drop to pull down core inflation in the coming year or so. Yesterday\'s Fed statement dropped a reference from the previous month to energy and commodity prices as a source of inflation pressure. There is little sign the economy outside housing and cars has slowed much. Some economists said the housing market has shown tentative signs of hitting bottom. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales fell 2% in September to an annual rate of 6.18 million, from August. The inventory of existing homes remained at about 7.3 months of sales for the third consecutive month. ""We might be having what some colleagues have described as a false landing rather than soft landing,"" said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank. He said growth could rebound to 3% in the current quarter as the housing correction ends and consumers benefit from a 25% to 40% drop in gasoline prices. ""The Fed must ask itself: Did things slow down long enough and far enough to reduce pressure on capacity? I think the next move [on rates] is probably up."" Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, predicted the Fed would cut rates by January. With long-term rates well below short-term rates -- a relationship that in the past has foreshadowed recession -- ""the risk factors are too high,"" he said. The shifting momentum of growth from strong to weak and back to moderate reflects the remarkable stability the U.S. economy now enjoys, said John Makin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""As has often been the case over the past five years, the slowdown itself has set into motion market adjustments that may mitigate or even reverse it,"" he wrote in a report. For example, the Fed\'s decision to pause as the housing market weakened led investors to drive down long-term rates on bonds and mortgages. That, with a lag, has helped put a floor under housing. Online lender Quicken Loans Inc.\'s pipeline of mortgage applications has grown 20% to 25% since rates began to ease in late June, said the company\'s chief economist, Bob Walters. The increase has been driven mostly by refinancing applications, while the number of applications for new-home purchases remains steady. ""Whether we\'ve seen the bottom or not, remains to be seen,"" he said. --- Online Today: Pimco bond fund manager Bill Gross discusses where rates may be headed next, at WSJ.com/Video.

85,2007-02-01 00:00:00,"['Cold weather continued to lift crude-oil prices yesterday in New York, helping them steam to a four-week high after government data showed distillate inventories, which include heating oil, fell more than expected. The prospect of fresh Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries production cuts, due to start today, supported prices, as did a Federal Open Market Committee statement that was more upbeat on expansion and inflation than the previous statement. Heating-oil prices led crude higher for most of the session as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration continued to forecast below-normal temperatures in the Northeast into mid-February. Winter came late to the region, which is the source of 80% of the nation\'s heating-oil use, and an extended cold snap is helping pare early January crude- and heating-oil losses because of low demand for the fuel. The front-month March light, sweet crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $1.17, or 2.1%, to $58.14 a barrel, crude\'s highest settlement since Jan. 3, which was the first trading day of the year. ""People are still focusing on distillates and looking ahead to next week, when there will likely be an even-bigger drop,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. ""The funds sold in early January thinking winter would never start, and now we\'re starting to see a psychological change"" as forecasts for colder temperatures continue, he said. Prices rose after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said distillate stockpiles, which include both heating oil and diesel, fell by 2.6 million barrels last week. Demand for the fuel jumped 11% from a week earlier to the highest since prewinter gains recorded Oct. 27. OPEC is due today to add 500,000 barrels a day of crude-oil production cuts to 1.2 million barrels a day it was supposed to have cut from November 2006. While most analysts and tanker trackers believe the cartel has fallen well short of its first cut, Saudi Arabia added support to prices this week when it said it will cut 158,000 barrels a day starting today. In other commodity markets: COPPER: Prices on the Comex division of the Nymex rallied as gains in precious metals and energy, along with a weak dollar and mine-labor issues, lifted the metal.

86,2003-08-13 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar ended North American trading higher against most of its major counterparts, remaining bound to recent narrow ranges before and after a closely watched statement on the economy from the Federal Reserve. The decision by the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to hold short-term interest rates at a 45-year low of 1% had been widely expected, with analysts focusing instead on the language of the statement accompanying the decision. Saying that ""the evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period shows that spending is firming although labor-market indicators are mixed,"" the Fed gave notice it would keep interest rates low for a ""considerable period."" Following recent U.S. economic data that some market participants viewed as grounds for cautious optimism of a U.S. economic recovery, analysts found little in the Fed statement to warrant a significant readjustment of currency positions. ""The Fed offered no surprises,"" said Ram Bhagavataula, senior economist with Royal Bank of Scotland in New York. ""Even though bond markets have become considerably more anxious, the Fed is telling the same story, which is disinflation, so accommodative policy can be maintained for a considerable period. Their policy hasn\'t changed one bit."" After some knee-jerk buying and selling immediately after the Fed\'s announcement, the dollar returned to pre-FOMC levels, exiting from New York trading at the upper end of the day\'s ranges. ""The currency markets are just chopping around in the ranges we\'ve been in for the past few weeks,"" said Tim Mazanec, senior currency strategist with Investors Bank &Trust in Boston. Analysts will likely watch retail-sales and business-inventories numbers due today for any signs of continued improvement in the U.S. economy. Late yesterday, the euro was trading at $1.1295, off session lows of $1.1282 from early in New York, but down from $1.1361 late Monday. The dollar was at 118.69 yen, virtually unchanged from 118.67 yen late Monday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was buying 1.3691 francs, up from 1.3581 francs, while sterling was changing hands at $1.6029, down from $1.6094 late Monday. The European currency seemed to fail to draw much strength from reports that French industrial production proved stronger than expected, rising 1.2% in June after falling a revised 1.3% in May, and by other figures showing that French inflation remained steady over the past two months, at 1.9% in July. Though the yen\'s recent strength would appear to be bolstered by data showing the Japanese economy grew 0.6% in the second quarter of this year, well above the expected rise of 0.2%, many analysts said potential intervention by the Bank of Japan on behalf of Japan\'s Ministry of Finance -- which has repeatedly intervened to weaken the Japanese currency against the dollar -- will continue to put brakes on any appreciable yen gains. Elsewhere, Brazil\'s real softened against the dollar somewhat, as dollar-buying by importers moved an illiquid market. The dollar traded at 3.025 reals late yesterday, compared with Monday\'s 3.005-real close. Argentina\'s peso climbed for a second day against the U.S. currency, as investors bought pesos on rising expectations that the country will reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a new financial aid agreement.

87,2000-06-29 00:00:00,"[""NEW YORK -- Volatility declined sharply in the options market in reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.    The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Market Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 option prices to determine investor sentiment, declined 1.30 to 23.52.    When the index declines, it often indicates that traders are optimistic about the stock market, but many options traders refrained from making any major commitments ahead of the coming short week because options lose a little bit of their value each day. The financial markets close early Monday and all day Tuesday in observance of Independence Day.    As expected, the Fed kept its target overnight bank lending rate, or fed-funds rate, at 6.5%. The committee, however, indicated that it may raise rates again to control inflation. Many people on Wall Street expect the Fed will raise interest rates at its next meeting.    The CBOE's equity put/call ratio was 0.40. The ratio is a contrarian sentiment indicator that holds that the smart approach to the market is to do the opposite of the crowd. If everyone is bullish, a contrarian trader is bearish on the assumption that the crowd is always wrong. The ratio is considered bullish above 0.75; neutral from 0.40 to 0.75 and bearish below 0.40.    The CBOE's index put/call ratio was 0.87, but the reading may not be accurate because index-trading volume was low. The ratio, also a contrarian sentiment indicator, is considered bullish above 1.5, neutral from 0.75 to 1.5 and bearish if it is below 0.75. Elsewhere in the market, a trader apparently sold a sizable position in EMC Corp. after CIBC Oppenheimer initiated coverage of the technology company with a buy rating. With the stock up, the July 80 calls gained 7/16 to 2 1/8 on CBOE volume of 6,807 contracts, compared with composite open interest of 14,089 contracts. The majority of the volume was executed on the bid, which generally indicates that a position is being sold.

89,2009-03-19 00:00:00,"['Gold futures staged an about-face to move higher in thinly traded after-hours screen trading after a surprise statement from the Federal Open Market Committee that pressured the dollar and rekindled longer-term inflation concerns. Gold had settled lower in the open-outcry session, with nearby March gold futures down $27.70 to $888.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The most-active April contract fell $27.70 to $889.10. The weakness was triggered by an abatement of recent flight-to-safety buying as financial stocks kept improving and by sell stops, preplaced orders triggered when certain chart points are hit. But in electronic trading two hours after gold\'s official close, the April contract had reversed and traded at $940.10, a rise of 5.7% from the session\'s close. The catalyst was steps announced by the Fed in its efforts to revive the economy, including plans to buy long-term Treasurys and more mortgage-backed securities. ""The dollar is getting whacked,"" said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with FuturePath Trading. ""It\'s the fact they\'re going to buy Treasurys. That\'s a surprise to everybody."" Investors often buy gold as a hedge against dollar weakness. Investors also buy gold as an inflation hedge, and that also came into play, said Andrew Montano, director of precious metals at Scotia Mocatta. The market perceived the Fed announcement as a ""massive expansion"" of the Fed\'s balance sheet and a rise in the money supply, he said, adding, ""Inflation worries would be the primary issue."" This prompted heavy buying in gold, with buy stops triggered, he said. George Gero, vice president at RBC Capital Markets Global Futures, also cited short covering, in which traders buy to offset positions in which they previously went short, or sold, the metal. Gold\'s sharp turn around in after-hours trading could make it ripe for a pull back. ""You might need some consolidation,"" said Stephen Platt, analyst with Archer Financial Services. But gold support is coming on expectations of a weaker dollar as the Fed is ""trying to pump as much money into the system"" as it can, Mr. Platt said. ""You would think it would be inflationary."" The gold decline during the regular-hours session was the largest one-day dollar and percentage drop since Jan. 12, and the lowest settlement since Jan. 28. It put gold prices down 11.4% from the exchange-record close of $1,003.20 hit on March 18, 2008. Comex silver for March delivery fell 73.5 cents per troy ounce, or 5.79% to $11.950, down for the third straight session and 9.7% over the past three sessions.

Light, sweet crude for April delivery fell $1.02, or 2.1%, to $48.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. NATURAL GAS: Prices fell to the lowest in over six years, since Sept. 25, 2002, dragged down by slumping oil prices amid ample gas supplies, weak demand and mild temperatures.

90,1995-08-23 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials left U.S. short-term interest rates unchanged, while separately an unexpected contraction in the German money supply increased speculation that the Bundesbank will cut rates soon. The decision by members of the Fed\'s Open Market Committee, who met yesterday to map out near-term policy, had been widely anticipated in financial markets and came six weeks after the Fed reversed course and pushed down rates by one-quarter percentage point in response to a weakening economy and abating inflationary pressures. The latest decision leaves the target for the important federal-funds  rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, at 5.75%. Further reductions in interest rates later this year remain a strong possibility and could come as soon as the Fed\'s Sept. 26 meeting. Any move depends on incoming economic data about the pace of growth, the inflation outlook and congressional progress toward reducing the federal deficit. The economy\'s surprisingly swift rebound from its spring-time slump has relieved pressure on the Fed to cut rates to avoid recession and has led some Fed officials to conclude that they need to keep the central bank\'s foot on the brake. By holding short-term interest rates somewhere between 2.75 and 3 percentage points above the inflation rate, the Fed is restraining the economy, economists figure. ""Real [or inflation-adjusted] interest rates remain high at levels historically consistent with slow growth or recession,"" complains Lawrence Chimerine, economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, a liberal think tank that is calling for further rate cuts. ""They are restrictive, but they need to be,"" counters Michael Moran, economist at Daiwa Securities Inc. in New York. Inflation remains a threat, he says, unless the unemployment rate climbs slightly from current levels. ""If you consider only the economy, we shouldn\'t expect the Fed to ease again [this year]. There\'s one condition that could lead the Fed to ease again: If Congress puts together a credible deficit package and passes it."" But other economists say the receding inflation threat means inflation-adjusted interest rates are too high, and they specu late that the central bank will be looking for an opportunity to bring them down. ""There\'s no urgency here,"" says St. Louis forecaster Laurence Meyer. ""They might say we\'d like to move rates down a little bit."" The latest weekly survey of 16 Fed watchers by his firm, Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, found 10 who anticipate a further cut in interest rates at or before the Sept. 26 meeting of Fed policy makers. Although Mr. Meyer himself predicts a 1/4-percentage-point cut in rates in September, he isn\'t very confident of that. ""The good news is we don\'t have to worry about recession. The bad news is that we\'re coming back to trend [economic] growth, perhaps too quickly,"" and that may make the inflationary-wary Fed reluctant to lower interest rates. As is its current practice when it leaves rates alone, the Fed\'s spokesman said yesterday only that the meeting of its policy-making FOMC ended after 3 1/2 hours at 12:25 p.m. Details of the central bank\'s deliberations and the vote of the current members of the committee won\'t be released until late September. Financial markets didn\'t respond much to word that the Fed was leaving interest rates unchanged. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was at 6.56% late yesterday, up from 6.52 the day before. But the dollar rallied earlier in the day on prospects for lower interest rates in Germany.   Late yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4860 marks, up from 1.4765, and 96.85 yen, down from 96.90. In Germany, the Bundesbank\'s policy-setting Central Bank Council gathers tomorrow for its fort-nightly meeting. ""If all the information is going in the right direction, I am not excluding some room for maneuver in reducing interest rates in the next time,"" Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said in an interview, which was conducted in English, with a Japanese news agency. A transcript of the interview was obtained by Dow Jones wire services, and the Bundesbank confirmed the accuracy of the remarks. A Bundesbank spokesman stressed that Mr. Tietmeyer\'s use of the phrase ""in the next time"" didn\'t indicate any specific date, implying rather ""in the time ahead."" A German move to lower interest rates would be welcome in the U.S. It probably would be matched by other European countries, spurring economic growth in Europe and with it demand for U.S. exports. Moreover, a German rate cut would make German securities less attractive to global investors, thereby depressing the German mark and lifting the dollar. Boosting the dollar is currently a shared objective of the U.S., German and Japanese governments. The Bundesbank said its broadly defined M3 money supply contracted at a 0.4% annual rate in the first seven months of the year, suggesting a diminishing inflation threat as the German economy slows down. Although the Fed largely disregards money-supply data in its deliberations, the Bundesbank tracks them closely. Many market analysts, and even some Bundesbank officials, had been expecting a mild acceleration in money-supply growth. Growth in M3 has fallen short of the Bundesbank\'s 1995 target of 4% to 6%. The report comes amid a series of gloomy economic indicators, including a 3.5% plunge in inflation-adjusted manufacturing orders in June. ""The M3 figures give the Bundesbank a perfect excuse to sink interest rates -- if that\'s what they want to do,"" said Joachim Fels, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Co. in Frankfurt. ""If they want to lower rates, it would be to help the real economy. The chance of this happening is bigger now, but it\'s still not certain."" With bad news piling up, many market economists consider a reduction in official Bundesbank interest rates to be imminent. Juergen Pfister, a Commerzbank AG economist in Frankfurt, forecasts a reduction in Germany\'s discount rate to 3.5% from the current 4% by the end of September. ""The inflation outlook is opportune and the economy has been very disappointing,"" Mr. Pfister said. ""Despite some statistical uncertainty, it\'s clear that the economy in the first half was very weak, perhaps little better than stagnation."" In the interim, perhaps this week, the Bundesbank is expected to shave a bit off the interest rate it charges on its 14-day securities-repurchase agreements, a key financing instrument for German money markets, Mr. Pfister said.']","Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged --- Money Supply in Germany Shrinks, and Bundesbank Could Cut Rates Soon",1995-08-22,The Wall Street Journal
91,2009-06-25 00:00:00,"['A bout of selling hit Treasurys after Federal Reserve policy makers refrained from increasing the size of the Fed\'s asset-purchase programs. Treasury prices had rallied earlier in the session as some investors bet the Fed would boost the size of its $300 billion Treasury-purchase program or alter the mixture of asset buying in favor of Treasurys against mortgage-backed securities. A well-bid $37 billion, five-year-note auction earlier in the afternoon also lent support to government securities. A gauge of demand for the five-year notes from a broad range of investors, including foreign central banks, reached a historical high. ""There was some disappointment in terms of the Treasury-purchases program,"" said James Caron, head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York. Bonds are likely to be pressured as investors brace for a $27 billion, seven-year-note auction Thursday, the final leg of this week\'s record $104 billion note supply from the Treasury. The Fed also is set to conduct a round of Treasury buying on Thursday, targeting maturities between 17 years and 30 years. Late Wednesday afternoon in New York, the 10-year note was down 12/32 point, at 95 12/32, to yield 3.687%, up from 3.640% late Tuesday, as bond yields move inversely to prices. The two-year Treasury fell 2/32 point, raising its yield to 1.204%. The yield curve, the spread between the two-year and 10-year notes, flattened to 2.49 percentage points from 2.53 points late Tuesday and 2.58 points Monday. The Federal Reserve made few major changes in its policy statement after officials concluded their latest meeting on Wednesday. Policy makers acknowledged signs of stability in the economy and suggested that price pressure remained contained near term. The Federal Open Market Committee voted, 10-0, to maintain the federal-funds target rate for interbank lending at a range between zero and 0.25%. Fed policy makers reiterated that they are likely to keep the fed-funds target rate at low levels for an extended period, a blow to some traders and investors who had bet on a more-hawkish statement. ""The Fed is reminding the hyperventilating bond market that it needs to relax; inflation will be low for some time because the economic weakness will be with us for a time,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., based in New York. Mr. Rupkey said Fed policy makers aren\'t about to start thinking about an exit strategy, which would mean raising rates, because the economy won\'t be back to normal for quite some time. Gary Pollack, who helps oversee $12 billion as head of fixed-income trading in New York at Deutsche Bank AG\'s private wealth-management unit, said that he was neutral on the market at this point and expected the 10-year Treasury note\'s yield to trade within the 3.5% to 4% range over the next couple of months. Mr. Pollack said he would be a buyer if the 10-year note\'s yield rises to 4% and would sell if the yield falls back to 3.5%. The Treasury\'s newly auctioned five-year note came in at a yield of 2.7%, compared with the 2.719% just before the auction. The lower yield suggests strong demand, a contrast to market expectations given that the auction came shortly before the FOMC statement. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.58, the biggest since October 2007, compared with 2.32 for the previous auction in May and the average of 2.16 from the past 10 auctions. The indirect bid -- demand from domestic and foreign institutions, including foreign central banks -- for the five-year Treasury note was a record 62.8%, compared with 30.8% last month.

The lower the trigger rate, the longer the Fed can wait before pushing up interest rates in order to slow economic growth. The policy makers\' immediate problem is that the consensus on the trigger rate has broken down. In perhaps the last major statement of the old established view, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City published a study in 1994 concluding that a jobless rate held below 6% would result in accelerating wage and price inflation. Few economists disagreed. The consensus rule worked well in the late 1980s. Unemployment fell below 6% in mid-1987, and labor costs began accelerating significantly in 1988. But the policy rule has failed recently. Joblessness has been well below 6% for nearly two years, yet labor costs have remained quiescent. In light of recent experience, nobody knows what the new trigger rate is. Around Washington, the most frequently heard guess is 5.5% -- simply because that is what unemployment has been hovering around since the end of 1994. But more substantial evidence is available. It can be found in the behavior of the Midwestern regional economy, as presented in the nearby chart. During the past two years, unemployment in the Midwest has averaged 4.5%. That is well below almost any expert guess at the trigger rate, yet growth in regional labor costs -- the lion\'s share of business costs, and so the biggest single warning sign of inflation -- has been contained. Interestingly, the table does provide some hint of cost acceleration so far this year. If so, it took a sustained period of 4.5% joblessness to trigger the acceleration. The regional evidence cannot be easily dismissed. The Midwest -- 12 states from North Dakota to Ohio, Wisconsin to Missouri -- is a huge, complex economy. Taken alone, it would be the fourth largest in the world. The 1990s have not seen substantial population inflows from other regions to relieve pressure from low unemployment. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the Midwestern experience can help us understand how the U.S. economy has changed. The message from the Midwest is a substantial, not modest, shift in the unemployment-inflation relationship. Business leaders understand the magnitude of the continuing changes in the economy. For years they have argued to Washington policy makers that widespread cost rationalization (sometimes derided as ""downsizing"") and globalization have altered inflation dynamics, making the economy capable of faster growth and lower unemployment. However, many economists and policy makers are skeptical of business claims, reluctant to assign rationalization an important role in recent economic trends. Indeed, economists find it convenient to assume that the economy always operates close to its maximum efficiency, providing little room for sustained cost-cutting. In this debate, the economists are wrong; the business leaders are right. In ""The Price of Industrial Labor"" (D.C. Heath, 1985), I showed that labor cost inefficiencies accumulated in the 1970s and 1980s. Widespread rationalization today is working to reduce those inefficiencies, pushing costs closer to market realities in a variety of ways: tighter controls on perks (""nonwage benefits""), fewer lockstep salary increases within companies, outright elimination of higher-wage positions (frequently in middle management), a trend away from cost-of-living adjustments, and the replacement (at least in part) of annual wage increases with performance-based awards. The macroeconomic result of the concerted efforts to boost cost efficiency should not be surprising. A high trigger rate of unemployment results from widespread labor-market inefficiency. Europe today, with its chronic double-digit jobless rates, illustrates this point. The higher economic efficiency is, the lower unemployment can be without triggering wage and price inflation. Nor should it be surprising that the Midwest leads the nation in cost rationalization. The one-time Rust Belt, battered by low-cost imports and burdened by high joblessness, had to improve its economic efficiency sharply in order to survive. Once started, institutional shareholders have insisted that the revenue gains continue, making rationalization a continuing process. This process of cost rationalization has spread throughout the whole country, substantially altering the U.S. economy. It has reduced the trigger jobless rate, allowing the Midwest to sustain unemployment well below 5%. The consequences, however, do not stop with lower unemployment. Most notably, efforts to improve cost efficiency have helped push up corporate profits as a share of national income, reversing a two-decade decline. The effect has been dramatic. The four-year growth in inflation-adjusted earnings per share in the S&P 500 has reached a record high. That explains the robust stock market and suggests that equity prices will continue to rise as long as cost rationalization persists. If Washington doesn\'t mismanage the process -- by, for example, adopting any of the anti-downsizing nostrums being bruited around -- today\'s rationalization will provide the foundation for the best sustained performance of the U.S. economy since the 1960s. Like the `60s, this new golden age will be characterized by strong profits, low inflation, modest unemployment, rising financial-asset prices, rapid investment, robust productivity gains and a resumption in the growth of real wages and living standards. Books will be written, and read widely in Europe and Japan, on how to manage like the Americans. --- Mr. Annable is chief economist at First Chicago NBD Bank.']",No Need to Fear Lower Unemployment,1996-08-20,The Wall Street Journal
93,2007-06-29 00:00:00,"['U.S. Treasury prices dropped as policy makers continued to stress inflation as their primary concern after leaving interest rates steady for the eighth straight meeting. Shorter-maturity issues were the hardest hit after the Federal Open Market Committee left rates at 5.25%, as expected, yet continued to stress worries over price pressures and pointed to an economy likely to continue to expand over the coming quarters. As a result, Treasury investors turned more downbeat on an ease in interest rates in the foreseeable future. The two-year note, the most sensitive to official interest-rate changes, was down 4/32 point to 99 28/32. Its yield rose to 4.950% from 4.879% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The benchmark 10-year note, the baseline for other types of debt, from fixed home loans to corporate bonds, fell 11/32 to 95 8/32 for a yield of 5.118%. ""The Fed looks hawkish,"" said John Canavan, market analyst at Stone &McCarthy, referring to policy makers\' view that the recent downtrend in price pressures has yet to be established in a convincing fashion. Mr. Canavan expects the two-year yield could head back up to 5% as investors take rate-cut bets off the table. That will flatten the yield curve -- the gap between short- and long-term yields, he added. Late in the session, short-term interest-rate futures contracts were showing 56% odds of a cut in interest rates to 5% by the first quarter of next year, compared with 80% odds before the Fed decision. The statement was ""more hawkish than I thought [it would be] -- it\'s out of left field,"" said Richard Gilhooly, interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. ""It shows [the Fed is] running out of patience on inflation,"" he added. With policy makers so focused on inflation -- and barring a serious upset in the U.S. subprime markets -- Treasury yields look set to hover around or above the 5% mark as the summer continues. Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers in New York, is among those who see an upside risk to Treasury yields from here. Mr. Matus said ""it doesn\'t make sense to me why"" the two-year yield ""is as low as it is"" at a time when the Fed looks as if it will stay on hold for a long while yet. And it isn\'t just the Fed stance that will pressure yields. Foreign central banks have recently seemed less eager to buy Treasurys -- another factor keeping yields on an upward path, particularly on the long end of the curve. The suspicion that market rates are unlikely to decline is also fueled by trends outside the U.S. Government-bond yields in Europe, the United Kingdom, Japan and elsewhere have recently hit multiyear highs lifted by stronger-than-expected growth and inflation pressures in many overseas economies as well. Indeed, several overseas central banks -- including those in the U.K. and Australia -- have had to resume increasing rates over the past 18 months, long after economists there thought the tightening cycle was over. Dollar General, CanWest Reconfigure Bond Deals Two high-yield bond deals stumbled, adding to a growing list of issues that have struggled to find buyers in the past week. Issuers accustomed to easily placing bonds and dictating pricing terms are suddenly encountering head winds from investors. Dollar General Corp. sold $1.9 billion of bonds. But it had to shuffle the deal to adjust to resistance to a $725 million tranche of PIK toggle notes -- which give issuers the option to make interest payments with more debt rather than cash. The underwriters handling the deal -- which included Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Wachovia Corp. -- were forced to keep the PIK toggle notes themselves and plan to sell them to investors in a separate offering in the coming weeks. The other $1.175 billion of the deal had previously been split into $625 million in senior eight-year notes and $550 million in senior subordinated 10-year notes. It was combined into a single tranche of senior eight-year notes noncallable for four years and sold to yield 11%. The bonds, combined with a $2.43 billion loan, will fund the leveraged buyout of Dollar General by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &Co. Separately, CanWest MediaWorks LP sold its junk-bond offering -- which had been downsized earlier in the day from $650 million to $400 million -- to yield 9.25% via Citibank and Bank of Nova Scotia, or Scotiabank, according to a person familiar with the matter. The maturity of the notes was also reduced to eight years from 10 years. Price guidance for the offering had been in the area of 9% to 9.25%. The deal will finance the company\'s transaction to go private. -- Michael Aneiro and Serena Ng License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service']",Treasurys Fall as Rates Hold --- Fed's Tough Stance On Inflation Leaves Investors Downcast,2007-06-28,The Wall Street Journal
94,2007-06-29 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- With the nation\'s underlying inflation falling, the Federal Reserve yesterday softened its hawkish inflation stance a bit while squelching any suggestion it might cut interest rates soon. The central bank, in the statement issued at the end of its two-day meeting, sidestepped the question of whether the current inflation rate is low enough. It emphasized that the outlook for inflation -- and not the latest inflation reading -- is now driving its interest-rate decisions. On that score, the Fed reiterated that its ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected."" As widely expected, the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its short-term interest-rate target at 5.25%, where it has been for almost exactly a year. In the accompanying statement, it said, that ""readings on core inflation,"" which excludes food and energy, ""have improved modestly in recent months,"" a more optimistic assessment than at its last meeting, on May 9, when it said ""core inflation remains somewhat elevated."" But it added: ""Sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures."" The statement appears to mean interest rates will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. Rate cuts appear ruled out by inflation concerns and rate increases are less likely than before thanks to a recent rise in long-term interest rates and continued weakness in housing. Futures markets responded by slightly lowering the odds of an interest-rate cut by year end. Analysts took differing messages from the statement. Thomas Joseph Marta, a fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, called the statement ""tight lite,"" with the Fed moving more to a Goldilocks scenario: ""growth not too hot, not too cold, and inflation certainly better, but we\'ve got to keep an eye on it."" But others found the statement almost grudging in its acknowledgment of improved inflation. It ""maintains a firm inflation bias and is telling us that this will not change soon,"" Bruce Kasman, chief economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, said in a note to clients. By dropping its description of core inflation as ""elevated,"" the Fed implicitly acknowledged that, at least for some policy makers, the latest inflation rate is no longer undesirably high. Core inflation as measured by the Fed\'s preferred benchmark, the price index of personal-consumption expenditures, dropped to 2% in April from 2.4% in February. Revisions to first-quarter data released yesterday suggest the decline was less pronounced. The May core inflation, to be reported today, may remain at 2% rather than the 1.9% widely expected before yesterday\'s revisions were reported. Even so, that would be at the bottom of the 2% to 2.25% year-end range the FOMC projected in February, meaning inflation is easing ahead of schedule. The Fed doesn\'t have an inflation target. Some Fed officials say their ""comfort zone"" for inflation is 1% to 2% and see a number much above 1.5% as too high. Yet others may think 2% or slightly lower acceptable, noting that is the target chosen by many foreign central banks. The Fed\'s omission of ""elevated"" helps investors ""further pinpoint the higher end of"" Chairman Ben Bernanke\'s preferred range for inflation, argued Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, a Chicago financial-research firm. Still, with the FOMC in the midst of a lengthy debate on how to better communicate, yesterday\'s statement was less a wink at an implicit target and more an attempt to sidestep the issue altogether. More importantly, the Fed emphasized that it isn\'t enough for inflation to be low now, it must also remain low for the next few years. On that score, it still sees risks it could move higher. With unemployment hovering near a six-year low of 4.5%, policy makers suspect the economy has little, if any, spare capacity, and firms and workers might have greater than usual ability to raise prices and wages. Yesterday the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance fell 13,000 last week to 313,000, reversing three straight increases, suggesting the job market remains healthy. The Commerce Department yesterday also revised up its estimate of first-quarter growth to 0.7% at an annual rate from 0.6%, primarily due to higher exports than previously estimated. Economists generally expect growth to rebound to above 3% in the quarter now ending. Still, the likelihood of a Fed rate increase also appears to be receding. The run-up in Treasury bond yields, from below 4.7% in May to about 5.1% now, appears driven in part by growing risk aversion by investors previously willing to accept the same return on long-term as short-term bonds. That risk aversion is also evident in corporate debt markets and will likely restrain growth, and housing in particular. Demand for housing also appears to still be falling, posing a continuing risk to the economy.

95,2007-06-29 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar rebounded from a three-day rally in the yen after the Federal Reserve offered reassuring words on the U.S. economy, which calmed the frayed nerves of yen-funded carry-trade investors. The dollar had already started to reverse the three-day yen rally before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended, amid market expectations that the FOMC wouldn\'t make comments that could roil the markets. The FOMC didn\'t disappoint. It left rates on hold at 5.25% for the eighth straight time and continued to say it expects the U.S. economy to see ""moderate"" growth over the next few months. That further eased recent worries among carry-trade investors, who borrow yen at low interest rates to buy higher-yielding currencies such as the dollar, that U.S. subprime mortgage sector problems could spill into the broader U.S. or global economies. ""The fear was that the Fed may be a bit dovish"" on U.S. growth and inflation worries, said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""If they were, that may have reignited recent fears amongst carry-trade investors."" In New York late yesterday, the dollar was at 123.21 yen from 122.65 yen, while the euro was at $1.3438 from $1.3449. The euro was at 165.57 yen compared with 164.96 yen. The dollar was at 1.2318 Swiss Francs from 1.2291, while the British pound traded at $2.0016 from $1.9989.

96,2007-12-12 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- With a deepening credit crunch threatening to drag the stalled U.S. economy into recession, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time since August, and left the door open to further cuts. But yesterday\'s moves, at the low end of Wall Street\'s hopes, disappointed investors, who had looked to the Fed to do more to thaw frozen credit markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply, undoing about a third of the run-up in stocks triggered in late November when top Fed officials first publicly signaled that another rate cut was likely. The blue-chip average ended the day at 13432.77, down 294.26 points, or 2.1%. The Fed lowered its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter percentage point to 4.25%. It also cut the discount rate, at which it lends directly to banks, by the same amount, to 4.75%. Fed officials, however, continue to consider ways of using various tools -- including the discount rate -- to combat banks\' unwillingness to lend even to each other, which they view as a threat to economic growth. The central bank could take action within days. A variety of steps, widely discussed in the markets, are likely to be on the table, including another cut in the discount rate, longer-term loans to money-market dealers, easier collateral rules for loans from the Fed, and other steps last taken in 1999 to alleviate funding pressures ahead of the year 2000, when many feared a ""Y2K"" computer bug would disrupt markets and create economic havoc. Changes in the discount rate can be made by the Fed board in Washington without the approval of the entire 17-member policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the federal-funds rate target. Some on Wall Street yesterday criticized the Fed\'s actions so far as inadequate. ""From talking to clients and traders, there is in their view no question the Fed has fallen way behind the curve,"" said David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley. ""There\'s a growing sense the Fed doesn\'t get it."" Markets believe a weakening economy will force the Fed to cut rates even more than they expected before yesterday, Mr. Greenlaw said. Futures markets anticipate another cut in January and a federal-funds rate of 3.25% by next fall. In its statement yesterday, the Fed said that its quarter-point rate cut, which pushed the federal-funds rate a full percentage point below where it stood in early August, ""should help promote moderate growth over time."" In October, the central bank said the risks of weaker growth and of higher inflation were roughly balanced, signaling it didn\'t expect to cut rates again. Yesterday, the Fed declined to give an explicit indication of its next move. It said it will assess financial and other developments and ""act as needed."" The Fed\'s language left its options open for its next meeting in late January. The FOMC\'s 10 voting members approved the rate cut 9-1. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren dissented in favor of a sharper, half-point cut. One FOMC member also dissented in October, but in favor of no rate cut. The shift in the dissents, from wanting less rate cutting to wanting more, shows the turn toward pessimism at the Fed. ""Economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending,"" the Fed said yesterday. ""Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks."" Unlike the previous two rate cuts, yesterday\'s wasn\'t portrayed as ""insurance"" against improbable but potentially damaging economic scenarios. That suggests Fed officials view the economy as weaker than they expected as recently as late October. Corporate executives are also signaling a more downbeat outlook. ""I\'m not going to put a happy face on this. Consumers are going to be a challenge in 2008,"" General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt told investors yesterday. But global growth is ""as strong as ever,"" he added. When Fed policy makers met in late October, financial markets were in better shape than they had been in August, and the economy had just posted a strong third-quarter performance. They chose to cut rates by a quarter point and concluded that would likely be enough. But in subsequent weeks, markets reversed course as big losses tied to soured mortgage-related investments cut into the capital of major banks and other financial institutions, limiting their ability to lend. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chairman Donald Kohn signaled their increased concern in speeches in late November, foreshadowing yesterday\'s rate cut. Even so, investors, who have persistently had a gloomier outlook than the Fed, were disappointed the Fed didn\'t cut rates more or signal greater willingness to do so. ""Well, the boys blew it again. You wonder which economy they are looking at and what it is they are thinking about,"" said Alfred Kugel, Chicago-based chief investment strategist for investment-management firm Atlantic Trust of Atlanta. Bond prices shot up yesterday and yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell sharply. The 10-year Treasury note\'s yield dropped to 3.97% from 4.1% just before the announcement, while the two-year note\'s yield, which is especially sensitive to expectations of Fed action, fell to 2.92% from 3.13%. Yields on corporate bonds rose relative to Treasurys. Major banks, meanwhile, lowered their prime lending rates, the benchmark for many consumer and business loan rates, to 7.25% from 7.5%. The Fed has found it especially difficult to discern the economy\'s path and thus the right level for rates because the main threat facing the economy is the reluctance of banks and investors to lend to home buyers, businesses and consumers. That\'s harder to measure than the things that usually drive the business cycle -- such as profits, inventories, employment and the Fed\'s own interest-rate actions. Brian Sack, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, said that in 2001 the major shock to the economy was the stock market. ""We have a better shot at trying to calibrate those wealth effects, whereas the credit turmoil has many dimensions to it. Frankly it\'s hard to assess how much economic restraint you get from those various dimensions."" In the past month, data on the so-called real economy have been soft but not dramatically so. Macroeconomic Advisers said yesterday it now expects the economy to shrink marginally during the current quarter, then grow at a 1.8% annual rate in the first quarter of 2008. On the other hand, credit markets have tightened sharply. Since Oct. 31, the yields on securities backed by auto loans have jumped to 6.3% from 5.4%, while yields on securities backed by home-equity loans have jumped to 7.7% from 6.6%, according to J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. Rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages -- those larger than $417,000 -- are around 6.9%, up from 6.6%. The London interbank offered rate, the rate banks charge each other for three-month loans in the offshore market -- is a full percentage point above the expected federal-funds rate; it is typically less than a tenth of a point higher. There isn\'t yet evidence these higher rates have significantly bit into consumer spending, outside of housing, and the rates could drop after year-end funding pressures ease. But investors generally don\'t expect that to happen. A survey by Macroeconomic Advisers of 55 clients, mostly hedge funds and other sophisticated investors, found most expect little retracement of the wide spreads between yields on risky debt and Treasury yields by next year, and most expect banks to curtail lending. ""The possibility of a widespread pullback in credit availability is a significant risk to the outlook,"" the firm said. --- E.S. Browning contributed to this article.

97,2007-12-12 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The yen bested both the euro and dollar, as risk aversion swept through financial markets after the Federal Reserve announced a third-consecutive cut to interest rates to defend the U.S. economy. The yen surged on a sharp decline in U.S. stocks, with equity investors disappointed by the 25-basis point cut to the fed-funds rate, instead of a 50-basis-point reduction -- although few market watchers actually expected the latter. ""This is the bare minimum that was expected,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Consequently, the euro dropped almost three yen from its intraday high and the dollar declined almost 1.5 yen from its intraday high after the announcement. The euro\'s significant fall, just one day after striking a one-month high of 164.58 yen, helped boost the dollar against the single currency. The dollar was also boosted against the euro, said Robert Sinche, head of global foreign exchange at Bank of America in New York, because it is more attractive than it would have been if there was a 50-basis point cut. A cut to the fed-funds rate of any size suggests downside risks for the U.S. currency because lower rates reduce investors\' returns on dollar-denominated assets. However, the dollar\'s reaction wasn\'t as large as seen in the past, perhaps because the Fed itself stressed the current uncertainty. ""For now, the foreign-exchange markets will be taking their cue from other markets, like the commodity and equity markets,"" Mr. Sinche added. The euro was at $1.4653 in New York, down from $1.4717 the previous day, while the dollar was at 110.64 yen, compared with 111.68 yen. The U.K. pound was at $2.0337, down from from $2.0474, while the dollar was quoted at 1.1315 Swiss francs, compared with 1.1278 Swiss francs late Monday. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 9-1 to reduce the federal-funds rate to 4.25% from 4.5%, its third reduction since September totaling 100 basis points. It also cut the discount rate it charges banks that borrow from the Fed by 25 basis points to 4.75%. The market anticipated a cut after statements from several officials early last month, most pointedly by Fed governor Randall Kroszner, who on Nov. 16 said ""the current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year."" The dollar had retreated from its lifetime lows against the euro following that speech on the positive momentum it created in U.S. equities. ""Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing,"" the FOMC said in its statement, reflecting the ""intensification"" of the housing slump and slower business and consumer spending. The statement signaled an about-face from the previous Fed meeting, when the board suggested further easing was off the table. The Fed also dropped its previous assertion that growth and inflation risks were roughly balanced, opting instead for an open-ended view, and pledged to ""act as needed"" to keep the economy growing and inflation in check. The dollar and euro\'s subsequent decline versus the yen followed a typical low-risk appetite trading pattern. The yen benefits during times of risk aversion because Japan\'s ultra-low interest rates make the yen a funding currency for riskier assets when the market has a more positive sentiment. When that perspective shifts, the funds shift back into the yen. A similar pattern often aids the dollar against the euro and currencies like the Brazilian real, as it did yesterday. However, currency analysts say that the Fed\'s downside view of the economy indicates that this is no dollar rebound. Before the FOMC announcement, there was no significant U.S. economic data to sway the market\'s focus from the meeting and the dollar was largely rangebound. Today, the U.S. October trade deficit will be released at 8:30 a.m. EST, at the same time as November import prices. November\'s federal budget will be released at 2 p.m. EST. Late in the evening, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will close the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing, during which he had planned to press China to pick up the pace on adopting a more flexible currency policy. --- Dan Molinski in New York and Brian Blackstone and Henry J.

98,1989-10-04 00:00:00,"['The combined foreign-currency holdings of the Federal Reserve and Treasury totaled $34 billion at the end of July 1989, the latest reporting date. That figure had increased by $23.2 billion in the 13 months since June 1988, mainly by purchases of yen and marks. This activity\'s costs appear to outweigh by far the benefits. The legal basis for the Federal Reserve\'s intervention in foreign-exchange markets is questionable. The Federal Reserve Act provides no general and positive authorization to operate in foreign currencies. However, in early 1962, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, comprising the Fed board and presidents of the Fed regional banks) approved such operations with the concurrence of top U.S. officials. Congress, in the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, gave the Treasury a limited authority for operations to stabilize the dollar\'s exchange value. In March 1961, with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its agent, the Treasury for the first time since the late 1930s entered into foreign-exchange transactions for monetary purposes. The Treasury and the Fed effectively have been coordinating these efforts ever since, except during the the first Reagan administration, when no intervention occurred. Only since the start of 1977, however, has the FOMC approved an overall open position in all foreign currencies. Why do the authorities engage in substantial foreign-currency purchases? Has doing so achieved its objective? What costs are imposed on the economy? The authorities buy foreign currencies when they want to prevent the dollar from appreciating, and sell them when they want to prevent the dollar from depreciating. Ten years ago, foreign-currency reserves were $3.8 billion. The current figure is almost tenfold as large, a far greater increase than in the total assets of the Federal Reserve System, which less than doubled ($160 billion in 1979; less than $300 billion at the end of June 1989). The foreign-currency purchasing binge over the past 13 months has not prevented a sizable appreciation of the dollar. One dollar bought 1.758 marks and 127.5 yen in June 1988, and 1.89 marks and 140.4 yen in July 1989. Intervention has been ineffective because the Fed sterilized the monetary effects of purchases and sales -- that is, it contracted or expanded the domestic money supply to counteract the effects at home of its moves in the foreign-exchange markets. A major source of fluctuations in exchange rates is the change in relative rates of money growth. Differences in money growth rates tend to produce differences in inflation rates. Differences in inflation rates in turn produce either exchange-rate depreciation or appreciation. Since early 1987, with the exception of the months just after the 1987 stock market crash, the Federal Reserve has been restricting monetary growth; Japan and West Germany on the whole have been expansionary. Monetary policy was expansionary in those countries in 1987 and 1988 because they engaged in exchange-rate intervention in the attempt to prevent dollar depreciation and did not fully sterilize their purchases of dollars. As a result, monetary growth has accelerated in Japan and West Germany. A delayed result of these differences in monetary growth rates is that inflation is now trending down in the U.S. and rising in the other countries, with the expected consequences for exchange rates. Central-bank intervention in exchange markets has been a pointless activity that has imposed costs on the countries engaging in such intervention. One cost is an increase in exchange-rate volatility produced by the erratic intervention. A second is that the taxpayer bears a double pecuniary loss. The first arises from the Fed\'s sterilization activity. It offsets open-market purchases of foreign currency with open-market sales of Treasury and federal agency obligations. Although the monetary base grew by $10 billion from June 1988 to May 1989, domestic interest-bearing securities held by the Fed over the period declined on net by $7 billion. Net income of the Federal Reserve Banks, which is normally rebated to the Treasury, has accordingly been reduced. That is one part of the loss sustained by taxpayers, offset to an extent that is not reported by the interest earned on foreign-exchange holdings. The second loss relates back to exchange-rate volatility and the risk to which the taxpayer is exposed as foreign-currency assets held by the Fed and the Treasury balloon. By acquiring $34 billion of foreign currency, the monetary authorities have taken a speculative position that yen, D-marks and other currencies will appreciate in relation to the dollar. The Fed and the administration assert that the elimination of inflation is a major goal of policy. Yet in their foreign-exchange operations, the U.S. authorities are gambling that their own anti-inflationary policies will fail. The Fed publishes a quarterly report on its foreign-exchange operations three months after their conclusion. The report details the dates of purchases and sales, but not the prices at which it executed the transactions. In 1988, the latest year for which information is available, the realized and unrealized loss on foreign-exchange-rate transactions by the Fed was $511 million. The Treasury\'s losses, approximately equal, are not reported. No benefits offset the losses. Sterilized intervention has only temporary effects on exchange rates. The public has a right to insist on a full accounting of the realized and unrealized losses on official intervention in foreign-exchange markets. Is any congressional committee paying attention to these losses? Is there any other mechanism in existence for making the Treasury and the Fed accountable for their speculation in foreign exchange? --- Ms. Schwartz, co-author with Milton Friedman of ""A Monetary History of the United States,"" is affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research.']",The Fed's Costly Trips to the Market,1989-10-03,The Wall Street Journal
99,2004-01-29 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve\'s surprise deletion of a key phrase from its official statement on monetary policy sent shock waves through the bond market, with Treasury prices falling sharply. While investors had expected the Fed\'s decision to keep short-term interest rates on hold at 1%, the absence of the ""considerable period"" phrasing, used since August 2003 to describe how long the bank would keep rates low, caught market participants off guard. Many believe the removal of the phrase and its replacement with somewhat vaguer language signals that an eventual increase in the federal-funds target rate will come sooner rather than later. Prices plummeted in the immediate aftermath of the Fed\'s decision and the yield on the 10-year note shot up to 4.26%, a level not seen since the soft December jobs report encouraged investors to buy government securities. ""This was clearly a wake-up call for the market,"" said Craig Coats, head of fixed income at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods in New York. ""The Fed is seeing improvement or they wouldn\'t have done this,"" he added. Prices recovered from their worst levels in late trading, however. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 26/32 point, or $8.125 per $1,000 face value, at 100 18/32. Its yield rose to 4.177% from 4.078%% late Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price fell 31/32 point at 105 14/32 to yield 5.006%, up from 4.943%. In its statement, the central bank\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said ""it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."" While the change to ""patient"" from ""considerable period"" may seem like a subtle one to those outside of the bond markets, traders believe the shift indicates that the Fed will raise rates sooner than had been expected. Federal-funds futures contracts now indicate a roughly 72% chance of a 0.25 percentage point rate increase in June, compared with previous expectations for an increase in late September. ""I think it\'s basically telling the market that they may raise rates before they actually see a confirmation of growth in terms adding jobs,"" said Jim Caron, bond market strategist at Merrill Lynch. Some of the losses were reversed as the knee-jerk selling moderated once investors realized that just because the ""considerable period"" phrase is gone, it doesn\'t mean the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting. ""The FOMC now has the flexibility to raise rates this year, but they still have to remove the hurdle of `patience\' before they do,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Rather than the bond market wondering whether the FOMC will adopt a bias toward raising rates at its next meeting in March, traders will wonder whether it will drop the term ""patience,"" he added. The change in the statement also cast doubt on the safety of the so-called carry trades in which leveraged investors borrow at short-term rates and buy longer-dated securities. These trades have helped keep Treasury yields at their historic lows in recent months. Now that the timing of a Fed rate increase appears to be closer than many thought, investors who have favored these trades ""are going to think a little bit harder"" about staying in them, said J.P. Marra, head of U.S. government trading at Lehman Brothers in New York. The yield curve, which measures the difference between shorter-dated and longer-dated securities, flattened dramatically as the spread between the two-year and 10-year notes narrowed by 0.06 percentage point to 2.37 percentage points. Municipal Bonds Citing New York City\'s progress in reducing budget imbalances, Moody\'s Investors Service raised its outlook on the city\'s ratings to stable from negative. New York City\'s general-obligation bond rating is A2.

100,2004-01-29 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar surged across the board after currency dealers read a more hawkish stance into Federal Reserve policy makers\' outlook for interest rates. While the Fed\'s Open Market Committee left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a 45-year low of 1%, it surprised markets by dropping the closely watched phrase that monetary policy would remain accommodative for a ""considerable period"" of time, replacing it with a pledge to be ""patient"" before tightening. Even though most banks don\'t think the Fed will lift interest rates until later this year, or even 2005, the nuanced shift in language was taken as a signal that the central bank has gone one step further down that road and that was a clear boon for the dollar. Late yesterday, the euro was trading at $1.2488, around session lows and well below $1.2640 late Tuesday. It was also lower against the yen at 132.42 yen from 133.50 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose to 1.2552 francs from 1.2404 francs, while sterling fell to $1.8220 from $1.8277. The dollar rose to 106.02 yen from 105.64 yen late Tuesday. That the dollar clawed back so much ground after the FOMC was all the more impressive given that it had been under pressure for much of the day. The pound led the onslaught on the dollar earlier in the session, benefiting from a British judge\'s report clearing Prime Minister Tony Blair\'s government of a BBC report claiming a dossier on Iraq weapons had been ""sexed up."" Meanwhile, not to be outdone by the Fed, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand made a surprise rate increase, lifting its official cash rate 0.25 percentage point to 5.25%. The New Zealand dollar, which had traded higher ahead of the decision, was sold modestly afterward, trading at 67.72 U.S. cents yesterday afternoon in New York, little changed from 67.81 U.S. cents late Wednesday in Wellington. Elsewhere, Norges Bank, the Norwegian central bank, met market expectations and cut its key deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.0%, in effect today. In its statement, the bank said it took into account the fall in the kroner against the euro since December as well as a continued rise in equity prices at the end of 2003 and into 2004. Market expectations of a rate cut in neighboring Sweden influenced its decision, as did the lack of signs of a rise in global consumer price inflation. The euro rose sharply in New York trading, peaking at 8.7410 kroner, but then fell back to end North American trading at 8.7020 kroner, still up significantly from 8.6160 kroner late Tuesday. --- Jamie McGeever in New York and Magnus Hansson in Stockholm contributed to this article.

101,2004-01-29 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve has freed its hands for a future increase in interest rates. The central bank left its short-term interest rate target at a 45-year low of 1%. But the bigger action was in its language, which it uses in addition to rate changes to guide the markets and economy. In an important tactical move, its policy panel dropped the commitment it first made five months ago to keep interest rates low for ""a considerable period."" Instead, the Federal Open Market Committee said after its first two-day meeting of this year that it can be ""patient"" in raising rates because inflation is low and the economy still hasn\'t fully recovered. Investors interpreted the omission of ""considerable period"" as a signal that the Fed is closer to raising interest rates than many thought. The 10-year Treasury bond yield leapt to 4.17% from 4.08% Tuesday. Futures trading on the Chicago Board of Trade suggests traders have moved up the month when they think the Fed will start raising rates to June from August. The prospect of higher interest rates damped the relative attraction of stocks, which compete with interest-bearing investments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up almost 50 points earlier in the day, plunged after the Fed\'s announcement, closing down 141.55 points at 10468.37. The dollar rallied against the euro, since higher rates would improve the return on dollar-denominated loans. The announcement doesn\'t seem to suggest an interest-rate increase is imminent. Rather, it appears the central bank wants the freedom to raise rates if the economy continues to improve, without worrying about violating a perceived commitment to keep them down. ""This is tactical,"" said Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. ""It serves as a reminder that monetary policy will not stay on hold forever."" The rest of the statement suggested the Fed\'s economic outlook hasn\'t changed significantly since it last met in early December. ""Output is expanding briskly,"" it said. While ""new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labor market."" Meanwhile, excluding food and energy prices, inflation is ""muted and expected to remain low."" It said upside and downside risks to economic growth were ""roughly equal,"" while the risk of ""an unwelcome fall in inflation"" was ""almost equal"" to the risk of an increase. Economic reports yesterday suggested the expansion may have slowed in December though it doesn\'t appear to be in trouble. New-home sales fell 5.1% in December from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.06 million units, while new orders for durable goods -- those meant to last at least three years -- were unchanged in December from November. Fed officials feel underlying inflation, at about 1%, is already at the bottom of their preferred range, and with businesses operating with a lot of spare capacity and unemployment high, there is little prospect that inflation will rise from that level. Still, in recent months they have grown more confident that the economic expansion is unfolding as expected. Some officials think upward pressure on consumer prices and wages could develop before the end of 2005, and they would like to start raising rates ""well in advance of that point, rather than slamming on the brakes in the middle of 2005,"" said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va. ""This gets the market into better alignment with their thinking."" The FOMC, made up of seven governors in Washington and 12 regional bank presidents, of whom five vote, agreed unanimously to leave the federal-funds rate at 1%. The rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, has stood there since last June after 13 successive cuts beginning in January 2001. With its shift in language, the Fed has exited from an unusual experiment with verbal monetary policy born of last year\'s brush with deflation, or generally falling prices. Last summer, markets assumed the Fed would quickly raise interest rates to snuff out inflationary pressure, as in prior recoveries. In fact, with inflation so low and deflation still a risk, the Fed was prepared to wait much longer. But as long as markets believed otherwise, long-term interest rates would be pushed up, undermining the recovery. To alter their expectations, the Fed began saying in August that rates could stay low for a ""considerable period,"" departing from its historic practice of letting the markets decide for themselves what it would do. The commitment was almost immediately controversial inside and outside the Fed. Some policy makers thought it dangerous to constrain their future actions, when inflation could surge unexpectedly. Some Wall Street analysts meanwhile thought the Fed had encouraged rampant speculation in the stock and bond markets with an open-ended promise of cheap financing. Still, the commitment worked: It has held down long-term interest rates, such as on mortgages, supporting home sales and other interest-sensitive purchases at a critical juncture for the economy. Some analysts saw little change with the alteration of the language. Daiwa Securities economist Michael Moran said, ""The phrases `considerable period\' and `patient\' should be viewed as near-perfect substitutes,"" noting that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has used the word ""patient"" before. But for the Fed, the difference is crucial. With the change, it is now freer to act solely on economic data, rather than on any perceived commitment to keep rates low. The change in language appears to be the only result so far of a lengthy internal review of communications policy. Prompted by a series of controversies last year, the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee in October formed a working group headed by Gov. Roger Ferguson to study how it speaks to the public. The entire FOMC spent most of Tuesday discussing the issue. A Fed spokeswoman said Mr. Ferguson\'s group has completed its work. She said that while FOMC members aren\'t announcing any specific changes, ""they decided to gradually adapt their statements as needed and in response to changing economic circumstances."" She added that no decision has been made about releasing meeting minutes earlier. Currently, there is a wait of about six weeks. Analysts had speculated the Fed might start releasing minutes before, rather than after, its next scheduled meeting. In yesterday\'s economic reports, the Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods such as cars and computers were flat in December, after falling 2.3% in November from October. Excluding defense and aircraft, capital goods orders -- a barometer of business spending -- slipped 0.4%. The data may be distorted by statistical difficulties related to communications-equipment orders. Other data show a manufacturing and technology rebound, and tech executives are relatively optimistic. In a separate report, the department said while new-home sales fell in December, sales during the previous two months were revised higher. Homebuilders had on average 4.3 months of supply of homes, up from a low of 3.5 months during August. Mortgage rates have declined in recent weeks, which could provide a new lift to sales in the new year. --- Jon E.

102,2005-11-02 00:00:00,"['The Treasury market took the 12th consecutive quarter-percentage-point rate increase by the Federal Reserve in stride, settling modestly lower after the central bank raised the federal-funds target rate to 4% from 3.75%, while confirming that more increases are to come. ""The implication"" of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting is that the Fed ""is showing no sings they are wavering"" in the rate-increase campaign, said Anthony Karydakis, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in New York. With yesterday\'s rate increase, the federal-funds rate stands at its highest level since May 2001. Most major banks raised their prime rate to 7%. The accompanying policy statement was largely unchanged from that of the late September meeting, reiterating that the risks between rising prices and economic growth remain balanced. While policy makers noted caution about inflation and spikes in energy prices, they said that underlying inflation and inflation expectations remain contained. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 3/32 point, or 93.75 cents per $1,000 face value, at 97 15/32. Its yield rose to 4.573% from 4.563% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was down 4/32 point at 108 29/32 to yield 4.765%, up from 4.757%. The Federal Open Market Committee\'s statement confirmed what the futures markets have been pricing of late: Two more quarter-percentage-point increases are likely, which would bring the federal-funds rate to 4.5% by the end of January. ""The FOMC meeting is totally irrelevant,"" said Stan Jonas, head of interest-rate strategy at Fimat USA in New York, adding the ""only uncertainty is what happens post January."" Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan retires at the end of January. Former Fed governor and current presidential-economic adviser Ben Bernanke will succeed him, pending a Senate confirmation hearing. For the Treasury market, the latest FOMC decision and statement is unlikely to push yields much in either direction, said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley in Purchase, N.Y. ""The bond market, like the Fed, is data dependent,"" he said, ""and it will take some surprising numbers to merit a breaking of the current range in yields."" Surprises on the data front have been more to the upside than the downside -- the economy expanded at a faster-than-expected 3.8% rate in the third quarter, despite soaring gasoline prices and the damage caused by two hurricanes. The Institute of Management Supply\'s index of national manufacturing activity was stronger than expected, coming in at 59.1 in October from 59.4 in September. Some economists said the fourth quarter could see growth slow from the rapid pace in the third quarter, as consumer spending is likely to slow from the third quarter\'s 3.9% increase. Commercial banks are raising their prime lending rate to 7% -- adding to the interest-rate burden of some homeowners with home-equity lines of credit, which are typically tied to the prime rate. A year ago, the prime rate stood at 4.75%. As of June 30, the home-equity line of credit debt at banks, thrifts and credit unions totaled $628 billion, up from $486 billion a year earlier and $136 billion at the end of 1999, according to George Yacik, vice president of SMR Research, a financial-research firm in Hackettstown, N.J.   Junk Bonds Moody\'s Investors Service cut General Motors Corp.\'s ratings deep into speculative-grade territory yesterday, saying that the auto maker\'s continuing recovery plan faces significant hurdles. Moody\'s cut GM\'s long-term credit rating two notches to B1 from Ba2 -- a middling, speculative-grade rating -- and left the outlook negative. The ratings firm cited a familiar litany of troubles for the auto maker, including a recovery plan that seems to have stalled as car and truck sales continue to slide. --- Simona Covel and Danielle Reed contributed to this article.

103,2005-11-02 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for a 12th consecutive time, and will probably have to keep raising them until the economy slows, to keep inflation from rising. The Fed, as expected, increased its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4% from 3.75%. Its accompanying statement showed optimism on economic growth and concerns about inflation. ""Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity have temporarily depressed output and employment,"" the Fed said yesterday in the statement accompanying its decision. In spite of the damage and disruptions caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the U.S. economy grew at a 3.8% annual rate in the third quarter, its eighth consecutive quarter at about that pace. That\'s above what most economists consider the economy\'s potential growth rate -- that is, what it can produce with existing capital and labor. Moreover, the Fed appears to see that continuing, thanks to relatively low interest rates, robust productivity growth and ""planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas."" At the same time, the Fed warned that, although oil and gasoline prices have fallen from their levels in the immediate aftermath of the storms, the ""cumulative rise in energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" So far, though, ""core"" inflation -- which excludes food and energy prices -- has ""been relatively low"" and ""longer-term inflation expectations remain contained."" The Fed suggested it will continue to raise rates, albeit at a ""measured"" pace, which has come to mean a quarter percentage point per meeting. All 10 voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee agreed on yesterday\'s increase, unlike Sept. 20 when Fed governor Mark Olson dissented, favoring no increase. (There are normally 12 voting members but two governors\' seats are vacant.) All 12 regional reserve banks agreed to the accompanying increase in the less-important discount rate, charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to 5% from 4.75%. Many commercial banks raised their prime rate, the benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 7% from 6.75%. With the economy running out of spare capacity and showing no signs of slowing, Fed officials have concluded they need to boost rates further than they previously thought to keep higher energy prices from triggering a price-wage spiral. That will likely require the economy to slow down noticeably in the next year or two. That may happen on its own. There are scattered signs that the housing market is beginning to cool, and high oil prices have eroded consumer confidence. But without evidence of a slowdown, the Fed is likely to keep raising rates until it induces one. Last month, Fed governor Donald Kohn said that ""the economy would still seem poised to expand more quickly than the rate of growth of its sustainable potential unless monetary policy accommodation is removed further."" Markets expect the Fed to raise the funds rate to 4.25% on Dec. 13 and 4.5% on Jan. 31, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\'s last day before retirement. Ben Bernanke, chairman of President Bush\'s Council of Economic Advisers, has been nominated to succeed Mr. Greenspan. Markets see approximately 50% odds Mr. Bernanke will raise the rate at his first meeting, on March 28, to 4.75%. Since the Fed began raising the funds rate from a 46-year low of 1% in June last year, it has described rates as ""accommodative"" -- in other words, below some neutral level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. Fed watchers had assumed that at some point the Fed would conclude the rate is at neutral and drop ""accommodative."" Some Fed officials have recently pressed to drop the description. But it now appears the Fed will keep calling the rate accommodative as long as it expects to raise it further, even if it has passed most estimates of neutral, into ""restrictive"" territory. Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, thinks the Fed has to get the federal funds rate to 5% because the economy is running out of spare capacity, which heightens the risk that companies and workers will be able to boost prices and wages in response to the jump in energy costs. Inflation excluding food and energy prices -- the Fed\'s preferred price index -- was 2% in August and September, near the top of many officials\' ""comfort range."" Mr. Hooper expects inflation to go above that range, forcing the Fed to slow the economy down, to 3% or slower by 2007. In economic reports yesterday, the Institute for Supply Management said its monthly index was at 59.1% for October, down from September\'s 59.4% and contrary to expectations for a plunge. With the index continuing to exceed 50 -- seen as an indication that the sector is expanding -- and with new orders and employment continuing to show strength in the report, analysts are optimistic about the sector\'s future. The Commerce Department said total U.S. construction spending rose 0.5% in September for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.12 trillion. --- Joi Preciphs contributed to this article.

104,2001-08-22 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar moved lower against the euro and yen despite brief gains after the Federal Reserve acted to boost the U.S. economy. The Federal Open Market Committee cut the federal-funds rate (which governs overnight loans between banks) to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the seventh cut this year and bringing interest rates to their lowest level in seven years. Within one hour of the news, the dollar was at its intraday lows against its major counterparts. As active trading wound down in New York, the dollar continued to hover at or near intraday lows against the yen, euro, sterling and Swiss franc. The U.S. currency was poised for further losses as today\'s global session got under way in Asia. Currency trading hit a 10-minute lull immediately following the widely expected cut, as market watchers rushed to assess the Fed\'s accompanying statement, which noted a good a long-term economic outlook, but said ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" While the initial interpretation was favorable for the dollar, the realization that the U.S. economy remains mired in the same uncertain scenario appeared to outweigh the brief optimism for the dollar. ""This was bang in line with expectations,"" said Tim Fox, currency strategist at Standard Chartered in New York. ""The statement didn\'t give any particular new insights,"" but just helped consolidate the trend that was under way immediately prior to the announcement, he said. Indeed, the euro shakeout to an intraday low of 90.81 U.S. cents during the dollar\'s short-lived rally ""pushed some stops on the downside"" and ""leads me to believe the risk is to the top side in an attack of 92"" cents, a strong resistance level, said Thom Worden, senior vice president of foreign exchange at HSBC New York. Market focus is now firmly on the Aug. 30 European Central Bank meeting. A rate cut from the ECB could restore market confidence in the euro zone and support the euro further, analysts said. Meanwhile, capital-flow data continue to present signs of wavering foreign support for the dollar. UBS Warburg weekly equity-flow analysis showed net inflows to both the U.S. and continental Europe last week, but the U.S. saw net outflows to Europe. The Asia-Pacific region saw its ninth straight week of net inflows. Late yesterday, the euro was at 91.70 cents, up from 91.30 cents earlier in London and from 91.42 cents late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 119.59 yen, down from 119.90 yen in London and from 120.70 yen late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 1.6558 Swiss francs, down from 1.6616 Swiss francs late Monday. Sterling was at $1.4523, up from $1.4449 Monday in New York. In European data, Italian cities\' consumer prices for August came in at a rise of 0.1% on the month, and Swedish June retail sales rose 0.4% compared with a 0.3% fall in May. Swedish July unemployment came in unchanged from 4.2% in June. The krona has weakened sharply against the euro and dollar in the last few days, and traders believe more weakness is in the cards despite yesterday\'s positive sales data.']",Dollar Slips Against the Yen and Euro In Wake of Fed Interest-Rate Reduction,2001-08-21,The Wall Street Journal

106,2001-08-22 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Technology issues fell again and consumer names retreated as investors interpreted the Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates again as a signal that economic trends remain weak. A host of telecommunications-gear makers fell during trading. Communications-chip maker Broadcom shed $4.73, or 13%, to $33.06 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Optical-equipment maker JDS Uniphase, which hit a 52-week low Monday, fell further, dropping 44 cents, or 5.9%, to 7.07. Cellphone-chip maker RF Micro Devices slid 2.02, or 7.9%, to 23.54. Storage-software developer Brocade Communications retreated 1.60, or 5.9%, to 25.47. All trade on Nasdaq. The weakness came after the Federal Reserve voted to lower interest rates to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the central bank\'s seventh rate cut this year. Market averages, which had moved slightly higher, albeit in thin trading, ahead of the release of the Fed\'s decision, veered lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 50.05, or 2.7%, at 1831.30, the lowest the index has finished since April 9. Technical analyst Peter Green of Gerard Klauer Mattison speculated the Nasdaq composite could fall another 4% during the short term, given the recent technical patterns. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 145.93 points, a 1.4% drop, at 10174.14, its lowest finish since April 12. Though Wall Street accurately anticipated the result of the Federal Open Market Committee ruling, investors clearly saw the decision, as well as the accompanying commentary, as an indication that the economy hasn\'t responded to the Fed\'s attempts to stimulate growth. Abby Joseph Cohen, market strategist at Goldman Sachs, highlighted the state of corporate profits in a report released yesterday before the Fed\'s ruling. In the report, titled ""Closing the barn door on second-quarter earnings,"" Ms. Cohen reduced the firm\'s earnings estimates for the S&P 500, saying ""our original estimates for 2001 earnings were too high, given the weaker-than-expected economic environment and the aggressive charges taken by many companies."" Separately, Ms. Cohen said the deterioration of corporate profits had largely run its course, adding, ""This is a great time for investors with longer time horizons to rebuild portfolios,"" because valuations remain attractive, despite the weak earnings backdrop. Much of the selling pressure during the session was on stocks in technology, manufacturing and financial-services sectors, which have shown weakness in profit performance for the first two quarters. Dell Computer eased 71 cents, to 22.01 in Nasdaq trading, while Honeywell slid 85 cents, to 37.25, and Merrill Lynch declined 1.63, to 49.85, near the 52-week low of 49.66 set during the past week. The weakness in some tech stocks whose market performance has been the worst since the Fed started this cycle of rate reductions in January got even worse yesterday. Ciena, which set a 52-week low Monday, fell 1.04, or 5.7%, to 17.05; Tellabs hit a 52-week low, falling 26 cents to 13.61; and Nortel Networks dropped 38 cents, or 5.7%, to 6.23, another 52-week low. Disturbing signs in the actions of stocks exposed to consumer spending suggest investors are worried those consumers may not continue to hold fast in the face of economic fallout. Credit-card lender Capital One Financial eased 2.47, to 59.37. Americredit, a Fort Worth, Texas, financial-services company that specializes in servicing auto loans slid 7.40, or 14%, to 45.05; since reaching a 52-week high of 64.90 three weeks ago, the stock has declined 31%. Home-builder Centex fell 86 cents to 40.24. In a tough session for retailers, Home Depot fell 1.70 to 48.10, while Bed Bath & Beyond slipped 1.04 to 28.64. ""I think the market\'s performance has begun to tell you that consumer spending has become a definite worry,"" Bob Basel, a Salomon Smith Barney senior trader, said. Agilent Technologies fell to a 52-week low intraday but recovered by the close, gaining 36 cents, to 26.45. The Palo Alto, Calif., producer of semiconductor-making hardware posted a loss for its fiscal third quarter, and said it will cut 4,000 jobs. Macrovision gained 3.39, or 7.8%, to 46.60 on Nasdaq. Thomas Weisel Partners, in a research note, said the Sunnyvale, Calif., developer of copy-protection technology could benefit from indications that the price of digital-video-disk players, which use Macrovision technology, will decline further, spurring demand. Computer Associates fell 1.28 to 32.44, amid indications that a dissident-shareholder group, led by investor Sam Wyly, has gained momentum in its bid to unseat four directors from the Islandia, N.Y., software developer. Mr. Wyly\'s group won the backing of Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder-advisory service. Cypress Semiconductor eased 1.01 to 22.36. The San Jose, Calif., maker of integrated circuits, trading in a tough session for chip stocks, agreed to acquire In-System Design, a closely held semiconductor-design company, for $45 million. Medtronic rose 87 cents to 45.55. The Minneapolis medical-device maker reported fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped Wall Street\'s forecasts. Guidant added 3.40, or 11%, to 35. The Indianapolis medical-device maker reached an agreement with closely held Cook Inc. for exclusive world-wide marketing rights for Cook\'s drug-coated stent for coronary-artery disease. American Eagle Outfitters tumbled 9.06, or 28%, to 23.21. The Warrendale, Pa., apparel retailer reduced its fiscal third-quarter growth estimate because it is having trouble selling jeans. In a difficult session for retailers, Target declined 1.74 to 35.36, after the Minneapolis discount retailer said its fiscal third-quarter earnings will come in at the low end of Wall Street\'s forecasts. Talbots shed 3.87, or 9.5%, to 36.68. The Hingham, Mass., apparel retailer posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, but cautioned that comparable-store sales figures for September and October will decline from year-earlier totals. Alcoa fell 40 cents to 37.40. The aluminum giant\'s Alcoa Fujikura unit acquired Laser Armor Tech, a developer of stainless-steel tubes for optical fibers, from closely held Cook Group. Immunex added 64 cents to 16.86 on Nasdaq. The Seattle drug developer reported encouraging results from a preliminary clinical study of its Enbrel, which is used to treat psoriasis. Enzon rose 1.6% to 65.45 on Nasdaq. The Piscataway, N.J., drug developer posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street\'s forecasts. BJ\'s Wholesale fell 2.53 to 52.74. The Natick, Mass., warehouse-discount retailer declined despite reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street\'s forecasts. Calpine gained 1.63, or 5.8%, to 29.90, after hitting a 52-week low Monday. The San Jose, Calif., energy company said Monday it will abandon plans to issue new stock during the first half of next year if the share price stalls at its current level.']","JDS Uniphase, Brocade Tumble As Rate Cut Reinforces Pessimism",2001-08-21,The Wall Street Journal
107,2001-08-22 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, citing continued weakness in business investment and profits and slowing growth abroad, cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to their lowest level since 1994. The cut, the Fed\'s seventh this year, lowered the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.5% from 3.75%. The Fed also cut its largely symbolic discount rate to 3% from 3.25%, prompting major commercial banks to follow suit by cutting their prime lending rates to 6.5% from 6.75%. The statement accompanying the Fed\'s action suggested that policy makers see the economy much as they have for the past few months: torn between weak business spending and foreign growth on the one hand and continued demand from consumers on the other. ""Household demand has been sustained, but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken and growth abroad is slowing, weighing on the U.S. economy,"" the Fed said. The Fed also indicated it was more likely to lower than raise rates in the future, saying risks were ""weighted mainly toward . . . economic weakness"" rather than inflation. However, with some signs of stability emerging and the full impact of interest-rate cuts and tax rebates yet to be felt, some economists saw hints that the Fed would pause now in its rate-cutting campaign. In its statement, the Fed alluded to monetary stimulus already in the pipeline, noting that yesterday\'s action ""brings the decline in the target federal-funds rate since the beginning of the year to 300 basis points,"" or three percentage points (though it said something similar in June). Its reference to ""sustained"" household spending was more positive than the ""weak expansion of consumption"" it talked about in June. ""They have acknowledged that there are some elements of firmness in the economy but that they may not be sufficient to restore the kind of growth that they feel is appropriate,"" said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va., and former senior Fed staffer. The downbeat tone of the Fed\'s statement helped send the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 145.93 points, or 1.4%, to 10174.14, its lowest level since April. Futures markets put the odds of a quarter-point cut at the Fed\'s Oct. 2 meeting at 70%, up from 62% Monday. Whether that happens depends mostly on developments in the interim. Merrill Lynch chief economist Bruce Steinberg said, ""The Fed\'s view of the economy was not as dire as in July but still gave no sense that the Fed saw an imminent turnaround,"" suggesting that a cut is likely in October. Recent signs have been mixed. Most manufacturers\' orders still are falling, according to surveys, and profit projections remain in free-fall. Some areas of previous strength, like commercial construction and auto sales, are also weakening. Foreign economies are slipping. But new claims for unemployment insurance have stopped going up and aggregate manufacturing output held steady in July for the first time since last fall. Retail sales appear to be getting a lift from tax rebates. Furthermore, while the impact of the Fed\'s earlier easing had been diluted by the failure of longer-term rates or the dollar to fall, both have dropped recently. Bill Dudley, head of U.S. economic research at Goldman Sachs and one of Wall Street\'s gloomiest prognosticators, thinks the Fed will cut rates again this fall but not necessarily at its October meeting. He expects tax rebates to sharply boost August retail sales, but that will make it hard for the Fed to know what the underlying trend is. ""I can imagine a scenario where the Fed saw the recovery in retail spending and decided in October to wait for more evidence"" before cutting rates again, he says. In yesterday\'s statement, Fed officials said slackening in job and product markets ""is expected to keep inflation contained."" That\'s the same language they used in their June statement. Still, in recent months, some members of the Federal Open Market Committee, made up of Fed governors and regional-bank presidents, have raised concerns about cutting rates so much that inflation becomes a problem next year. For that reason, Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said that unlike in previous economic cycles when the Fed cut rates until economic conditions improved, it may stop sooner this time. ""One reason they may want to be a little more cautious this time is that over the last year, as the economy has slumped, core inflation has drifted up a bit,"" he said. Though Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has been consistently optimistic about the inflation outlook, Mr. Levy said ""there are different members who are probably keeping a closer eye on the inflation numbers, and that concern, I believe, will mount and spread once we\'re into the economic rebound."" Only seven of the Fed\'s 12 regional reserve banks had requested yesterday\'s quarter-point interest-rate cut, the same as in June. That suggests ""some possible dissension,"" said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, surmising that most if not all of the other five would have preferred no cut. However, the Richmond, Va., and Kansas City, Mo., Feds, two hawkish banks that didn\'t originally request the June quarter-point cut, did request yesterday\'s, suggesting some hawks have become either more worried about the economy or less worried about inflation during the past two months. --- Journal Link: Read the Fed\'s latest policy statement and see background information on interest rates, in the online Journal at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.']","Fed Cuts Rates to Lowest Level Since '94 --- Quarter-Point Reduction Tied to Slump Overseas, Weak Business Climate",2001-08-21,The Wall Street Journal
108,2001-08-22 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar moved lower against the euro and yen despite brief gains after the Federal Reserve acted to boost the U.S. economy. The Federal Open Market Committee cut the federal-funds rate (which governs overnight loans between banks) to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the seventh cut this year and bringing interest rates to their lowest level in seven years. Within one hour of the news, the dollar was at its intraday lows against its major counterparts. As active trading wound down in New York, the dollar continued to hover at or near intraday lows against the yen, euro, sterling and Swiss franc. The U.S. currency was poised for further losses as today\'s global session got under way in Asia. Currency trading hit a 10-minute lull immediately following the widely expected cut, as market watchers rushed to assess the Fed\'s accompanying statement, which noted a good a long-term economic outlook, but said ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" While the initial interpretation was favorable for the dollar, the realization that the U.S. economy remains mired in the same uncertain scenario appeared to outweigh the brief optimism for the dollar. ""This was bang in line with expectations,"" said Tim Fox, currency strategist at Standard Chartered in New York. ""The statement didn\'t give any particular new insights,"" but just helped consolidate the trend that was under way immediately prior to the announcement, he said. Indeed, the euro shakeout to an intraday low of 90.81 U.S. cents during the dollar\'s short-lived rally ""pushed some stops on the downside"" and ""leads me to believe the risk is to the top side in an attack of 92"" cents, a strong resistance level, said Thom Worden, senior vice president of foreign exchange at HSBC New York. Market focus is now firmly on the Aug. 30 European Central Bank meeting. A rate cut from the ECB could restore market confidence in the euro zone and support the euro further, analysts said. Meanwhile, capital-flow data continue to present signs of wavering foreign support for the dollar. UBS Warburg weekly equity-flow analysis showed net inflows to both the U.S. and continental Europe last week, but the U.S. saw net outflows to Europe. The Asia-Pacific region saw its ninth straight week of net inflows. Late yesterday, the euro was at 91.70 cents, up from 91.30 cents earlier in London and from 91.42 cents late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 119.59 yen, down from 119.90 yen in London and from 120.70 yen late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 1.6558 Swiss francs, down from 1.6616 Swiss francs late Monday. Sterling was at $1.4523, up from $1.4449 Monday in New York. In European data, Italian cities\' consumer prices for August came in at a rise of 0.1% on the month, and Swedish June retail sales rose 0.4% compared with a 0.3% fall in May. Swedish July unemployment came in unchanged from 4.2% in June. The krona has weakened sharply against the euro and dollar in the last few days, and traders believe more weakness is in the cards despite yesterday\'s positive sales data.']",Dollar Slips Against the Yen and Euro In Wake of Fed Interest-Rate Reduction,2001-08-21,The Wall Street Journal

110,2000-08-23 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- Acknowledging that recent economic data point to a cooling economy, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady again, although policy makers said they remain concerned about inflation. The central bank\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee left the target for the federal funds rate -- used by banks for overnight lending -- unchanged at 6.5%, a nine-year-high that it reached after a half-point increase in May. In a statement accompanying the decision, the Fed said growth is moderating toward a pace closer to the economy\'s ""potential,"" while continued gains in work-force efficiency are ""containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures."" The closely watched decision marks the second time in a row that central-bank officials have met and decided against boosting interest rates. Many analysts now think the Fed is likely to stay on the sidelines until at least mid-November. The Fed\'s next meeting is scheduled for Oct. 3, and policy makers are believed to be reluctant to take action so close to an election. The decision came as little surprise to many analysts and market-watchers, who had grown increasingly confident the Fed would decide to sit back and watch the effects of its six interest-rate increases since June 1999. In recent weeks, a range of data -- from moderating consumer demand numbers to a job market that shows early signs of softening -- painted a picture of an economy that continues to work toward a ""soft landing"" of slower growth and almost nonexistent inflation. Yesterday\'s statement was noticeably more optimistic than the one the Fed issued after deciding to keep rates steady in June. When explaining the June decision, the central bank cautioned that signs the economy was slowing to a sustainable pace were ""tentative and preliminary,"" a qualification the Fed elected not to repeat. This time, the statement also suggested many Fed officials are increasing their estimate of the economy\'s speed limit. It said that ""more rapid advances"" in productivity have been ""raising"" the economy\'s ""potential growth rate."" Still, yesterday\'s statement leaves little doubt officials from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on down remain wary about a pickup in inflation. It points out that imbalances remain between the levels of demand and supply in the economy amid one of the tightest job markets in decades. It also emphasizes that the Fed worries that the risks facing the economy continue ""to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future."" Despite widespread anticipation by markets of the announcement, the Fed\'s decision pushed the stock market higher as investors concluded that the central bank\'s rate-increase campaign would for all intents and purposes be put on hold until year end. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 59.34, or 0.54%, to 11139.15, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was at 3958.21, up 5.06, or 0.13%. While Fed officials would be reluctant to acknowledge that they pay much attention to politics, the November elections make it less likely that the central bank will raise rates in October. The last time the Fed raised rates in the meeting close to a presidential election was in 1980, when the economy was in the throes of stagnant growth and rampant inflation. This year, analysts say they are hard-pressed to think of a scenario in which future data would be worrisome enough for the central bank to conclude that it couldn\'t wait until its Nov. 15 meeting to take action. ""The Fed would have to perceive that the cost of not going would be greater than the cost of going. It would have to be a situation where the Fed\'s concerns about its own credibility or the risk of inflation overrode its sensitivities to the political process,"" said Robert DiClemente, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ""But it\'s difficult to imagine the kind of circumstances emerging that couldn\'t wait six weeks."" Mr. DiClemente speculated that the type of worst-case scenario that could persuade Fed decision-makers to move again in October would include further declines in the unemployment rate alongside a pickup in the pace of job creation and sharp increases in commodity prices, import prices or prices for goods still in the pipeline. ""So far,"" he added, ""there are no signs whatsoever that that\'s where things are heading."" Several analysts said gains in work-force productivity -- which rose 5.3% in the second quarter, posting its largest yearly gain in nearly 17 years -- were the biggest factor keeping the Fed from raising rates. --- Journal Link: Read the Fed\'s latest policy statement and see background information on interest rates, in the online Journal at WSJ.com.']",Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged --- Specter of Inflation Remains A Concern as Economy Grows More Moderately,2000-08-22,The Wall Street Journal
111,2000-08-23 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- While options traders let out a collective yawn yesterday in response to news that the Federal Open Market Committee left rates alone, the rate-sensitive financial sector extended early-morning gains. Citigroup Inc. and Chase Manhattan Corp. traded strongly. With Chase Manhattan\'s stock up $1.56 at $52.50, the September 55 calls gained 0.50 to 1.125 on American Stock Exchange volume of 2,865 contracts, compared with composite open interest of 6,067 contracts. With Citigroup\'s stock up 0.56 at 78, the September 80 calls gained 0.18 to 1.31 on Chicago Board Options Exchange volume of 2,404 contracts, compared with composite open interest of 6,829 contracts. Overall, rather than greeting the news as a buying opportunity, options trading patterns shifted into neutral territory. ""Boring,"" is how one trader described the session. ""I don\'t think anyone\'s around,"" he added. Many senior traders and money managers are traditionally on vacation for the last two weeks of August. The option market\'s fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, rose 0.06 to 19.62. When the index rises, it generally means that traders are getting uptight about the stock market. When the index declines, it often indicates that traders are optimistic about the stock market. The CBOE\'s equity put/call ratio was 0.48. The ratio is a contrarian sentiment indicator, which holds that if too many traders are bullish, then the smart approach is to be bearish. The index is considered bullish above 0.75; neutral from 0.40 to 0.75 and bearish below 0.40. The CBOE\'s index put/call ratio was 1.41.

112,2006-09-21 00:00:00,"['What started out as a pause in rate increases last month began to look more like a full halt yesterday. The Federal Reserve left its short-term interest rate target at 5.25% for a second consecutive meeting. It also warned that it remains concerned about inflation, and thus if it changes rates soon, it is more likely to raise them than lower them. The statement accompanying yesterday\'s decision suggested that, since pausing in its two-year string of rate increases last month, the Fed has become more confident that standing pat is justified. In explaining yesterday\'s decision, it cited the quickening decline in housing activity and easing inflation pressure from energy. Investors, however, increasingly expect the Fed not just to remain on hold, but to cut rates at least once by next June and again by December 2007. Ten-year Treasury bond yields have fallen, ending yesterday at 4.73%, down from 5.25% in late June. Those expectations may not match the Fed\'s, at least for now. Indeed, its statement did little to hint a rate cut would be on the table in the near term and financial markets pulled back slightly in their anticipation of one. Stocks, meanwhile, which have been rallying because of falling oil prices and on hopes the Fed is finished raising rates and the economy escapes recession, extended their winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 72.28 points yesterday to 11613.19, just 110 points short of its January 2000 record. In its statement, the Fed said growth is moderating, ""partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market."" By discarding last month\'s characterization of housing as ""gradually cooling,"" the Fed acknowledged the slide in home construction, sales and, in some regions, prices has picked up speed. It said that while the ""core"" measure of inflation, which excludes food and energy, remains ""elevated,"" it was likely to moderate in part because of ""reduced impetus from energy prices."" Oil and gasoline prices have fallen sharply in recent months. Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $1.20 yesterday, or nearly 2%, to settle at $60.46 a barrel -- their lowest level in six months and down 22% from the nominal high reached July 14. In theory, such a decline has mixed implications for the Fed. Lower energy prices reduce inflationary pressure, which would call for the Fed to lower rates. They also boost consumer purchasing power, which can improve growth prospects and would call for an increase in rates. The Fed statement suggests it considers the former effect as more important. While economists differed on what the Fed\'s next action is likely to be, they agreed that the small changes in its statement signaled greater comfort with leaving rates where they are, despite its stated bias toward raising rates. ""We see these wording changes (and absence of other potential changes) as a step in the direction of a neutral balance of risks,"" Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, wrote in a note to clients. He predicted the Fed would drop its bias to higher rates either at its next meeting, on Oct. 24-25, or in December, and would cut rates by March. The Fed\'s statement conveys ""more of a sense of comfort of being on hold,"" agreed Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at J.P. Morgan Chase. He noted that inflation remains the Fed\'s paramount concern. He also expects another rate increase by March. Ten of the 11 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee agreed to yesterday\'s decision not the change the federal-funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. The Fed had increased that rate at 17 consecutive meetings before pausing last month. As in August, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, preferring a quarter-point increase. It was the first time in eight years an FOMC member dissented at two consecutive meetings in favor of higher rates, said David Resler of Nomura Securities. The last time, he said, the Fed\'s next move was to lower rates. The Fed remains focused on inflation risks in large part because core inflation is above the 1% to 2% ""comfort zone"" of many Fed officials, including Chairman Ben Bernanke. In the 12 months through August, core inflation was 2.8%, up from 2.7% in the 12 months through July. Using a lesser-known price index that the Fed prefers, core inflation was 2.4% in the 12 months through July. Fed officials expect core inflation to move back below 2% over the next two to three years as energy prices stop boosting the prices of other goods and services and the economy cools. If that forecast doesn\'t unfold, it could pose a threat to the Fed\'s credibility that would require higher interest rates. The Fed\'s continuing concern about inflation seems at odds with investor expectations of rate cuts. Thomas Joseph Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says that while the Fed and his own firm\'s economists are optimistic the housing slump won\'t significantly hurt the rest of the economy, market participants are far more pessimistic. ""I\'ve heard traders say, \'Look, the Fed\'s wrong,\'"" he said. ""Traders are reacting viscerally to housing. Housing is something you see when you\'re driving home from the train station; it\'s very obvious, very visible."" Mr. Marta added, ""In terms of inflation, I keep whispering in the traders\' ears, \'Look, core [prices], hourly wages, unit labor costs, they\'re all at dangerous levels.\' They don\'t care."" Still, some economists say the bond market will be proven right. Paul Ashworth, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics of London, said if housing construction\'s share of economic output falls to the same level it hit in the early 1990s, after the last housing boom, ""you\'ll get a substantial drag on growth."" He expects growth to slow to 1.5% next year from a projected 3.3% this year, and the Fed cutting its rate target to 3.5% by mid-2008. Another reason for the disconnect could be anticipation of easier credit conditions globally. The U.S. bond market is increasingly linked to its foreign counterparts, and there have been signs of slowing growth in Germany, Japan and China in recent weeks. --- Online Today: Journal editors David Wessel and Dave Kansas analyze the Fed\'s decision, at WSJ.com/Video.

In a knee-jerk reaction, the greenback fluctuated in narrow ranges as investors digested the Fed policy statement that accompanied the decision. The dollar exited active New York trading slightly higher versus levels immediately before the release of statement, but still down on the day. With few changes to the central bank\'s Aug. 8 statement, the Fed signaled little new to the currency market, analysts said. Prior to the release of the Fed\'s decision, investor concerns had ebbed about contagion from Tuesday\'s bloodless military takeover of the government in Thailand. The Thai baht stabilized and spillover effects to other emerging markets were insignificant, causing the dollar to give back its day-earlier gains. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.2687 from $1.2679. The dollar was at 117.45 yen from 117.61 yen. ""The dollar is pretty much where it was before,"" said Daniel Katzive, currency strategist at UBS in Greenwich, Conn. ""Right now we\'re just going sideways."" Indeed, though analysts pointed to some minor changes in the wording of the Fed\'s statement, the modifications weren\'t enough to move the greenback out of its recent ranges. The ""tacit message"" is that the Fed ""is increasingly acknowledging that the slowdown is proving more severe than they assumed a few months ago,"" said Naomi Fink, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York, and ""that the downside risks to growth that the [Federal Open Market Committee] has acknowledged all year have begun to crystallize to a greater extent."" --- Dan Molinski contributed to this article.

114,2009-04-30 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve signaled it has no intention of pulling back from its aggressive efforts to revive the financial system, even though it acknowledged that the intensity of the recession has eased in recent weeks. The Fed said in a statement after its regular policy meeting that it would push forward with plans to substantially increase its holdings of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities in the months ahead, and suggested it could increase those purchases if markets and the economy veer further off track. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee reiterated that it will keep its target for its key short-term interest rate -- the federal-funds rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- near zero for an extended period. ""Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time,"" the Fed said. It noted that household spending ""has shown signs of stabilizing"" while businesses have cut inventories, investment and staffing. Still, officials are in no hurry to pull their foot off the monetary accelerator. The latest data have reassured officials that the economy is performing as their forecast anticipated, namely modest recovery in the second half of the year, with unemployment continuing to rise for several months. Considering the amount of slack built up as unemployment has risen and factories have curtailed output, officials see inflation as a remote risk, giving them a cause to continue to support the economy with low interest rates and aggressive purchases of assets. By purchasing Treasury notes, mortgage-backed securities, and debt issued by mortgage-finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Fed is trying to push down a broad array of long-term interest rates, particularly those that affect the housing market. As of Tuesday, the Fed had purchased $74 billion of Treasury securities, a quarter of the $300 billion it has said it expected to purchase by September. It had purchased or committed to purchase a net $381 billion of mortgage-backed securities, roughly a third of the $1.25 trillion in such purchases it plans. ""They\'re in the implementation stage,"" said Laurence Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, a forecasting firm. Some economists, including Mr. Meyer, believe the Fed might eventually need to ramp up purchases of Treasury notes, in light of the enormous amount of slack still in the system and the risk that inflation could become too low. The Fed has not bought as much of them as it has of mortgage-backed securities. Treasurys are a liquid market that could be easy to exit when the Fed feels the need to reverse its easy-money policies. The Fed left itself a lot of maneuvering room. In its statement, the Fed said it ""will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.""

Setting off the Wednesday session was a report from the Commerce Department that gross domestic product fell for three consecutive quarters for the first time in 34 years. Later, in an afternoon statement, the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to keep the federal-funds target rate in a range near zero and reiterated its pledge to keep rates ""exceptionally low"" for an extended period. Together, a weak domestic outlook and concerned Federal Reserve would normally lead to a sliding market. However, investors looked past the economic malaise, as they have done in recent sessions, and bet the reports signaled a trough. ""We\'ve moved from a max defensive position to a little less of one,"" said Gary Flam, a portfolio manager with Bel Air Investment Advisors. ""That said, we\'re not going out into the deep end, just moving out of the kiddie pool.""

116,2001-02-01 00:00:00,"['With yesterday\'s half-point interest rate cut, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan is hoping to lift the nation\'s economic spirits before they pull the economy into recession. Together with another half-point cut earlier this year, the Fed\'s actions mark the central bank\'s most aggressive easing move since 1982. But there\'s a key difference between now and 19 years ago. Back then, the central bank was struggling to revive an economy that had fallen into deep recession, with unemployment rates near the double digits. This time around, Mr. Greenspan is administering medicine to a patient who\'s still showing remarkable health, including a jobless rate that, at 4%, is near a 30-year low. More than usual, the Fed chief appears to be engaged in a game of psychology, struggling less to revive a moribund economy than to restore a sense of confidence to the nation\'s consumers and businesses. He remains convinced that the New Economy is for real, and that it promises above-average economic growth in the years ahead. But recent surveys show that many consumers and businesses have lost that faith. New evidence of their gloom came on Tuesday, when the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence had slid to a four-year low, taking its biggest hit since the 1990-91 recession. The survey showed that consumers have yet to actually feel much pain. But they fear worse times ahead. The week before, the same New York-based research group reported that business confidence had hit its lowest point since 1980. ""Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer-purchasing power and press on business profit margins,"" the Federal Open Market Committee said, in a statement that accompanied yesterday\'s cut to 5.5% from 6% in its target for the federal-funds rate. ""Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. . . . Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy."" The Fed\'s actions are aimed at Americans like Tim Bice, who owns his own small construction firm in Waseca, Minn. Mr. Bice has been contemplating starting a new business that doesn\'t experience the winter lulls that construction does. He\'s thinking about manufacturing homes indoors that can then be transported to a home site, in any season. He even located a place to start his business -- an empty radio factory. But in recent months, his enthusiasm for the project has waned. Business remains good, he says; if anything, he got to bid on building more new houses than was usual for January. But the outlook, he fears, is bleak. ""On the news every night, all these layoffs, people downsizing, everybody is talking recession, recession,"" he says. Fear of a recession can quickly bring on the real thing. ""Animal spirits,"" the British economist John Maynard Keynes once wrote, can hold the key to important economic variables, such as business investment. And new numbers out yesterday show that investment did drop in last year\'s fourth quarter. The government reported that the quarter\'s real, or inflation-adjusted, growth in gross domestic product slipped to an annual rate of 1.4%, its slowest pace since 1995. Household consumption, which makes up two-thirds of total economic spending, advanced at a respectable 2.9%. But business investment on equipment and software actually fell at a 5% rate -- a dramatic reversal from 21% growth in the first quarter of 2000. A big December drop reported last week in orders for capital goods, excluding aircraft and defense, suggests the capital retrenchment isn\'t over. That\'s being felt by companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the giant Internet-gear maker in San Jose, Calif. ""In November, when we first started to see a slowdown, we thought it would be a blip -- it looked like it wouldn\'t affect us,"" Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said yesterday, according to Dow Jones Newswires. ""But then in early December it was obvious that things were slowing down with many of our customers much faster than people anticipated. I became concerned when the Fed didn\'t move, but now they\'re moving."" The slowdown in investment is troubling for three reasons, says Joshua Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management in New York. First, it subtracts directly from total spending in the economy. Second, as companies cut back, suppliers of capital goods slash output and jobs, and their stock prices fall -- unsettling both employees and consumers. Third, and perhaps most important, if businesses slow their investment spending, that could undercut the rapid growth in productivity that has fueled hopes for above-average economic growth in the decade ahead. Many economists, including William Dudley, head of U.S. economic research at Goldman Sachs in New York, think Mr. Greenspan\'s rapid action now means a recession is less than a 50% probability. The Jan. 3 surprise cut -- which came between meetings of the FOMC, instead of at one of the committee\'s regularly scheduled gatherings -- helped stocks and corporate bonds turn in a healthy January performance. That makes it easier for companies to issue securities to fund new investment, and it makes holders of the securities feel wealthier and more inclined to spend. ""You don\'t want [confidence] to break,"" says Mr. Dudley. ""But the financial markets suggest we\'re not at that breaking point."" Mr. Dudley argues that maintaining confidence is the key to keeping a temporary slowdown from snowballing into a more serious recession. Since World War II, the unemployment rate has never gone up more than 0.33 percentage point during any period of economic growth, except during one strike-affected period, he notes. But in a recession, it has never gone up less than 1.9 percentage points. Once unemployment starts rising, it can be hard to stop. For all the talk of consumer confidence, business confidence may be just as critical at this juncture, and it is eroding even faster. When the key decision makers at the nation\'s largest corporations are feeling pessimistic, outlays by businesses for new equipment -- once a major driver of growth -- suffer. Last week, the Conference Board said that in the fourth quarter of 2000 CEO confidence plunged by its largest amount ever -- to levels not seen since 1980. CEOs\' expectations for conditions in their own industries six months from now fell to the lowest level since the survey began in 1976. Lynn Franco, who oversees the survey, says executives are quicker to shift their views on the economy than the average consumer. ""They generally tend to be a little more pessimistic,"" she says. ""The economy has decelerated so rapidly it has created enormous uncertainty in the minds of CEOs"" and chief financial officers, says Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. That\'s prompted belt-tightening at many companies. At discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp., for instance, where sagging revenue has taken its toll, that means a cutback in all planned discretionary expenses. Among its cost-cutting measures, Schwab, which is based in San Francisco, already has announced a hiring freeze, and has told some employees to take several Fridays off as vacation days. ""We had to look at all nonessential projects and other areas within the company where we could either delay or put off costs,"" says spokesman Greg Gable. ""We\'re looking at the more mundane areas, too, like limiting travel wherever possible."" Similar cutbacks are happening in other industries. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, says capital spending is one of the first lines of defense against falling profitability: ""Once businesses get in the mindset of cutting capital spending one quarter, they\'re not going to turn around on a dime the next quarter, particularly in view of the inventory overhang and high energy prices."" In recent weeks, the European Central Bank has constantly spoken of ""increasing uncertainty"" from the U.S. economic slowdown and its impact on the rest of the world. Its governing council gathers for a regular meeting today, though it hasn\'t indicated any plans to change rates. ""There are no signals yet that we should change our monetary policy,"" Ernst Welteke, an ECB council member, told reporters over the weekend, but an additional half-percentage-point Fed cut ""would certainly trigger a very diligent discussion and evaluation."" Yesterday, the Fed also cut the largely symbolic discount rate by half a point to 5%, for a total reduction of one percentage point since the start of the year. In its statement, the Fed said that ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future,"" which means rates are more likely to fall soon than to rise. Some analysts think the next cut could happen before the FOMC meets again March 20. While there\'s been little hard data yet on how the economy performed in January, Mr. Greenspan may already have gotten a glimpse of a report coming out today from the National Association of Purchasing Management, which conducts a monthly survey of manufacturing activity. A former Fed insider says the central bank often gets an early look at that report. The Fed chief also may have gotten an early look at some of the data in the January employment report, due out tomorrow. The pace and magnitude of cuts show a shift in tactics by Mr. Greenspan, who has generally preferred to move in small, quarter-point steps in order to avoid startling the markets. The half-point Jan. 3 cut took markets by surprise, and even yesterday\'s cut, though less than the three-quarters point some had hoped for, was more than the consensus expectation just a few weeks ago. Former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder says Mr. Greenspan is moving more aggressively because ""he sees a more pressing need than is normal. Second, the market has gotten better at thinking ahead to what the Fed is going to do. The result is that his previous worry -- that if you move too much at once you\'ll unsettle the markets -- isn\'t a worry any more."" Whether the Fed\'s action will be sufficient to revive the economy\'s sagging spirits remains to be seen. But some were optimistic yesterday. ""This half-point cut is exactly what was needed to brake our descent into a general downturn,"" says Mr. Jasinowski, the NAM president. ""The astute timing of the Fed\'s last two interest-rate moves . . . probably has prevented an economy-wide recession."" --- G.

117,2007-09-19 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar hit a series of fresh record lows against the euro yesterday, after the Federal Reserve sliced a half a percentage point from its benchmark lending rates to counteract the effects of credit-market woes on the U.S. economy. A cut by the Federal Open Market Committee was widely expected, but a unanimously voted 50-basis-point reduction was at the high end of currency analysts\' expectations and caught some off guard. The result was a spike higher for the euro to an intraday top at $1.3983, the single currency\'s peak level since its introduction in January 1999. ""It\'s broadly negative for the dollar, because of the lower interest rates and the outlook for rate differentials,"" said Rebecca Patterson, global currency strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. The Fed explicitly said that the cut was required as a result of developments in the financial market, said Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Citigroup Inc. That ""degree of responsiveness"" took the market by surprise, he said. Now, higher-yielding currencies, like the euro, are going to show gains, because the Fed has, at least temporarily, ""alleviated some concern among investors that these trades are going to see further pressure,"" Mr. Elmer said. The upshot is a re-emergence of the carry trade, which involves investors borrowing currencies with low interest rates, such as the yen, to finance the purchase of currencies with higher returns. The dollar rose versus its Japanese counterpart after the FOMC announcement, exiting from active North American trading up more than a yen on the day. In late trading in New York, the euro was at $1.3970, up from $1.3867 late Monday, while the dollar was at 116.23 yen, up from 115.17 yen. Also, the euro was at 162.35 yen, up from 159.70 yen. The British pound was at $2.0120, up from $1.9956 late Monday. The dollar was quoted at 1.1827 Swiss francs, down from 1.1868 Swiss francs late Monday. The FOMC also lowered by 50 basis points to 5.25% the discount rate it charges banks that borrow directly from the Fed. Last month, officials cut the discount rate by 50 basis points in a rare inter-meeting move and modified rules to encourage use of that facility. ""Today\'s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets, and to promote moderate growth over time,"" the Fed said in the statement accompanying its decision. It also said that core inflation has improved ""modestly,"" but that some risks remain, and that it will monitor price developments ""carefully."" In a departure from previous statements, the Fed didn\'t cite high capacity utilization, a nod to tight labor markets, as an inflation risk. It didn\'t refer to a balance of risks between economic growth and inflation either. But the worry is clearly on the economy. ""Given that Fed rate moves only tend to really take effect six months to a year after the fact,"" noted Naomi Fink, currency analyst at BNP Paribas, its decision means ""this may not be the end of the financial-market moves that we\'ve seen. . . . It\'s only a matter of time before the euro clears $1.40."" The yen could lose ground to the euro and the dollar as investors adjust to lower U.S. interest rates. ""Real money investors are still in risk-averse mode, trying to digest the impact"" of the announcement, said Samarjit Shankar, director of global strategy at Bank of New York Mellon, immediately after the Fed release. When the dust settles, he said, expect fresh carry trades to come with a renewal of risk appetite, in light of a favorable reaction by the U.S. equities market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 335.97 points by the end of trading yesterday. Elsewhere, Canada\'s dollar touched a fresh 30-year high again yesterday on the Fed\'s decision, with the greenback dropping to $1.0139 after the FOMC made its announcement. The Fed cut, said market strategist Stewart Hall of HSBC Securities Canada in Toronto, has worked to the Canadian dollar\'s advantage by underscoring the monetary-policy divergence between the U.S. and Canadian central banks. Canada\'s central bank has suggested that it is unlikely to adopt any rate-changing policies in the near term. The Canadian dollar had surged earlier this week, as oil prices continued to rise. --- Paul Evans in Toronto contributed to this article.

118,2007-09-19 00:00:00,"['Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke moved aggressively to stop the spreading credit crunch from sinking the nation\'s economy with a surprising half-percentage-point cut in interest rates, casting aside for now worries about appearing to bail out investors. The cut, which exceeded the quarter-point reduction most economists had expected, signals that Mr. Bernanke, fearing broad damage from the market turmoil that erupted a month ago, preferred to risk doing too much rather than too little. The move came amid a sizable drop in home sales, construction and prices that could send mortgage defaults higher and damp consumer spending. With yesterday\'s move, Mr. Bernanke may have shown himself closer in style and tactics to predecessor Alan Greenspan than some market watchers had suspected. That carries risks: Critics may start referring to the ""Bernanke put,"" as they once spoke of the ""Greenspan put"" under the former Fed chairman. (A put option protects its holder from a loss on an investment.) Yet Mr. Bernanke has shown that giving the impression he might be shielding investors matters less than keeping the economy out of recession. That\'s how Mr. Greenspan interpreted the Fed\'s action. ""The question they had to weigh was, \'Was punishing those [speculators] more important than doing something that they perceived to be in the greater good?\'"" he said in an interview yesterday with Fox News Channel\'s Neil Cavuto. The Fed cut its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.75% from 5.25%. It also cut its discount rate, charged on direct loans to banks, by the same amount, to 5.25%. The cuts sparked a rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up just 70 points before the decision was announced, soared 335.97 points, or 2.5%, to 13739.39, its biggest percentage gain since 2003. But in a sign some investors fear that the cut could also foster inflationary pressures, the dollar fell sharply, long-term Treasury-bond yields rose, and oil prices also jumped. Crude-oil futures surged 94 cents a barrel to $81.51, a second consecutive record on the New York Mercantile Exchange but still well short of the inflation-adjusted high of $101.57 hit in April 1980. In a break from the past, the Fed did not say whether higher inflation or weaker growth was its greatest worry or whether those worries were equal; it thus gave no hint about what its next move would be. ""Some inflation risks remain,"" it said. But ""developments in financial markets . . . have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook."" Markets put high odds on a quarter-point cut at the Fed\'s next meeting, on Oct. 30. The half-point cut put an exclamation point on a drama that began more than a month ago. At its last meeting, Aug. 7, the Fed left the federal-funds rate, its main target for short-term interest rates, at 5.25% and signaled continued worries about inflation. Days later, credit-market concerns erupted in Europe over losses in bank-linked hedge funds and off-balance-sheet investment vehicles that had purchased U.S. subprime mortgages. In the following weeks, investors and lenders became increasingly suspicious of each other and unwilling to lend, driving up interest rates for all sorts of borrowers. On Wall Street, cries soon rose for the Fed to cut rates immediately. Instead, the Fed on Aug. 17 cut its discount rate by half a percentage point and eased terms on direct loans from its discount window in hopes banks would use the Fed\'s cash to restore liquidity to credit markets. The aim, Fed officials said at the time, was to make a distinction between the Fed\'s role of keeping the financial system functioning normally, and its responsibility for economic stability. By contrast, Mr. Greenspan tended to treat financial stability and economic stability as inextricably linked, and saw a rate cut as the best way both to restore investor confidence and cushion the economy. His critics say those cuts over time emboldened investors to take on ever more debt and drive asset prices -- first stocks, then houses -- to ever-loftier levels, making the ultimate correction more painful. That criticism has intensified both with the turmoil in housing and the recent release of Mr. Greenspan\'s memoir. Mr. Bernanke heard that criticism, but ultimately has shown himself of much the same mind as Mr. Greenspan: the Fed can\'t take responsibility for asset prices, only for growth and inflation. ""Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally,"" the Fed said in a statement accompanying yesterday\'s decision. ""Today\'s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets."" Fed officials had been leaning toward a rate cut in recent weeks, but the case for the larger move may have been sealed by a report two weeks ago revealing that employment declined in August for the first time in four years. That showed the economy had slowed markedly even before the full force of the market turmoil had been felt. As recently as July Fed officials had expected the economy to grow around 2.5% this year. While the Fed has lowered that forecast, the size of its rate cut was motivated more by the wide range of possibilities around that new forecast, due to the still-unknown reaction of business and households to tighter credit markets. The larger-than-expected cut represents insurance against more catastrophic scenarios. The market turmoil is likely to hit housing first and hardest. Investors have grown wary of holding loans from all but the safest borrowers. That has led to a sharp jump in rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages -- those above $417,000 -- which can\'t be sold to federally chartered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The ranks of home buyers have thinned, especially in high-priced markets, and borrowers with shaky credit have difficulty finding a mortgage at any rate. The lack of buyers will likely drag down sales, make it even harder for home builders to trim bloated inventories, and force them to drop prices further. John Makin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said even with the rate cut, the economy will probably shrink in the fourth quarter of the year, though by less than if the Fed hadn\'t acted. ""If the economy continues to weaken, credit conditions will weaken again because [of] falling housing prices. You\'ve got to break that cycle, where you have bad credit, bad economy, bad credit, bad economy. They\'re taking a first step to break that cycle."" David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said even though Treasury-bond yields -- the main determinant of mortgage rates -- rose slightly yesterday, the rate cut might boost credit market confidence and lead to a narrowing in the spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields, allowing mortgage rates to fall. Several banks announced they were cutting their prime rates, the benchmark for many consumer and commercial loans, to 7.75% from 8.25%. It was only a month ago the Fed declared it was still more worried about higher inflation than weaker growth. Those concerns haven\'t entirely ebbed: yesterday the Fed said that while underlying inflation had ""improved modestly this year . . . some inflation risks remain."" Allan Meltzer, a Fed historian at Carnegie Mellon University, said the cut was a mistake, reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s, when the Fed put more emphasis on unemployment and less on inflation in its actions. That caused inflation to ratchet higher over the years until Fed Chairman Paul Volcker brought it down again. ""What\'s the market saying?"" Mr. Meltzer said. ""That this is an expansive move that will bail out the economy."" He added: ""I never believed in the \'Greenspan put.\' But the market believes it, and now it will certainly believe there will be a \'Bernanke put.\'"" Some Fed officials may have shared similar concerns either about inflation or about the risk of stoking further speculation. Only seven of the Fed\'s 12 reserve banks requested the half-point cut in the discount rate. Four of the five absent banks are headed by presidents who have raised such concerns. None of the four, however, have a vote on the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee this year, and that may be why the vote to cut the federal-funds rate was unanimous.

119,2005-07-01 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the ninth time in a year, signaling confidence in the economy and concern about inflation -- even as bond investors worry that a downturn is in the offing. The Fed, as widely expected, raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.25% from 3%. Yesterday\'s increase came exactly one year after the Fed began to lift rates from an extraordinary low level. But in that time, long-term interest rates, which are determined by market forces and are the benchmark for mortgages and corporate loans, have actually declined. That decline has fueled a debate over whether the Fed is going too far or hasn\'t gone far enough. Some say the Fed should pause in its rate increases because the decline, together with a downdraft in stock and commodity prices, foreshadows slower economic growth. Others say short-term rates should keep rising because low long-term rates have given an extra boost to the economy -- in particular housing. For now, the Fed is in the latter camp. In the statement accompanying its decision, the Fed said, ""Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm."" That\'s a more upbeat assessment than the statement after its May 3 meeting, which observed that growth had ""slowed somewhat."" Yesterday\'s statement said ""pressures on inflation remain elevated,"" though it dropped its May 3 assessment that ""pricing power is more evident."" The Fed said interest rates are ""accommodative,"" i.e. low enough to stimulate economic activity, and will likely rise further at a ""measured"" pace. ""Measured"" has come to mean a quarter percentage point per meeting. The Fed funds rate has risen from 1% to 3.25% in the last year, but at the same time, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage has fallen to 5.6% from 6.3% while the one-year adjustable rate mortgage has edged up only to 4.2% from 4.1%. Low mortgage rates have lifted housing construction, sales and prices to levels many Fed officials worry are unsustainable. Housing was the subject of a special discussion at the Fed\'s two-day meeting this week, according to several private economists close to the Fed. As they did with stocks in the 1990s, Fed officials disavow any responsibility for reining in a potential real-estate bubble. But they do believe housing activity and prices are fueling economic growth, adding to inflation pressures, all of which are reasons to keep tightening. Fed officials have also warned the banks they regulate against lax mortgage lending. All 11 voting members of the 18-member policy-making Federal Open Market Committee agreed to yesterday\'s rate increase. (One voting seat is vacant.) The Fed also raised its lesser-used discount rate, charged on Fed advances to commercial banks, to 4.25% from 4%. Commercial banks raised their prime rate to 6.25% from 6%. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor and now an analyst at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, a forecasting firm, predicted the Fed will raise the funds rate one or two more times, to 3.5% or 3.75%, then pause to ""take stock."" If inflation creeps higher, even dovish Fed officials will support further increases, he said. Paul McCulley, a fund manager and economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., a big bond fund manager, said yesterday\'s rate increase ought to be the Fed\'s last. He said declines in manufacturing activity surveys and global freight rates are ""screaming, unambiguously"" that the global economy is decelerating. But Jan Loeys, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan in London, says long term rates have been depressed because corporations around the world are investing and borrowing less than normal, and the extra capital has poured into the U.S., where investment is relatively firm. This means the U.S. is ""stronger than it otherwise would be,"" and the Fed should raise its short-term interest rate target to 4.5% by early next year. --- Journal Link: WSJ.com subscribers can see how mortgage rates have moved in the past year, plus search current rates on consumer loans, at WSJ.com/PersonalJournal.

120,2005-07-01 00:00:00,"[""The dollar slipped against the euro but touched to a 39-week high versus the yen, as reshuffling of investors' bets continued to drive activity amid a muted reaction to an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee adjusted its benchmark target rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25%. The FOMC has raised rates for nine consecutive meetings and indicated that it will continue to do so. However, the Fed decision did little to affect either the dollar's modest decline versus the euro or the sharp rally versus the yen that had come earlier in the session. Some analysts suggested that the yen's losses represent a continuing pullback in expectations for a revaluation of the Chinese yuan. The yen's fortunes in recent months have ebbed and flowed along with speculation over China's currency policy, since many Asian currencies are expected to appreciate if China does allow the yuan to strengthen. U.S. pressure on China to revalue its currency eased somewhat, when Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), and Sen. Lindsey Graham, (R., S.C.), said they had agreed to delay a vote on their proposed legislation to put a 27.5% tariff on Chinese imports to offset the impact on trade of China's currency peg. The news came following a closed-door meeting in Washington with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow. In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.2102, up from $1.2064 late Wednesday. The dollar was at 110.91 yen, just off the 39-week high of 110.99 yen it hit earlier in the session and compared with 110.55 late Wednesday. Versus the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.2817 Swiss francs, down from 1.2829 francs late Wednesday. The euro was at 134.23 yen, up from 133.33 yen late Wednesday, and the pound was at $1.7917, down sharply from $1.8045 late Wednesday. Traders will be looking to see whether the euro's rebound versus most currencies, as well as the broad weakness in the yen and the pound, are going to continue, said Grant Wilson, senior foreign-exchange trader at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. In general, the session was marked by weakness in both the yen and the pound, and by a technical bounce back in the euro which lured an array of buyers. The euro's advance versus a number of currencies, including the pound and the yen, helped lift the common currency versus the dollar. The yen's decline led to a fresh five-week low versus the euro and a 39-week low versus the dollar. Just days after the dollar pushed through the key 110.00-yen level, it was now knocking on the 111.00-yen level with an intraday high of 110.99 yen.

121,2005-07-01 00:00:00,"['The high-stakes game of poker between the Federal Reserve and the Treasurys market continued, with bond investors still calling the central bank\'s bluff over the extent of future rate increases. The Fed yesterday raised its federal-funds target rate by another quarter percentage point to 3.25%, and gave no sign that a pause in tightening is imminent. In reaction, long-dated Treasurys rallied strongly. This test of wills is the basis of a bet that could make or break many fixed-income investors during the second half of the year. It revolves around whether the Fed will halt its monetary tightening when the federal-funds rate reaches the area around 3.5% or 3.75%, or keep adjusting the cost of overnight borrowing in measured steps toward or beyond the 4% threshold. For now, the Fed\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, in its role as the ultimate judge and jury of the bond market\'s various swings in sentiment, is keeping its options open. At the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting, the FOMC not only met the expectations of a rate hike, it also released a statement similar in substance to the one from its May meeting. ""Although energy prices have risen further, the [economic] expansion remains firm and labor-market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the FOMC said. ""Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well-contained."" Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, said, ""The Fed is not giving any ground on the idea among many investors that a pause is around the corner. Even if they do decide to pause tightening policy in a couple of months, the Fed wants to maintain a restrictive face for the bond market."" The six-week hiatus before the next Fed meeting provides the market with some breathing room. But it\'s walking a very fine line. ""There is no longer much of a margin for error,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn. He noted that current market forecasts for the year-end federal-funds rate and Treasurys out to 10 years in maturity are all below 4%. Despite the current debate over the economy\'s growth prospects, some investors believe things are much better than low Treasury yields imply. Economic factors ""will ultimately prevail, and rates are likely to move meaningfully higher than they are today,"" said Colin Lundgren, head of institutional fixed-income at American Express Asset Management Group in Minneapolis. He expects rate hikes beyond the 3.75% expected by the market, subject to future economic data. Aside from data, the test of wills between the bond market and the FOMC may be resolved to some degree by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\'s semiannual address before Congress on July 20. ""Greenspan will be able to flesh out in great detail policy makers\' thinking on the outlook and the stance of policy,"" said RBS Greenwich\'s Stanley. This has the bond market prepared for another increase of a quarter percentage point, and some language that hints at a pause after one more increase to 3.75%. Should the Fed ultimately pause, one big change in Treasurys would be a widening in the difference between short- and long-term yields -- in market terms, a steepening yield curve -- as investors build an inflation premium into longer-dated Treasury yields. For now, flattening remains the driving trend. And in post-FOMC trading, the margin between two- and 10-year note yields continued to shrink, falling below 0.3 percentage point for the first time since the start of 2001. ""Most of the rally in bonds is explained by the compression of inflation,"" said Eric Hiller, head of derivatives interest rate strategy at Bank of America. ""The curve is certainly flatter, with some room to continue."" At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 face value, at 101 21/32. Its yield fell to 3.922% from 3.986% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was up 1 7/32 points at 118 15/32 to yield 4.193%, down from 4.263% Wednesday.

122,2007-05-10 00:00:00,"['The dollar rose against the euro and the yen after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and maintained an optimistic outlook on the U.S. economy. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee kept rates steady at 5.25% for the seventh straight meeting. It made no significant changes to its statement compared with the statement from its previous meeting in March, saying the economy is ""likely to expand"" moderately in coming quarters. While the Fed acknowledged weak first-quarter growth rates -- which last month helped send the dollar to a record low against the euro -- it didn\'t dwell on the fact as some currency investors feared. This suggests the Fed saw those weak growth rates as the ""bottoming out"" of the economy, and expects stronger growth going forward, said David Powell, currency strategist at IDEAGlobal. ""The big message [for currency markets] is that the Fed didn\'t have greater acknowledgment of slow first-quarter growth,"" he said. ""As a result, the dollar has rallied."" Late afternoon, the euro was trading at $1.3526 from $1.3543 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 120.05 yen from 119.93 yen. The euro was at 162.38 yen from 162.45 yen late Tuesday. The dollar was at 1.2185 Swiss francs from 1.2180 Swiss francs, while the pound gained against the dollar at $1.9938 from $1.9894 late Tuesday. The Fed\'s decision to shrug off the weak first-quarter growth rates is likely due to strong April activity readings on the manufacturing and services sectors, traders said. Those reports last week suggest higher growth rates in the second quarter, they said. Analysts also noted that the Fed repeated that its top worry remains the risk of a surge in inflation rather than continued slow growth. This helped the dollar because inflation can lead to higher interest rates and thus higher returns on dollar-based assets. ""The second big element behind the dollar\'s rally is the lack of acknowledgment that core inflation slowed in the last report,"" Mr. Powell said. Traders said the statement, while expected, bodes well for yen carry trades, where investors borrow yen at low interest rates to buy dollars or other higher-yielding currencies. Carry trades do well in low-volatility environments because investors can reap profits from interest-rate differentials without worrying about sharp changes to the exchange rates that may erase these profits. The Fed\'s near copy of its previous statement kept expectations for future rate adjustments little changed, suggesting the dollar\'s knee-jerk gains are unlikely to be sustained.

123,2007-05-10 00:00:00,"['They wanted change and got it, but nowhere near enough. Despite a tweak in its language on growth, the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision to reiterate that inflation risk remains its ""predominant"" concern leaves the Treasury market stranded where it has stood for weeks now -- range-bound and uncertain where to turn forsome clear direction. As expected, the FOMC kept rates on hold at 5.25% for the seventh meeting running, extending to 11 months the period in which the Fed hasn\'t adjusted rates. In its statement, the Fed budged not an inch on inflation, repeating that price pressures excluding energy and food remain ""somewhat elevated."" The market\'s reaction said it all. From little-changed before the meeting, Treasurys sold off across the curve. The two-year note, which was unchanged for a yield of 4.67% before the statement, fell 3/32 point, or $0.9375 per $1,000 face value, to 99 19/32. Its yield rose to 4.726% from 4.671% Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The new benchmark 10-year note stood at 98 21/32 to yield 4.669% late in the afternoon. ""I think that as much as anything it\'s a positioning trade . . . . A lot of speculative money was focused on the fact that five of the last six times when the Fed left rates on hold, the front end had gone on to rally"" after the meeting, said Jason Evans, head of government trading at Deutsche Bank in New York. ""The vast majority of people were long in anticipation of the meeting"" -- betting on price gains -- and had to reverse their bets after the statement, he added. For T.J. Marta, rates strategist at RBC Capital Markets, the most significant aspect of the statement was ""the pulled punch"" on inflation, which leaves market bets on a third-quarter rate cut precariously balanced. ""The fact that they could have downgraded their inflation assessment but didn\'t"" was what pushed the market lower, he said. For Treasury traders, the May FOMC meeting now passes onto a lengthening list of missed opportunities for the market to break out the ranges it has been stuck in. The statement reiterated the Fed\'s view that the economy will likely ""continue to expand at a moderate pace,"" even as it acknowledged that recent growth has slowed. Despite the weak first-quarter growth data, the tame March inflation readings and last Friday\'s softer nonfarm-payrolls growth, the 10-year yield has been stuck in a 4.60%-4.70% range for three weeks. It has been in a 4.58%-4.78% range for the last 5 1/2 weeks and in a 4.44%-4.78% range for almost three months. While the market has put a slate of bond issuance behind it and Treasury debt paydowns will soon leave investors flush with cash, there is fresh inflation data in coming days that could renew the pressure on Treasury prices if they don\'t conform to March\'s weakness.

124,2007-11-01 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar dropped to its seventh straight record low against the euro yesterday, a response to the Federal Reserve\'s cut in U.S. interest rates. The dollar also lost heavily against its Canadian counterpart, touching its lowest level in modern times. The dollar maintained gains on the yen, after the Bank of Japan voted to keep interest rates on hold during Asian trading. The euro broke the $1.45 barrier to $1.4508 after the Federal Open Market Committee announced its interest-rates cuts. At 4 p.m., the euro was at $1.4486, up from $1.4436 late Monday, while the dollar was at 115.35 yen, up from 114.69. The euro was at 167.10 yen, up from 165.67 yen. The United Kingdom pound was at $2.0793, up from $2.0683. The dollar was quoted at 1.1581 Swiss francs, down from 1.1590. The Canadian dollar extended its gains to C$0.9422, its modern-day high against the U.S. dollar. At 4 p.m., the U.S. dollar was trading at C$0.9448, down from C$0.9529 Tuesday. The C$0.9422 level dates from Aug. 21, 1957. It represents the strongest level reached by the Canadian dollar since the Bank of Canada was established and charged with managing the currency in the 1930s. Earlier versions of the Canadian currency reached their strongest level versus the U.S. dollar in the early 1860s, when the U.S. was still embroiled in the Civil War and issues of legal tender in Canada were fixed to the gold standard. Yesterday\'s late gains for the Canadian dollar were an extension of the rally set off following the Fed\'s cuts in interest rates. The Fed\'s quarter-point trimming of its benchmark rate eliminated the long-standing U.S. rate premium and brought administered U.S. and Canadian rates into alignment at equivalent 4.50% settings. ""As long as the Fed is the only central bank in the G-10 cutting rates, the U.S. dollar is going to underperform,"" said Sophia Drossos, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. ""People are contrasting the path for Fed and ECB [European Central Bank]."" After euro-zone data confirmed rising inflation, it is becoming clearer that the ECB will keep its rate on hold when it meets Nov. 8, analysts said. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority intervened in currency markets five times yesterday, selling 7.828 billion Hong Kong dollars to defend the local currency\'s peg to the U.S. dollar. Authorities in South Korea, the Philippines and India bought dollars, traders said, to limit the damage a strong local currency inflicts on their export-reliant economies.

125,2007-11-01 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point, but with an eye on surging energy prices and other inflationary threats, it strongly discouraged expectations of further cuts. The decision, following a half-point cut six weeks ago, shows Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is grappling with risks on two fronts: Plunging home construction and eroding real-estate values could hit the broader economy, while rising oil and commodity prices, combined with a falling dollar, could spoil the Fed\'s hopes to contain inflation. Developments yesterday underlined the tension. Though data showed the U.S. economy growing at a faster-than-expected 3.9% annual rate in the third quarter, a purchasing managers\' survey showed weak manufacturing in the Midwest in October, the latest in a series of such reports. At the same time, crude-oil futures prices jumped $4.15 to $94.53 a barrel, a nominal record, and gold futures settled at $792.00 an ounce, a 27-year high. For now, though, investors appear to believe neither of those scenarios will materialize. Stocks initially fell after the announcement dashed expectations of more rate cuts, but then recovered, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 137.54 points, or 1%, to 13930.01, less than 235 points from its record. The Fed cut its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.5% from 4.75%, after cutting it half a point in September. The combined cuts were designed, it said in the accompanying statement, to ""help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy"" from the summer credit crunch that drove up interest rates paid by many homeowners, corporations and banks. Growth was solid in the third quarter but likely to slow with the ""intensification of the housing correction,"" the Fed said in its statement. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, has improved, it said, ""but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation."" As a result, the Fed said, ""after this [rate cut], the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth."" In the weeks leading up to the meeting, Fed officials saw their choice as no cut or a quarter-point ease. But their room to maneuver was limited by the fact that markets had become certain there would be a cut and, by last week, perhaps even a larger, half-point cut. Many on Wall Street justified their predictions on the grounds that Fed officials hadn\'t publicly countered them. Fed officials don\'t like to do something just because the markets expect it. But with futures markets assigning a 92% probability yesterday morning to a cut, a failure to deliver would have been the biggest surprise in the 14 years for which comparable data is available, according to Bianco Research LLC, a Chicago financial-research firm. Many predicted that would have led to a stock selloff and increased reluctance to lend. Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who teaches at Princeton University, said, ""The Fed did not make their views very clear to the markets for about a three-week period in October when they could have. As a result, they wound up being pushed by the market. The Fed has a communications problem when the market\'s thinking diverges from the Fed\'s and the Fed doesn\'t say anything to get back in line."" But Mr. Bernanke has been less inclined than his predecessor Alan Greenspan to try to steer market expectations. And in any case, officials also saw good economic reasons to ease borrowing conditions. Markets remain unsettled and the housing slump could yet spill over more broadly to consumer spending, already weighed down by high energy costs. By some estimates a 4.75% funds rate is high relative to inflation and growth, implying the Fed was likely to ease eventually. Doing so now rather than later bought insurance against worst-case scenarios. There were hints the decision was a close call. Federal Open Market Committee members voted 9 to 1 to cut, the first time this year a vote hasn\'t been unanimous. Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dissented, preferring no cut. Just six of the 12 reserve banks requested the parallel decrease in the discount rate, charged on direct Fed loans to banks, to 5% from 5.25%. That suggests presidents of some of the other banks also would have preferred to stand pat. Just five of the 12 bank presidents have a vote on the FOMC in any given year. Perhaps mirroring the differing views inside the Fed, outsiders criticized the decision from both sides. Some said the Fed is underestimating the risks posed by the housing bust and credit crunch and will have to ease monetary policy again before long. ""The bursting of the housing bubble and strains in parts of the credit markets are profoundly deflationary events, and the Fed\'s concerns seem out of place,"" Bank Credit Analyst, a financial research service, said. But others say the Fed, despite yesterday\'s promise to monitor inflation pressure, risks stoking it. ""The Fed has to walk the walk as well as talk the talk,"" said John Ryding, an economist at Bear Stearns. ""They have to, should the numbers demand it, be willing to reverse the rate cuts. With gold up sharply and the dollar down, the market is still questioning the Fed\'s commitment to do what it says."" The expected inflation rate as implied by trading in inflation-protected Treasury bonds also rose yesterday, though that may reflect short-term trading dynamics. Despite the rhetoric, the Fed\'s leadership probably isn\'t too worried about inflation. Officials believe the tendency of a lower dollar or higher energy prices to become embedded in underlying inflation has declined significantly in recent decades. Their principal source of inflation concern -- the low level of spare capacity in the economy -- has waned as the unemployment rate rises and the economy slows. Wage and benefit costs rose at a subdued rate in the third quarter, the Labor Department said yesterday. The economy is expected to slow sharply in the fourth quarter as high energy prices bite into consumer spending and housing construction tumbles further. On the other hand, the Fed doesn\'t see the self-reinforcing dynamics that lead to recession, such as in 2001, when it had to cut rates repeatedly. Rather, it sees the economy as sagging temporarily, as the pool of potential homeowners shrinks to match the tightened terms of credit and the inventory of unsold new homes is worked down, after which it expects growth will return to a normal rate.

126,2004-03-17 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar hit a three-week low against the yen, but was little changed against the euro after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled no shift in the outlook for interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee not only left its key interest rate at a 46-year low of 1%, as expected, but also reiterated its stance that inflationary pressures are low enough that it ""can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."" Fed officials also acknowledged the recent batch of disappointing employment reports, noting in their postmeeting statement that, ""Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged."" The statement reaffirmed market expectations that the Fed would hold off from raising rates until at least late 2004, which may continue to weigh on the dollar. Low U.S. rates have been a major factor in the dollar\'s long-term downtrend because it makes it more difficult to attract enough foreign investment to fund the U.S. current-account deficit. However, the dollar was mostly directionless in choppy trading against most currencies after the Fed\'s decision. ""The dollar consequences will be marginal at best,"" said Jason Bonanca, director and currency strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""The Fed\'s still not talking about removing policy accommodation, [so] this is not dovish enough to reignite dollar bearishness."" Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at HSBC Bank in New York, agreed that the statement included ""nothing really new substantially to elicit much of a response in the forex market."" Instead, the biggest moves in the dollar came against the yen amid continued speculation that the Bank of Japan would ease up on large-scale intervention. The dollar fell as far as 108.65 yen, a level not seen since late February. The dollar\'s slide against the yen started a chain reaction during the New York session, pushing European currencies down. That, in turn, helped the dollar recoup most of its overnight losses against the European currencies, which were due in large part to continued jitters about an increase in global terrorism. Late yesterday afternoon, the dollar was trading at 108.84 yen, down sharply from 110.31 yen late Monday in New York. The euro was at $1.2264, down slightly from $1.2271, and was lower against the yen at 133.40 yen from 135.40 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.2784 francs, up from 1.2752 francs, while sterling remained higher on the day at $1.8110 versus $1.8057 late Monday. In recent weeks, the Bank of Japan, which intervenes on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, had apparently switched tactics by buying dollars even when the U.S. currency was rallying. The more aggressive stance was viewed as a move to push down the yen ahead of the March 31 fiscal year end to assist Japanese exporters and others that need to repatriate money. --- Jamie McGeever contributed to this article.

127,2004-03-17 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Indications that the Federal Reserve will remain very patient before raising interest rates triggered a strong afternoon rally in Treasurys. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s rate-setting arm, kept official interest rates at a more-than-four-decade low of 1%. The FOMC said the odds of an ""unwelcome"" fall in inflation are ""almost equal"" to the risk of inflation. The Fed also noted that new hiring has ""lagged"" -- a less upbeat view on labor markets than it expressed in late January -- and that it can remain patient in removing its policy accommodation. The statement turned around the bond market, which had traded lower in price prior to the FOMC decision, and pushed yields down to near eight-month lows. Traders had worried that the Fed would adopt a neutral stance on inflation risks and perhaps pave the way for higher rates later this year. ""It\'s a major statement of where the Fed is leaning. . . . Rates are really on hold at least through the end of this year, if not well into the beginning of next year,"" said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. Some traders said the outlook for U.S. rates to remain low likely will encourage continued ""carry trade"" activity -- a popular strategy that involves borrowing in low-yielding securities and investing in markets with higher yields. Craig Coats, head of fixed income at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods in New York expects the exuberance in Treasurys to be short-lived. ""I think we\'ve probably seen the bulk of the rally, and we\'ll be here for the next couple of weeks until we get the next payroll number,"" he said. The next Labor Department report on monthly nonfarm payrolls growth is slated for April 2. The Fed\'s patience on monetary policy comes despite continuing signs that the economy is growing in the 4%-to-4.5% range, which could eventually trigger price pressures, some investors believe. ""Longer term, we think that rates are fundamentally too low relative to the prospects for economic growth and the potential that we could see inflation pass through from higher commodity prices,"" said John Miller, portfolio manager at Nuveen Investments. Economic reports yesterday were mixed. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell by 4% to a seasonally adjusted 1.855 million annual rate in February, well below the 1% increase expected by economists. However, a retail-chain-store sales index from the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS rose by 0.5% in the week ended March 13, compared with the week before, on a seasonally adjusted, same-store basis. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 20/32 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 face value, at 102 18/32. Its yield fell to 3.689% from 3.762% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 30/32 point at 111 2/32 to yield 4.650%, down from 4.706% Monday.   Corporate &Junk Bonds High-yield bonds fell around 1/2 point, and Tenet Healthcare Corp.\'s 7 3/8% bonds due 2013 fell one point to 86.5 bid after the company said it anticipates negative cash flow, renegotiations of credit facilities and a credit downgrade. Standard &Poor\'s and Moody\'s Investors Service recently cut Tenet\'s ratings. S&P rates its senior unsecured bonds single-B-minus, and Moody\'s rates them single-B3. Elsewhere, terms were revised for Nextel Communications Inc.\'s $500 million deal via Credit Suisse First Boston and J.P. Morgan. It initially had been priced at 97.243 with a 5.875% coupon to yield 6.25% -- terms that posed tax concerns, people familiar with the deal said. Revisions increased the price to 97.795 and the coupon to 5.95%, but kept the yield at 6.25%, according to IFR Credit. The bonds were up slightly in the secondary market at 98 bid. A $6.7 billion deal by the Pacific Gas &Electric unit of PG&E Corp. is expected to be priced today. It would be the largest issue by an electric utility in the U.S. dollar market, according to Dealogic data. --- Liz Rappaport and Mara Lemos contributed to this article.

128,2005-09-21 00:00:00,"['STOCKS FELL as the Federal Reserve signaled that it won\'t get soft on inflation and Hurricane Rita gathered strength. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 76.11 points, or 0.72%, to 10481.52, and is down 2.8% for the year. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee raised its overnight lending rate target a quarter percentage point to 3.75%, the 11th such increase in 15 months. In an accompanying statement, the Fed said that it didn\'t expect the destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina to ""pose a persistent threat"" to the U.S. economy, and that it could continue to raise interest rates at a ""measured"" pace. Rising short-term interest rates can keep inflation in check, but can also stifle economic activity and corporate earnings -- a concern that weighed on stock investors, along with worries about U.S. fuel supplies as Rita strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane and threatened Texas oil-refining areas. ""It\'s a very skittish time for investors,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab Corp. Meanwhile, the Fed\'s move helped to quell bond investors\' fears that inflation will accelerate amid high fuel prices and heavy federal spending to rebuild areas hit by Katrina. The difference in yield between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes fell to 0.26 percentage point, from 0.32 percentage point Monday -- a sign that investors in long-term bonds are demanding less compensation for the risk of inflation. ""They\'re buying into the Fed statement, which is that inflation is well contained,"" said Steve Rodosky, a Treasury portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco. Responding to the rate increase, most major banks yesterday raised their prime rate one-quarter point, to 6.75%. The Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index fell 0.79%, or 9.68 points, to 1221.34, still up 0.8% this year. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.65%, or 13.93 points, to 2131.33, down 2% on the year. Outside the U.S., stocks rose in dollar terms, including a surge in Japanese stocks to their highest close since June 2001. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, advanced 0.62%, or 1.16 points, to 187.25. Including U.S. stocks, the index fell slightly, down 0.06%, or 0.14 point, to 225.01. In major U.S. market action: Stocks retreated. On the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.72 billion shares traded, 1,031 stocks rose and 2,259 fell. Bond prices were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, or 62.50 cents for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield up to 4.255%. The 30-year bond was up 11/32 to yield 4.529%. The dollar strengthened.

129,2005-09-21 00:00:00,"['The dollar moved higher, rising late in the session after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the 11th consecutive meeting and gave no signal of an imminent break in rate tightening. The Fed\'s decision to increase its key rate to 3.75% from 3.5% and what the market considered to be a hawkish-leaning policy statement boosted the dollar to a six-week high against the yen and pushed the euro down to near the five-week low versus the dollar it tapped Monday. Analysts interpreted the statement as indicating a pause in Fed rate increases isn\'t imminent. Late yesterday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.2127, down from $1.2151 late Monday. The dollar was at 111.91 yen, up from 111.48 yen, and at 1.2809 Swiss francs, up from 1.2768 francs. The pound was at $1.7996, down from $1.8044, while the euro was at 135.73 yen, from 135.46 yen. Noting elevated energy prices, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted 9 to 1 in favor of a rate increase in a widely anticipated move that put the Fed\'s key rate at its highest level in over four years. Fed Governor Mark Olson dissented, advocating no change in the federal-funds target rate (which governs overnight interbank loans) at the meeting. The FOMC said that although Hurricane Katrina and resulting damage have raised near-term uncertainty in the economy, they don\'t ""pose a more persistent threat."" Monetary-policy ""accommodation"" and robust productivity growth continue to support the economy, even as higher energy prices and other costs have added inflation pressures, it said. The Fed again said that ""policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."" Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar ended little changed in a session of consolidation. The U.S. dollar was trading at C$1.1699 late in New York from C$1.1686 late Monday.

130,2005-09-21 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve\'s decision to stay on a steady course of interest-rate increases answered a key question for the bond market: Hurricane Katrina will not derail this tightening cycle. The Fed\'s 11th consecutive quarter-point interest-rate increase put the monetary-policy-sensitive two-year Treasury note under mild pressure and supported government bonds with longer maturity dates, which are most vulnerable to inflation. By extension, the Fed\'s statement that it may continue to raise interest rates at a ""measured"" pace gave renewed appeal to a flatter yield curve, whereby yields on shorter-dated maturities rise faster than those on long-dated peers. Noting elevated energy prices, the Federal Open Market Committee voted 9 to 1 to lift its target on the key federal-funds rate a quarter percentage point to 3.75% in a widely anticipated move that put the rate at its highest level in more than four years. Fed Governor Mark Olson dissented, advocating no change in the federal-funds target at this meeting. ""The Fed is giving no indication they are close to finishing their rate-hike cycle,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""They clearly want to get ahead of inflation risks and it makes 4.25% a likely year-end level for the [federal] funds rate."" Interest-rate-futures contracts forecast a 4% federal-funds rate for the end of the year. Meanwhile, a Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey of primary dealers -- banks that deal directly with the Fed -- found a strong majority looking for the nudge to 4% at the FOMC\'s next meeting Nov. 1, with the short-term rate expected to reach 4.25% in December. Mr. Konstam said the selling pressure in Treasurys, led by the two-year note, was an understandable reaction. ""The yield curve is flattening and that should continue as the Fed keeps raising rates."" After Hurricane Katrina sparked widespread damage across three states, some market participants expected the Fed might hold rates steady, or at least indicate it was prepared to do so. The Fed acknowledged the risks from the hurricane, but in a key statement, it suggested the unfortunate developments and disruption in energy markets ""do not pose a more persistent threat,"" to growth. Indeed, the jump in energy prices because of Katrina was the focus of the FOMC\'s concerns. Although policy makers said ""core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained,"" they cautioned ""higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" With those words, the Fed helped breathe life into the flattening of the yield curve, which had succumbed in Katrina\'s wake to a steepening trend. In late trade, the spread between the yields of two- and 10-year notes had narrowed to 0.26 from 0.32 percentage points before the Fed decision. Further flattening of the curve is expected to be propelled by a rising two-year yield and a steady 10-year yield. ""As long as the Fed is viewed as being more concerned with inflation than with growth, the 10-year should remain in a 4% to 4.38% range,"" said Andy Brenner, head of institutional fixed income at Investec in New York. ""This will force in more buying over the rest of the month"" for the 10-year, he added. Treasury Bonds At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 2/32 point, or $0.625 per $1,000 face value, at 99 31/32. Its yield rose to 4.255% from 4.25% Monday. The 30-year bond was up 11/32 point to 112 22/32, with its yield falling to 4.529% from 4.55%.   Corporate Bonds Telecom Italia is planning a $2.5 billion three-part note offering, split between five-year fixed- and floating-rate notes and 10-year notes, according to an investor. J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers will jointly lead the offering, which will be sold this week following a teleconference call with investors today.

131,2009-11-05 00:00:00,"['After months of subsisting on close-to-zero yields and watching assets bleed away, money-market mutual funds may have reason to hope that a little relief isn\'t far off. Many economists are predicting a Federal Reserve rate increase in 2010, and the central bank is considering how to take cash out of circulation. In addition, government support programs for the funds and the assets that they buy, put in place after the Reserve Primary Fund dipped below its $1 net asset value and sparked panic in the industry, are starting to unwind. That combination may bring slightly higher yields, which would be a welcome break for fund companies that have been waiving fees on their funds to maintain investors. ""These rays of hope may just be enough to give you courage,"" said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC, of struggling money-market fund providers. ""It could make you walk a couple more miles in the desert, but you need that Fed-hike oasis to really survive."" Fed watchers had waited Wednesday for a change, even a subtle one, in the central bank\'s commitment to keep borrowing costs at record lows for ""an extended period."" Even though the Fed didn\'t remove the word ""extended"" from its new statement, Mr. Crane saw signs of hope in the Fed\'s expanded discussion of the economy. He noted, too, that the Fed said economic conditions are likely to warrant ""exceptionally low levels"" of the federal-funds rate for an extended period. ""They didn\'t say an \'exceptionally low level,\'"" which could possibly indicate room for some change, he said. Mr. Crane believes one of the most important moves the Fed could make to affect rates is to engage in reverse repurchase agreements to drain liquidity from the financial system. The Fed last month said it was testing the use of these ""reverse repos,"" in which it sells securities to market participants with a commitment to buy them back at a higher price. In a statement Tuesday, Debbie Cunningham, chief investment officer for taxable money markets at Federated Investors, said some Federal Open Market Committee members seem to be hedging on their pledge to keep benchmark rates exceptionally low for an extended period. Ms. Cunningham said she expects the Fed ""in the near future"" to begin conducting reverse repos with nontraditional market participants, possibly including money-market funds. She wasn\'t available for comment after the Fed\'s statement Wednesday. Barry Benjamin, U.S. leader of PricewaterhouseCoopers\'s Investment Management and Real Estate Industry Group, said it is important to determine whether money-market funds will be able to continue with stable $1 net asset values. To sustain that, some system of support is needed to handle any possible run on money-market funds, he said. Discussions about an industry-sponsored liquidity bank are still under way. ""As the government programs are wound down, what\'s going to replace them?"" Mr. Benjamin asked. Value Line Case Settled for $45 Million New York investment adviser Value Line Inc., its chief executive and former chief compliance officer settled civil charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims they charged more than $24 million in bogus brokerage commissions on mutual-fund trades funneled through Value Line\'s affiliated broker dealer, Value Line Securities Inc. Value Line, CEO Jean Buttner, former Chief Compliance Officer David Henigson and Value Line Securities agreed to pay nearly $45 million to settle the charges. ""Value Line misappropriated millions of dollars from the mutual funds they managed by artificially allocating fund trades and then charging the funds for phantom brokerage services,"" said Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC\'s enforcement division. Value Line proposed the settlement in September to avoid protracted litigation. Value Line officials weren\'t available for comment. -- Fawn Johnson']","For Money Funds, Wait Till Next Year --- Rate Relief Seen in '10 as Fed Stands Pat",2009-11-04,The Wall Street Journal

Yesterday\'s Federal Open Market Committee statement after its two-day meeting declared that the economy has improved but that this is still no reason to stop driving its monetary engine like an Indy race car. The Fed has been running full throttle for an entire year, while the financial panic has subsided, credit markets are healing, and third quarter GDP growth was 3.5%. The Fed is nonetheless focused principally on the ""output gap,"" by which it means ""low rates of resource utilization"" and the high jobless rate. As long as the economy isn\'t going at full capacity, the governors believe, there\'s no danger of price increases and thus we need ""exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."" English translation: The Fed is going to maintain zero interest rates for as long as the political eye can see. In our oft-repeated view, this policy ignores the Fed\'s role as the central bank not merely for the U.S. domestic economy but also for the large chunk of the world known as the dollar bloc. The Fed\'s irrationally exuberant ease is clearly showing up around the world in a very weak dollar, asset bubbles in the likes of Asian property, and rising commodity prices that include $80 oil despite weak global energy demand. This risks creating new monetary excesses that will eventually have to be corrected in ways that could jeopardize the global and U.S. recovery. We\'d prefer more cautious policy now to avoid more trouble later, but this Fed is clearly on autopilot.

Outside the larger economies, emerging-market currencies continued to be in the spotlight, several of which were initially hurt by renewed fragility in the Brazilian real following a credit-rating agency downgrade late Monday. Moody's Investors Service cut Brazil's country ceiling for foreign-currency bonds and notes to single-B-2 from single-B-1, and the country ceiling for foreign-currency bank deposits to single-B-3 from single-B-2. Regardless of which candidate wins Brazil's autumn presidential election, the new administration will face growing fiscal pressures that could translate into risks in the external sector, especially as currency depreciation increases the burden on dollar borrowers, Moody's said.

135,2002-08-14 00:00:00,"['Markets had to absorb a welter of news yesterday. President Bush held his Waco gabfest, with Treasury Secretary Paul O\'Neill remarking afterward about the participants\' ""passion."" The Federal Open Market Committee refrained from cutting its target interest rates, but changed what Fed-watchers call its ""bias,"" hinting that it may cut rates further in the future. Last and probably least, companies are stirring themselves to vouch for their earnings to meet today\'s deadline established by the SEC. The net verdict was, down 206 points on the Dow Industrials. Investors, or that is traders, evidently expected more from the Fed. We didn\'t, for there is a limit to monetary policy, and interest rates are at or near historic lows. Everyone\'s sisters, cousins and aunts expected absolutely nothing from Waco, at least in the short run, and early reports suggest they were right. President Bush came out for restraint on government spending, saying he would not release $5.1 billion in counter-terrorism funds because Congress lumped in unrelated pork. Maybe he can even manage to veto something or other. Which brings us to the certification circus. Embattled SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt decided that because some CEOs did wrong, all must be patted down and made to take an oath that they are not currently committing fraud. August 14 is the day when CEOs at the biggest 947 companies are supposed to ""certify"" that their financial results are correct or to explain why they can\'t. Most executives already had assumed they were vouching for something when their companies issued their quarterly reports and seem appropriately mystified by the demand for an additional ""certification."" Sun\'s Scott McNealy briefly threatened to call the agency\'s bluff until his PR handlers calmed him down. In the past week the trickle of certifications has become a flood, as executives from J.P. Morgan Chase, Foot Locker, Kellogg and others have filed. In each case, CEOs swallowed hard and submitted to the SEC\'s self-administered lie detector test. This was supposed to ""reassure"" the markets, which yawned, or yesterday, swooned. Throughout it all, indeed, you have to give credit to the stock market, which unlike Mr. Pitt or the media, has behaved as if distinctions are worth making. Enron\'s stock price dropped precipitously for months before the press began asking intelligent questions about Enron\'s accounting. WorldCom had fallen from $65 to less than $1 before accounting fraud was even whispered. The certifications will no doubt provide ammunition for class-action lawyers, who are in the habit of suing companies whose share prices fall regardless of whether any management misbehavior was involved. But, then, creating new opportunities to sue has been the practical thrust of all the ""reforms"" that have made it out of a Senate controlled by Tom Daschle Democrats. In the meantime, we suspect that the market has already gotten over any systemic ""crisis of confidence"" in accounting and returned to worries about whether the folks in Washington know how to keep our nascent recovery going. In this respect, we\'d like to offer one post-Waco suggestion. To wit, that President Bush convene a more workable forum and think seriously about economic policy. We\'d suggest he lock himself in a room with Larry Lindsey from the White House, Glenn Hubbard from the Council of Economic Advisers and John Taylor from the Treasury. Then he could reach out to Stanford University to add Michael Boskin, John Cogan and Martin Anderson. In case you\'re wondering, this is not our list. It was the economic brain trust announced back during the last presidential campaign by candidate George W. Bush. They did pretty well then, it seems to us, but economic policy has pretty much been on hold since except for the intrusion of short-term politics. It\'s time to reconvene the brain trust and pass around the thinking caps.']",After Waco,2002-08-13,The Wall Street Journal
136,2002-08-14 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Prices of U.S. Treasury securities rallied, pushing yields toward historical lows, after Federal Reserve policy makers left rates unchanged but acknowledged  the downside risks to the economy are outweighing its potential upside. The rally pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to its lowest level in 39 years. Treasury securities had been mostly higher before the decision, with long-dated securities outpacing shorter-dated issues. That trend quickly reversed after the Fed\'s decision, as short-dated Treasurys benefited most from the Fed\'s acknowledgment it might need to cut interest rates if economic weakness persists. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 1 2/32 point, or $10.63 per $1,000 face value, at 102 13/32. Its yield fell to 4.083% from 4.207% late Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 1 18/32 point at 106 5/32 to yield 4.973%, down from 5.070% on Monday. Late in the session, a large drop in major stock indexes helped bolster the rally in Treasurys. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 206.50 points at 8482.39, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 37.56 at 1269.28. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to leave the key federal-funds rate unchanged at 1.75%, a 41-year low. But the panel altered its assessment of the economic outlook, saying risks to the economy no longer are ""balanced."" The risk of too-slow economic growth is again greater than the risk of higher inflation, the committee said. The language implied the Fed is prepared to cut interest rates, possibly as early as Sept. 24. ""The softening in the growth of aggregate demand that emerged this spring has been prolonged in large measure by weakness in financial markets and heightened uncertainty related to problems in corporate reporting and governance,"" the FOMC said, after a unanimous vote. That prospect ""makes it very difficult for anyone to be underweight Treasurys at this point,"" said Sadakichi Robbins, head of global fixed-income trading at Bank Julius Baer in New York. Still, that doesn\'t mean that investors will remain nervous about owning Treasurys near historically low yields. ""People look at absolute yield levels and say that it\'s scary, but we are in an atypical situation here, with renewed economic risks, global event risk, mortgage prepayments, and a poor functioning of the corporate bond market,"" Mr. Robbins said. Following the Fed\'s announcement, Treasurys quickly reversed much of the curve-flattening trend -- in which investors had been favoring long-dated securities -- that has marked the past several sessions. Instead, investors piled into short-dated Treasurys since they stand to benefit most if economic conditions warrant another rate cut. Besides the economy, market-watchers will also look for how the corporate-bond market fares. In recent weeks, the corporate-bond market has become increasingly illiquid as many investors avoided all but the safest credits. If the Fed\'s implied willingness to act on further problems in the bond market does indeed calm some nerves, it might help to mitigate the so-called credit squeeze that has been going on. In the short term, however, some said the change in the Fed\'s bias toward lower growth might alarm markets, since it suggests the Fed\'s economic outlook has worsened since Chairman Alan Greenspan offered a cautiously upbeat assessment of the economy in congressional testimony in mid-July and other central bank officials echoed that sentiment. Prices of long-dated Treasurys had been higher early in yesterday\'s session, when a particularly weak economic report in Germany sent U.S. and European investors flocking toward the safety of U.S. government securities.  Corporate Bonds The Fed\'s action had little effect on the corporate-bond market since it was widely expected, market participants said. Instead, the market was more affected by movements in equities and concerns about particular sectors, he said. One of those sectors was telecommunications where SBC Communications had its Aa3 senior unsecured long-term credit rating placed on review for possible downgrade yesterday by Moody\'s Investors Service. The announcement wasn\'t unexpected after Moody\'s last week said it was re-examining the Regional Bell Operating Companies, or RBOCs, on a number of industrywide pressures.

137,2006-12-13 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve signaled that while the economy looks a bit weaker than a month ago, its forecast and concerns about inflation are unchanged, and thus interest rates are still more likely to rise than fall. The Fed yesterday left its short-term interest rate at 5.25%, where it has stood since late June. In the statement accompanying its decisions, the Fed downgraded its assessment of the housing market and acknowledged ""mixed"" signals on growth. But its forecast of moderate growth is unchanged. Inflation remains its principal focus, and it still says its choice is whether to raise rates -- not to lower them. Bond yields declined and stocks retraced most of their early losses as investors interpreted the statement as a concession by the Fed to markets\' gloomier forecast of growth and more sanguine outlook on inflation. That, however, might turn out to be an overreaction. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has emphasized that rate actions depend on where the Fed thinks the economy and inflation will be in the future, not where they are today. And that hasn\'t changed. The Fed said that ""growth has slowed . . . partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market."" Its last statement, in October, didn\'t include the word ""substantial."" ""Although recent indicators have been mixed, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters,"" it said. Inflation remains ""elevated,"" and though expected to moderate, ""inflation risks remain."" Whether rates rise again will depend on new data, it said, in words identical to those used in October. ""The very fact that not even a comma was altered in the discussion of inflation and the outlook for policy should be taken as a strong sign that the Fed does not see \'recent indicators\' as altering their fundamental outlook for the economy,"" said Michael Feroli, economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co., in a note to clients. The Fed and the markets have starkly different views of the path of interest rates, with the former maintaining a bias to raise them and the latter anticipating cuts of half to three-quarters of a percentage point in the coming year. Yesterday\'s statement did little to close the divide. Indeed, investors raised the probability of rate cuts a bit. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said markets were reacting to ""the insertion of the word \'substantial\' to describe the cooling in the housing market,"" but he argued this was off the mark, as it was a backward-looking description. Indeed, the Fed for some months has expected housing to be a sizable drag on the economy. Its statement first acknowledged a ""gradual cooling"" in August, and since then, reported housing starts have fallen 19%. In early October, Mr. Bernanke said housing was undergoing a ""substantial correction."" The insertion of ""substantial"" in yesterday\'s statement was mostly an acknowledgment that the housing correction has advanced. Fed officials consider the decline in construction necessary to clear inventories of unsold homes. That said, they acknowledge housing remains a risk factor: Sales of homes are still falling, albeit more slowly, and eroding house prices could yet damp consumer spending more broadly. Ten of the 11 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. For the fourth-consecutive meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, favoring a quarter-percentage-point increase. Mr. Lacker won\'t be a voting FOMC member next year. One seat on the committee is vacant. Laurence Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, says the divide between the markets and the Fed is likely to be resolved one month at a time. If the data continue to support the Fed\'s stance, the Fed\'s language will remain the same, and markets will adjust their expectations as each Fed meeting approaches. Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. in Cleveland, predicted the Fed would stay on hold through all of next year. He attributed recent weakness in manufacturing to firms reacting to a buildup of inventories. Businesses are ""not hunkering down and playing defense,"" he said, adding that his bank continues to see healthy loan demand from businesses. But economists at UBS AG predicted rates will be cut a full percentage point next year as growth remains subpar, unemployment rises and inflation edges down. --- Online Today: The Journal\'s Greg Ip talks about what the Fed\'s policy statement suggests about future rate decisions, at WSJ.com/Video.

138,2006-12-13 00:00:00,"['The dollar fell against its rivals after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady and took baby steps away from its rate-tightening cycle and possibly toward rate cuts. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee kept rates on hold for the fourth straight policy-setting meeting and continued to name inflation as a worry. But the FOMC also made slight adjustments to its postmeeting statement compared with previous statements, which investors pounced on as another reason to sell the embattled dollar that is 11% lower versus the euro this year. Late afternoon in New York, the euro stood at $1.3280 from $1.3239 late Monday, while the dollar was at 116.80 yen from 116.99 yen. The euro was at 155.11 yen from 154.86 yen. The dollar stood at 1.2000 Swiss francs 1.2028 francs, while the pound was at $1.9708 from $1.9567. Referring to the U.S. housing slowdown, for example, the FOMC referred to a ""substantial cooling"" of the market, whereas previous statements simply said the sector was simply ""cooling,"" leaving out any ominous modifier. This change surprised a market that expected the FOMC would essentially just cut and paste its previous statement and use it as the new one. ""Since [that] didn\'t materialize, we\'re seeing the dollar lose some ground,"" Brian Dolan, head of currency research at Forex.com, said just as the dollar began slipping. Chances that the Fed may begin cutting rates before too long has been hurting the dollar, because lower rates tend to send investors looking for higher returns elsewhere. Indeed, the market odds of a rate cut increased slightly following the FOMC less-hawkish-than-expected statement. Eurodollar futures priced in a 56% chance for a rate cut to 5% within the first three months of 2007, versus 52% before the FOMC announcement. --- Isabelle Lindenmayer, in New York and Campion Walsh and Benton Ives-Halperin in Washington contributed to this article.

139,1999-05-19 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve decided to leave benchmark interest rates unchanged, but said it is so ""concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances"" that it is leaning toward raising rates in the coming months for the first time in nearly a year. Although inflation remains ""generally . . . quite subdued,"" the Fed said in a 134-word statement, ""domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved"" since it slashed rates by three-quarters of a percentage point last fall. It also suggested that demand in the U.S. economy is growing faster than the economy\'s ability to supply goods and services, despite gains in productivity. The Fed\'s decision to adopt an end-ofmeeting statement, or directive, that says a rate increase is more likely than a rate cut doesn\'t mean that higher rates are a certainty. Rather, it is a clear statement that Fed officials at this moment see a much greater risk of accelerating inflation than of a worrisome slowdown in the economy. In March 1998, for instance, the Fed adopted a directive that said it was leaning toward higher rates. But after Russia\'s default and devaluation shook global financial markets in August of that year, the Fed actually ended up cutting rates. According to a tally by economists at Goldman, Sachs & Co., the Fed under Chairman Alan Greenspan has ended 29 of its policy meetings with a bias toward higher rates. In half the cases, rates were lifted within six months, and in the other half rates weren\'t. Financial markets reacted negatively to the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up nearly 70 points before the 2:15 p.m. Eastern time announcement, quickly reversed course and ended the day down 16.52 points at 10836.95. Treasury bonds, which also had been higher during the day, fell after the announcement and ended the day little changed. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds was 5.88%. The reaction might have been sharper if not for a May 6 speech by Mr. Greenspan and last Friday\'s unanticipated uptick in consumer prices, both of which led many Fed watchers to predict yesterday\'s outcome. The decision leaves the Fed\'s target for the federal funds interest rate at 4.75%, the level at which it has been since November. The Fed manipulates the fed-funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, by buying and selling government securities. The Fed yesterday left unchanged the discount rate, at which it lends directly to banks. The Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee traditionally ends each session with a statement on where it believes rates are headed in the weeks ahead. In the past, the statement was supposed to be kept confidential for six weeks, although the press sometimes reported it earlier and Fed officials sometimes gave away the secret in speeches. But the Fed has moved slowly toward more openness. In 1994, it began announcing changes in its target for the fed-funds rate, but it offered explanations only when changing the target. Then in February, it said it would reveal the directive and explain its thinking ""when it wanted to communicate to the public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of policy."" Yesterday\'s statement was the first use of that new tool. When they met in early February, according to a summary of the meeting released subsequently, some Fed officials were already prepared to undo some of the rate cuts implemented last fall amid turmoil in the global economy and financial markets. Since then, the economy has proved much stronger than expected, the stock market has continued to climb and foreign economies have improved. Except for one month of bad consumer-price numbers, tangible signs of inflation have yet to emerge. Yet the much-forecast slowing of U.S. economic growth has yet to arrive, causing concern at the Fed that the inflationary good luck may be running out. The Fed statement is a sign that, with the jobless rate already at a 29-year low, FOMC members won\'t wait forever for the slowdown to materialize. The decision to hold rates steady for now, and the statement\'s reference to the possible need for action in the ""coming months,"" suggests the Fed is willing to wait a little while longer, though. ""Against the background of alreadytight domestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains,"" the Fed statement said, ""the Committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation."" Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., said the statement is the first step toward tighter monetary policy. ""The basic point is that the inflation risks, while relatively small, are rising. Last fall\'s easing was put in place as we witnessed a drying up of liquidity in domestic financial markets and prospects for the global economy were deteriorating."" With both those concerns abating, ""it\'s appropriate for the Fed to take back some of the easing that they put in place last fall."" Economists at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged the Fed to ""respond cautiously to developments until they can be interpreted with greater confidence."" The OECD foresees growth of 3.5% in the U.S. this year and 2% growth next year. With inflation low, the Fed can wait for the economy to slow on its own, the OECD\'s top economist, Ignazio Visco, said yesterday. After cutting rates in November, the Fed adopted a directive saying that higher or lower rates were equally likely in the ensuing weeks. It maintained that stance in meeting in December, February and March. The last time the Fed ended a meeting with a directive tilted toward higher rates was in early July 1998.

140,2002-01-31 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The bond market moved lower, pushed down by the combination of stronger equity markets, improved economic data, and Federal Reserve policy makers\' decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Treasury securities had been lower for most of the session, spurred mostly by the release of positive U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product data and the Treasury\'s quarterly refunding announcement. Then a late-day rally in stocks, which followed the Fed\'s interest-rate decision, pushed the debt market down further. At 4 p.m. EST, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 8/32 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face value, at 100. Its yield rose to 5.000% from 4.966% late Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond\'s price was down 12/32 at 99 8/32 to yield 5.426%, up from Tuesday\'s 5.401%. The central bank\'s Federal Open Market Committee voted to hold its main federal-funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.75%, pausing to see whether the economy will strengthen as businesses start rebuilding inventories they depleted last year. The Fed\'s message was ""almost perfectly in line with what the market expected,"" said David Ging, government bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. That means the bond market will need to take a wait-and-see stance in coming weeks, as participants focus keenly on the performance of the U.S. economy, corporations and stock markets. Earlier in yesterday\'s session, government debt fell when the market got a dose of improved economic data. Prices slipped further when the Treasury Department announced a $29 billion refunding package, consisting of $16 billion in reopened November five-year notes to be auctioned Tuesday and $13 billion in 10-year notes to be sold Wednesday. The Treasury Department also revealed it is considering ending its current pattern of alternating new issues and reopenings, and that it would conduct $3 billion to $5 billion in buybacks in three operations after the April tax deadline. In general, the Treasury Department\'s news contained no surprises for a market warily awaiting details of the February refunding. ""The Treasury signaled this, and the Treasury is definitely trying to get more predictable. And what I like about this refunding is that they are telling the market what they are thinking,"" said Gerald Lucas, senior government-bond strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. Still, the announcement helped to lay to rest recent speculation that the Treasury Department would move to a monthly five-year note auction schedule. Speaking to reporters, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets Brian Roseboro said the government isn\'t ""actively considering"" such a move. Many market participants have been clamoring for the Treasury Department to move to monthly five-year note auctions due to recent imbalances in the government repurchase agreement market, where dealers go to borrow securities. For nearly eight weeks, the November five-year note has been extremely scarce in the government repurchase agreement market, allowing lenders of the note to command zero-rate financing from those who need to borrow it. In many cases, the note has been so elusive that borrowers haven\'t been able to return it to the lender, a situation known as a fail. Corporate Bonds The corporate bond sector was quieter compared with Tuesday, with little reaction seen to the Fed\'s announcement. ""If anything, not cutting sends the message that the Fed sees the economy bottoming or improving and that their job is pretty much done,"" said Steve Nelson, portfolio manager at Advantus Capital Management. ""Things should improve, which means things will get better in the corporate world as it relates to earnings."" Tyco International\'s debt got an initial bounce yesterday but fell back after it experienced some extremely wide swings. The company\'s 10-year paper started the day priced at 2.7 percentage points over comparable Treasury securities and moved as wide as 3.5 before coming back in to 2.5. Williams Communications\' bonds, which also took a hit Tuesday, rallied a bit as well. The 7.125% paper due 2011 closed Tuesday at 3.3 percentage points higher than Treasurys after having widened from 2.6 higher. Late yesterday, they were trading around 2.85 above comparable Treasurys.

142,2006-05-11 00:00:00,"['THE FEDERAL RESERVE has often sent markets spiraling or rallying. Yesterday it froze them. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is still about 80 points from its record high, after finishing the day only slightly above where it began. The benchmark idled because investors couldn\'t wring enough optimism out of a statement from the Fed, which raised its short-term rate target to 5% as expected. Many hoped the central bankers would signal a pause in its rate-raising campaign in its statement. But the Fed failed to provide investors with a straight answer. Further rate hikes ""may yet be needed to address inflation risks"" the Federal Open Market Committee said, adding the word ""yet"" to its previous statements on rates. And doubts about that single word left stocks treading water. ""The Fed was the story of the day and `yet\' was the key word,"" said Ted Oberhaus, director of equity trading at Lord Abbett Funds. The key question: Does the inclusion of ""yet"" indicate a pause is more likely -- or less? The Dow edged up 2.88 points, or 0.02%, to 11642.65. It is up more than 8.6% this year and one good day from its highest close, 11722.98, set on Jan. 14, 2000. The Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index finished down 2.29 points at 1322.85, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 17.51 points to 2320.74. Those indexes are much further from their all-time highs also set in 2000. Doreen Mogavero, a floor broker at the NYSE, predicts the Dow will hit a new record soon and then shoot higher. ""There will be a lot of woo-wooing and throwing paper,"" she said. Others worry that psychologically important milestones, like the Dow\'s record, can distort investor sentiment, leading to irrational buying. ""It\'s close enough that I have a hard time believing they, whoever they are, won\'t push this thing up to a record soon,"" said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, who says stocks are expensive at today\'s levels. ""People will be excited, but I don\'t understand it and I don\'t trust it."" Treasury bonds, whose prices tend to weaken when short-term interest rates are on the rise, fell after the Fed\'s statement but finished up a whisker on the day. The dollar continued its slide. After the Fed\'s move, major U.S. banks raised their prime rates, the basis for many consumer loans, by one-quarter point to an even 8%. Fueling inflation concerns, oil futures rose $1.44 to $72.13 a barrel and gold jumped $4.30 to $703.70 an ounce, its high since Sept. 25, 1980.

143,2006-05-11 00:00:00,"['As it raised interest rates by a quarter-point for the 16th consecutive time, the Federal Reserve, in its accompanying statement, struck a careful balance between concern about inflation and a willingness to consider pausing in its two-year rate-raising campaign. The Fed, as expected, boosted short-term rates to 5% from 4.75%. In its statement, it laid out a rationale for a pause in the series of rate increases that began in mid-2004, while signaling such a break need not be a halt. In recent weeks, Fed officials, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, have tried to signal that they are less certain of where rates are going and that while they may pause soon, they could raise rates again later. But those signals have come while recent data have shown that the economy remains strong and inflationary pressure is growing. Markets have questioned the wisdom of the Fed\'s game plan by showing greater concern about inflation. Yesterday\'s statement was less explicit than Mr. Bernanke\'s Congressional testimony two weeks ago on the prospects of a pause. It restated the Fed\'s bias to raise interest rates further because of the risk of higher inflation. But it also laid out a forecast of slowing growth that would allow it to pause on rate increases. Growth has been ""quite strong,"" the Fed said, but will ""likely . . . moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices."" Inflation expectations are ""contained,"" but tightening capacity usage and high commodity prices could add ""potential"" inflation pressure. Further rate increases ""may yet be needed to address inflation risks,"" the Fed said, slightly tweaking the guidance it gave on interest rates after its previous two meetings. But it added that it ""emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information."" That wording suggests that the Fed still sees a reasonable chance of having to raise rates again this year, but without the predictability of the past 23 months. Stock and bond markets weakened following the Fed\'s statement, and finished mixed on the day, while futures markets raised to 40% from 38% the odds of a quarter-point increase in rates at the Fed\'s next meeting on June 28-29. The dollar recouped some of its losses against the euro, but remained lower on a day when the highlight was a Treasury report that criticized China for holding down the value of its currency but stopped short of calling it a currency manipulator. All 11 voting members of the 18 member Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans among banks. (One FOMC seat is vacant.) The Fed also raised the less-important discount rate, charged on central-bank loans to commercial banks, to 6% from 5.75%. Eleven of the Fed\'s 12 regional banks requested the increase; the board of the Kansas City Fed did not, just as in March. In response, U.S. commercial banks raised their prime rate, a benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 8% from 7.75%. The Fed and its new chairman are at a delicate juncture. At 5%, short-term rates are now about neutral -- neither so low that they stimulate spending, nor so high that they restrain it. And there are signs that, after two years, the Fed is having an impact: Long-term rates have started to rise, and home sales and price appreciation have slowed. But the overall economy grew at a robust 4.8% annual rate in the first quarter, and though it\'s expected to slow to between 3% and 3.5% in the second quarter, the latest data have been strong. Moreover, underlying inflation recently ticked up to the top of the Fed\'s comfort zone of 1% to 2%. Thus, Mr. Bernanke is caught between the risk of appearing soft on inflation and the risk of raising interest rates too much and triggering a serious slowdown. They are ""concerned with the lagged impact of earlier tightening on economic activity -- it\'s the reason the [notion of a pause] has been introduced,"" said Al Broaddus, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. ""But . . . they mustn\'t give anyone the idea their ultimate focus on inflation has diminished. It\'s very tough to walk this fine line."" Robert Parry, former president of the San Francisco Fed, thinks the Fed will likely have to raise rates further this year, in part because it usually has to raise them above neutral to get the economy to slow to a desirable rate and keep inflation in its preferred zone. Even so, he said the Fed would be justified in pausing at its next meeting because after several years in which the direction of rates was straightforward, ""it\'s much more complex, and one has to be careful and also circumspect."" Mr. Bernanke seems more willing than his predecessor Alan Greenspan to lay out his forecast for the economy to justify the Fed\'s rate actions. Edward Gramlich, a former Fed governor who is now interim provost at the University of Michigan, said ""it\'s inevitable"" that the Fed must now rely on forecasts. The only reason it can consider a pause, he said, is that it believes rates at current levels ""have already dampened spending enough to bring [inflation] under control."" However, that forecast may not yet ring true with people in the markets who still see a strong economy, buoyant financial markets and inflation signals, such as gold prices hitting a 25-year high. Hank McKinnell, chief executive of Pfizer Inc. and chairman of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives, said yesterday: ""Interest rates aren\'t at a point where they\'ve started to bite into financing capability.

Along with a quarter-percentage-point increase in the federal-funds rate to 5%, the Federal Open Market Committee kept the idea of another rate increase in June alive, saying ""some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks."" It also emphasized that any further rate increases will depend ""importantly"" on the incoming data. The market sold off in an initial response to the statement, and yields -- which move inversely to prices -- rose, as bond investors had pegged the odds of a pause in June around 65% before the FOMC statement was released. But prices exited from active trade little changed, and the two-year note\'s yield failed to move beyond the 5% mark. At 4 p.m., the two-year note was down 1/32, or 31.3 cents per $1,000 face value, at 99 25/32 to yield 4.992%, compared with 4.975% Tuesday. The 10-year note rose 2/32 to 95 7/32 to yield 5.128%. The odds of a rate increase in June are ""now close to fifty-fifty,"" said Jim Caron, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch &Co. in New York. That is also reflected in short-term interest-rate futures, which show the odds of a June increase at 44%, compared with 50% odds just after the FOMC statement was published. Scott Gewirtz, head of Treasury trading at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York, said the statement itself was neutral and that explained the modest nature of the selloff. ""I think they avoided overtly signaling a pause but they left themselves a huge amount of flexibility,"" Mr. Gewirtz said. Policy makers also highlighted inflation risks in their statement -- and that was the trigger for the market\'s biggest move in the wake of the statement\'s publication -- a flatter yield curve, said Richard Gilhooly, senior interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas. Longer-term yields are sensitive to inflation expectations, while short-term yields react most to official interest-rate changes. In recent trade, the yield curve as measured by the difference between two-year and 10-year yields had flattened to 0.13 percentage point, its lowest level since April 26, the day before Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke made his comments about a possible pause in rate increases to Congress. How far the flattening goes will now be determined by the reception given to today\'s auction of $13 billion in new 10-year notes. ""A good auction will help rally the back end,"" Mr. Gilhooly said. In the wake of the Fed\'s rate move, commercial banks are raising their prime rate to 8% from 7.75%. Many consumer-lending rates, such as interest on credit cards and home-equity loans, are tied to the prime rate. Municipal Bond The Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico has delayed today\'s planned sale of $800 million bonds, a GDB spokeswoman said. The sale, which would have been the largest this week in the tax-exempt bond market, has been put off at least temporarily because of a downgrade Monday by a major ratings firm of $25 billion of the commonwealth\'s debt, said spokeswoman Maria Rosario. The island territory has been in the grips of a fiscal crisis that has partially closed its government, as well as eroded its shaky credit rating and that of the GDB, which has made extensive loans to the government. Impatient about a budget impasse that has kept the Puerto Rican government in a partial shutdown since May 1, Moody\'s Investors Service Monday took its rating on the commonwealth\'s general obligation bonds down one peg to Baa3, the firm\'s lowest investment-grade rating and just one step above junk-bond status. It also cut its ratings on Puerto Rico\'s appropriations debt to Ba1, its highest junk-bond rating. The company said it was keeping Puerto Rico on a watch list for possible further downgrades. Corporate Bond Embarq Corp. is shopping a $4.485 billion three-part debt offering this week and investors are already lining up for the deal. A person familiar with the offering said roughly $17 billion in orders have poured in for the offering, which is expected to price this week. This deal comes after $4 billion in new debt from Abbott Laboratories in the investment-grade market on Tuesday. Embarq is Sprint Nextel Corp.\'s local land-line phone business that is being spun off to Sprint shareholders May 17. It has garnered the lowest possible investment-grade ratings of triple-B-minus from Standard &Poor\'s, Fitch Ratings and Moody\'s Investors Service. S&P has a negative outlook on the company, while Fitch and Moody\'s are stable. The business has ""lots of cash"" that is expected to be used to pare down debt, said Eric Geil, credit analyst at S&P. But ""beyond the next couple of years, we\'re really unsure where the business may go,"" he said. That is because the land-line sector of the telecommunications market is shrinking, while the wireless and cable sectors are expanding. Yield-starved investors, however, are willing to overlook the gloomy outlook. GM Bonds Shift Out of Reverse General Motors Corp.\'s bond ratings are on review for yet another downgrade by both Moody\'s Investors Service and Standard and Poor\'s, but that hasn\'t stopped investors from snapping up the debt securities lately. The company\'s 8.375% bonds due in 2033 have risen over the past few trading sessions and yesterday hit 76.5 cents on the dollar, representing a yield of about 11%. That is much improved from a low of about 66 cents on the dollar at the end of December 2005, according to data from MarketAxess. Earlier this week, GM revised its first-quarter results to a profit from a loss effectively ending a five-quarter streak of reported losses. ""We are putting our vote in the constructive outcome column,"" wrote analyst Glenn Reynolds of independent bond-research firm CreditSights Inc., in a report out late Tuesday, when he raised his rating on GM\'s bonds to ""overweight"" from ""underweight."" --- Serena Ng contributed to this article.

145,2008-06-26 00:00:00,"['The dollar declined versus the euro after the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep interest rates unchanged Wednesday and gave no signal of a near-term rate increase. The dollar fell to a 12-session low against the euro, which rose as high as $1.5687. Wednesday breaks the Fed\'s string of seven straight cuts between September and April totaling 3.25 percentage points, during which the European Central Bank stood firm. The euro zone\'s higher interest rates help make assets denominated in the euro more attractive to investors. With the ECB widely expected to raise rates at its meeting next week, currency analysts said the dollar will stay under pressure from the euro\'s advances. Wednesday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.5676 from $1.5572 late Tuesday, according to EBS. The dollar was at 107.77 yen from 107.79 yen, while the euro was at 168.95 yen from 167.80 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.9758 from $1.9697, and the dollar was at 1.0351 Swiss francs from 1.0412 francs Tuesday. The FOMC voted 9-1 to keep its benchmark lending rate at 2%. It also took no action on the discount rate charged for Fed loans to banks and brokers, which stands at 2.25%. In the policy statement, officials signaled that while the economy still faces headwinds, the chances of a severe slowdown or recession have receded. They also said, ""Upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased."" ""People in the currency market may have been looking for a more hawkish stance from the FOMC,"" said Adam Boyton, currency strategist at Deutche Bank AG in New York. ""What we\'ve seen is a shift in that direction, but no explicit tightening bias. That\'s allowed the euro a little bit of a relief rally."" Jens Nordvig, currency strategist at Goldman Sachs in New York, explained that given currency market expectations for a more aggressive stance, the FOMC\'s change in language will now take a second-seat to U.S. economic data. After falling off, the dollar ended the afternoon Wednesday little changed against the yen from a day earlier as stocks stayed up. The next U.S. report, nonfarm payrolls, will be released the same day as the ECB\'s rate decision: July 3. Overnight, as earlier in the week, the dollar was stuck in range-bound trading versus its rivals. The euro was able to earn a narrow lead after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the governing council may raise the ECB\'s main refinancing interest rate ""by a small amount"" to 4.25% from 4% to anchor inflation expectations. Mr. Trichet also said the ECB governing council is in a state of ""heightened alertness,"" against a backdrop of significant upside risks to price stability in remarks to the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Brussels. The risks of triggering a wage-price inflation spiral currently ""is particularly acute,"" he said. The euro found some additional support from news that the ECB will hold a monetary policy meeting and press conference in August, a month when members are normally on holiday.

146,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"['At his first policy meeting as Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke picked up where predecessor Alan Greenspan left off: with another quarter-point boost in interest rates, and a hint of more to come. But Mr. Bernanke put a modest stamp of his own on the Fed\'s closely watched postmeeting statement, by including a more explicit view of where the nation\'s economy is headed. The statement\'s forecast that economic growth appears likely ""to moderate to a more sustainable pace"" may be an early, though small, sign of his efforts to make the central bank\'s thinking more transparent. The Fed raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.75% from 4.5%. In its statement released after the two-day meeting, the Fed said ""some further policy firming may be needed to keep"" the risks to growth and of inflation ""roughly in balance."" The language was identical to that used in the statement released after Mr. Greenspan\'s last meeting, on Jan. 31. Fed officials have indicated that saying policy firming ""may be needed"" simply keeps their options open on whether to raise rates again, and implies no commitment to do so. Nonetheless, financial markets, which had already thought it highly likely that the Fed would raise rates to 5% at its May 10 meeting, became even more convinced it would do so after reading the statement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up about 19 points before the Fed\'s afternoon announcement, finished the day down 95.57, or 0.9%, at 11154.54. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.78% from 4.71% Monday. Yesterday\'s move was the Fed\'s 15th consecutive quarter-point rate increase since June 2004, when it began to raise rates from a 46-year low. The increase reflects a continuing view at the Fed that robust growth abroad and an economy near full capacity at home create a risk that inflation, though tame, could rise. The Fed said that while energy prices could boost underlying inflation, so far they have not, in part because of brisk productivity growth. ""Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures,"" it said, in words similar to its Jan. 31 statement. The similarity of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee\'s words and actions to those of Mr. Greenspan\'s on Jan. 31 may have reflected Mr. Bernanke\'s stated desire to maintain ""continuity."" But in one respect, the statement did break some new ground. It said the slowing growth of the nation\'s gross domestic product in the fourth quarter was due to ""temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace."" The inclusion of an explicit forecast differed from previous statements, which generally stuck to a snapshot of current economic conditions. Its reference to ""real GDP growth in the fourth quarter"" was also far more specific than previous statements, which seldom specified what data they were referring to. Mr. Bernanke has suggested that more discussion of the forecast would help markets more accurately predict the central bank\'s actions. ""What does it mean when the Fed is data-dependent?"" Mr. Bernanke said after a speech in New York last week. It means, he said, that with each new economic report, the Fed reconsiders ""where the economy is going to be a year down the road. The key statistic is the forecast."" Changes in the forecast, he said, drive rate decisions. In his earlier career as an academic, Mr. Bernanke worked extensively on economic modeling, which is used to make forecasts. And as a Fed governor from 2002 to 2005, he often met with Fed staff to discuss their forecast, dubbed the ""green book."" While Mr. Greenspan also considered forecasts important, he generally was reluctant to issue one, and often disagreed with the green book. Mr. Bernanke has argued for more transparency at the Fed and suggested the FOMC should release forecasts more often than twice a year, the current practice. The modest change in yesterday\'s statement suggests Mr. Bernanke may pursue his transparency initiatives in small, incremental steps. Other changes in the FOMC\'s communications and deliberations processes may have been considered at the meeting. Minutes of the discussion will be released April 18. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor who now analyzes the Fed for Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm, said the statement reflected ""continuity in policy and innovation in communication."" While the forecast of moderating growth wasn\'t news, its inclusion in the statement served to temper potential market overreaction to the Fed\'s upbeat assessment of current conditions, he said. Fed officials have said their actions increasingly are driven by new economic data, which means they probably will soon stop giving hints about their next action on interest rates. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said more information on the Fed\'s forecast could help make up for such a loss of guidance on interest rates as markets try to figure out what the Fed will do next. The decision by the FOMC\'s 11 voting members was unanimous. Departing Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson didn\'t attend. It is customary for departing FOMC members to skip their last meeting. Eleven of the Fed\'s 12 regional reserve banks asked for the accompanying increase in the little-used discount rate, charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to 5.75% from 5.5%. The exception was the Kansas City Fed. Many commercial banks yesterday raised their prime rate -- a benchmark for many consumer and business loans -- to 7.75% from 7.5%. Economists generally said that how much higher rates go depends mostly on whether the risk of inflation becomes reality. Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers, said, ""I think you\'re going to see both . . . tightening capacity and some kind of pickup in inflation."" He predicted the Fed will eventually lift its key rate to 5.5%. Larry Kantor, co-head of research at Barclays Capital, said, ""The financial environment is still stimulative: high stock prices, relatively low bond yields."" He predicted that even if the Fed paused soon it would have to resume raising rates shortly afterward. But Maury Harris, chief U.S. economist at UBS, said the Fed should stop raising rates now, arguing that the economy is already slowing. He noted that new-home sales and capital-goods orders, excluding aircraft and defense, dropped in February. Mr. Harris predicted growth will slow to an annual rate of 2.5% by the second half of the year from the current rate of about 4%. If the Fed raises rates further, it risks overshooting and making the slowdown worse, he said. However, he added that inflation is low enough that it is unlikely any such overshooting would trigger a recession. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can see how the Federal Reserve\'s statement compares with the previous one and read the full text of the Fed\'s statement.

147,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"['Treasurys prices fell across maturities after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate and -- to the disappointment of some investors -- indicated it wasn\'t finished raising rates. In late trading, the 10-year note was yielding 4.79%, up from 4.71% late Monday. The two-year yield was at 4.80%. When short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, it is known as an inverted yield curve, and has previously signaled a slowing economy. But the Fed wasn\'t deterred by the yield curve as officials, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, have disputed that interpretation of the inverted yield curve. They argue that this time, other factors are at work, including strong demand by overseas investors for U.S. assets. The Federal Open Market Committee raised its target for the federal funds rate -- which is what banks charge each other on overnight loans -- by a quarter percentage point to 4.75% at the end of its two-day meeting. Some bond investors were surprised by the Fed\'s apparent intention to keep raising rates. ""People in the bond market were hoping the statement would indicate the FOMC was close to being finished. But there is no sense that the next meeting will be the last rate hike,"" said Anton Pil, global head of fixed income at JP Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 20/32 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 face value, at 97 24/32. Its yield rose to 4.788% from 4.707% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond shed 1 2/32 points to 95 9/32 to yield 4.80%. ""One more rate hike is what investors should be gearing their strategies toward,"" said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley in Purchase, N.Y. Alex Li, bond strategist at Credit Suisse in New York, said he expects selling pressure to continue in maturities of two years and five years. The five-year note sustained the largest losses, with its yield rising more than 0.09 percentage point to 4.78%. The Treasury will sell $14 billion new five-year notes later this week, which hampered prospects for the maturity. After the Fed\'s move, banks raised their prime rates -- the base for many consumer loans -- to 7.75% from 7.50%.   Emerging-Market Bonds Brazil\'s debt sold off as investors digested the resignation of Finance Minister Antonio Palocci late Monday.

148,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"['Options traders spent yesterday in much the same fashion as their stock-market cousins -- waiting for the Fed. Options players were looking ahead to the Federal Open Market Committee\'s interest-rate announcement, which was delivered in the afternoon. ""The activity this morning was quiet, because there was a lot of wait-and-see,"" said Frederic Ruffy, an analyst at Optionetics, shortly after the Fed announcement. With stocks selling off in the wake of the Fed\'s decision to raise rates again and keep the door open to future increases, volatility readings moved higher in the options market. The Chicago Board Options Exchange\'s market-volatility index, or VIX, climbed 0.12 to 11.58. Not all was quiet in the hours before the Fed spoke. Options in Nucor Corp. saw action, as shares of the Charlotte, N.C., steel company fell 55 cents, or 0.5%, to $103.77. Traders focused on Nucor\'s call options, such as April-expiring contracts with strike prices ranging from 40 to 85. The April 65 calls, for example, were up $3.80 at $40.60 as of late yesterday, with 26,169 contracts changing hands against open interest of 1,740 contracts. Michael Schwartz, Oppenheimer &Co.\'s chief options strategist, said the activity may have been related to a dividend play. In May, Nucor plans to pay a cash dividend of 70 cents a share to shareholders of record as of Friday. There was also some trading in Best Buy Co.\'s options. The home-electronics retailer is expected to announce fiscal fourth-quarter results tomorrow; yesterday, Best Buy shares rose 41 cents, or 0.7%, to $55.16. Some analysts are optimistic ahead of Best Buy\'s earnings report. But Mr. Ruffy noted that options trading has been ""cautious."" He pointed to renewed activity in Best Buy\'s puts. The April 50 and April 55 puts were particularly active. As of late yesterday, the April 50 puts had traded 7,090 contracts, compared with open interest of 8,025 contracts.

149,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"['The dollar made impressive gains late in the session, rallying in the wake of the Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate increase and hints of more increases to come. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the key federal-funds rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75%, the 15th consecutive rate increase by that amount since June 2004. The meeting was the first FOMC meeting overseen by Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman. At late afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.2009 from $1.2069 prior to the Fed announcement and from $1.2011 late Monday. The dollar was at 117.98 yen from 117.26 yen pre-FOMC and from 116.70 yen late Monday, up more than a yen on the day. The dollar was changing hands at 1.3096 Swiss francs from 1.3094 francs late Monday, and the pound fetched $1.7435 from $1.7474. Although the rate increase had been universally anticipated, investors were relieved that the statement implied additional rate increases may be needed. ""It\'s not a particularly hawkish statement, but some people were expecting something overly dovish, and when that didn\'t happen the market responded"" by buying dollars, said Jens Nordvig, global markets economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. Expectations of higher U.S. interest rates have been supportive of the dollar in recent months because dollar-denominated assets thereby become more attractive to investors. The statements that accompany FOMC decisions have come under close scrutiny for clues as to a possible end to the tightening cycle. During the market lull that customarily precedes FOMC rate decisions, several U.S. senators made announcements regarding U.S. efforts to encourage China to adopt a more flexible currency regime. Two longtime critics of China\'s yuan policy, Sens. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), said they would delay a vote on a bill they sponsor that could impose punitive tariffs of 27.5% on imports of Chinese goods if China fails to allow its currency to appreciate significantly. Also, Senate Finance Committee leaders said they would introduce a bill directing the Treasury Department to take a tougher line in dealing with currency manipulation by trading partners. --- Azam Ahmed in New York, Elizabeth Price in Washington and Alastair Stewart in Sao Paulo contributed to this article.

150,1998-05-20 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve again decided to hold short-term interest rates steady, even though an amazingly strong U.S. economy has pushed the unemployment rate well below the level some inflation-fearing Fed officials consider wise. The decision to keep the key federal-funds rate at 5.5% was widely expected on Wall Street both because new turmoil in Asian financial markets make them particularly vulnerable to a surprise Fed move and because Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had said nothing in public to prepare the markets for a rate increase. Some Fed watchers expect the Fed to raise shortterm rates later this year, unless the depressing effect of Asia\'s financial crisis or something else slows the economy from its robust pace. Seven of the 18 economists surveyed weekly by Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting company, expect a 1/4 percentage point rate boost before Labor Day. Indeed, going into yesterday\'s meeting, some Fed officials were ready to raise rates as insurance against an acceleration of inflation from the current historical low level. But Mr. Greenspan apparently was not. The Fed won\'t disclose until early July whether any members of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee formally dissented from yesterday\'s decision. However, economic forecasters suggest that economic growth may slow significantly in coming months from the better-than-3% pace of the past six quarters without a Fed rate boost. ""For the Fed to remain on hold, significant moderation of economic activity . . . needs to be seen . . . certainly by the Aug. 18 meeting,"" Merrill Lynch & Co. economist Bruce Steinberg said. ""We expect such moderation."" Even with last month\'s uptick in consumer prices, the government\'s consumer price index has risen just 1.4% during the past 12 months, equal to the lowest reading since December 1988 when falling oil prices damped inflation -- and close to the Fed\'s long-stated goal of ""price stability."" With inflation so low, some Fed officials have argued, the Fed can afford to take a wait-and-see stance. Business and labor groups that have been urging Mr. Greenspan to keep his hands off the interest-rate trigger greeted the Fed decision warmly. ""The wisest course is inaction,"" the National Association of Manufacturers said. ""The risk of doing it [raising rates], given Asia and the stock market, exceeded the risk of not doing it,"" said the National Federation of Independent Business. The stock market declined after the widely expected decision. A survey of 35 Wall Street economists by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC found 33 of them predicted no change in rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up more than 50 points just before the Fed announcement, gave back nearly all the day\'s gains to finish up 3.74 to 9054.65. The bond market had little reaction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 6/32, or $1.875 for a bond with a $1,000 face value, at 102 17/32. The bond\'s yield rose to 5.933%. The Fed doesn\'t give any explanation when the committee maintains its current target for the federal-funds rate, at which banks lend money to one another overnight. Yesterday was no exception. The Fed simply said at about 2:15 p.m. EDT that its committee meeting had ended at 1:35 p.m. The committee next meets in a two-day session on June 30 and July 1. The Fed\'s summary of its March 31 meeting will be released tomorrow and closely scrutinized for clues to the Fed\'s thinking. The Fed changed its stance in March and concluded that rates were more likely to rise than fall in the near future. The summary will explain the reasons for that shift. The voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee include the seven Fed governors in Washington and the presidents of five of the 12 regional Fed banks.']",Fed Again Decides to Hold Rates Steady,1998-05-19,The Wall Street Journal
151,2002-06-27 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Whacked by the disclosure of a major accounting fraud at WorldCom Inc., the dollar tumbled against its key counterparts, at one point coming within striking distance of parity with the euro and prompting talk of a major meltdown in the U.S. currency. The dollar did regain some lost ground later in the session in line with gains in U.S. stocks, but the currency still ended New York trading around nine-month lows against the yen, a 28-month trough against the euro and at its weakest mark against the Swiss franc in close to three years. At one point, the euro traded as high as 99.45 cents, stoking talk that the common currency could reach the elusive bar of parity with the dollar as early as this week. Meanwhile, the dollar shrugged off a low-key monetary-policy statement from the Federal Open Market Committee, after the U.S. central bank left its key interest rates unchanged for the fourth time this year. The Fed said the economic outlook remains foggy, with risks ""balanced"" between inflation and too-slow economic growth. The message implied the Fed isn\'t preparing to raise or lower interest rates. As well as being sold off heavily on the Worldcom scandal, market participants also took comments from President Bush as an effective green light to sell the currency. Signaling that the U.S. won\'t likely step into the foreign-exchange market and try to prop up the flagging dollar, Mr. Bush said late Tuesday that market forces and economic fundamentals will determine the dollar\'s exchange rate, in the process casting doubt about the very existence of a so-called strong-dollar policy. Treasury officials scrambled to mop up any confusion sparked by Mr. Bush\'s rare foray into foreign-exchange policy, insisting that there was no change to the Bush administration\'s commitment to a strong currency. ""Nothing new. No change in dollar policy,"" a Treasury spokesman said. But currency-market participants viewed Mr. Bush\'s statement as a sign that the government won\'t stand in the way of a falling dollar, certainly as long as the decline in the currency doesn\'t transform into a straight-line plunge. ""The price of explicitly abandoning [the policy] is very high,"" said Jason Bonanca, vice president and foreign-exchange analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. He said Mr. Bush\'s remarks were ""one of many pieces of commentary that suggest that there is significant dilution of exactly what it means."" Late yesterday, the euro was at 98.20 cents, well off its intraday high of 99.45 cents, but still stronger than 97.85 cents late Tuesday in New York. The dollar was at 119.99 yen, again off its lows for the day near 118.98 yen, but still weaker than 121.38 yen late Tuesday in New York. The dollar was also at 1.4949 Swiss francs, down from 1.5006 francs late Tuesday in New York. Sterling was at $1.5259, up from $1.5066 late Tuesday. While the selloff in the dollar might have been overdone -- on an intraday basis, the euro jumped as much as 1. 5%, sterling by 1. 4% and the yen by 2% -- the WorldCom fraud nonetheless focused attention on the deep doubts hanging over what had been a covenant of faith between U.S. corporations and shareholders. It also raised the question of how many other U.S. companies might have engaged in similar practices. ""This brings attention to speculative excesses that bloated values in the telecommunications sector,"" said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody\'s Investors Service. As a result of WorldCom, ""investors will be increasingly wary of building up further positions within U.S. equities,"" which in turn is expected to ""speed up the pace of dollar\'s decline,"" said Michael Woolfolk, currency strategist with the Bank of New York. There were already key signs that the retreat from U.S. assets -- in particular equities - was gaining pace, which has already been weighing on the dollar. But the prospect of a rapid withdrawal from U.S. asset markets raises an additional raft of fears for the currency, which has effectively metamorphosed into a barometer of global risk. ""If the dollar\'s decline turns explosive, this could compound the problems of the U.S. asset markets as currency losses raise fears of a massive capital flight out of the U.S.,"" said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING Barings. The dollar failed even to get lasting respite from several rounds of intervention by the Bank of Japan, which is keen to stop a strong yen from derailing Japan\'s frail economic recovery. There were some silver linings for the dollar, however. The dollar gained against many of the key peripheral currencies -- including the so-called commodity bloc of the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars as well as most Latin American currencies. At one point the Mexican peso, which tends to trade in tandem with the dollar, saw its rate against the dollar drop as far as 10.0725 pesos, a two-year low and well down from late Tuesday\'s 9.9010 pesos. But the peso also recovered some ground as the dollar clawed back, ending the day at 9.9575 pesos to the dollar. --- John Parry and Kristyne Demske contributed to this article.']","Currency Trading: Dollar Falls Against Key Rivals, Amid Fallout From WorldCom",2002-06-26,The Wall Street Journal
152,2009-01-29 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve inched toward a new program to purchase long-term U.S. Treasury securities, possibly the next step in the central bank\'s battle against a recession that it said has only deepened in recent weeks. ""Industrial production, housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending,"" Fed officials said Wednesday in a policy statement following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank\'s direction. ""Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly."" The Fed has already pulled its main lever for managing the economy as far as it can. Its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal-funds rate -- hovers near zero, and policy makers reiterated the rate would remain low ""for some time."" With the funds rate about as low as it can go, officials are focused on developing new lending and asset-purchase programs to bring down an array of other interest rates and boost the economy. On the list of next steps could be an effort to buy long-term government debt, which could in effect lower rates on mortgages and other debt. But the Fed is taking a slow path toward embracing the idea, something that has unsettled some investors. Disappointed that the central bank didn\'t take a more decisive step toward buying government bonds, investors sold Treasury bonds Wednesday. An effort to buy long-term government bonds could help the economy broadly because many kinds of debt -- from mortgages to corporate bonds -- are benchmarked to Treasury yields. Fed purchases could raise Treasury prices, which would reduce their yields and thus yields on other kinds of debt. Still, it would be a controversial move at a time when government budget deficits are soaring. Some might see it as an inflationary move to finance deficits by printing money. With economic slack building so abruptly around the world, Fed officials don\'t see inflation as a worry now. In their statement, they pointed to a different worry: that inflation would fall below their comfort levels, believed to be roughly between 1% and 2%. An abrupt fall in inflation raises the inflation-adjusted cost of borrowing, which could be a new hindrance to growth and recovery. Two other programs geared toward the credit market are still in the process of being ramped up. Officials have high hopes they will more directly ease strains afflicting consumers and businesses. In one, the Fed is buying $600 billion of securities issued or guaranteed by government-linked mortgage-finance companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In the other, which won\'t be operational until February, it will provide up to $200 billion of financing to investors buying securities tied to consumer debt like car loans or credit cards. ""There are lots of channels through which the Fed is working hard and using its balance sheet to ease financial conditions,"" said Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist with Morgan Stanley. ""Buying Treasurys is only one of those."" Operationally, buying Treasurys would be easy for the Fed after a year of complicated efforts to revive markets. It has clear legal authority to buy government debt and the markets desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a long history of trading bonds with securities dealers. The approach is favored by some members of the Fed\'s policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. Dissenting from the Fed\'s latest policy statement Wednesday, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said purchasing Treasury bonds was preferable to the Fed\'s many other new lending programs. Moreover, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has highlighted the possibility of Treasury purchases twice in speeches since December. In its statement Wednesday, the central bank said it ""is prepared"" to take such a step, stronger language than it has used before. But the Fed said it depended on ""evolving circumstances,"" and whether such a move would translate into help for private-sector debt markets. It offered no plan for moving forward on such purchases. The market sold off sharply on the hesitant approach. The 10 and 30-year Treasury bonds fell on the day by 1 9/32 points and 4 11/32 points, respectively. Treasury yields are still very low. The yield on a 10-year note hit 2.66% Wednesday. Still, they have pushed higher in recent weeks, from just above 2% in December. Uncertainty about the Fed is one factor pushing yields up recently. A range of other factors are at play, from the mountain of supply hitting the market as deficits rise, to concerns that foreign buyers may back away as the global economy contracts. Many estimates put the Treasury\'s borrowings this year at $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. In recent years, $300 billion was considered a large amount. Peter Hooper, chief economist for Deutsche Bank, said the Fed hasn\'t felt much pressure to begin the program because Treasury yields have been so low. But ""if Treasury yields rise appreciably,"" he said, then the program ""becomes a more important part of the picture."" The economic backdrop is souring fast. Economists believe the nation\'s gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 5% or more in the fourth quarter.

153,2000-10-04 00:00:00,"[""NEW YORK -- The specter of slower corporate earnings growth smashed into the options market, but traders seemed unfazed. They plowed deeper into the largest blue-chip stocks, treating Xerox Corp.'s third-quarter warning as a company-specific problem. Cisco Systems Corp., Intel Corp., Nortel Networks Corp. and Oracle Corp. traded actively in the session, though traders were reluctant to remain fully committed to their positions. Recent patterns in the options and stock markets indicate that traders are selling rallies and buying declines. The Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract was meaningfully higher before the financial markets opened, and into the first hours of trading, but the futures ultimately sold off, which led traders to take some profits out of winning positions that were established at the opening. The decline, however, ultimately reignited another wave of buying. The option market's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, rose 0.96 to 24.39. An increase in the VIX generally means that traders are getting nervous about the stock market. When the index declines, it often indicates that traders are optimistic, or complacent, about the stock market. Traders spent the day with one eye on their trading monitors and the other on the clock in anticipation of the end of the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting. The committee wasn't expected to raise interest rates, but the lack of certainty was enough to restrain traders from establishing overly long or short positions in their portfolios. The CBOE's equity put/call ratio was 0.70, indicating that 70 defensive puts traded for every 100 bullish calls. While the ratio showed that traders were trading puts because they were concerned about the sustainability of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's advance yesterday, the put activity wasn't enough to telegraph a buying opportunity. The index is considered bullish above 0.75; neutral from 0.40 to 0.75 and bearish below 0.40. Elsewhere in the options market, the CBOE's index put/call ratio was 1.55. The ratio, also a contrarian sentiment indicator, is considered bullish if the ratio is above 1.5; neutral from 0.75 to 1.5 and bearish below 0.75.""]",Options Traders Appear Unfazed in the Face Of Specter of Slowdown in Corporate Earnings,2000-10-03,The Wall Street Journal
154,2000-10-04 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The economy will continue to glide toward a soft landing with slower growth in the months to come, new economic data show. The Conference Board\'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to predict economic conditions in the next six months, fell 0.1% in August, after dropping 0.2% in July. The index has been flat or declining for all of 2000 except for a 0.1% increase in March. The data suggest the economy is likely to continue slowing into the early part of 2001 before stabilizing. The economy expanded at a surprising 5.3% annual rate in the second quarter, but many analysts expect the pace of gross-domestic-product growth to drop to between 3% and 3.5% for the rest of 2000, and remain at about that level for much of 2001. ""The days of 5% GDP growth are behind us,"" said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, a New York-based market-research firm. The report was good news for the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates six times since June 1999 to cool the economy and stave off inflation. Yesterday, the Federal Open Market Committee held rates steady. For much of the year, the housing sector offered some of the clearest evidence of a cooling economy, as rising interest rates, which make housing more expensive, hampered sales. But the sector has begun to show some signs of a resurgence. The Commerce Department reported that new-home sales fell 3% in August to a seasonally adjusted rate of 893,000 units a year, but that came after a huge 11.8% rise in July. All told, new-home sales remained 2.3% lower than the torrid pace a year earlier. Meantime, existing-home sales surged 9.3% in August, while overall construction spending grew 1.4%. All three measures have largely reversed their earlier declines. One reason: lower mortgage rates. The interest rate for a 30-year mortgage was 7.88% last week, a notch higher than the 7.63% level of June 1999, but well off the recent high of 8.64% in May, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage purchaser. In the Conference Board report, six of the leading index\'s 10 components -- including manufacturing hours and consumer expectations -- declined. A sustained decrease signals weaker economic conditions, though Mr. Goldstein predicted the slowdown wouldn\'t be severe. The economy, he said, is like ""a hurricane with 115-mile-per-hour winds that slows to 75 miles per hour: It still packs a lot of wallop.""

155,2000-10-04 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Big technology stocks suffered as worry spread that the profit problems of technology companies had spread to the market leaders.    Shares of Oracle fell $9.25, or more than 11%, to 69.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after an analyst at Merrill Lynch shared cautious comments with the firm\'s sales staff following a meeting Oracle officials held with analysts. Oracle shares had been edging lower throughout the session, then fell sharply in the final hour of trading.    At the same time, shares of International Business Machines dropped in the final hour, as fears that the company would issue an earnings warning spread throughout Wall Street. The stock finished down 7.25 at 110.56.    Investors initially had pushed some stocks up, allowing market averages to post modest gains. Even an earnings warning from copier maker Xerox was considered a company-specific, rather than sectorwide, problem. Xerox shares fell 3.94 to 11.38, a 52-week low. However, the optimism withered in the face of speculation about further earnings warnings.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session at 10719.74, up 19.61, or 0.18%. IBM\'s decline shaved 42.19 points off the average.    The Nasdaq Composite Index fell to 3455.83, down 113.07, or 3.2%.    ""There is so much negative sentiment out there in the market,"" Adam Weisman, a trader at Wit SoundView, said. ""The last thing people want to hear is bad news about leadership names.""    Several stocks whose high valuations had remained intact coming into this week despite selling elsewhere came under pressure. I2 Technologies dropped 17.88 to 152, while Ciena sank 11.25 to 110.13. Ariba fell 14.58 to 112.48, and PMC-Sierra slid 13.50 to 199.25, all on Nasdaq. Commerce One, hurt by pessimistic comments from an analyst at Jefferies, which lowered its rating on the stock, declined 13.69, or nearly 19%, to 58.88.    The sell-off came in another session of vigorous trading. Nasdaq trading totaled 1.90 billion shares, up from the 1.72 billion that changed hands Monday, while action on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to 1.09 billion, up from 1.02 billion Monday.    The technology sell-off came at the same time the Federal Reserve released a statement saying it left interest rates unchanged at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting. But that outcome had been widely expected.    Shares of several blue-chip names thrived during the session. Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing gained 2.31 to 94, Alcoa added 2.44 to 26.94 and International Paper rose 1.63 to 29.63. Those names, though, had been coming off relatively low bases. Both Alcoa and International Paper reached 52-week lows last week, suggesting some bargain-hunting was at work.    Meanwhile, money-management firm Neuberger Berman rose 3.63, or 5.6%, to 68.38 on speculation the firm would be taken over by a large financial conglomerate. Jeffrey Lane, president and chief executive of Neuberger, said he ""won\'t comment on rumors."" Analysts say banks, insurers and brokerage firms have been eyeing asset-management businesses with particularly wealthy clients such as those of Neuberger, New York. The stock rose 3.25 Monday.    Investors, hesitant to own technology shares, gravitated to other sectors. Media stocks found a following. Shares of Cox Communications added 2.38 to 41.94, while Time Warner rose 1.15 to 81.01. Cablevision Systems added 1.44 to 70.44, and Adelphia Communications rose 1.13 to 28.81.    Shares of home builders also gained ground, with several names reaching 52-week highs. Economic data released during the session showed that new-home sales slid in August following a sharp gain in July, but nevertheless reflected healthy demand for housing. Shares of Lennar gained 1.06 to 31.25, reaching a 52-week high. Pulte, helped by comments from Goldman Sachs, which started coverage of the stock yesterday, gained 56 cents to 33.56. Centex moved up 1.38 to 34.38. Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 1 to 17.29, near its 52-week low. Lehman Brothers lowered its earnings forecast for the Akron, Ohio, tire maker, and said it expected the company to reduce its dividend.    Raytheon\'s class B shares moved up 1.75 to 29. Striking workers at the Lexington, Mass., defense contractor voted to accept a four-year agreement Monday, ending a monthlong strike against the company.    Electronics For Imaging fell 4.19 to 20.50, a 52-week low, on Nasdaq, caught in Xerox\'s profit warnings. Analysts said that about one-third of sales at the Foster City, Calif., maker of printer components are made to Xerox. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating on the stock yesterday.    Covad Communications fell 2.09 to 9.91 on Nasdaq, pulling back even though the Santa Clara, Calif., provider of Internet access services said it expected to meet its third-quarter earnings targets.    Equifax rose 3.25 to 29.94, reaching a 52-week high in intraday trading. Bear Stearns raised its rating on the Atlanta provider of information services about consumer credit, following the company\'s announcement Monday that it wants to separate into two businesses, spinning off its payment-services division to shareholders.    Intersil gained 25 cents to 41.81 on Nasdaq. Lehman Brothers issued an upbeat research note on the Palm Bay, Fla., semiconductor maker, saying the stock is undervalued, and that it expected strong third-quarter numbers from the company.    Mentor Graphics fell 2.19 to 20.44 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston issued a research note in which it recommended that investors take some profits in the stock, adding that it wasn\'t enthusiastic about the company\'s fundamentals.

156,2004-12-15 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve raised its key interest-rate target for the fifth time this year, giving no signal it would either speed up or slow down the pace of rate changes next year. As widely expected, the Fed raised its target for the federal-funds rate to 2.25% from 2%. It was the fifth consecutive policy meeting at which the central bank raised the target a quarter of a percentage point. In language almost identical to what it said after its November meeting, the Fed said the economy is growing at a ""moderate pace"" despite high energy prices, the job market continues ""to improve gradually,"" and both inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain ""well contained."" The Fed also reaffirmed its intention to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace, interpreted as no more than a quarter point per meeting. Investors trading futures contracts based on movements in the fed-funds rate currently put a near 100% probability that the Fed will raise the rate to 2.5% at its meeting Feb. 1-2, but are split on the likelihood the Fed will repeat that step at the March 22 meeting. Economists said the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee shed no new light on its inclinations. ""The outlook is now data-dependent,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, a money-market research firm in New York. ""The world could change over the next few weeks and they\'re not prejudging it."" There was one slight hint of less inclination to pause in its rate increases. All 12 of the Fed\'s regional banks had submitted requests to raise the discount rate, up from 10 in November. That little-used levy on central-bank advances to commercial banks moves in lockstep with the more important fed-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. Several commercial banks raised their prime rate, a benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 5.25% from 5%. The Fed said, as it has since March, that there are ""roughly equal"" risks of the economy growing faster or slower than its ideal rate, and of inflation going too high or too low. Markets, relieved that the Fed gave no sign of greater concern on inflation, pushed down long-term interest rates. Stocks rose. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor and a Fed analyst at St. Louis forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, said the Fed is torn between data that show the economy to be strong and expectations that a widening trade deficit, high energy prices and less fuel from tax cuts will weigh on growth in the coming year. He predicted the Fed, after raising interest rates in February, would slow the pace of increases thereafter, so that the funds rate reaches about 3.5% by year end. Separately, the FOMC said it would begin releasing minutes to its deliberations three weeks after a policy meeting, instead of the Thursday after the subsequent meeting five to seven weeks later. It is the latest move by the Fed to become more transparent. The earlier release should give the public a better understanding of what drove a particular decision, and more appreciation of any divergence of views within the Fed. Under the old schedule, issues raised in the minutes often had been superseded by intervening developments by the time the public read them. ""In the current environment, where the Fed is being so predictable and there are so few surprises, it won\'t add or subtract that much,"" said Ken Kuttner, an economist at Oberlin College who worked on communications issues while a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ""But when the turning point in interest rates comes, having the minutes available [sooner] will make some difference."" The FOMC had been considering earlier release for at least a year, but officials first had to reassure themselves it wouldn\'t distract from the Fed\'s postmeeting statement. Another concern was whether the central-bank staff could prepare the minutes, which are based on a full meeting transcript, and circulate them for approval in time. The Fed\'s first rate increases were driven primarily by the need to lift the rate from extraordinary lows appropriate only when the economy faced the risk of deflation. With yesterday\'s increase, the rate is firmly above the underlying inflation rate -- 1.5%, according to the Fed\'s preferred measure -- and the Fed is keying its moves more to the ebb and flow of data on growth and inflation. While all 12 voting FOMC members were unanimous in yesterday\'s action, there is growing divergence on the outlook for growth and inflation. Some officials are becoming more wary on the outlook for inflation. Productivity growth -- which enables firms to become ever more efficient -- has slowed, and firms are trying harder to raise prices in response to higher material costs and the lower dollar. In a survey of 185 chief financial officers released yesterday, 56% said their companies have felt rising producer prices and of those, 77% plan to pass along between half and all of that increased cost to consumers. The survey was conducted by Financial Executives International, a trade association, and Baruch College in New York. But other Fed officials think inflation will remain tightly under wraps. They note with factories operating below normal capacity and unemployment still relatively high, businesses will remain hard-pressed to raise prices and workers will struggle to win pay increases.

Traders held their powder before the Federal Reserve\'s Open Market Committee announced it would raise its target short-term interest rate to 2.25%. But after the statement, which included reassurances that the central bankers would maintain a ""measured"" pace of monetary tightening, investors got busy. Stocks pushed higher despite a 2% gain in oil, a record trade gap and somewhat subtle indications from the Fed that the soft labor market just isn\'t firming up. Could the fabled ""Santa Claus"" rally finally be under way? Blue chips have advanced four out of the past five sessions and are up 2% for the month, with only seven more trading days before the Christmas holiday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 38.13 points, or 0.4%, at 10676.45 -- the average is now just 60 points off the 2004 high. Alcoa weighed on the industrials, slumping 1.7% after J.P. Morgan downgraded the aluminum company on concerns of higher costs and declining demand, among other reasons. But Intel, another Dow component, gained 2.7% on a broad rally in the technology sector. That helped carry the Nasdaq Composite Index up 0.5%, or 11.34 points, to 2159.84. Reports of merger talks between security-software makers Symantec and Veritas Software helped prop up the tech sector. The broad Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index added 4.7 points, or 0.4%, to 1203.38, padding its three-year high. While investors held their collective breath until the Fed announcement, the rate increase wasn\'t a surprise. The economy ""appears to be growing at a moderate pace, despite the earlier increase in energy prices, and labor-market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the policy makers said. The ""gradually"" caveat -- a concession to a soft job market -- was the only alteration from the FOMC\'s last statement, in November. ""There had been some talk about more recognition of inflation risk, given [Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\'s] observations in Frankfurt a few weeks back,"" said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, referring to concerns Mr. Greenspan expressed about trade and current-account deficits. But there was no such recognition, and stocks celebrated. In addition to the Dow\'s move closer to its 2004 high, which puts it up 2% for the year so far, the Nasdaq composite, up about 8% for the year, ended at a more-than three-year high. The S&P 500 closed above 1200 for the first time since August 2001, before the 9/11 terrorist attacks; it also is up 8% for the year. Merrill Lynch analysts weighed in with a bullish call for stocks in 2005, citing unleashed corporate cash that has boosted merger activity. Stocks ""offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns relative to their bond counterparts,"" the bank\'s global equity research department said. While the Fed may be conceding jobs are in short supply, U.S. consumers continue to skew global trade balances. A report of a surprisingly sharp jump in the U.S. trade deficit showed that it swelled 8.9% to $55.46 billion in October -- the widest gap since June, when it hit $55.34 billion. While record-high oil prices played a part, the voracious demand for cheap consumer goods from China also was to blame. The trade deficit with China ballooned 8% to $16.8 billion for the month, a record high. It\'s a record that comes amid a tacit U.S. policy to drive down the dollar to help offset the nation\'s trade and budget deficits. Treasury Secretary John Snow has left it for the market to sort out the greenback\'s value. Mr. Greenspan\'s comments to foreign bankers in Frankfurt last month about the threat of the twin deficits were interpreted by many as an endorsement of a weak-dollar policy. The dollar, however, held its ground against the euro yesterday while gaining on the yen as currency traders seemed to have discounted the exploding trade deficit into the greenback.

158,2004-12-15 00:00:00,"['KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A U.S. Commerce Department move to reduce countervailing and antidumping duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber surprised futures traders, who had expected deeper cuts, and led to minimal gains in lumber futures. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange\'s January lumber contract rose 90 cents a thousand board feet to $331.40, and the March position rose $1.40 to $345.50. The Commerce Department announced shortly after noon CST that it was lowering the countervailing duty to 17.18% from 18.79% and the antidumping duty to 4.03% from 8.4%. Before the announcement, traders said they were expecting a combined reduction of about 9% rather than the 6% that was announced. ""The news was a little less bearish than anticipated,"" said Sandi Castillo of Rosenthal Collins Group LLC. Prices settled higher, but since the duty reductions were less than expected, the reaction was minimal and disappointing, traders said. Lumber prices opened narrowly mixed but declined quickly on follow-through selling from Monday\'s inability to hold a rally attempt and on anticipation of a reduction in the Canadian lumber duties, said Bob Book, senior lumber analyst at TJ&R Trading Corp., Chicago. The sharp pullback from Monday\'s high made traders nervous about betting prices would rise, especially since there were no early reports of cash markets making any kind of a rally attempt. As prices were falling, however, word filtered into the pit that one large British Columbia spruce-pine-fir lumber producer found a price at which lumber would move in quantity, Mr. Book said. This price was well below other mills\' quotes, and though the other producers weren\'t selling much, the fact that one was having a good day persuaded traders that maybe the market was finding some firm footing. In addition, at the lows, the January contract fell below even that major producer\'s low prices, and commercial traders stepped in to cover their needs, Mr. Book said. Another broker said rumors began seeping into the pit that the duty announcement would be less of a cut than expected. That prompted local and outside investors to cover earlier bets that prices would fall, and the market began to rise to the day\'s highs, where the buying interest ran out, Ms. Castillo said. HEATING OIL: Futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as the first wave of cold weather spread across the U.S. midsection and the Atlantic Coast region. Some weather forecasters are also calling for colder temperatures to persist for a couple of weeks. Heating oil for January delivery rose 4.75 cents a gallon to $1.3045.

159,1990-03-28 00:00:00,"['Several rounds of computer-guided buy programs put a shiny gloss on an otherwise lackluster stock market, while bond prices eased a bit and the dollar climbed sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 29.28 points to 2736.94 in light trading, but only after being pushed to and fro by various buy or sell programs. At one point the Dow Jones industrials slipped under the 2700 mark before rebounding in late afternoon trading. Analysts said stock market investors are frozen by uncertainty, which was reflected in the low volume yesterday and Monday. Only 131.6 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Monday\'s volume was even lower at 116.1 million shares. ""The whole mood is very uncertain,"" said Laszlo Birinyi, a market strategist who owns his own firm. ""There is no reason for people to do anything at this point. The feeling is that we\'re not going to have any real breakout. With very few exceptions, if you missed something earlier this year, you had a chance to do it again later."" He said that with relatively few shares offered for sale or sought for purchase, buy or sell programs can have exaggerated effects on stock prices. He said a buy program early yesterday afternoon effectively swept up shares offered for sale and subsequent buy programs then drove prices up. Other analysts cited growing worries that disappointing first-quarter earnings may deal stocks a harsh blow. That\'s offsetting any temptation money managers may have to engage in end-of-the-quarter ""window-dressing,"" in which they attempt to be holding winning stocks in their portfolios when they report to clients. ""The earnings do spook people, and you just can\'t get around that,"" said Marshall Acuff, a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. Stock investors got little leadership from the bond market. Despite a powerful dollar rally, which often provides a foundation for higher bond prices, the Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond barely budged. Fixed-income investors are still without a clear sense of direction for the economy and monetary policy. The Federal Reserve\'s Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, met yesterday, but traders said they don\'t expect the Fed to make any changes until March employment and inflation data are available. Currency traders noted that while the dollar staged healthy rallies against the mark and yen, the U.S. currency isn\'t likely to continue strengthening against the mark. They said underlying demand for the German currency will halt its slide. But the dollar\'s upward trend against the yen may continue because it appears to be resulting mostly from the fundamental weakness of the Japanese currency. In major market action: Stock prices shot up in thin trading. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered decliners 889 to 569. Bond prices edged lower. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year issue slipped less than an eighth of a point, or less than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue stood at 8.46%. The dollar climbed. In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.7135 marks and 157.74 yen, compared with 1.6910 marks and 156.70 yen.']",Programs Help Stocks Post Gains --- Prices of Bonds End Down a Bit Despite Dollar's Sharp Rise,1990-03-27,The Wall Street Journal

The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, although the labor market has been weakening. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

161,2003-09-17 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve retained its cautious outlook for the economy today, leaving short-term interest rates unchanged at 1 percent.The decision was not a surprise as Fed officials announced a month ago that they were prepared to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at its current low levels ''for a considerable period.''If there was an added nuance to the decision today by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, it was in its slightly more pessimistic tone about unemployment. In its statement accompanying today's decision, the Fed noted that the labor market had been weakening. That reflected the continued loss of jobs last month and several unexpected jumps in the number of people seeking unemployment claims. By contrast, the Fed described labor conditions last month as mixed.The wording suggested that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was more worried than before that a continuation of the relatively high unemployment rate -- slightly above 6 percent of the work force -- could affect economic growth in the months ahead.

Prices of Treasury bonds and notes moved lower yesterday, with the bulk of the losses recorded among long-term issues.The Commerce Department's merchandise trade data, which showed only a marginal narrowing of the deficit in October from September, were in line with market expectations.Nevertheless, the figures, which showed that the deficit fell to $10.35 billion in October from a revised $10.67 billion for September, were a disappointment to many traders.''The Street was secretly thinking that the deficit figure would be $9 billion or lower,'' one government securities trader said. ''Also, the number we got told us that we will not be getting any further improvement, that with the dollar where it is we may continue to run monthly deficits in the $10 billion to $11 billion range.'' $1 Billion Bond Sale While the trade data provided an early impetus to sell, the bulk of the downward move in bond prices was provided by what market participants described as a huge move out of 30-year bonds and into 10-year notes. According to some traders, the transaction, which was done for a domestic account, involved the sale of $1 billion worth of bonds.

The nation's trade deficit narrowed modestly in October to $10.3 billion, as imports declined twice as much as exports, the Commerce Department reported today.It was the second straight month in which the deficit has narrowed, but the $400 million improvement, though about as expected, was far less than in September. Economists and other experts were divided on whether the latest trade figures represented a positive development.Some economists said the slower pace of both imports and exports indicated a welcome slowdown in the economy that might relieve some pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further to counter a possible speed-up in inflation. 'A Little Moderation'''It does suggest we're seeing a little moderation,'' Evelina M. Tainer, a senior economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said of the trade numbers. She added that ''there still is an improving trend'' in trade.

Other analysts disagreed. Even though the economy showed signs of settling back into a more sustainable growth path during the summer, this now appears to have been only a temporary lull partly as a result of the drought. Most of the recent indicators, including stunningly strong November employment growth reported on Dec. 2, have been buoyant to strong.

Following is a transcript of President-elect Bush's remarks and some of Clayton Y. Yeutter's remarks at a news conference in Washington yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of ABC Radio News:  OPENING STATEMENTSMR. BUSH: Well, I'm pleased today to announce another Cabinet selection and a very, very important one. It is my intention to nominate Clayton Yeutter to serve as Secretary of Agriculture. His wide knowledge of the issues, obviously demonstrated skill and broad experience make him quite simply the best man for this very important job. He himself has worked in farming. He's a noted scholar of agricultural economics and he's twice before held sensitive regulatory and trade posts in the Department of Agriculture. And for many years now he's served the nation with highest distinction as trade representative and international negotiator.Since 1985, Clayton has served in the Cabinet as U.S.T.R. - United States Trade Representative - the man principally responsible for the development and execution of American trade policy. And in that office he's accomplished much in the way of notable work for our country on a number of fronts. Our new and historic free trade agreement with Canada is as much as anything the product of his personal dedication and his personal diplomacy. He's the man who persuaded Congress to remove dangerous protectionist provisions from the omnibus trade and competitiveness bill of 1988, and then his ongoing work in international trade will make a perfect jumping-off point for the important work that lies ahead in American agricultural policy.Ambassador Yeutter has just returned from Montreal where the 96 member nations of GATT completed this midterm review of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. Now President Reagan's objectives in these negotiations are mine, and I know they're Clayton Yeutter's as well - a comprehensive reform of world agricultural trade rules by 1990. And I'm confident that Ambassador Yeutter will continue to ably pursue this goal in his new post, and that our shared national goal of free agricultural trade and expanded agricultural exports abroad will have no better spokesman, no greater advocate. So he knows foreign policy domestically, he knows it internationally, and I am just delighted to think that I will be serving with him as our new - when he becomes our new Secretary of Agriculture.

You're entitled to equal time:MR. YEUTTER: Well, thank you Mr. Vice President. I won't take equal time, because that was a very eloquent statement. I would simply say, Mr. Vice President, as you already know, that I really had intended to return to the private sector at the conclusion of the Reagan Administration, and as I said to you this morning there are only a few people in the world who could convince me to carry forward in another stint in Government, but you're one of those few. And I am deeply honored to serve you, Mr. Vice President, in the coming years, and I hope we'll have a lot of fun in dealing with some very difficult issues - difficult and challenging issues in agriculture. But those are the kinds of issues that make life interesting and rewarding. Continue reading the main story",Transcript of Bush's Remarks on Domestic and Foreign Issues,1988-12-14,The New York Times
165,2009-11-05 00:00:00,"The Dow Jones industrial average erased almost all of a 156-point rally after the House of Representatives passed a bill to curb rate increases on credit cards, touching off concern about bank earnings. The news outweighed investor optimism after the Federal Reserve said it planned to keep interest rates at a record low, Bloomberg News reported.
“Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement on Wednesday after meeting in Washington. “Activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months.”
Gold surged, settling at $1,092.20 an ounce, after the Fed announcement. The dollar, meanwhile, slipped as much as 1 percent against a basket of six currencies.
This year, gold has soared 24 percent, heading for a ninth annual gain, as the dollar fell 6.8 percent. Gold has climbed on speculation that central banks and investors will buy more metal to hedge against a falling dollar. India’s central bank said this week that it bought 200 metric tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund last month.
“With interest rates so low, money is seeking markets that have an upside,” Leonard Kaplan, the president of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Ill., told Bloomberg News. “Momentum is crucial, and gold has a lot of momentum.”
The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index wiped out most of a 1.5 percent rally that began after the Fed said it would leave interest rates at “exceptionally low” levels for an extended period.
“If you’re going to limit how much banks could charge in their credit cards, that’s going to limit profits,” said Art Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. “So it’s certainly another source of pressure.”
At the end of the day, the S.& P. 500 added 0.1 percent, or 1.09 points, to 1,046.5. The Dow increased 30.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,802.14. About five stocks fell for every four that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup led financial shares to the steepest loss among 10 industries. The House legislation would move up the start date of many rule changes that will make it more difficult for banks to increase rates on credit cards.
The S.& P. 500 rallied in morning trading after the Institute for Supply Management’s report on nonmanufacturing businesses showed 1.4 percent growth in new orders and a 2 percent increase in the backlog of orders. The main index in the report fell to 50.6, below analysts’ estimates but still signaling growth.
Some traders may have sold shares in anticipation of the Friday report on the job market in the United States. Economists on average are estimating that the unemployment rate increased to 9.9 percent in October, according to a Bloomberg survey.
The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 16/32, to 100 26/32. The yield rose 3.52 percent, from 3.47 percent late Tuesday.

Eleven Senate Democrats today brought out a $22 billion package of bills that they said would revive the nation's competitiveness in international markets.Competitiveness and trade policy have faded as issues in the Presidential campaign, as have unsuccessful candidates in both parties who focused on them. And the senators, led by George Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, conceded that many of the 30 proposals in their package were not new. But they contended that the presentation of their ideas as a package would dramatize the Bush Administration's reluctance to pursue an industrial policy.They called the plan a comprehensive strategy to maintain American technological leadership, rebuild manufacturing, create high-wage jobs and tighten trade laws. At its core is a trade bill with two central provisions.  Reviewing Foreign TradingOne would allow industries to force the Administration to review foreign compliance with trade bills. The other would revive Super 301, a section of American trade law, much criticized by foreign governments, that would force the United States trade representative to challenge foreign trade barriers on a faster and more rigid schedule. The bill would not include restrictions on car imports from Japan.

167,1999-08-25 00:00:00,"Following is the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5.25 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 4.75 percent.With financial markets functioning more normally, and with persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies firming and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary economic expansion.Today's increase in the Federal funds rate, together with the policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over recent months, should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the interest rate that is charged depository institutions when they borrow from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

Prices of Treasury bonds and notes were little changed yesterday in trading ahead of today's vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement in the House of Representatives.The outlook for approval of the trade treaty linking the United States, Canada and Mexico is still unclear. But some traders said yesterday that they were a little more confident that the Clinton Administration could win approval. A vote is not expected until after trading is finished in New York today.In a separate development, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that it had requested data on the trading of the 30-year bond from the primary dealers that are at the center of trading in the bond market.The request confirms that the Fed is looking into what the market already knows: there is a shortage of the 30-year bond, which could be pushing price artifically higher. What could happen next is that the Treasury could decide to issue more of the same bond in an effort to relieve the shortage. The speculation in the market yesterday was that this increase could occur even before the next scheduled 30-year auction, which is in Feburary.

170,2005-09-21 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 3/4 percent.Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane Katrina. The widespread devastation in the gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production and employment will be set back in the near term. In addition to elevating premiums for some energy products, the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure may add to energy price volatility.While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat. Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures. However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern. Voting against was Mark W. Olson, who preferred no change in the federal funds rate target at this meeting.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4 3/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City.

While some inflation risks persist, they are diminished by the more moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence of any indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased. The committee will continue to monitor closely the evolving economic situation.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee consequently believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.

Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for United States exports. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability.

175,2008-10-30 00:00:00,"For a few moments, Wall Street seemed on track for its most encouraging two-day performance in a month.
But then the sellers rushed in, The New York Times’s Sharon Otterman reports. Within 13 minutes, the momentary upswing that had followed the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday afternoon announcement of a half-point cut in interest rates was gone, and the market’s volatility was back.
The late-day decline echoed other final-hour moves in the market in recent weeks, indicating to investors that the combination of forced selling, profit taking and fear that has kept the market on edge since the start of the financial crisis had not yet resolved into a more reassuring stability.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.82 percent, or 74.16 points, to 8,990.96. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined 1.1 percent, or 10.42 points, to 930.09 and the Nasdaq finished slightly higher at 1,657.21. All three markets rose 10 percent or more on Tuesday.
“We’ve seen this before. Any time you have a market like this, you are setting yourself up for people to sell and take advantage of these profits,” Ryan Larson, head equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, told The Times. “The short-sellers came in, and the profit takers came in, and they came in hard.”
Meeting in Washington, the Federal Open Markets Committee decided unanimously on Wednesday afternoon to cut the benchmark federal funds target rate to 1 percent. It was the latest of a series of moves by the Fed to try to encourage the flow of credit to ease the downturn in the broader economy.
Stocks initially lost ground after the Fed announcement, as some investors had predicted even a larger rate cut. The major indexes then reversed course, with the Dow soaring more than 200 points before the final losses.
Some uncertainty may have been because of varying readings of the statement issued by the Fed along with the rate cut, analysts said. The statement said the central bank would “act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability,” but did not explicitly outline any additional moves to shore up the economy.
“I think some investors were disappointed that the statement didn’t indicate that the Fed was poised to do more,” said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management.
After Tuesday’s rally had sent the Dow soaring 889 points, helped by expectations of the interest rate cut, stocks opened lower Wednesday. They then staged a midmorning rally, a hopeful indication for investors that most of the gains would hold.
“There was a very tepid response in terms of a sell-off in the morning, so that’s a healthy sign,” said Michael Holland, the chairman of Holland & Company.
New economic data released may have also brought the markets some short-lived optimism. In one economic report released Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods rose 0.8 percent, surprising economists who had expected a decline. Orders fell 5.5 percent in August in the biggest setback in nearly two years.
Lending between banks also continued to ease. The government’s plan to assist businesses by buying commercial paper – the short-term i.o.u.’s that companies issue to borrow money for payroll and other immediate needs – began to have some impact, with the volume of commercial paper issued rising by nearly 50 percent since the program began on Monday. The closely watched three-month Libor rate was down, indicating an increase in trust between banks.
“Right now, it looks as if some of the remedies are taking hold,” Mr. Holland said. “Confidence is returning to the credit markets.”
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 101 5/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 3.85 percent, up from 3.83 percent late Tuesday.
The dollar was weaker against major currencies, falling to 97.47 yen, down from 97.63 yen late Tuesday.
Crude oil for December delivery settled at $67.50 a barrel in New York trading.
Overseas, stocks were mostly higher in Europe and Asia as investors focused on the prospect of additional interest rate cuts. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are expected to cut rates next week.
The markets in Asia were higher on Thursday morning. The Nikkei 225 rose 3.38 percent in early trading in Tokyo as investors speculated that the Bank of Japan might cut rates as well. In Australia, the S.& P./ASX 200 index was up 3.14 percent. In a bid to spur growth and shore up exports, China cut key interest rates for the third time in six weeks on Wednesday.
Despite the recent rallies, major stock market indexes globally remain 30 percent to 65 percent down so far this year.
“I think that uncertainty and volatile trading will continue to be the rule until we rehabilitate the years of excess in the credit markets,” Douglas M. Peta, a market strategist at J.& W. Seligman, told The Times. “It’s hard to know how long that is going to take, but we know it’s going to take a while.”

Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday despite a signal from the Federal Reserve Board that it had not yet decided to reduce short-term interest rates.Credit market participants said they were surprised when the Fed chose to drain reserves from the banking system when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading at 4 3/8 percent, just under the 4 1/2 percent level that is widely seen as the Fed's target.Prices of short-term notes and bills fell in the wake of the Fed's move, but recovered later on.""They clearly are telling us that they haven't eased yet,"" one trader said. ""But that doesn't mean they won't do it tomorrow. That is how the market is interpreting what happened.""The Fed's Open Market Committee met yesterday to consider whether it should make any adjustments in monetary policy.  What the Economy Needs

""There is no question but that the economy needs the Fed to do more,"" said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.

Evidence mounted today that the economy has halted its slide and that the improvement already under way in housing may have begun to spread.The Government revised its retail sales figures for March to show a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent instead of an eight-tenths drop and it said sales essentially held this gain in April.""It certainly is going in the direction of an upturn,"" said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at the First Boston Corporation, citing recent increases in industrial production, consumer sentiment and corporate purchasing as well as housing. ""Perhaps the economy bottomed in April, but, if not, it will probably be May or June.""The relative strength in retail sales disclosed today by the Commerce Department appeared to touch off declines in both the bond and stock markets, reflecting diminished chances that the Federal Reserve will need to cut interest rates again to arrest the economic decline and spur a recovery. Stocks, which have been anticipating a recovery since early in the year, are now taking their cue from interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.57 points to end at 2,886.85.

The Consumer Price Index rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in November, as food and shelter grew more costly while energy prices edged down, the Labor Department said today.The increase, which was a bit more than expected, was believed to have been of some concern to those participating in an important Federal Reserve strategy meeting today.With the economy generally seen as sluggish, the Fed has allowed interest rates to decline slightly, but an inflation signal viewed as too strong could give the Fed pause in easing further. The dominant view among economists, however, was that the rise in inflation last month was not high enough to prevent the Fed from easing credit some more in coming days or weeks. Pressure on Credit MarketsStill, the Fed, whose Open Market Committee completed two days of meetings today, did not enter the credit markets, disappointing those who had hoped for an immediate move toward lower interest rates. As a result, traders said, the markets for Government securities, particularly short-term instruments, were under pressure.  [ Page D16. ]  Major parts of the economy, including automotive and other manufacturing sectors, are in the doldrums, economists noted. The housing market is also in a downturn, with the Government reporting today that housing starts dropped by 4.7 percent last month.  [ Page D8. ]  And last Friday's Government report on prices received by producers showed small declines at both the finished goods and intermediate goods levels, indicating that down the road consumer prices should follow suit.

''Inflation remains under control,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today, with recent results holding ''some promise'' of lower interest rates. The Bush Administration has throughout the year been dropping hints that it would like to see the Fed become somewhat more accommodative in supplying the banking system with credit.

Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in light trading yesterday. Dealers sold some securities when it became apparent that the Federal Reserve Board was not prepared to ease credit conditions immediately.The Fed, whose Open Market Committee completed two days of meetings yesterday, refrained from conducting open-market operations.As a consequence of the Fed's inaction, ''the front end of the market is under a great deal of pressure,'' one trader said, referring to short-term securities. ''We are torn between people's perceptions that the economy is slipping into recession and a Fed which seems to disagree with that analysis.''Economists at MMS International, an economic information and consulting firm, said in its daily commentary that ''the lack of Fed intervention severely reduces the chances of a pre-1990 easing, according to our forecasts.''

180,1998-11-18 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again by a quarter of a percentage point today to help keep a gradual economic slowdown from turning into a recession, but the central bank signaled it might hold off on further reductions in coming months.The cut was the third in seven weeks, and like the previous two it was driven by the concern that the global financial crisis was making it hard for companies to raise money, threatening the long expansion in the United States.In reducing rates but suggesting that investors should not count on further cuts, the Federal Reserve was walking a line between calming Wall Street's fears of global turmoil and giving too much stimulation to an economy that has shown surprising resilience in the face of shocks from abroad.With the outlook for further rate cuts now uncertain, the markets reacted with ambivalence. Down 75 points just before the Fed's announcement at 2:20 this afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average pushed 75 points into positive territory after the announcement, then fell back again and closed at 8,986.28, off 24.97 points for the day.

181,2009-01-29 00:00:00,"Following is the full text of the statement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  1/4 percent. The committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.Information received since the committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further. Industrial production, housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending. Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly. Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight. The committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant.In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters. Moreover, the committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The focus of the committee’s policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant.The committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. The Federal Reserve will be implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. The committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.

182,2009-01-29 00:00:00,"For one day, at least, battered bank stocks actually helped the markets.
Reports that the government was considering a deal to set up a “bad bank” to absorb toxic assets ignited a broad rally on Wednesday, with financial companies leading the way, The New York Times’s Jack Healy reports. It was Wall Street’s third consecutive day of gains, which reached across all sectors.
The Obama administration did not announce formal plans to absorb billions of dollars in toxic assets still lingering on the balance sheets of banks. But the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has confirmed that officials were considering such a system, to be run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“Investors are concluding that if the F.D.I.C. is going to run the bad bank and take on all the bad assets of the commercial banking system, then they will suddenly be transformed overnight into good banks,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told The Times,  adding, “which is a bit of a stretch.”
Stocks rose to their highest point in two weeks, injecting a note of cheer into markets that have been stricken by new fears about the scope of the economic downturn.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 200.72 points, or 2.46 percent, to 8,375.45, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index jumped 28.38 points, or 3.36 percent, to 874.09. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index increased 53.44 points, or 3.55 percent, to 1,558.34.
Once again, investors watched developments in Washington as the House prepared to vote on an $825 billion stimulus plan that contains a combination of tax cuts and new spending.
And a statement released by the Federal Open Market Committee indicated that interest rates would stay near zero in the face of the persistent recession. The Fed indicated it was growing more concerned about deflation and the health of the economy and said it was willing to expand programs to buy mortgage-backed securities, which are aimed at unfreezing the credit markets.
“The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability,” the committee said in a statement.
Wells Fargo posted a fourth-quarter loss of $2.55 billion, its profit hurt by mortgage assets that it assumed after it took over Wachovia. But the results were better than some analysts had expected, sending the stock up $5, or 30.88 percent, to $21.19.
Financial companies including Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase rose by double digits. Citigroup gained 66 cents, or 18.59 percent, to $4.21. Bank of America jumped 89 cents, or 13.69 percent, to $7.39. Morgan Stanley rose $3.48, or 17.83 percent, to $23. JPMorgan jumped $2.60, or 10.38 percent, to $27.66.
Shares of banks and brokerage firms were pummeled in 2008 as the credit crisis unfolded and troubles in mortgage-backed assets came to light.
“I would not be backing up the truck to financial stocks just yet,” Stephanie Giroux, chief investment strategist at TD Ameritrade, told The Times.
And analysts said that the gains in financial shares could quickly evaporate.
“A lot of these bank stocks are getting awfully close to zero,” Mr. Yardeni told The Times. “I don’t think you’re seeing buyers. I think you’re seeing short-covering.”
Treasury prices fell as the Fed provided little new guidance on whether it would buy government debt to keep borrowing costs low as the government embarks on broad new deficit spending. The Fed said it was “prepared” to buy longer-term Treasuries if such an action would be “particularly effective” in aiding the credit markets.
The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 1 9/32, to 109 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.67 percent, from 2.53 percent late Tuesday.

Geithner said Wednesday the administration is working on a comprehensive plan to “repair the financial system.”
Mr. Geithner declined to provide any specific details or to address rising calls for the creation of a government institution to buy or guarantee the declining assets at several of the nation’s largest banks, The New York Times’s Stephen Labaton and Edmund L. Andrews reported. He discouraged speculation that the plan would include the nationalization of some banks.
“We have a financial system that is run by private shareholders, managed by private institutions, and we’d like to do our best to preserve that system,” he said.
But bank stocks surged on hopes the government was moving toward creating a “bad bank” to purge toxic assets from balance sheets that are rapidly deteriorating as the economy worsens. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cautioned that the economy was still spiraling downward on many fronts.
According to several Wall Street officials, senior administration members spent the weekend and the last few days reaching out to top bankers for their views on how a bad bank should be structured. Lawrence H. Summers, head of the White House’s National Economic Council; Sheila C. Bair, the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation chairwoman; and Mr. Geithner have been involved in the talks, the Wall Street officials told The Times.
Federal policy makers are discussing how to use the second $350 billion portion of bailout funds. About $50 billion to $100 billion is expected to be allocated to stave off home foreclosures. That would leave up to $250 billion available for the banks, with the bulk going to buying troubled assets.
On Wednesday, the head of the Congressional Budget Office told lawmakers that weakening banks would probably need hundreds of billions in additional funds beyond the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.
But administration officials believe that trillions of dollars more may be needed to buy the majority of bad assets from banks.
“The size of the problem is so large that no one knows if you just wiped out all the assets, how much it would cost,” Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, told The Times. He added that a number of officials estimate it may take up to $3 trillion to $4 trillion to buy the bad assets.
Federal officials are trying to find a delicate balance between stabilizing banks and keeping the nation’s finances steady. Mr. Summers privately expressed concern last week that spending too much to buy bad assets could cripple the dollar, according to a person who spoke with him.
Administration officials are also worried that lawmakers might reject the high price tag. At the same time, spending too little may not provide enough to plug the deepening hole.
“None of the solutions are very easy,” Mr. Schumer told The Times. “All of these proposals sound very appealing until you start to examine them in detail. And then you find that all of them have problems. The good bank-bad bank idea — the problem, first and foremost, is how do you value the assets? No one knows how to do that.”
Lawmakers have complained that the $350 billion already spent under TARP has failed to prevent institutions from continuing to decline. On Wednesday, several senior members of Congress, including Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, urged the administration to detail swiftly how it will run the assets program.
Administration officials have been moving with some caution. They say that they hope to avoid the spectacle of the last administration, which lurched from policy to policy, and in the process lost some credibility in Congress.
Senior officials including Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Ms. Bair have recommended that the new administration consider a so-called aggregator bank that would relieve banks of their worst assets. Such a move, they contend, would restore investor confidence in the banks and encourage investors to provide them with fresh capital.
One version of the plan being floated by bankers would have the F.D.I.C. take the lead in running the “bad bank” and buying the toxic assets for a combination of cash and notes backed by the bad bank.
In return, the government would demand some sort of equity stake. The banks would still be responsible for collecting payments on the loans that they sold, according to bankers briefed on the situation.
Other issues still need to be resolved, including how the government would determine what to pay for the toxic assets, which assets would qualify, and what conditions might be attached. Also under discussion was whether to require banks that dump their assets into the fund to separately raise private capital. That could put pressure on weaker banks.
Government officials are considering other ideas for stabilizing the financial system. Those include expanding the types of government guarantees given to Citigroup and Bank of America to cover more assets at more financial companies. Another idea is to pour even more federal money into the banks, possibly in return for common stock.
In a sense the debate over creation of an aggregator bank or nationalization is really a discussion over how much to expand policies begun during the Bush administration, officials said on Wednesday.
The government in effect has already nationalized several large institutions, including the American International Group, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when it seized control. And it has taken the same steps as creating a bad bank when it took $29 billion in assets held by Bear Stearns and guaranteed more than $300 billion in declining assets at Citigroup.
Officials said the debate within the administration was over how much and under what terms to extend those programs to other institutions. Compounding the complexity is the fact that the administration is simultaneously asking for a stimulus package of more than $800 billion.
Moreover, as the excesses of Wall Street — from expensive corporate jets at Citigroup to huge bonuses and extravagant renovations at Merrill Lynch — ring through Capitol Hill, the idea of a large bailout that does not penalize shareholders and senior executives becomes a tough sell.
The concept of a bad bank has gained momentum in the financial industry as the economy deteriorates, slashing the value of risky assets on banks’ books and increasing the need for banks to hold capital against those losses.
Shares in Citigroup and Bank of America, which both recently received a second taxpayer lifeline, surged 19 percent and 14 percent respectively as the stock market rose on optimism that the administration would relieve banks of money-losing assets.
The Fed said Wednesday the economy remained gloomy, and vowed to use “all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.” Its Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep the federal funds target rate at zero to 0.25 percent.
Analysts estimated that the economy contracted by more than 5 percent in the fourth quarter, one of the sharpest quarterly drops in decades. Employers eliminated two million jobs from September through December.
In the past, the Fed has tried to steer the overall economy almost entirely through the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other to lend overnight reserves. But because banks remained reluctant to lend, even after the Fed lowered the overnight rate time after time, the central bank began creating new programs last fall in which it stepped in as a lender itself.
To push down interest rates on mortgages, the Fed began a program this month to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal agencies. Buying large volumes of a security pushes up its price in the market, which leads to lower yields or interest rates.
Thus far, the Fed has bought about $53 billion of the securities. But rates for the kind of traditional mortgages that Fannie and Freddie guarantee dropped sharply and stayed low as soon as the Fed announced plans for the program in late November.
The committee also served notice that it might purchase longer-term Treasury bonds, a move that would drive down long-term interest rates of all types.
In the next several weeks, the Fed expects to start a $200 billion program to finance securities backed by consumer loans, including car loans and credit card debt. This month, the Fed started a program to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities.
Wednesday’s policy vote was not unanimous. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, in Virginia, voted against the decision.

186,2009-01-29 00:00:00,"When close allies of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg banded together last summer to create a political organization to push for the renewal of a 2002 state law that gave New York City’s mayor control over its public schools, the initial buzz was that it would become a powerhouse lobbying group, raising as much as $20 million and helping shape the debate over the year.
 Instead, the group, called Learn NY, has raised less than $3 million from several foundations. Rather than producing flashy television announcements, it has placed simple ads on Web sites of news organizations and urbanbaby.com, and has tried to spread its positions by posting on education and community listservs and blogs.
At times, such efforts have backfired, with parents calling the posters puppets of the mayor and suggesting that they take their suggestions elsewhere.
With the first of five public hearings on mayoral control by the Assembly’s Education Committee scheduled for Thursday in Queens, the group has lined up supporters to testify about what they see as Mr. Bloomberg’s successes and how the school system is better off now than when the initial legislation took effect.

Some had counted on selling their hoards to investors fleeing the stock market, but a calm day there created no appetite for bonds.The sharp selloff reflected some traders' beliefs that Fed policy makers, who met yesterday, might not lower their rates as soon, or as much, as had been expected.The Fed has already cut its discount rate, which it charges for loans to banks, seven times in less than two years, leaving it at 3 percent, about the same low level as inflation.

Interest rates plunged sharply yesterday, after the Federal Reserve broke precedent for the second time in two months and announced its intention to raise short-term interest rates.In a short statement released in the afternoon, the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the Federal Open Market Committee -- the central bank's policy-setting arm -- had ""decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions."" He added, ""This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term interest rates.""Within minutes of the statement, bond prices rose a half-point on the long end, with rates on shorter-maturity bills dropping sharply. The 30-year bond's yield -- which moves in the opposite direction of its price -- fell as low as 6.83 percent and by late in the day the price was up 110/32 , to 92 18/32 , for a yield of 6.84 percent. The drop of 11 basis points was the largest one-day yield decline in two and a half months. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Rally in Short-Term BillsShort-term bills also rallied strongly, with the rate on three- and six-month bills down 11 basis points as well, to 3.50 percent and 3.79 percent, respectively.

203,1996-11-14 00:00:00,"Government bond prices were little changed yesterday, despite relief that the Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged.The benchmark 30-year bond was off 3/32, to a price of 100 23/32, for a yield of 6.45 percent. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, was up from 6.44 percent on Tuesday. Prices of some securities with shorter maturities rose slightly.Prices generally fell in early trading, despite a favorable report on producer prices for October, which would normally help the bond market. That hesitation, before today's report on consumer prices and retail sales, left many market participants wondering what it would take for bond prices to continue their recent move higher. Yields have been at their lowest levels since March.The October Producer Price Index showed that the core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, down three-tenths of 1 percent, after analysts expected it to be up. The overall index was up four-tenths of 1 percent, more than expected. Traders said the market nevertheless elected to focus on the core inflation rate instead.

Jack Ablin, director of fixed-income activities and senior fund manager at the Private Bank of the Bank of Boston, said he thought that traders saw the higher energy prices as a sign of inflation. Still, he said, companies might have to absorb those higher prices, rather than passing them on to customers, thus helping keep consumer prices stable. ''While oil prices are indeed higher,'' he said, ''we see it more as a tax than an inflation factor.''

204,1996-11-14 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted to keep interest rates unchanged today, as the Government's report on producer prices provided the latest evidence that inflation remained quiescent despite a surge last month in food and energy costs.With both the Fed and financial markets scrutinizing data for signs that inflation may be infecting the economy, the Labor Department's Producer Price Index showed that prices at the producer level actually fell by three-tenths of 1 percent last month when food and energy, which are notoriously volatile, were excluded. The decline in the so-called core component, while driven in part by technical factors, was the steepest in two years.Including food and energy, the index told a very different story: a rise in producer prices for finished goods of four-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest increase since March. But food prices are already showing signs of leveling off after surging in recent months, and the outlook is for energy prices to continue increasing but at a more moderate pace. Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.Indeed, the markets, many economists and presumably the Fed concentrated on the decline in the core rate to conclude that despite steady growth and low unemployment in the sixth year since the end of the last recession, the economy is showing no sustained signs of slipping into the kind of upward wage-price spiral that typically derails expansions.

Authorities Try to Unravel How Daiwa Trader Hid Loss  Japanese and American authorities tried to unravel how a Japanese-born bond trader working for Daiwa Bank in New York lost $1.1 billion over the last 11 years, without raising the suspicions of regulators in either country or of his employer.The trader, Toshihide Iguchi, an executive vice president, was arrested Saturday. A complaint filed in Federal court in Manhattan charged that he maintained a false set of books enabling him to cover his losses, chiefly in United States Treasury securities.  [ Page A1. ] Mr. Iguchi was an unlikely candidate to rise to executive vice president of a major Japanese bank. He majored in psychology at Southwest Missouri State University, and his first job was at a car dealer.

Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting.Bonds were initially higher in early trading after the Conference Board reported its consumer confidence reading had fallen in September to 97.4, below the average trade forecast of 100. In August it was 102.4. Analysts said the report suggested signs of waning consumer optimism that could restrain growth. People buy things when they feel confident; when they do not, manufacturing slows and inventories rise.The 30-year Treasury issue gained 2/32 of a percentage point, to 103 30/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.57 percent, from 6.58 percent on Monday. But shorter-maturity bills, because they are more sensitive to monetary policy, were down sharply. The rate for a three-month bill was up 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.27 percent.Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said he was sure that some of the early price gains were tied to the hopes of some who still believed that there was an outside chance the Fed would ease rates. ""But those hopes did not come to fruition, and bonds relinquished those gains,"" he said.

""I expect the bond market to remain in a narrow trading range over the short term until more evidence regarding the strength of the economy comes forth,"" Mr. Dwyer continued.

Currency traders often watch the performance of the bond market to gauge foreign investors' appetite for American assets, and the dollars needed to buy them.Both bonds and the dollar steadied later in the day because many investors suspected that Fed policy makers had given Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, authority to raise rates at his discretion before the next policy meeting on Nov. 15, said David Durst, a currency-options trader at Bear, Stearns & Company.In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5417 marks, from 1.5527 marks on Monday.

Prices of Treasury long-term securities fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.The 30-year bond fell 18/32 , to a price of 962/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, up from 7.79 percent on Monday and the highest since June 23, 1992. The rates on shorter-term Treasury bills fell, however, as investors sold long-term notes and bonds into less volatile three-month and six-month bills.The market moved after the Fed announced in the afternoon that its Federal Open Market Committee has decided not to raise its target for short-term interest rates, which is now 4.75 percent. An increase would have been the sixth of this year as the Fed sought to fight future inflation by slowing economic growth.Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said because the Fed did not tighten yesterday doesn't mean that it will not happen. ""I suspect they'll hike rates a few more times,"" he said. ""The last time the Fed raised rates was on Aug. 16, and they said then it would suffice for a time.""

And there is unlikely to be much upward pressure on prices as long as labor costs do not accelerate significantly and Europe and Asia remain in the economic doldrums.''I am sure most members of the committee think everything is going rather beautifully,'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist and a former Fed vice chairman. ''They have not allowed themselves to be provoked into some sort of pre-emptive action against inflation and, in hindsight, their patience has proven to be correct.''In the past, the Fed sometimes raised interest rates before any rise in the inflation rate, contending that an increase was necessary to discourage borrowing and thus slow a strong economy before companies raised prices in response to shortages and rising wage pressures.

However, the ebbing of geopolitical tensions has rolled back oil prices, bolstered consumer confidence and strengthened debt and equity markets. These developments, along with the accommodative stance of monetary policy and ongoing growth in productivity, should foster an improving economic climate over time.Although the timing and extent of that improvement remain uncertain, the committee perceives that over the next few quarters the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth are roughly equal. In contrast, over the same period, the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. The committee believes that, taken together, the balance of risks to achieving its goals is weighted toward weakness over the foreseeable future.

The chief danger facing the economy, the Fed said, is that inflation, which is already low, will fall further as demand for new products remains weak. Many economists say they believe that deflation can cripple an economy by effectively increasing debt levels and causing consumers to reduce their spending in anticipation of future bargains. Low inflation, on the other hand, is widely considered to be the ideal situation. Continue reading the main story","Fed Worries About Prices, But Holds Rate",2003-05-06,The New York Times

THE connection between a nation's internal and external deficits is clear: If a nation invests more than it saves and consumes more than it produces - as the United States has been doing - the excess must be covered by an inflow of foreign capital. The greater the internal budget deficit, the lower the rate of national savings and the greater the dependence on foreign capital.The persistent United States budget and trade deficits have lessened the ability of the nation to control its economy and hampered its leadership of the non-Communist world. Among American politicians and economists alike, there is now a consensus that to remedy the nation's external weakness the structural budget deficit must be reduced, and if possible eliminated, in the next four or five years.But there is no consensus on how to do it. The conflict between Republicans and Democrats on that issue has been widened by Vice President Bush's pledge not to raise taxes, while Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts has left open the option of raising taxes if expenditures cannot be cut enough to close the budget gap. Mr. Dukakis asserts he would raise taxes only ''as a last resort,'' but said in an interview with Business Week, ''No serious candidate for the Presidency can guarantee that he wouldn't raise taxes.''Mr. Bush portrays the Dukakis position as a ''fundamental'' difference with his own and apparently means to make his no-tax-increase pledge the centerpiece of his conservative campaign, following the strategy President Reagan devastatingly used against Walter F. Mondale in 1984. This week President Reagan gave strong support to Mr. Bush's assault on Governor Dukakis as a high-taxing, high-spending liberal who had just approved tax increases in Massachusetts.

Highly sensitive to the way Mr. Reagan used the tax issue to crush Mr. Mondale, the Dukakis camp was in a state of anxiety this week on how to parry the Republicans' attack. Until now Mr. Dukakis has been vague on how he would eliminate the budget deficit. He has said it would be irresponsible for him to get too specific before gaining the Presidency.

222,1997-11-13 00:00:00,"For the most part, Treasury securities again danced the dance with stocks yesterday, gaining as stock prices retreated in response to further erosion in the Asian markets.Although traders were watching Federal Reserve policy makers closely yesterday, the decision to keep short-term interest rates unchanged for the fifth time this year was what most bond market participants were expecting. Short-term rates have not changed since March 25, when the Federal Open Market Committee increased the Federal funds target rate, which is the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.Kim Rupert, economist at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said, ''The Fed makes policy decisions on a risk-to-reward trade off, and currently the risks favor a steady stance.''The strength in the October employment report on Friday, which showed joblessness at 4.7 percent, a 24-year low, would have been sufficient for the Fed to push rates up, Ms. Rupert said, but global instability argued against it. Also, she continued, given the lack of domestic prices pressures and the belief that recent turmoil could slow growth slightly, the Fed can afford to wait.

223,1997-11-13 00:00:00,"Torn between fear of incipient inflation at home and concern about unsettling financial markets around the world, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged and ride out the storm for a while longer.The decision had been widely expected by economists and investors, who saw little chance that the central bank would risk upsetting the global markets by raising rates, even though there is mounting evidence that inflationary pressures are building in the American economy.But it highlighted the delicate situation faced by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, as he sought to keep the long economic expansion enjoyed by the United States on track while also taking account of his vast influence over markets and economies in the rest of the world.As if to illustrate just how volatile an environment Mr. Greenspan faces, markets tumbled once again today. Sharp declines in Asian and Latin American markets caused jitters on Wall Street, where investors appeared increasingly convinced that slowdowns in foreign economies would hurt profits of multinational companies and slow growth in the United States.

Investors have now turned their attention to tomorrow's June employment data, which are expected to help determine the Fed's next move on interest rates.The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32 , to 8812/32 , leaving its  yield unchanged from Tuesday at 6.93 percent.Prices were weaker before the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, ended a two day meeting without raising short-term interest rates.

Bond prices bounced off their lows on news of the Fed's inaction.Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said that by not raising rates the Fed was telling the market that the economy was fine and that it was willing to wait and see if growth would begin to accelerate inflation. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the Fed's decision not to raise rates gave the board another seven weeks to analyze  more data. ""But unless the upcoming data shows a significant weakening of the economy, the Fed is very likely to tighten by Aug. 20,"" he said.

225,2003-03-19 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 1/4 percent.While incoming economic data since the January meeting have been mixed, recent labor market indicators have proven disappointing. However, the hesitancy of the economic expansion appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties. The committee believes that as those uncertainties lift, as most analysts expect, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will provide support to economic activity sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time.In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decision making, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks with respect to the prospects for its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth. Rather, the committee decided to refrain from making that determination until some of those uncertainties abate. In the current circumstances, heightened surveillance is particularly informative.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W.

226,2003-03-19 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged today, but it also departed from its standard practice by saying that the uncertainties about Iraq were so great that it could not assess the risks of an economic downturn.It was the first time that the Fed has refused to comment on the ''balance of risks'' between inflation and recession since February 2000, when it began announcing the assessment after every decision on monetary policy.The decision leaves the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the lowest in 41 years. But many analysts and traders had been expecting a broad hint about the Fed's willingness to pump money into the system if the economic news did not improve.In a statement after the meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed said, ''In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks.''

233,2002-08-14 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates steady today but downgraded its view of the economy and signaled that it would consider cutting rates if the recovery from last year's recession continued to lose steam.Abandoning its previous optimism that the economy would gradually bounce back, the Fed emphasized that the decline of the stock market and disclosures of corporate wrongdoing had prolonged a sharp deceleration that became apparent in the spring.The Fed had suggested for several months that it expected its next move to be to raise rates from their current 40-year-low levels to keep the economy from overheating. But it adopted a policy stance today that is often a precursor to a rate cut, saying that the main risk now is that the economy will stall.In a sign, however, that it did not want investors, consumers and businesses to think that it would definitely cut rates -- and in a possible indication of uncertainty or disagreement within the Fed about how to proceed -- the central bank also noted that interest rates are already so low that they should eventually help get the economy going again.

240,2000-08-23 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to leave short-term interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal funds  rate at 6 1/2 percent.Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce. The data also have indicated that more rapid advances in productivity have been raising that potential growth rate as well as containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.Nonetheless, the committee remains concerned about the risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

241,2000-08-23 00:00:00,"Reassured by evidence that wage and price increases remain under control despite robust economic growth, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged but warned that it might raise them later in the year if inflation creeps up.The decision displayed the Fed's confidence that the economy is gradually moving onto a path of slightly more modest, though more sustainable growth, but suggested as well that the central bank is not yet sure that its campaign of rate increases is complete.The task of bleeding off any inflationary pressure without ruining a business expansion is a tricky one under any circumstances. It has become especially complicated in this cycle because, many think, some old rules have been rendered obsolete by the changes that technology and globalization have brought to the economy.Analysts and policy makers are increasingly certain that the economy is capable of a substantially faster pace of noninflationary growth than it was a few years ago, though there is considerable debate in and outside the Fed about where the new tipping point might be and how close the economy is to it.

Prices of Treasury securities rose in lethargic trading yesterday, helped by a rise in the dollar in overseas markets. The move in the dollar prompted some overseas buying, but dealers in New York said most domestic customers showed little interest once trading shifted to the United States.''We have been at these price levels since early this morning,'' said David Green, manager of government bond trading at Chemical Bank. ''The last two days have been as slow as the worst days of summer. I don't know what it will take to get retail investors off the fence, but they show no signs of moving right now.'' Employment Numbers AwaitedRoberta D. Olsen, a fixed-income portfolio manager at the Banc One Asset Management Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, with $650 million under management, said, ''Nobody is going to want to get back into the Treasury market until after the employment numbers are released on Friday.'' He added that now people are doing business in specific sectors like municipals or mortgage-backed bonds, and are trading those until they get a clearer picture of where the economy is going.Still, prices of some Treasury securities moved up by more than half a point, and gains were spread across the maturity spectrum.

In this day and age, consumers should have more choices and not fewer.” He added: “I’d like to know how this serves the public.”Many fans have been angered by the seven-year, $700-million deal, which will move Extra Innings from cable, where it is available to 75 million subscribers, and the Dish Network into an exclusive arrangement with DirecTV, which has 15 million subscribers. Extra Innings had about 600,000 cable and satellite customers last year.A spokesman for Kerry, Vincent Morris, said the DirecTV deal would be only one of several subjects raised during the hearing.

The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid rate and hiring appears to have picked up. Although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher, long-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well contained.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. Similarly, the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance. At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy actions were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

The Fed also declared that the risks to price stability ''have moved into balance.''The statement reinforced expectations among investors that the Fed would start to push borrowing costs higher before the November presidential election. If and when it raises rates, it would be the first time in four years and could lead to the first series of increases since 1994.

Bernanke's first meeting as head of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, the watchword was no surprises.As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the benchmark federal funds rate on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, and suggested that at least one more increase was in the cards. It was the 15th such increase in consecutive meetings of the committee.In its statement describing the decision, the central bank veered little from the Fed's prior assessments of the economy and the expected path of monetary policy, underscoring Mr. Bernanke's stated intention to maintain the course set by his predecessor as Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan.Despite its predictability, the Fed's statement still modestly unsettled financial markets, bolstering the dollar in foreign exchange markets and sending the prices of stocks and government bonds lower. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.64 percent, to 1,293.23. [Page C9.]

Though virtually all investors expected the rate increase, a substantial minority of operators on Wall Street had held hopes that the Fed would indicate that it would be the last one in the cycle that began in June 2004, when the benchmark rate stood at 1 percent. They were disappointed by the clear suggestion that the Fed still saw the need for further tightening. Continue reading the main story",Fed Panel Raises Rate to 4.75%,2006-03-28,The New York Times
254,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 43/4 percent.The slowing of the growth of real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh and Janet L. Yellen.In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 53/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 3 1/2 percent.A significant reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced. Consumption and housing expenditures have held up reasonably well, though activity in these areas has flattened recently. Investment in capital equipment, however, has continued to decline. The erosion in current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on the economy.With pressures on labor and product markets easing, inflation is expected to remain contained. Although measured productivity growth stalled in the first quarter, the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recent years appears to be largely intact, supporting longer-term prospects.The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco.

Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in moderate trading yesterday, as many participants interpreted the open-market activity by the Federal Reserve Board as a sign that the central bank has decided to push interest rates lower.Analysts have been anticipating a further easing in monetary policy by the Fed because the economic statistics of continue to be weak. When the central bank chose not to drain reserves from the banking system around noontime, the period when it normally conducts its open-market operations, analysts took the decision as an indication that the Fed was easing its policy.''The Fed's absence from the market at a time when they needed to drain reserves suggests they are moving to push the Federal funds rate down to 9 1/4 percent,'' said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. ''That could happen over the next day or two.'' Looking for a ShiftFed watchers like Mr. Jones were more sensitive to the central bank's activities yesterday than usual because the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded two days of meetings in Washington. The windup of those sessions has occasionally provided evidence of a shift in policy.

The unemployment rate for June is expected to be unchanged from 5.2 percent in May, many economists say.''The market appeared to be anticipating tomorrow's employment figures as it moved higher following early weakness,'' said Robert B. Ritter, chief technical analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''Given last week's sharp Dow decline, many negatives seem to have been discounted.''Mr. Ritter said takeover stocks continued to lead the market, particularly among transportations issues.

The first Treasury debt sale under new auction guidelines imposed in the wake of the Salomon Brothers bidding scandal went extremely poorly yesterday, as the Government struggled to sell $14 billion worth of new three-year notes.Traders and analysts cited a number of reasons for the poor auction. But all agreed that it would cost the Treasury -- and the taxpayer -- well over $120 million in higher interest over the life of the securities sold yesterday.Aside from an adverse reaction by primary dealers in Government securities to the new rules, traders said that the low level of short-term market rates and disappointment that the Federal Reserve Board did not move to cut key interest rates yesterday contributed to the poor results.  Watching Fed PolicyContinued signs of economic weakness had led some traders and analysts to believe that the central bank, whose policy-making Open Market Committee met in Washington yesterday, might decide to lower the overnight Federal funds rate to 4 3/4 percent from its current target of 5 percent before the refunding auctions began.

The market's focus now turns to the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, which is scheduled to begin on Jan. 31.Many market participants think the Fed will choose that time for another increase in short-term interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating.

The Federal Reserve's top officials met for nearly four hours today but adjourned without announcing any change in interest rates.Most economists and traders still expect the Fed to raise rates again, possibly at its next meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, or perhaps before then.The Fed is prepared to brake economic growth, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned a Congressional panel on Dec. 7, if necessary to prevent recent increases in raw materials and other manufacturing costs from showing up in consumer prices.But the central bank's top officials also hinted earlier this month that they would probably pass up the chance today to raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year. Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, emphasized on Dec. 9 that reliable information on the economy's health for the fourth quarter would not become available until January.

265,1996-12-18 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, concluding that inflation remained dormant despite sporadic surges in economic activity.The Fed's decision had been widely anticipated among economists and in the financial markets. The Fed has not raised or lowered rates since January, and analysts said monetary policy was likely to remain unchanged well into 1997 because the economy had shown few signs of deviating from its course of moderate growth with low inflation, even though unemployment is low and other economic indicators occasionally send warning signals.Indeed, just before the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee began meeting to consider interest rate policy today, the Commerce Department reported that construction of housing jumped sharply higher last month, suggesting that the economic growth could be picking up again in the fourth quarter after cooling down substantially over the summer.Driven in part by a decline in mortgage rates, housing starts rose 9.2 percent in November, the biggest monthly jump since July 1995, the department said. The increase, which put housing starts at an annual rate of 1.514 million units, wiped out nearly all of a decline in new housing activity recorded in September and October.

Is this inflation, as the Government's statisticians contend? Or is it simply fair value for the promise of longer, healthier lives, as a blue-ribbon panel of economists argues?Or consider what happens when people shift from going out to the movies to bringing videos home. Watching ''Independence Day'' at the neighborhood theater costs, say, $7 a ticket while the video rental is $3.50, no matter how many people crowd around the television. Both prices have held steady for a while. Is that zero inflation, as the Government says? Or should the Consumer Price Index register a price decline for movies as people shift to a different movie experience that is less costly but comparable in quality, as the economists contend?In the suddenly expanding debate over the accuracy of the C.P.I. -- which is used to set everything from Social Security pensions and union wage increases to individual tax brackets -- questions like these are crucial. Indeed, behind the controversy, which was set off when the Congressionally appointed panel of economists recently released its report, lie two fundamentally different ways of looking at the economy.The blue-ribbon panel, led by Michael A. Boskin, President George Bush's chief economic adviser, concluded that the C.P.I. exaggerates the rate of inflation by slightly more than one percentage point a year. Defenders of the current way of measuring price changes -- a group that includes representatives of the elderly, labor unions and a number of economists as well -- contend that any error is much smaller.

''The market will continue to struggle with each upcoming data release, as traders attempt to divine the course of future rate moves. There is still the risk of higher rates this summer.''Because it was the short end of the market that would have been hit hard had the Federal Open Market Committee raised rates yesterday, it was the short end that experienced the sharpest rally.

The Fed made its intentions known simply by saying that the committee had adjourned with no announcement.Private economists have begun debating whether the central bank overreacted to fears of inflation in doubling short-term rates throughout 1994. If that is true, the Fed may be forced to start cutting them again later this year if the economy slumps.Fed governors have indicated that so far they believe this is unlikely. Some expect the economy to revive later this year as business inventories are run down and falling bond yields and a weak dollar stimulate housing and exports.

That helps explains the Fed's hand-off policy.Nevertheless, financial markets are starting to expect that the Fed's next move will be to cut rates during the summer or autumn.

Faced with slowing growth in the American economy and a strengthening dollar, the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at a meeting today.The Fed's interest rate policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, signaled its decision with a brief statement. ""The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 12:15 P.M.; there is no further announcement,"" said Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed's chief spokesman.The phrasing of the announcement matched almost exactly the wording of statements from previous meetings at which the Fed left interest rates unchanged.Few economists were surprised by the Federal Reserve's announcement. The central bank doubled short-term interest rates in the 12 months that ended on Feb. 1 in response to a burst of economic growth that appeared likely to produce some increase in inflation.

A wide range of economic indicators since then has pointed to slower growth, while inflation has barely risen. Producer prices and consumer prices did creep up in April. But last year's sharp increases in prices for raw materials like wheat and for semiprocessed goods like steel have not yet produced the run-up in finished good prices that many Wall Street economists and some Fed officials feared last year.

Bonds rallied yesterday, sending interest rates to their lowest levels in nearly a week on speculation that the Fed would cut short-term interest rates soon.The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met without changing the Fed's monetary policy. After the meeting, the Fed's spokesman simply said, ""There is no further announcement.""William Shea, senior vice president-head government trading at Nikko Securities Company International, said that Treasuries received a lift from a report in The Washington Post yesterday that suggested Fed officials would lower the overnight bank loan rates, better known as the Federal funds rate, sometime this year. The article said that the central bank could cut short-term rates as much as 1.50 percentage points this year, if growth slowed to a 2.5 percent pace.Analysts said that since the economy was widely predicted to grow at less than that rate in the first quarter of this year, the newspaper article effectively presented a case for an easing of rates in the near term.

Wall Street rushed back to stocks for a second consecutive session yesterday, nearly wiping out last week's losses, after the Federal Reserve signaled a continuation of its steady interest-rate policy and traders speculated that there would be a rate cut later this year.As measured by the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks and the Nasdaq composite index, stocks raced to record levels. Traders bought back many of the stocks they had bid down last week, and much of the market has now returned to its price level of last Wednesday. The market fell 81.96 points on Thursday alone, when there was a rush of sell orders brought on by the quarterly expiration of options on Friday.The bond market continued its rally, but the rush to equities was not altogether explained by the lowering of borrowing costs implied by the rise in bond prices. For one thing, volume on the New York Stock Exchange surged to 362.7 million shares yesterday, more than the 352 million shares on Thursday, when traders were rushing for the exits.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.81 points, to 4,436.44, just 1.03 points shy of establishing a new high. It followed the even stronger rebound of Monday, when the Dow surged 54.30 points.

The broader S.& P. 500 rose 4.94 points yesterday, finishing at a record 528.59. The Nasdaq composite index, rich in the technology stocks that have led the market recently, advanced most of all, with the index rising 8.46 points to 879.64.

272,1998-07-02 00:00:00,"The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged yesterday, after, as expected, the Federal Reserve policy-making committee decided not to adjust interest rates.The 30-year bond closed at a price of 107 6/32, leaving the bond's yield at 5.62 percent.Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, attributed the Fed's decision to a slowdown in the economy, subdued inflation, the budget surplus and the malaise in Asia.Treasury securities opened weaker yesterday after the dollar fell in currency trading. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors, who also benefit from the currency translation.But then a report on manufacturing suggested the economy was slowing. ''Indeed, economic data released today clearly indicated a slowing of economic momentum, as exemplified by the sharp decline in the National Association of Purchasing Management index, a fallback in construction spending, and the flattening in the index of leading indicators,'' Mr. Fine said. The June manufacturing index fell to 49.6 from 51.4 in May, the first time in two years that the level has dropped below 50, a sign of contraction in the industrial sector.

Mr. Fine added that some of the declines in the index were for production, employment and inventories, and while some of the sluggishness may be a result of the strike against the General Motors Corporation, he said, the crisis in Asia was  playing a much greater role.

Construction spending tumbled 1.5 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $633.5 billion as private and public sectors registered declines. And the Conference Board's index of leading indicators was unchanged in May for the second consecutive month, which could  be signaling slower growth in the third quarter as well as the second  quarter.The Government will report today  on the number of jobs added to the economy last month and on the unemployment rate, both of which are capable of moving the market. Estimates of jobs created range from an increase of 125,000 jobs to an increase of 250,000, placing the consensus at about 190,000 new jobs.

273,1998-07-02 00:00:00,"Banks are lending out cash a bit too easily, with too little regard for the risks that will come if the economy stumbles into recession. So says the Federal Reserve in an unusual letter sent to all banks last week and released to the public this week.That the Fed should be worried about easy credit now is merely the latest indication that the American economy is out of sync with many other world economies. Most of Asia is in the midst of a severe credit crunch, as suddenly cautious banks try to get back the money they were lending out so willingly as recently as last year.The Fed's letter, based on a detailed analysis of a sample of loans made by large banks across the country last year, falls well short of an indictment of bank lending practices. But the tone is one of caution, and there are specific warnings that credit standards may have slipped in certain areas, among them loans to real estate investment trusts and media companies. The Fed is also concerned that banks may be charging too little on loans to corporate customers. It is a concern that some top bankers privately say is warranted.To the extent the Fed's warnings are taken to heart by bankers, the letter might serve as a mild drag on the American economy, something some Fed officials would like to see. The Fed has been unwilling to accomplish that through the usual means, raising interest rates, because of concerns that such a move would exacerbate the Asian economic crisis. No one was surprised that this week's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee ended without a decision to raise or lower rates.In good times bankers vie to make loans, and are sometimes willing to use overly optimistic assumptions to justify those loans both to management and to regulators. Then, after errors become apparent, bankers grow too cautious, as may be happening now in Asia. If the Fed's letter does help to hold down excessive optimism now, it could help to reduce or forestall the pain that will be felt if the American economy does suffer a setback.

274,1998-07-02 00:00:00,"With signs of a slowing economy and increasing evidence that the Asian economic crisis is beginning to hurt some industries in the United States, the Federal Reserve today decided not to raise interest rates.Following a two-day private meeting, the Fed said that it was keeping the benchmark Federal funds rate -- the borrowing cost on overnight loans between banks -- steady at 5.5 percent, just where it has been since March 1997.At the same time, other indicators were released today that gave a picture of an economy cooling down from the hectic pace of the last year or so. A key index of manufacturing activity, the monthly purchasing managers' report, fell in June for the first time in two years. This index measures manufacturing production and its sharp decline from 51.4 in May to 49.6 in June was seen as evidence that the Asian economic turmoil is starting to affect American industrial producers.The Commerce Department also reported today that construction slumped 1.5 percent in May, the worst drop in more than four years, and the Conference Board's indicator of future economic activity remained unchanged from April to May, at 105.2. This is the second consecutive month that the Conference Board's leading indicator stayed fixed, a sign that the economy, while still on a positive track, is expected to be sluggish.

''When you have an economy where inflation is low and the economy is slowing, there is no reason for the Fed to raise rates,'' said Stan Shipley, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. ''And the three indicators also released today indicate that this economy is weakening and weakening rapidly. We think that by December we may begin to see unemployment rise and retail sales fall and then the Fed will have to vote to lower rates.''

275,2001-02-01 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, decided to lower interest rates by 50 basis points, or hundredths of a percent:The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 1/2 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5 percent.Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. In response, manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment.Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit few signs of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates, should support growth of the economy over time.Nonetheless, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco.

The dollar rose yesterday against most currencies, despite a concerted round of dollar selling by the Federal Reserve and eight European central banks.Some traders and economists said they expected the dollar to continue to rise, unless there are increases in interest rates in West Germany and Japan or the Japanese central bank joins the dollar selling. And they predicted that the dollar could top 1.90 marks, which is considered the ceiling set for the currency by the Group of Seven, including the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.In late New York trading, the dollar was at 133.25 yen, up from 132.70 Monday, and at 1.8960 marks, up from 1.8834. The dollar was also sharply higher against the Swiss franc at 1.6540 and the British pound. The pound, which was at $1.7080 Monday, fell to $1.6855. Policy-Making Group MeetsThe rise in the dollar came as the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee met yesterday to consider pushing interest rates higher to curb economic growth and inflation.

ORGANIC agriculture, espoused by those who went back to nature in the 60's, is on the verge of changing from a movement to an industry. In ever-increasing numbers and at ever-increasing speed, growers, distributors, retailers, governments, agricultural scientists and economists are responding to consumer concerns about food safety by exploring organic agriculture.''We no longer position ourselves as an alternative,'' said Fleur Hedden, vice president of marketing for Whole Foods Market, an eight-store organic- and natural-food chain in Texas. ''We are mainstream.''Organically raised food is generally described as food grown by traditional farming methods without synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides or fungicides. Organic farming relies on crop rotation, manure and biological methods to control pests. Organic farming is a stricter form of sustainable agriculture, which seeks to reduce pesticide residues in food butnot necessarily to eliminate them.Less than 1 percent of the produce in this country is organic; even if sales continue to climb, experts do not expect it to be much more than 9 percent of the total produce grown in the next few years, said Robert Scowcroft, executive director of California Certified Organic Farmers.

But until recently such products were available only from relatively small producers and manufacturers, usually in natural-food shops. That situation is changing rapidly, and in the meantime, the stores that sell organic food are doing a land-office business.

278,1997-07-03 00:00:00,"Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, as the Federal Reserve opted to keep monetary policy unchanged and more economic data pointed to a slowing economy, with low inflation.The 30-year bond rose 13/32, to a price of 98 31/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.71 percent, from 6.74 percent on Tuesday.While the market was relieved by the decision of the Fed's Open Market Committee not to raise interest rates, analysts said investors were equally interested in scrutinizing today's report on the labor market for signs of inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.But adding to the picture of a slowing economy, the Government reported yesterday that factory orders in May fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, more than the two-tenths of 1 percent decline that was expected. The April factory orders were revised upward to 1.4 percent, from 1.2 percent, and served only to underscore the decline in May.

''While the economy's apparent sluggishness in the second quarter, coupled with a still decelerating rate of inflation, kept the Fed at bay, there are still a number of developments in the economic picture that suggest caution in the months ahead regarding another round of Fed tightening and a potential backup in bond yields,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.

280,1997-07-03 00:00:00,"U.S. central bankers decided to leave interest rates unchanged at their two-day policy meeting that ended Wednesday, after the economy showed few signs of inflation despite strong growth in recent months.After pushing up short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point in March, the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee has opted at its last two meetings to maintain its target for overnight interbank loans, which set a floor for U.S. rates, at 5.50 percent.Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had been warning investors since late in 1996 that the central bank was concerned about rising stock and bond prices, which he said might reflect ""irrational exuberance"" about the markets' prospects. But although the economy grew at a strong 5.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter of the year, there have been few signs of inflation.It is widely believed that economic growth slowed to a rate of about 2 percent in the second quarter, but with unemployment below 5 percent for the first time in two decades, there have been questions as to whether a lack of workers would require wage increases that would kindle significant inflation.

281,2008-06-26 00:00:00,"Following is the full text of the statement released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent.Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending. However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.The committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year. However, in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high.The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time. Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased. The committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I. Plosser; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Richard W. Fisher, who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.

HOUSTON — The two political parties have settled on markedly different strategies for improving domestic oil supplies to help lower gasoline prices.Republicans want to end the 27-year ban on offshore drilling along much of the nation’s coastline, while Democrats want to force companies to speed up exploration in certain offshore areas that they already control. A version of the Democratic plan may come to a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Thursday.But oil experts say that neither approach will give drivers any relief in the short run from prices that stood Wednesday at nearly $4.07 a gallon, on average. They say the simple reality is that no one knows how much oil is to be found  offshore, how difficult producing it would turn out to be or how many years that might take.And oil companies, amid a global drilling frenzy, are stretched so thin they will be hard-pressed to take on big new projects anytime soon. More than 400 major drilling and production projects are competing for engineers, rigs, seismic equipment and steel to build platforms, and the costs of doing the work have skyrocketed.

284,2008-06-26 00:00:00,"On Wall Street, there are stars that fade and stars that fight. Richard A. Grasso is one of the latter.
On Wednesday, Mr. Grasso, the former chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, won another round in his almost five-year battle to keep the $187.5 million of pay he amassed during his eight years at the helm of the Big Board.
The New York State Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling dismissing four of six counts originally brought by Eliot Spitzer, then New York’s attorney general, against Mr. Grasso. The decision leaves Mr. Spitzer’s successor, Andrew M. Cuomo, two claims to pursue.
Since 2004, the attorney general’s office has argued that Mr. Grasso’s pay was unreasonable under New York’s nonprofit laws and that his compensation was not properly disclosed to the exchange’s board. (The exchange became a public, profit-making corporation in 2006, after Mr. Grasso had been awarded his pay.)
But the Court of Appeals ruled that state law did not give the attorney general the authority to bring major parts of the case.
“Mr. Grasso is gratified by the court’s decision,” Gerson A. Zweifach, one of Mr. Grasso’s lawyers along with Mark C. Zauderer, told The new York Times. “He always had faith in the justice system.”
While the decision is certainly a win for Mr. Grasso, the war is not over. In 2006, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Grasso had breached his fiduciary duty to keep the board informed about his pay and ordered Mr. Grasso to pay back at least $100 million. “Mr. Grasso’s duty is to be fully informed and to see to it that the board was fully informed,” Justice Ramos wrote. “He failed in this duty.”
Mr. Grasso is appealing that decision.
“Both sides have something to look forward to,” Richard J. Schulman, a securities lawyer for Bryan Cave, told The Times. “The attorney general has a decision from the lowest court saying there has been a breach of fiduciary duty. But Grasso has slimmed down the case against him.”
Mr. Grasso’s fight to keep his pay has drawn widespread attention, partly because of his rags-to-riches story. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Queens, dropped out of Pace University and started his career as a clerk at the exchange. But he rose through the ranks, ultimately securing the chairman’s title and ringing the exchange’s famous bell with business and political luminaries. He was even featured on an episode of “Sex and the City,” ringing the bell with Sarah Jessica Parker.
He protected the exchange’s open-cry auction system, which many deemed outdated and rife with human error, against the near universal move to all-electronic trading.
After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, Mr. Grasso helped get the exchange open again and reveled in his role as a high-profile cheerleader for the United States economy and its markets.
As his star rose, so did his pay. His annual compensation, including special payments, bonuses and base salary, soared from $3 million in 1996 to more than $30 million in 2001, when he was awarded a hefty bonus for his stewardship of the exchange through Sept. 11, according to an internal report conducted by the exchange’s lawyers and Winston & Strawn.
In 2003, in a move that would lead to his undoing, Mr. Grasso sought to cash out some of his retirement benefits. Some directors say he expressed concern that a future board would be less willing to give him the money, a charge he contests. The compensation committee devised a contract to award him an immediate lump sum payment of $139.5 million and an additional $48 million to be paid over four years for past and future work.
A storm of controversy followed. Some directors, including Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the head of Goldman Sachs, argued against paying out Mr. Grasso’s retirement benefits before retirement. Others said Mr. Grasso was entitled to money he had earned. By Aug. 7, 2003, when the board was scheduled to meet, some directors seemed to believe the lump sum payment would not be awarded since it was not on the agenda for a board meeting.
But the issue was presented and after a debate, those present voted to pay Mr. Grasso the lump sum. The amount was disclosed to the public. Two days later, the exchange revealed that Mr. Grasso was owed an additional $48 million. As the uproar over his pay continued to ripple around the world, the board voted 13 to 7 in favor of asking Mr. Grasso to resign.
Mr. Grasso will now wait to see what happens with his appeal of the two remaining charges, while Mr. Cuomo will have to decide how to proceed with the remaining claims. According to the appellate court’s ruling, the attorney general must prove that Mr. Grasso knew the compensation was unreasonable and that he “violated his fiduciary duties to the New York Stock Exchange by accepting awards of excessive compensation” while in the job.
Mr. Grasso’s recent victory could push the attorney general to seek a settlement. “The dismissal of these claims may ignite renewed talks of settlement,” Robert A. Mintz, a former federal prosecutor and a lawyer at McCarter & English, told The Times. “It’s a win for Grasso but the war is far from over.”

285,2008-06-26 00:00:00,"HOUSTON — The two political parties have settled on markedly different strategies for improving domestic oil supplies to help lower gasoline prices.Republicans want to end the 27-year ban on offshore drilling along much of the nation's coastline, while Democrats want to force companies to speed up exploration in certain offshore areas that they already control. A version of the Democratic plan may come to a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Thursday.But oil experts say that neither approach will give drivers any relief in the short run from prices that stood Wednesday at nearly $4.07 a gallon, on average. They say the simple reality is that no one knows how much oil is to be found offshore, how difficult producing it would turn out to be or how many years that might take.And oil companies, amid a global drilling frenzy, are stretched so thin they will be hard-pressed to take on big new projects anytime soon. More than 400 major drilling and production projects are competing for engineers, rigs, seismic equipment and steel to build platforms, and the costs of doing the work have skyrocketed.

It was the third consecutive meeting at which the Fed kept monetary policy on hold, after raising rates by 1.75 percentage points in six steps starting in June of last year.In announcing its decision, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee suggested that the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth had increased in recent years and that the expansion had slowed to near that range. But its statement was laden with caveats, and gave no indication that the Fed had begun thinking about cutting rates, as some investors had been hoping it would.Faced with the likelihood that rates would remain steady at best in coming months and might even rise, investors sent stock prices down after the Fed's announcement.

In announcing the move, the Fed, the nation's central bank, noted signs that the downturn may be reaching a bottom, the first time the Fed has done so since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.

294,2005-02-03 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve raised short-term U.S. interest rates on Wednesday, its sixth increase since last June, and signaled that its strategy of gradually raising rates is far from over. The central bank nudged up the federal funds rate, the rate charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter of a point, to 2.5 percent.
In a statement that accompanied the decision, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated that it could afford to raise rates at ""a pace that is likely to be measured.""
The Fed also repeated almost word for word its previous sanguine view about the outlook for both economic growth and inflation. In so doing, it gave no hint of either slowing down or speeding up the process of tightening monetary policy.
With the decision Wednesday, the Fed has now more than doubled overnight lending rates from their 46-year low of 1 percent eight months ago.
But even with the latest rate increase, short-term borrowing costs are barely equal to the pace of inflation and below historical averages. More important, long-term interest rates for corporate bonds and home mortgages have actually declined in recent months.
Indeed, analysts say there is so much money available for lending that financial institutions are squeezing down rates for relatively high-risk corporate borrowers.
""There is so much liquidity in the marketplace that the only way lending institutions can compete is by lowering rates,"" said William Zadrozny, chief executive of Siemens Financial Services, which provides financing for business equipment and a wide array of other needs.""People are reaching to employ their money.""
Even though some Fed officials have begun to worry that rising wage costs and slowing growth of productivity could fuel inflation, the central bank said on Wednesday that the upside and downside risks to both inflation and growth are still ""roughly equal.""
By reiterating that monetary policy is still ""accommodative,"" the Fed signaled that it has not yet approached a ""neutral"" level of interest rates that neither encourages inflation nor slows down the economy.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, has refused to say what a ""neutral"" rate would be in practice. But most analysts expect the Fed to keep raising overnight rates until they reach at least 3.5 percent and perhaps 4 percent.
Investors had almost unanimously expected the quarter-point increase.
Greenspan is expected to shed more light about the Fed's plans when he testifies before the banking committees of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate on Feb. 16 and 17.
Fed officials face several big uncertainties as they plot their strategy. They need to dissect conflicting pressures on inflation: consumer prices have climbed more slowly in recent months, but last year's run-up in oil prices has yet to have its full impact.
Potentially more important, Fed officials must grapple with the possibility of a prolonged slowdown in productivity growth and rising wage costs.

296,2009-04-30 00:00:00,"It may still be months before the economy turns around, but investors on Wednesday were acting as if a recovery were just around the bend, and bet heavily that the worst economic declines were over.
Stock markets rallied broadly as investors stampeded into financial stocks and abandoned the safe-haven investment of Treasury debt, The New York Times’s Jack Healy reported. Their mood was leavened by an optimistic gloss on the country’s first-quarter output and a statement from the Federal Reserve saying that the pace of economic contraction was “somewhat slower.” 
Although stocks gave up some of their gains in the last minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average still rose 168.78 points, or 2.1 percent, to 8,185.73. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 18.48 points, or 2.2 percent, to 873.64, its highest close in three months.
“The market seems to be looking forward,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, told The Times. “It’s a good sign that the market’s focusing on the potentials of a rebound as opposed to the decay in economic activity.”
An analyst’s report predicting healthier bank profits helped lift financial shares. Bank of America rose 6.5 percent to $8.68 as shareholders meeting in North Carolina re-elected the bank’s board. After the markets closed, the company announced that its chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, was voted out as chairman.
Shares of the media and entertainment companies Time Warner and DreamWorks Animation rose after they reported earnings that beat investors’ expectations.
On its face, there was little cause for jubilation in the day’s economic news. The government reported that the gross domestic product — an important measure of the economy’s total output — fell at an annual pace of 6.1 percent from January through March, nearly identical to its plunge of 6.3 percent in the last months of 2008..
But investors took consolation because consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, rose slightly after six months of declines. And they expressed hopes that government spending would pick up and other economic indicators would brighten as the government’s $787 billion stimulus program kicks into gear.
And they fixed on a statement from the Fed’s Open Market Committee that looked ahead to a “gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.”
But as the government tries to combat the sluggish economy with tax cuts and huge new spending projects, investors showed signs of balking at the vast new supply of Treasury debt pouring into the marketplace. The Fed has already laid out plans to buy $300 billion in longer-term Treasuries to keep interest rates low, but it announced no additional measures on Wednesday. As credit markets begin to heal and once-wary bond investors develop an appetite for higher returns, they are beginning to stray from Treasury notes, sending yields sharply higher and potentially increasing the cost for the government.
The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 26/32, to 97. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.11 percent, from 3.01 percent late Tuesday.

In “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” when Bottom, in his ass’s head, is told “thou art translated!,” he has not only been physically transformed but also magically intoxicated, transmigrated to another world. In the Translation Slam on Friday, part of the PEN World Voices Festival, the Catalan poet Narcís Comadira will allow one of his poems to transmigrate through Mary Ann Newman and Rowan Ricardo Phillips. Mr. Comadira, who is a translator as well as a poet (“Formes de l’Ombra” or “Shadow Forms”), playwright, critic and artist, will read his poem in Catalan, followed by the English versions, prepared and read by Ms. Newman, director of the Catalan Center at New York University, and Mr. Phillips, poet and professor of English at Stony Brook University.So one poem becomes three, and the audience then dissects them, weighing meanings, tone, rhythm and the “feel” of each. “The conversation becomes an analysis of the act of writing,” said Michael F. Moore, the moderator and chairman of the PEN translation committee.Changing geography, the Irish writer Nick Laird (author of the poetry collection “On Purpose” and the novel “Utterly Monkey”), will read his poem in English, followed by a Spanish translation by Valerie Mejer, a Mexican poet and artist, and the writer Javier Calvo. (Mr. Calvo’s novel “Un Mundo Maravilloso” or “Wonderful World” was translated from Spanish into English by Mara Faye Lethem, the evening’s co-migrator.)This differs from last year’s Slam, Mr. Moore said, in which poems were translated from German, Spanish and Italian into English. “It’s my subversive little contribution to making the festival even more international, by pushing the English language into the minority position,” he said, “to get writers in English thinking about what happens when their words are transported into another language.” Even with skilled interpreters, and perhaps a touch of magic, you still can’t be exactly sure where a literary journey will end.

299,1999-02-04 00:00:00,"Trapped between conflicting pressures at home and abroad, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, keeping its hands off an economy that is either gratifyingly robust or too strong for its own good.The decision, almost universally expected by economists and investors, caused barely a ripple on Wall Street. But it highlighted the dilemma facing the central bank just months after it cut rates three times to insure that financial turmoil in much of the rest of the world would not derail the long American expansion.Rather than slowing, the economy grew at a torrid 5.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, putting back on the agenda the possibility that inflation, long dormant, could reappear. One faction within the Federal Reserve is also concerned about rapid growth in the money supply, a cause or signal of inflation.As a result, analysts said, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and his colleagues on the central bank are almost certainly considering whether they will need to reverse course and raise rates later this year if growth does not slow markedly on its own.

Yet the continued fragility of global financial markets, a rapidly expanding trade deficit, concern about causing a big selloff on Wall Street and the almost total absence of any hard evidence of inflation have combined to create a strong case for leaving rates alone or even cutting them further.

300,1999-07-01 00:00:00,"Following is the statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term rates:The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the Federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent. Last fall the committee reduced interest rates to counter a significant seizing-up of financial markets in the United States. Since then, much of the financial strain has eased, foreign economies have firmed and economic activity in the United States has moved forward at a brisk pace. Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment is judged no longer necessary.Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures.Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the F.O.M.C has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action. The committee, nonetheless, recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth.

301,2004-09-22 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 - The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates another quarter of a point on Tuesday, and it suggested that it will keep raising them gradually over the next year.It was the Fed's third rate increase in three months. Coming six weeks before the presidential elections on Nov. 2, the decision pushed the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks up to 1.75 percent from 1.5 percent.While incumbent presidents normally cringe at the prospect of higher rates before an election, the increases are not expected to pose a threat to President Bush because consumers and businesses have felt almost no tangible impact.Long-term interest rates, which determine home mortgage rates and many commercial loans, have edged down since June as fears of inflation have receded.

302,2004-09-22 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1 3/4 percent.The committee believes that even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. After moderating earlier this year partly in response to the substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appears to have regained some traction, and labor market conditions have improved modestly. Despite the rise in energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 2 3/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

Economic growth appears to have slowed recently, partly reflecting a softening of household spending. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction and some slowing in export growth are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth.Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the Committee. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S.

Proponents of a more systematic government role to help relieve financial institutions of their toxic securities range from Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary under President Clinton, to former Federal Reserve chairmen Paul A. Volcker and Alan Greenspan.
In Congress, the idea that is gaining traction centers on the creation of a new agency that would buy troubled assets from hobbled companies.

Steny H. Hoyer, the House majority leader, said there was no time to consider any new proposals in the two weeks before Congress adjourns.
But in its ad hoc approach to the crisis, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have, in effect, already embarked on a course similar to the proposals in Congress.
In the case of Bear Stearns, the Fed took $29 billion of the investment bank’s mortgage-related assets as collateral for a Fed loan to JPMorgan Chase, which then agreed to acquire Bear Stearns.
In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Treasury Department placed the companies in a conservatorship and explicitly backed the $5.3 trillion of mortgages they own or guarantee.
Treasury also agreed to buy an unspecified amount of Fannie’s and Freddie’s mortgage-backed securities on the open market, starting with a $5 billion purchase this month. Those securities are to be managed and ultimately sold for the government by an investment house on Wall Street.
But federal officials remain concerned about the plight of other institutions, including Washington Mutual, the nation’s largest savings association. Experts estimate that a government bailout of Washington Mutual could cut in half the size of the federal deposit insurance fund, which protects bank depositors at thousands of banks and savings and loan institutions.
Mr. Frank was among the House and Senate leaders who were hastily called to a meeting Tuesday with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to hear about the Fed’s latest rescue plan, this time of the American International Group.
Mr. Frank said that one of the issues discussed in the meeting was a potential need for broader, longer-term federal action in the marketplace.
“We have had a series of ad hoc interventions; this is one more ad hoc intervention,” he told The Times. “I do think, because you can’t be sure this is the last one, the question of a broader more systemic action in which the government tries to help resolve these things is very important.”
In concept, the proposal would resemble the Resolution Trust Corporation, which disposed of bad assets held by hundreds of crippled savings institutions. Created in 1989, Resolution Trust closed or reorganized 747 institutions holding assets of nearly $400 billion. It did so by seizing the assets of troubled savings and loans and then reselling them to bargain-seeking investors.
By 1995, the S.& L. crisis abated and the agency was folded into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which Congress created during the Great Depression to regulate banks and protect the accounts of customers when they fail.
But the parallels to Resolution Trust are inexact. The federal government, unlike now, had no choice but to acquire the assets from savings associations because they were backed by federal deposit insurance. The mortgages now at the heart of Wall Street’s woes are not backed by federally insured deposits.
Moreover, the mission of the corporation was to dispose of the assets as quickly as possible for maximum value. Its goal was to reduce taxpayer exposure.
In the current crisis, the goal is more debatable. Should the government be helping homeowners, housing or financial markets, or large companies in trouble? Moreover, policy makers already have been seeking ways to reduce the impact of hard-to-sell assets on the books of companies by encouraging healthier institutions to acquire troubled ones.
The issue is whether Congress, after the election, should create a more formal and accountable mechanism, such as a federal agency, that would provide a relief valve for the troubled assets now causing havoc on Wall Street.
“The question is, and it’s just a question, is, ‘Are we at the point where the private market has made so many bad decisions and is so depressed that it can’t get out from under?’ ” Mr. Frank, who is planning to hold a hearing next week to explore whether Congress should create an agency to help the markets dispose of hard-to-sell assets, told The Times.
“The question we have to address is, ‘Is it the case that market psychology has so depressed assets that no entity has capacity to buy and hold these assets except for the government?’ ”
Mr. Frank said it would be more appropriate for a new agency, rather than the central bank, to be relieving the markets of the troubled assets.
“It is not appropriate for the Federal Reserve either in a financial sense or in a democratic sense to take on this role,” Mr. Frank told The Times .
But Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate banking committee, said at a news conference announcing hearings later this week on the crisis that he wondered whether such an agency was necessary if Treasury and the Fed were already performing such a function and had the authority to continue to do it.
“I’m not opposed to it,” he told The Times of Mr. Frank’s proposal. “I’m anxious to hear what the administration would have to say about this.”
Administration officials said they had no plans to make such a proposal, and that they would leave it to the next administration.
Mr. Frank emphasized that any legislation creating a new agency would have to be accompanied by “tough new regulations” to discourage companies from making more risky investments. He acknowledged that the decision about such an agency would be in the hands of the next Congress and the next president.
In recent days, aides to the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Barack Obama have said it would be premature to consider creating a new agency. But after the election, the political imperatives could significantly change, particularly if the housing markets remain depressed and Wall Street continues to choke on the billions of dollars in mortgage-backed assets.

311,2008-09-17 00:00:00,"Fearing a financial crisis worldwide, the Federal Reserve reversed course on Tuesday and agreed to an $85 billion bailout that would give the government control of the troubled insurance giant American International Group.
The decision, only two weeks after the Treasury took over the federally chartered mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is the most radical intervention in private business in the central bank’s history, The New York Times’s Edmund L. Andrews, Michael J. de la Merced and Mary Williams Walsh write.
With time running out after A.I.G. failed to get a bank loan to avoid bankruptcy, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., pictured above, and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, convened a meeting with House and Senate leaders on Capitol Hill about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday to explain the rescue plan. 
They emerged just after 7:30 p.m. with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke looking grim, but with top lawmakers initially expressing support for the plan. But the bailout is likely to prove controversial, because it effectively puts taxpayer money at risk while protecting bad investments made by A.I.G. and other institutions it does business with.
What frightened Fed and Treasury officials was not simply the prospect of another giant corporate bankruptcy, but A.I.G.’s role as an enormous provider of esoteric financial insurance contracts to investors who bought complex debt securities. They effectively required A.I.G. to cover losses suffered by the buyers in the event the securities defaulted. It meant A.I.G. was potentially on the hook for billions of dollars’ worth of risky securities that were once considered safe.
If A.I.G. had collapsed – and been unable to pay all of its insurance claims – institutional investors around the world would have been instantly forced to reappraise the value of those securities, and that in turn would have reduced their own capital and the value of their own debt. Small investors, including anyone who owned money market funds with A.I.G. securities, could have been hurt, too. And some insurance policy holders were worried, even though they have some protections.
“It would have been a chain reaction,” Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of economics at Princeton University, told The Times. “The spillover effects could have been incredible.”
Financial markets, which on Monday had plunged over worries about A.I.G.’s possible collapse and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, reacted with relief to the news of the bailout. In anticipation of a deal, stocks rose about 1 percent in the United States on Tuesday. Asian stock markets opened with strong gains on Wednesday morning, but the rally lost steam as worries returned about the extent of harm to the global financial system.
Still, the move will likely start an intense political debate during the presidential election campaign over who is to blame for the financial crisis that prompted the rescue.
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke had not requested any new legislative authority for the bailout at Tuesday night’s meeting. “The secretary and the chairman of the Fed, two Bush appointees, came down here and said, ‘We’re from the government, we’re here to help them,’ ” Mr. Frank told The Times. “I mean this is one more affirmation that the lack of regulation has caused serious problems. That the private market screwed itself up and they need the government to come help them unscrew it.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly criticized the rescue, calling the $85 billion a “staggering sum.” Ms. Pelosi said the bailout was “just too enormous for the American people to guarantee.” Her comments suggested that the Bush administration and the Fed would face sharp questioning in Congressional hearings. President Bush was briefed earlier in the afternoon.
A major concern is that the A.I.G. rescue won’t be the last. At Tuesday night’s meeting. lawmakers asked if there was any way of knowing if this would be the final major government intervention. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson said there was not. Indeed, the markets remain worried about the financial condition of major regional banks as well as that of Washington Mutual, the nation’s largest thrift.
The decision was a remarkable turnaround by the Bush administration and Mr. Paulson, who had flatly refused over the weekend to risk taxpayer money to prevent the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the distressed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America. Earlier this year, the government bailed out another investment bank, Bear Stearns, by engineering a sale to JPMorgan Chase that left taxpayers on the hook for up to $29 billion of bad investments by Bear Stearns. The government hoped at the time that this unusual step would both calm markets and lead to a recovery by the financial system. But critics warned at the time that it would only encourage others to seek bailouts, and the eventual costs to the government would be staggering.
The decision to rescue A.I.G. came on the same day that the Fed decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent, turning aside hopes by many on Wall Street that the Fed would try to shore up confidence by cutting rates once again.
Fed and Treasury officials initially turned a cold shoulder to A.I.G. when company executives pleaded on Sunday night for the Fed to provide a $40 billion bridge loan to stave off a crippling downgrade of its credit ratings as a result of investment losses that totalled tens of billions of dollars.
But government officials reluctantly backed away from their tough-minded approach after a failed attempt to line up private financing with help from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which told federal officials they simply could not raise the money given both the general turmoil in credit markets and the specific fears of problems with A.I.G. The complexity of A.I.G.’s business, and the fact that it does business with thousands of companies around the globe, make its survival crucial at a time when there is stress throughout the financial system worldwide.
“It’s the interconnectedness and the fear of the unknown,” Roger Altman, a former Treasury official under President Bill Clinton, told The Times. “The prospect of the world’s largest insurer failing, together with the interconnectedness and the uncertainty about the collateral damage – that’s why it’s scaring people so much.”
Under the plan, the Fed will make a two-year loan to A.I.G. of up to $85 billion and, in return, will receive warrants that can be converted into common stock giving the government nearly 80 percent ownership of the insurer, if the existing shareholders approve. All of the company’s assets are being pledged to secure the loan. Existing stockholders have already seen the value of their stock drop more than 90 percent in the last year. Now they will suffer even more, although they will not be totally wiped out. 
The Fed was advised by Morgan Stanley, and A.I.G. by the Blackstone Group.
Fed staffers said that they expected A.I.G. would repay the loan before it comes due in two years, either through the sales of assets or through operations.
Asked why Lehman was allowed to fail, but A.I.G. was not, a Fed staffer told The Times that the markets were more prepared for the failure of an investment bank. 
Robert B. Willumstad, who became A.I.G.’s chief executive in June, will be succeeded by Edward M. Liddy, the former chairman of the Allstate Corporation. Under the terms of his employment contract with A.I.G., Mr. Willumstad could receive an exit package worth as much as $8.7 million if his removal is determined to be “without cause,” according to an analysis by James F. Reda and Associates.

However, the committee believes that as those risks lift, as most analysts expect, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will provide support to an improving economic climate over time.In these circumstances, the committee believes that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals for the foreseeable future.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

313,2003-01-30 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged today, though it suggested that the biggest restraint on economic growth stemmed from uncertainties about a possible war with Iraq.In leaving the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the lowest level in 41 years, the Fed's monetary policy committee said the balance of risks had not changed significantly since its last meeting in December.''Oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical risks have reportedly fostered continued restraint on spending and hiring by business,'' the Fed said in a statement after today's meeting.Essentially reiterating what Fed officials have said since they last reduced interest rates, in November, the Federal Open Market Committee went on to say that the combination of easy monetary policy and improving productivity should help the economy recover once the ''geopolitical risks'' are lifted.

A close reading of the statement by the Fed suggested that its chairman, Alan Greenspan, remains unlikely to push for higher interest rates for several more months. As it has before, the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, reiterated its view that inflation remains low and that the economy still has a considerable amount of ""slack"" in the form of relatively high unemployment and large amounts of unused factory capacity.

The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that output is expanding briskly.Although new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labor market. Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.

317,2004-01-29 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday that it had withdrawn its promise to keep short-term interest rates low ''for a considerable period'' shocked both the stock and bond markets, with the three major stock indexes dropping more than 1.3 percent and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note shooting up sharply.With its announcement, Fed policy makers took away what had been a security blanket for investors: a promise to keep the benchmark interest rate low as the economy picked up steam. That pledge was made in August, when members of the Federal Open Market Committee added these words to a statement after their meeting: ''The committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''That promise was repeated as the economy grew, and it helped to keep longer-term rates low. As recently as last week, the 10-year Treasury yield was below 4 percent, more than half a percentage point lower than it was in September.After yesterday's bond sell-off, the yield was back up to 4.20 percent. This surge came even though the Fed left its benchmark rate, the federal funds rate, at 1 percent. But it is not yet clear to investors precisely what the policy makers now intend.

Although widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve Board's decision to cut its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 6 1/2 percent, was enthusiastically received in the credit markets yesterday. Treasury note and bond prices posted strong gains, and interest rates fell.For the past few weeks analysts had been saying that the Fed would have to lower the discount rate, if only because the overnight Federal funds rate, the market rate the Fed most directly controls, was being moved steadily down toward 7 percent. Generally the funds rate trades at a higher level than the discount rate.Indeed, in announcing the change the Fed said that one of the reasons for the cut was to realign the discount rate with other market rates.But traders and analysts said the Fed's admission that the cut was being made against a background of ""weakness in the economy, constraints on credit and slow growth in the monetary aggregates"" was the real reason the market reacted so positively to the move.

Acknowledging in effect that the American economy is in recession, the Federal Reserve sent a clear signal yesterday that reversing the decline -- rather than fighting inflation -- is now its top concern.The signal came in the form of a reduction in the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent. This is the rate the central bank charges for loans to commercial banks, but since banks rarely borrow from the Federal Reserve -- unless they are in trouble -- the discount rate has become largely a signpost for policy decisions.The signal this time was a strong one, coming as it did as the Fed's top policy makers concluded one of their periodic reviews of the economy. The Fed had taken a few tentative steps recently to push down rates and thus encourage consumers and business people to borrow money to spend and invest, stimulating the economy. But the action yesterday -- the first change in the discount rate in 22 months -- was seen as an unequivocal statement that policy has changed.  'The Debate Is Over'""The debate is over within the Federal Reserve,"" said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers. ""Their action is a clarion call that they want rates down and they want people to borrow and spend.""

The announcement at 3:25 P.M. listed ""weakness in the economy"" as the main reason for the discount rate cut. Further evidence of that weakness came yesterday morning as the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index had risen a mild three-tenths of 1 percent in November.

Consumer prices rose a modest three-tenths of 1 percent in November, less than half the torrid oil-driven pace set during the three months immediately after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Labor Department figures showed today.The slowdown reflected both moderation in energy prices, which benefited from diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis instead of threats of force, and a general weakness in the economy. That weakness has tended to put downward pressure on the prices of some items while preventing higher prices for energy.When food and energy are excluded, the Consumer Price Index rose by the same three-tenths of 1 percent as when these volatile items are included. The rise in so-called core inflation has now been three-tenths of 1 percent for three straight months.  Strange Behavior for HousingWhile the November increase was about as expected, many analysts had braced for an unpleasant surprise since the largest element of the price index, housing, has been behaving strangely of late and because last week's report on prices at the producer level was worse than expected.

The reassurance provided by the modest rise in the consumer index appeared to extend to the Federal Reserve, whose governors announced this afternoon a half-point cut, to 6 1/2 percent, in the discount rate, the rate charged financial institutions when they borrow at the central bank. This move came as the Fed's Open Market Committee concluded a meeting to establish the course of monetary policy until early February.

322,2000-06-29 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to leave short-term interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 6.5 percent.Recent data suggest that the expansion of aggregate demand may be moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce. Although core measures of prices are rising slightly faster than a year ago, continuing rapid advances in productivity have been containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.Nonetheless, signs that growth in demand is moving to a sustainable pace are still tentative and preliminary, and the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.In these circumstances, and against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

323,2000-06-29 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, giving itself more time to determine whether the series of rate increases it has imposed the last year are slowing the economy sufficiently to avoid an upturn in inflation.But the central bank warned that it could start raising rates again as soon as its next meeting, on Aug. 22. Analysts said the Fed would probably tighten policy in August unless economic indicators in coming weeks provided assurance that the red-hot pace of economic growth earlier this year had given way to a more sustainable path that reduces the threat of an inflationary spiral in wages and prices.The Federal Reserve's decision had been widely expected by economists and investors, and Wall Street took the news largely in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 100 points but fell back after the Fed announcement to close at 10,527.79, up 23.33, for the day. The Nasdaq composite index rose 81.38, to 3,940.34.In calling a time out today in its campaign of rate increases -- six over the last year, pushing its benchmark federal funds target rate up 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent -- the Fed acknowledged that there had been some evidence that the economy was cooling off. And the central bank noted that while inflation by some measures had been accelerating, price pressures were being held down by continuing improvements in productivity, a measure of the economy's ability to produce more for less.

But the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee suggested that it remained unconvinced that the economic slowdown was real. And it stressed its continuing concern that the current low rate of unemployment -- 4.1 percent in May -- could lead wages to rise so fast that companies would be forced to raise their prices.

The evidence accumulated over the inter-meeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions have improved. Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

325,2004-07-01 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time in four years, officially signaling that a remarkable period of historically low rates is drawing to a close.But even as it increased the cost of borrowing for financial institutions on overnight loans to 1.25 percent from 1 percent, it sought to soothe investors by saying that inflationary pressures remained low and that further rate increases should come at a ''measured'' pace.The Fed's statement was a relief for many on Wall Street, as well as for home buyers, who will be able to get mortgages at comparatively low rates for at least a few more months.It also appears to be good news for President Bush. Even though the Fed is expected to keep increasing interest rates as the November elections approach, the economic impact of those increases is likely to be mild until at least sometime next year.

But some of the Fed's growing chorus of critics on Wall Street warned that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, might have waited too long to start raising rates. That could force the central bank to play catch-up in tightening monetary policy in the months ahead to prevent inflation from re-emerging as a serious economic threat.

326,2007-12-12 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday after the Fed’s monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4.25 percent.Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. Today’s action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Eric S. Rosengren, who preferred to lower the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this meeting.In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 4.75 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Louis.

The night before, his commercial flight suffered a long Chicago  holdover on the way from Boston, but he had reason to hope that his  days at the mercy of the airlines might be numbered. A Des Moines Register  opinion poll had just shown Huckabee passing Mitt Romney to take  the lead in the run-up to the Jan. 3 caucus. His picture, he already knew,  was on the front page of that morning’s USA Today. Now he was headed  to  Central College, to appear, surrounded by enthusiastic students, on ‘‘The  Early Show’’ on CBS . This kind of momentum, he hoped, would finally  produce enough cash to allow him to charter his own plane.The governor was especially happy that morning about an impending  endorsement he expected (and received the following day) from Tim  LaHaye, the author of the apocalyptic ‘‘Left Behind’’ series  of novels.‘‘Left Behind’’ is wildly popular among evangelicals,  who have bought  more than 65 million copies, making LaHaye a very rich man and one of  the few writers who is also a major philanthropist. Recently he donated a  hockey rink to Jerry Falwell’s Liberty University, although some members  of the faculty there deride ‘‘Left Behind’’ as science  fiction. Huckabee, an  ordained Southern Baptist minister, has no such reservations. He considers  the ‘‘Left Behind’’ books, in which the world comes  to a violent end as Jesus  triumphs over Satan, a ‘‘compelling story written for nontheologians.’’Huckabee’s affability and populist economic and social views have sometimes  been misinterpreted as a moderate brand of evangelical Christianity. In  fact, as he wrote in his book ‘‘Character Makes a Difference,’’ he  considers liberalism  to be a cancer on Christianity. Huckabee is an admirer of the late Jerry  Falwell (whose son, Jerry Jr., recently endorsed his candidacy) and subscribes  wholeheartedly to the principles of the Moral Majority. He also affirms the  Baptist Faith and Message statement: ‘‘The Holy Bible . . . has  truth, without  any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true  and  trustworthy.’’

On the road to Pella, Huckabee talked about the enthusiasm he now  encounters everywhere he goes.

It was, I thought, a dangerous anecdote to tell within earshot  of a professional driver traveling along an icy highway at high speed, but  Huckabee was feeling invulnerable, and the driver, I later realized, was already  on the governor’s team. Huckabee normally starts his mornings by running  6 to 10 miles and reading a chapter from the Book of Proverbs. Today he was  too pressed to do either, but he planned to catch up later. Anyway, he knew  much of the day’s assignment, Chapter 3, by heart. ‘‘Trust  in the Lord,’’ he  quoted, ‘‘and lean not upon thine own understanding.’’ Not  a bad motto for  a campaign that is still too broke to do any independent polling.

330,2005-07-01 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a revised statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 31/4 percent.The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Edward M. Gramlich; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 41/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds posted modest gains in very quiet, trendless trading yesterday, recapturing most of the losses sustained during Monday's session.Traders sold securities early in the day after the release of a Commerce Department report showing that, while economic growth in the second quarter was somewhat slower than previously thought, the rate of inflation was somewhat faster.However, the losses only amounted to as much as one-quarter of a point on long-term bonds. And they were recouped later on weakness in gold and oil prices. Reserves Added by FedSomewhat surprisingly, the day's major event in the credit markets had little or no impact on prices. For the second consecutive day, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system, a move that surprised traders and led some to wonder if the central bank might be sending signals that it intended to ease monetary policy.

Prices climbed at a faster clip than previously thought during the second quarter, pushing the inflation rate further above the expectations of the Federal Reserve and Administration policymakers, Commerce Department figures showed today.None of the new figures, however, made much of an impression on economists or financial markets, and the Reagan Administration insisted there was still no reason to believe inflation was headed for worrisome levels.Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, ''The facts, plus the moderating growth rate, point to inflation remaining under control.''The Commerce Department said that prices rose at a 5 percent rate from April through June, as measured by the fixed-weighted index tied to the gross national product, compared with the 4.7 percent rate estimated for the period in both July and August. This compared with a 3.5 percent inflation rate during the first three months of the year.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds slumped yesterday, sending the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond to a 10-week high of 8.24 percent.Trading was sluggish, as market participants struggled with an offering of $9.5 billion worth of new two-year Treasury notes, the latest in an avalanche of new Treasury issues.Late in the day, the Treasury said the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.37 percent, sharply higher than the average 7.75 percent yield at the last two-year auction on July 26. The price surge came despite early optimism among traders that the auction had gone well. ''We saw pockets of reasonable interest,'' one government securities trader said. ''This is the first Treasury auction in a month that has been fairly priced.''Even so, the slide continued after the auction results were released, and by late in the day the two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.41 percent.

Orders to American factories for durable goods tumbled 1.9 percent in July to the lowest level in nine months, the Government said today. The report provides further evidence that the economy is weakening.The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, a wide range of consumer and commercial items expected to last three years or more, totaled a seasonally adjusted $122.9 billion last month, the lowest level since October 1988.It was the fourth drop this year in the sector, which is considered a bellwether of the economy's performance.In June, orders rose 1.4 percent, faster than expected, following a 4.5 percent plunge in May, the steepest drop in 10 months. Orders rose in April and March and fell in February and January.

The bond market rose modestly yesterday, wiping out most of Monday's losses on the 30-year bond and moving higher in other maturities. But traders and analysts are still worried about some sudden surprise from the Republican National Convention and expect the market to be volatile for the rest of the week.The day's economic data continued to paint a picture of an economy growing slowly, which is one of the main reasons prices of notes and bonds have advanced recently.The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 2.8 percent in July, which surprised many analysts inasmuch as home mortgage rates are close to 20-year lows. The consensus forecast was for an increase of 1.7 percent.The one possibly positive note in the housing report was that permits for new structures were up 3.7 percent last month. But a lot of those new permits were for multifamily housing, not single-family dwellings, which would give a stronger lift to the economy. Permits for single-family homes have remained basically unchanged since April. Slower Sales Seen

Earlier this year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned that 200 banks with combined assets of more than $80 billion would fail this year. After seven months, however, only 70 banks with $20.9 billion of assets have failed, far below the rate the F.D.I.C. forecast.But even as banking experts debate how much the slowdown stems from election-year politics and how much from the palliative effects of the lower interest rates that make even the weakest banks more profitable, the F.D.I.C. is warning that tougher new regulations that will take effect on Dec. 19 will result in a flurry of bank closings.After Dec. 19, regulators must either start closing banks whose shareholder capital drops below 2 percent of assets, or provide good reasons why they are letting them stay open. A good reason, F.D.I.C. officials say, would be a viable plan for a quick merger or infusion of fresh capital.Under current law, state and Federal regulators do not usually close banks unless they are insolvent, meaning that the value of the bank's assets, like loans and securities, is not equal to the combined total of its capital and what it owes depositors.

Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain.In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the committee believes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals.The committee decided to include in its announcements following its meetings the roll call of the vote on the federal funds rate target, including the preferred policy choice of any dissenters. This action accelerates the release of this information, currently available in the minutes with a lag.To conform to this new practice, the board of governors also decided to report in the written announcement the roll call of any vote on the discount rate, also including the preferred policy choice of any dissenters.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

But the Fed laid the groundwork to begin reversing some of the 11 rate cuts it carried out last year as the economy sank into recession.The central bank also took a step to respond to criticism that its deliberations remain too shrouded in secrecy. It said that from now on it would immediately disclose how individual members voted on interest rate decisions. The Fed now waits to disclose the votes of individual members until after the subsequent meeting, when it releases minutes of its deliberations.At today's meeting, the Fed said, all 10 members of the open-market committee supported the decision to leave rates unchanged.

340,2002-03-20 00:00:00,"Let the guessing games begin. Investment gurus around the world are turning their prodigious energies to fathoming the future direction of the financial markets in a world of rising interest rates.Not a soul expected the Federal Reserve, which met Tuesday, to lift U.S. rates immediately. The American recovery is not yet trundling ahead with enough momentum to warrant the cooling effects of a rate increase. But market players had generally expected that the Fed would shift its bias to neutral from negative, signaling that it will lift rates in coming months.And the Fed is not alone. As Nomura International put it: ""Other central banks are getting twitchy. Increasingly hawkish noises are being heard in different corners of the world: Canada, Sweden and Australasia."" Sweden and New Zealand raised their benchmark rates this week.Reading the mind of the Fed is tricky at best — and especially so at this early stage of the U.S. economy's slow crawl out of recession. Analysts at Societe Generale recently forecast that the improving American economy will put pressure on the Fed to reverse course on interest rates and start raising them sooner rather than later.

However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.Nonetheless, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate target at this meeting.

Conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months. Household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Dennis P. Lockhart; Daniel K. Tarullo; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen.

343,2009-06-25 00:00:00,"President Obama hailed a pledge by the pharmaceutical industry to contribute $80 billion in drug discounts and other savings over the next 10 years as “a significant breakthrough on the road to health care reform.” The pledge should help large numbers of older Americans struggling to pay high drug bills. But before anyone gets too ecstatic, we will need a lot more details about what industry is giving up and what it is getting.The deal was negotiated in private among the industry, Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee and a crucial figure in shaping health reform, and the White House. From the broad outlines described by the White House, it looks as if $30 billion would be used to cut in half the price of brand-name drugs sold to Medicare patients who have reached a gap in coverage known as the doughnut hole.That could be a great help for elderly Americans of modest means who, after reaching the gap, stop taking their medicines rather than pay the full cost themselves. And it could reduce the need for the federal government to close the hole entirely on its own. The move has been justifiably praised by  AARP and the Medicare Rights Center, both advocates for beneficiaries.The other $50 billion pledged is meant to save the government money that could be applied to covering the uninsured. There appear to be three main elements: a big increase in the discounts drug companies are required to give to Medicaid programs for the poor; a new fee imposed upon the companies; and a new regulatory pathway to foster the development of generics to compete with brand-name biological drugs.

Eager to have a strong voice in the health care debate — and head off more draconian demands — six major health care industries have promised to help reduce the growth in spending. So far the pharmaceutical industry is the only one to  come up with specific requirements that it is willing to meet.

The Congress and the public should see these proposals as an opening bid and not the final word.They will still provide less savings to the federal budget than the administration had been seeking. And viewed against the backdrop of the $1 trillion or more needed to finance health care reform over the next decade, these cost reductions seem small. The $80 billion is also a fraction of the nation’s overall drug spending, which federal estimates suggest will total $3.3 trillion over the next decade.

344,2003-10-29 00:00:00,"The statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday is nearly identical to its statements after monetary policy meetings in September and August. The only difference is its description of the labor market, which was ''weakening'' in September and appeared ''mixed'' in August, but now ''appears to be stabilizing.'' Following is the text of yesterday's statement:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, and the labor market appears to be stabilizing. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

345,2003-10-29 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates at 1 percent on Tuesday, the lowest level in 45 years, and suggested that it would continue to do so until at least sometime next year.In a statement accompanying the decision, the Fed was optimistic for the first time this year about job creation and employment, saying, ''The labor market appears to be stabilizing.''But the Fed did not mention that economic growth appears to have accelerated to a blistering annual pace of 6 percent in recent months, or refer to a raft of data showing that business spending and investor confidence has climbed sharply.Instead, it reiterated its view of the last several months that there is more risk that inflation will be too low rather than too high, and it repeated its intention to continue its policy of rock-bottom interest rates for ''a considerable period.''

346,2002-12-11 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted to leave the benchmark rate unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 1/4 percent. The committee continues to believe that this accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity.The limited number of incoming economic indicators since the November meeting, taken together, are not inconsistent with the economy working its way through its current soft spot.In these circumstances, the committee believes that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals for the foreseeable future.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

347,2002-12-11 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged today, leaving its main short-term rate at its lowest level in 41 years as policy makers wait for more signs of economic strength.In a statement after today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, the Fed repeated its view that the economy was working through a ''soft spot'' and that existing monetary policy was loose enough at the moment.Last month, the Federal Reserve made an aggressive move by reducing the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by half a percentage point, to just 1.25 percent. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has called the move an ''insurance premium'' in case the economy proves to be weaker than expected.Given the big rate cut last month and the continued signs of economic weakness, the decision today to stand pat came as no surprise. But analysts said the absence of new guidance from the Fed reinforced their view that rates would be kept down for at least the next several months.

348,2002-12-11 00:00:00,"Jay A. Pritzker, the aging scion of Chicago's wealthiest and leading philanthropic family, called a meeting in June 1995 to hand 11 members of the next generation an important memorandum, outlining the Pritzker principle that family money should be shared among them and appointing a triumvirate to replace him at the empire's helm.But after Mr. Pritzker's death in 1999 and a nasty squabble between the triumvirate and the other cousins, that blueprint was torn up last year and replaced by a secret plan to carve up the $15 billion empire over the next decade, most likely taking public key assets like the Hyatt hotel chain, and handing each of the 11 a $1.4 billion purse.Now, a cousin who was left out of that pact, Liesel Pritzker, an 18-year-old movie actress and freshman at Columbia University, has sued the family, bringing unwanted attention to the underlying dispute and threatening the agreement. In her lawsuit, Liesel, who is a member of the family's fourth generation, contends that her trust funds were emptied to benefit the other members of that generation, who are decades older. It contends they are treating her and her 20-year-old brother, Matthew, like members of the fifth generation who are closer to their ages.''The Pritzker family will no longer be the major factor it was,'' said Leon Danco, chairman of the Center for Family Business, a Cleveland consulting firm that advises family businesses on management and governance. ''The dissolution of the family is an attribute of human nature. The Pritzkers were a powerful family. Jay Pritzker died and the money is diffused and it creates new factions and new allegiances.''

WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 — Senate Republicans formally put aside a broad immigration overhaul sought by President Bush  on Wednesday and decided instead to press ahead with narrower bills to require building 700 miles of fence on the southwestern border.Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said the fate of millions of illegal immigrants already in the United States had become a “fundamental sticking point” in trying to reach agreement with the House on a broad bill.Mr. Frist said the fence proposal, which the House has passed, was the best alternative if lawmakers wanted to salvage some immigration changes before the Nov. 7 elections.“Let’s focus on a problem the American people understand,’’ the senator said, “and that is, we have hundreds of thousands of people coming across our border every year into our country.”

353,1998-05-20 00:00:00,"Treasury prices ended slightly lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, left interest rates unchanged.The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 102 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to 5.93 percent, from 5.92 percent on Monday. There was little reaction to the Fed's announcement at 2:15 P.M.Until last month, many bond market participants were confident that the central bank would not move to raise short-term interest rates anytime soon. But that changed, and there is now some anxiety looking ahead to the the next meeting of Fed policy makers, the Federal Open Market Committee, in July.''With signs of a slowing economy increasing, inflation still calm, the dollar still strong and Asia still in turmoil, the Fed decided to wait until its next powwow to see if an economic slackening actually materializes and thus provides the rationale to continue to adhere to a 5.5 percent Federal funds rate,'' said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.

However, he said, ''in the absence of a significant moderation in business activity, many on the F.O.M.C. will want to be pre-emptive and tighten at the July 1 meeting because of fears that the extremely low rate of unemployment will exacerbate already budding wage pressures and lead directly to increasing inflationary tendencies in the overall economy.''

Mr. Fine also said economic statistics over the next six weeks would be crucial to the Fed and would therefore come under intense scrutiny by bond investors.The Government released its April housing starts report yesterday and reaffirmed what the market already knows, that the housing industry remained strong.

354,1998-05-20 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve declined once again today to increase short-term interest rates, apparently determining that the threat of inflation remained remote and that the latest phase of the worsening Asian economic crisis might be exacerbated by any rate rise now in the United States.Several weeks ago, there were hints that the Federal Reserve might be leaning toward increasing interest rates sometime soon. But a number of recent indicators, including continued low inflation and the announcement this morning of a modest decline in the starts of new housing, have lessened immediate fears of an overheating of the economy, market analysts said.The decision to leave rates unchanged, at least for now, was hardly a surprise on Wall Street, where many leading economists had predicted that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which meets regularly to review interest-rate policy, would again sit on its hands. The markets yawned in response: The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 3.74 points, at 9,054.65, after having risen 62 points earlier in the day.While no one knows for sure what motivated the Federal Reserve's decision, its policy makers had reason to worry that an increase now would only worsen problems in Asia. In recent weeks, there have been signs of renewed economic trouble in Thailand and South Korea, and the images of Jakarta in flames last week rekindled fear of a contagion effect that would discourage further investment in Asia.

Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly index of manufacturing activity in the Chicago region, seen as a bellwether for the economy, unexpectedly rose to 59.5 points in March from 57.8 in February.Taken together, the numbers indicate that the economy remains on a roll, analysts said.''These numbers are still remarkable,'' said Kathleen Stephansen, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities.

In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate, to 2 percent.The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. Recent signs point to a firming in spending, markedly improved financial conditions, and labor and product markets that are stabilizing. The economy, nonetheless, has yet to exhibit sustainable growth. With inflationary expectations subdued, the committee judged that a slightly more expansive monetary policy would add further support for an economy which it expects to improve over time.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. On balance, the committee believes that the latter concern is likely to predominate for the foreseeable future.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.Voting against the action was Robert T. Parry. President Parry preferred a 50 basis point reduction in the target for the federal funds rate.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco.

The full Senate has not approved the accord, but after days of dispute, it appeared to remove one of the last obstacles to approval of the bill.''We will now have clear sailing to final passage,'' said Senator Max Baucus of Montana, principal Democratic sponsor of the bill.

The economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months.However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.In these circumstances, the committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S.

363,2002-05-08 00:00:00,"With new data suggesting that inflation will remain under control, the Federal Reserve voted unanimously today to hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged, saying the durability of the economic recovery remained uncertain.On a day when the Labor Department reported a bigger-than-expected surge in the growth rate of productivity, the central bank reiterated that it was not in any rush to raise interest rates, despite a sharp upturn in economic growth in the first quarter. The productivity gain is evidence that companies may be able to restore their depressed profit margins without having to jack up prices.The decision left the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at a 40-year low, 1.75 percent, where it has been for nearly five months. Economists said the Fed would probably not seriously consider raising rates until August, especially if the unemployment rate continued to rise, as it has in recent months.On Wall Street, stock prices were little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.51, to 9,836.55. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,573.82, down 4.66.

Growth in the current quarter appears robust. Fears of a credit squeeze in the bond market have abated. And while manufacturers and farmers still suffer from exports lost as a result of the financial turmoil of the last year and a half, the latest trade figures suggested that the worst may be past, even for them.

Prices of Treasury bonds and notes fell by as much as a point in fairly light trading yesterday, as market participants reacted negatively to the implications of a report showing a big drop in the nation's merchandise trade deficit in March.The sharp $4.08 billion decline in the March deficit from February's $13.8 billion shortfall was far above market expectations, and in the minutes after the 8:30 A.M. release of the figures, bond prices rallied by more than a point.But once analysts had a chance to study the numbers, the early enthusiasm gave way to sober reassessment and a sharp selloff.Closer examination of the data showed that very rapid export growth was the primary reason behind the improvement. Moreover, imports, which economists would like to see decline, rose again in March, although at a far slower rate than exports expanded.

The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement over recent months. Household spending appears to be expanding at a moderate rate, though it remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit.Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace, and remain reluctant to add to payrolls; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth.Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will contribute to a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.

To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

367,2009-12-17 00:00:00,"A federal judge who will decide whether the name Tavern on the Green belongs to New York City or the restaurant’s current operators rained a barrage of  Socratic questions on a succession of trademark lawyers  who  popped up in the legal equivalent of Whack-A-Mole on Wednesday. 
Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of the Southern District of Manhattan reserved judgment on the name, which was bestowed on the property by the city in 1934 and trademarked in 1981 by its operator at the time, Warner LeRoy, whose family has lost the right to run the restaurant and has placed it in bankruptcy proceedings. But Judge Cedarbaum seemed to give equal measures of agita and hope to each side. 
While offering little indication of which side she favored, the judge gave every evidence that she would treat the case as a complex intellectual-property dispute that could be breaking new legal ground. “This is a very interesting case,” she said at one point, assuming a half-smile.
The ownership issue has been a flash point in Tavern’s bankruptcy case since the name — which has been appraised at $19 million — is potentially the restaurant’s most valuable asset.
Lawyers on both sides were circumspect after the hearing. The case “raises a lot of issues of concern to the court,” said Gerald E. Singleton, senior intellectual property lawyer for the New York City Law Department, “and this is far from a slam dunk for either side.”
Norman N. Kinel, lawyer for the committee of Tavern’s 452 unsecured creditors, who are owed $8 million, said that “from her spirited questioning, it is very clear that the judge is familiar with the arguments, and is giving the matter appropriate consideration.”
Other lawyers — there were 10 before the court and eight more attorneys and their assistants looking on — declined to comment. 
There was quiet drama in the incisive questions that enlivened the long play of argument centering on a legendary Manhattan building that began in 1872 as a sheepfold for a herd that chomped the grass in the adjoining field, now known as the Sheep Meadow.   
And both the city and the Tavern operators seemed to bear the brunt of the judge’s acute legal scrutiny. 
To the city, the judge stated flatly: “We have an incontestable trademark that you want to overcome as a matter of law.” She added: “Selecting a name doesn’t give you a trademark.” And of the incontestability, she said: “It is a heavy burden.” 
But to Tavern’s lawyers, Judge Cedarbaum commented about Mr. LeRoy’s use of the Tavern on the Green title that “he was given the name,” adding that “the city had always owned a building in Central Park that was called Tavern on the Green.”
When Mr. LeRoy submitted the trademark application in the 1970s the judge noted that he “didn’t disclose there had been a restaurant known as Tavern on the Green in the same place in Central Park for many years before.” Of making the sheepfold a restaurant, she said, “nobody questions that was the city’s idea.” 
The judge sent lawyers for both sides scurrying back to their offices to do homework, asking for more relevant prior cases that would shed light on the trademarking of a restaurant name describing a physical location, that is also a business providing services.  
The case has been bubbling in two separate federal courts. Only two weeks ago, on Dec. 1, Judge Cedarbaum ruled that she — and not a judge in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan — would decide the ownership issue. Under the federal judicial bureaucracy, bankruptcy court is subordinate when the district court asserts its jurisdiction. 
“Trademark law is something that this court regularly examines,” Judge Cedarbaum said earlier this month, referring to intellectual property disputes that frequently wind up in the Southern District. 
At his death in 2001 at the age of 65, Mr. LeRoy named his daughter Jennifer Oz LeRoy chief executive of Tavern; the family holds the license to the restaurant under the name Tavern on the Green Limited Partnership. The LeRoys and their managers have said the trademarked name would have value in other locations, and they already market a line of Tavern on the Green salad dressings and gift items.
In two weeks the LeRoys must surrender their jurisdiction over Tavern to a new operator. Dean J. Poll, who runs the Boathouse restaurant in Central Park, was awarded the city’s new 20-year license to run Tavern starting Jan. 1, but he hasn’t signed a contract with Tavern’s landlord, the Parks Department. And he has yet to come to an agreement with the Hotel Trades Council, which represents some 400 Tavern employees.
Mr. Poll’s lawyer, Barry B. LePatner, has said of the name, “the only prospective purchaser is Dean Poll — and he is not paying very much for it.”
In its most recent court papers the city argued that the Tavern name is specific to the Central Park location and “associated in the minds of consumers with a specific place.”
But in its latest legal filings before Judge Cedarbaum, Tavern’s official committee of unsecured creditors  termed the restaurant under pre-LeRoy ownership “Tavern-in-the-Red,” describing it as a “dingy little money-losing rustic pub” before the LeRoys made an “investment of many millions of dollars and a complete gut and rebuild,” transforming it to “a world-class, opulent restaurant.” 
Furthermore, the name Tavern on the Green “now stands for the excellent creation of Warner LeRoy,” David H. T. Kane, a trademark lawyer for Tavern, explained to the judge on Wednesday. Both sides agree that under the family’s tenure, it became one of the country’s most lucrative restaurants. 
But at the Wednesday hearing, the city also introduced last-minute evidence — from, yes, 1956 — in the form of press releases and questions and answers authored by Robert Moses, the city parks commissioner then, who originally oversaw the naming of the sheepfold as a restaurant called Tavern on the Green in 1934.
Mr. Moses was quoted as saying that Tavern “is patronized by hundreds of thousands every year,” adding that “in recent years the use of the Tavern on the Green in Central Park has increased so greatly that enlargement of the building” was necessary. 
Tavern’s lawyers challenged the admission of the materials, which were nevertheless discussed at length. The city’s lawyer, Mr. Singleton, was expected to use the documents as an indication that Tavern was a popular attraction long before Mr. LeRoy reinvented it in 1976, in an effort to undermine claims that Mr. LeRoy’s association amounted to value added for the restaurant. 
Potentially, the trademark could be a lucrative bankruptcy asset. Last year Gabe Fried, chief executive of another brand advisory firm hired by Tavern, Streambank LLC, said his company sold the trademark and brand of the bankrupt Circuit City electronics chain for $17.5 million, Mr. Fried said, and sold the trademark and logo of the bankrupt KB Toys chain for $2.1 million at auction. 
The Tavern on the Green name was appraised at $19 million by Marshall & Stevens, a valuation firm. But Mr. Fried said last week that “it is too early to speculate on the value” of the Tavern trademark.
Since the LeRoy family would lose the license to operate the restaurant in the new year, “the infrastructure that helped support the value of the name would not be there any more,” Mr. Fried said. Therefore, the name’s “liquidation value will be lower than the fair market value,” probably less than $19 million.
To Mr. Fried, “The bottom line is that it is hard to think of a restaurant name that has as broad national and international recognition as Tavern on the Green,” he said. 
To hedge its bets against a courtroom defeat, the city has already registered a substitute name with New York State: Tavern in the Park.
In court the LeRoys have submitted proof of the legality of the original trademark certificate of ownership, and proof that the family has successfully defended the trademark through the years; they have argued, too, that the city never challenged that trademark — even when it renewed the LeRoys’ operating license in 1985.
Furthermore, the LeRoys opened a fine-dining restaurant in Wellington, Fla., invoking the Tavern on the Green name in 2006. Though at the time the parks department sent a letter to the LeRoys requesting that the trademark be turned over to the city, the LeRoys claimed ownership and operated the restaurant until 2009 without further city objection. 
“After being silent and claiming absolutely no ownership interest in the Tavern Mark for virtually the entirety of three decades, the city now has mounted a full-court media and legal press centered on a baseless claim of trademark ownership,” the creditors have charged in court papers.
In its own court papers the city has termed the LeRoys “merely custodians and caretakers of the name,” adding that nothing in the license agreement “authorizes them to walk away with the name at the end of the license term.” 
Furthermore, the city has derided the notion, in the creditors’ arguments, that “some city employee actually had to don an apron and personally supervise food preparation at Tavern on the Green in order for the city to establish and claim trademark rights,” the city’s latest filings assert. 
The city has also excoriated the LeRoys for a “failure to produce” the early 1970s agreement whereby Warner LeRoy purchased the Tavern assets of Restaurant Associates, the previous operator, asking if the predecessor claimed to own — and sell – “the Tavern name to LeRoy?”
After an hour and a half of closely parsed disputation and pointed cut-and-thrust, Judge Cedarbaum asked for more information from the parties, saying, “I will do my best to expedite the matter.” Her decision is not expected before the end of the year.

The rally in the Government bond market continued yesterday, as traders pushed up prices of some Treasury securities as much as a point and long-term interest rates fell to their lowest levels since the Persian Gulf crisis began.The catalyst behind yesterday's move was a Federal Reserve report that industrial output had dropped eight-tenths of a percent in October, the first decline since April.The drop in the industrial production index was slightly more than had been expected, but economists and bond dealers said the depth of the decline was not as significant as its breadth.

Yesterday was a choppy one on Wall Street with stock prices dropping slightly. Trading was brisk and oil prices edged $1.25 a barrel higher, to $33.12. Program trading was heavy and small stocks picked up a bit.Nervous investors cashed in their chips after the Federal Reserve, which was widely expected to trim interest rates as soon as yesterday or today took no immediate action.By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue- chip stocks gave up 4.95 points to close at 2,535.40. The American Stock Exchange's market value index and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks edged ahead.Some analysts expect an upturn in the broad market before many days, largely because the Fed's widely heralded rate cut is still believed to be on the way -- particularly because of growing concern that the economy is faltering badly.

The output of American factories, mines and utilities dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent in October, prompting many analysts to declare that the economy as a whole has now conclusively slipped into recession.The decline, the first since April and the largest since January, was exceptionally widespread. And it intensified the belief that the Federal Reserve would move soon to cut interest rates again to arrest what could become a rapid economic contraction.""The steep decline in industrial production in October demonstrates that the economy is now entering the free fall stage,"" said Gordon Richards of the National Association of Manufacturers. ""The evidence of recession is now unambiguous.""

EARLIER this month, at a conference in Tokyo, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Manuel H. Johnson, said he was ''not uncomfortable with the current level of exchange rates.'' Hidden in that off-the-cuff comment may be a growing rift between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department over the dollar.Although Mr. Johnson's remarks seemed entirely consistent with those he had uttered in the past, this time the foreign exchange markets reacted by sending the dollar to three-year highs against the yen. Since then, the dollar has climbed even higher, although other factors, like the drop in the Tokyo stock market, have also had an effect.The most elementary reading of Mr. Johnson's remarks was that the Federal Reserve was content to hold interest rates firm and would refrain from intervening in the foreign exchange markets. But given the uncertainty in Japan's stock market, a non-interventionist policy would almost certainly drive the dollar higher against the yen, something the Treasury, which is concerned about exports, almost certainly does not want.Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, found Mr. Johnson's comments so important that ''I devoted two issues of my newsletter to them.'' Normally, the Fed does not take a position on the value of the dollar. ''It does what it is told by the Treasury,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''But this remark signals a potential shift in the way the Fed sees itself.''

Prices of Treasury securities dipped slightly in very slow trading yesterday, as dealers placed bids on $10 billion worth of new two-year notes - the only real activity of the day.''We thought the two-year would spark some interest, but even though the auction went well, it wasn't enough,'' said Joe Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc. ''We believe there is a lot of money on the sidelines, but at this juncture there is no reason for that money to come in.''At the auction, the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.59 percent, up from the 8.50 percent average yield at the last two-year note sale on Feb. 21, and the highest yield on a two-year note since the auction last May 24.As expected, the attractive yields generated strong demand from investors.Non-competitive bids for the notes, a good barometer of retail demand, amounted to $1.56 billion for the new notes. It was the largest non-competitive bid since the two-year auction held on April 26. $8 Billion Sale Today Today the Treasury is expected to sell $8 billion worth of new four-year notes.

375,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn. Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and activity in the housing sector has increased. Household spending seems to be stabilizing, but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to   1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets, and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt. The committee will gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipates that they will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of $300 billion of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October 2009. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S.

376,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"Wall Street got an initial lift on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve’s assessment that an economic recovery was under way, but the glow faded fast, dragging stocks to their second day of losses this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average briefly crossed 9,900 points after the Fed released its statement at 2:15 p.m., but then a spree of selling pulled the market into the red, The New York Times’s Jack Healy reported. Financial firms led the way lower, and oil producers and industrial stocks slid as commodity prices dipped.
While investors found few surprises in the Fed’s words, the statement still offered some support for the prevailing economic outlook.
“The Fed statement didn’t really change anything,” Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Globa, told The Timesl. “They went out of their way not to rock the boat.”
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.32 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 9,748.55. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 10.79 points, or 1 percent, to end at 1,060.87, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 14.88 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,131.42.
With no striking revelations from the Fed, investors homed in on nagging questions about whether stocks had become too expensive. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500, a broad measure of how stocks are priced compared with corporate profits, rose to its highest point in a year this week, according to Bloomberg News data.
In a regular Wall Street ritual, investors and analysts scoured a statement from the Fed as its Open Market Committee concluded a two-day meeting, seeking the central bank’s views on the prospects for inflation, interest rates and other aspects of the economy.
“Economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn,” the Fed wrote in its statement. “Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and activity in the housing sector has increased.”
As expected, the Fed left its key short-term interest rate untouched at a record low of close to zero, and it announced it would extend its program to buy more than $1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities to March 31.
Investors do not expect the Fed to lift its overnight federal funds rate until next year, given the huge challenges facing the economy as it tries to climb out of a deep recession. Unemployment is heading toward 10 percent, factories are still running at well under full capacity and credit markets are still fragile.
The prices of inflation-resistant investments fell on Wednesday as the Fed said that rapidly rising prices were not a threat, predicting that inflation would remain “subdued” for a while. Crude oil fell $2.79 a barrel, to $68.97, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and gold and copper prices also slipped.
But investors grabbed up Treasury notes after the Fed released its statement, heartened by expectations of low inflation.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had been higher for much of the day after an auction of five-year notes drew lackluster response, but yields dropped after the Fed’s announcement as investors speculated that lengthening out the mortgage-purchase program would help to keep interest rates low.
“The mortgage market is such a huge driver of rates,” George Goncalves, head of fixed-income strategy at Cantor Fitzgerald, told The Times. “You have another large investor that hasn’t gone away.”
But Fed officials said the economy was continuing to improve, albeit slowly, leaving open the question of how and when the bank would begin to withdraw its emergency financing programs.
The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.
The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 7/32 , to 101 23/32. The yield fell to 3.42 percent, from 3.44 percent on Tuesday.

The Government's chief gauge for predicting the economy fell one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the third decline in the latest five months, the Commerce Department said today.Although most economists had been expecting a small rise in the index of leading indicators, they focused today mainly on the sawtooth pattern that has developed in the index since late spring. That, they said, along with other figures, was evidence that the economy has clearly begun to slow.''Some of the momentum has been left behind,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities Company International, a Wall Street firm. ''I think the index is forecasting some further sluggishness.'' Growth Rate of 2.2 PercentLast week the department said the economy had expanded at a rate of 2.2 percent in the third quarter, somewhat below the average growth of the gross national product for the first half of the year even after allowing for a substantial loss of output from this summer's drought.

385,1997-03-26 00:00:00,"Treasury prices turned lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve fulfilled investors' expectations and raised short-term interest rates.The central bank's monetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, raised its target on the Federal funds rate to 5.50 percent, from 5.25 percent. The rate, the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, has not been adjusted since January 1996, when the Fed cut it a quarter-point amid concern that the economy was headed for a recession. The committee did not, however, adjust the discount rate, which is the rate the Fed charges its member banks for overnight loans.While the rise in the funds rate had largely been expected, the hawkish tone of the Fed's announcement had not. ''This action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand,'' the Fed's statement said, ''which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy.''The comments ''suggest the Fed will not stop tightening until the economy shows signs of slowing,'' Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said.

Indeed, concerns over the Fed's next move weighed down prices late yesterday.The price of the 30-year bond ended down 18/32, to 95 25/32.

386,1997-03-26 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to raise interest rates for the first time in more than two years, firing a warning shot at an inflationary threat that remained hidden over the horizon.The central bank took one of the smallest steps it could, nudging up the more important of the two short-term rates it controls -- the Federal funds target rate for overnight loans between banks -- by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent. In doing so, it was trying to keep the economy from growing so fast that it generates wage and price pressures strong enough to threaten the nation's six-year economic expansion.Because banks tie their benchmark loan rates to the Federal funds rate, today's action will ripple through the economy, probably curbing investment and consumption somewhat by increasing the rates charged for many business and personal loans and for credit cards.The move was applauded as tempered but appropriate by a number of Wall Street and academic economists, many of whom say the current combination of strong growth and low unemployment will ultimately lead to a resurgence of inflation unless action is taken to slow the economy. They said the Federal Reserve was likely to keep trying to fine-tune the economy by raising rates at least once or twice more this year.

''What the Fed did today is about right,'' said Paul A. McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities.But with few signs that rising prices are actually infecting the economy, the move drew criticism from a significant minority of economists as well as from labor unions, business groups and politicians who say that economic statistics overstate the threats to steady growth and that such factors as global competition and fear of layoffs have permanently damped inflationary forces.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50- basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 4 1/2 percent.Persistent pressures on profit margins are restraining investment spending and, through declines in equity wealth, consumption. The associated backup in inventories has induced a rapid response in manufacturing output and, with spending having firmed a bit since last year, inventory adjustment appears to be well under way.Although current developments do not appear to have materially diminished the prospects for long-term growth in productivity, excess productive capacity has emerged recently. The possibility that this excess could continue for some time and the potential for weakness in global economic conditions suggest substantial risks that demand and production could remain soft. In these circumstances, when the economic situation could be evolving rapidly, the Federal Reserve will need to monitor developments closely.The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of all 12 reserve banks.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, to 5 percent.Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to sustainable growth persist. Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential.As a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue.Today's increase in the federal funds rate, together with the policy actions in June and August and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over the course of the year, should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and Kansas City.

Today's increase took back the last of three quarter-point reductions  made last year in response to the global financial crisis and returned the rate to its level 14 months ago.

Stock investors generally dislike interest rate increases because, in the broadest sense, they raise the cost of operating a business. Rising rates also make bonds more attractive than stocks as investments.So it was not too surprising that the Fed's rate increase rattled stocks after it was announced. A quick blip upward could not be sustained, and the Dow Jones industrials fell about 140 points on the news.Minutes later, stock traders got their bearings and roared with approval over the move. The white-hot Nasdaq composite index gained 73.51 points on the day, a 2.28 percent increase. The Dow Jones industrial average raced ahead 171.58 points, or 1.59 percent.

The investor euphoria after the Fed's action seemed to be based on two assumptions. Most compelling was the view that the Fed's move was the last rate increase for the foreseeable future. The next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee takes place on Dec. 21, an unlikely occasion for anyone except Ebenezer Scrooge to raise rates. The meeting after that, in early February, is expected to feature economic statistics distorted by Year 2000 anomalies. As a result, many economists have concluded that the Fed will not move again on rates until next spring regardless of what the economic numbers show.

The Federal Reserve ended a two-day strategy session on monetary policy today without announcing an increase in short-term interest rates or explaining its apparent inaction.Analysts took this to mean that the central bank, which had raised rates four times since early February, was satisfied with early signs that the economy is slowing enough to minimize the risk of resurgent inflation.It had been widely agreed that the Fed's assessment of the domestic economy would outweigh its interest in supporting the dollar in world currency markets, even though higher rates, by making the dollar more appealing, would tend to enhance foreign investment and minimize inflation from imports. Markets' ResponseThe financial markets responded fairly positively, though with no great enthusiasm, to the apparent outcome of the Fed meeting. The dollar rebounded from its morning declines, blue-chip stocks rallied and bond prices showed relatively little change.

Prices of Treasury securities dipped in quiet trading yesterday, as dealers took profits after the recent strong rally.The price slide began during overnight trading in Tokyo, where a rise in the value of the yen against the dollar led to a mild selloff. Later, announcements that industrial production fell by four-tenths of a percent in April and that car sales for the first 10 days of May were weak failed to stir any enthusiasm, even though they would be a disincentive for the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates.''The market feels a little tired, even though it continues to trade very well,'' one Government securities trader said. ''With the Fed on hold for another month at least, it looks to me like prices are at the high end of a very wide trading range that has been established over the last couple of weeks.''The Federal Reserve Board's policy-making Open Market Committee gathered yesterday in Washington, and as the trader suggested, analysts and market participants are virtually unanimous that the Fed will vote to leave monetary policy unchanged.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved lower in thin, volatile trading yesterday, as dealers used movements in oil prices as their major indicator to buy or sell securities.A sharp run-up in oil prices early in the day sent out a clear sell signal, pushing bond prices down by more than a point. But oil later came down from its daily highs, and that helped erase most of the decline in bond prices.Comments from Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister, calling for a negotiated settlement to the crisis in the Persian Gulf also helped buttress prices, even though Mr. Aziz did not offer to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait and restore its monarchy.Traders said that the drop in stock prices had little influence on activity in the credit markets.

400,2004-08-11 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates on Tuesday by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 1.5 percent, and strongly implied that it would keep raising rates modestly but regularly in the months ahead.Analysts had almost uniformly expected the increase, the second such move since June 30.But the Fed, the nation's central bank, was tougher in a statement issued after the meeting than some had thought it would be, and this increased the prospects that policy makers would follow up with an additional rate rise at their next meeting in September, less than six weeks before the election.In the statement, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged that economic growth and job creation had both slowed but said that the economy ''nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion.''The Fed also reiterated statements pointing to a series of small rate increases that are widely expected to stretch over the next year or so. And it raised another benchmark interest rate, the discount rate on loans to big banks, also by a quarter-point, to 2.5 percent.

''We read it as pretty hawkish,'' said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank. ''There was no hint here that the Fed is inclined to stop. They could have left open an escape hatch, but I don't see any escape hatch here.'' Continue reading the main story",Fed Increases Interest Rates Quarter-Point,2004-08-10,The New York Times
401,2008-05-01 00:00:00,"Following is the full text of the statement released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 2 percent.Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months. The committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. The committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against were Richard W. Fisher and Charles I. Plosser, who preferred no change in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2.25 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Cleveland, Atlanta and San Francisco.

402,2008-05-01 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to reduce short-term interest rates this week came with a repetition of the discord that has accompanied some of its previous rate cuts.The Fed, mixing concern about the feeble U.S. economy with worries about rising inflation, reduced short-term interest rates Wednesday for the seventh time since September, while signaling a pause for now in any further rate cuts.The action lowered the federal funds rate - the rate it charges banks for overnight loans - to 2 percent, from 2.25 percent, the least since November 2004. The Fed defended that step as necessary to counter the ailing U.S. housing sector and the ""considerable stress"" shadowing financial markets.But two regional Fed bank presidents on the policy-setting committee again dissented from the decision to reduce  rates. They and many other economists have called on the Fed to shift its focus from countering a possible recession to heading off inflation spurred by the increasing costs of food and energy.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, mixing concern about the feeble economy with worries about rising inflation, reduced short-term interest rates Wednesday for the seventh time  since September, while signaling a pause in any additional rate cuts for now.The Fed’s action brought the federal funds rate — the rate at which banks lend to each other —  to 2 percent, from 2.25 percent, the lowest level since November 2004. It defended that step as necessary to counter the ailing housing sector and the “considerable stress” shadowing financial markets.The move followed new indications that the economy remained fragile at best. The Commerce Department reported early Wednesday that the economy expanded only 0.6 percent on an annualized basis in the first three months of 2008, short of an overall downturn but still far from healthy.The Dow Jones industrial average, which was trading up 178 points shortly after the Fed’s announcement, dropped sharply in late trading, ending down 11.81 points at 12,820.13.

404,2000-02-03 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5 3/4 percent. In a related action, the  board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 5 1/4 percent.The committee remains concerned that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

With the economy apparently recovering from a stumble in the spring, the Federal Reserve's top policy committee chose today to leave short-term rates unchanged.The decision to do nothing had been widely expected, given a recent string of strong economic indicators that suggested little need for the Fed to stimulate the economy right now. But the decision was nonetheless important as an indication that the central bank planned to move slowly on lowering rates even in the face of an equally striking set of indicators showing inflation was under control.The Federal Reserve's decision had little effect on the stock and bond markets.The group that met today, the Federal Open Market Committee, had voted on July 6 to cut interest rates for the first time since 1992. In the weeks before that meeting, the economy had seemed in worse shape, and the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, had talked about the possibility of a recession.Nevertheless, the panel chose to make the smallest possible reduction in short-term interest rates, and justified the move not in terms of the need for stimulus but on the grounds that ""inflationary pressures have receded enough.""

Wall Street endured a typically dull late-August session yesterday, showing little response to the Federal Reserve Board's decision not to act on interest rates.Trading volume was sluggish and there were relatively small changes on the plus side in the major market averages.After a follow-through of Monday's selling early in the day, the stock market leveled off until the last hour of trading. At that point, buyers entered the market and many stocks pulled out of minus territory.""The market spent a lot of time waiting for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting and then nothing happened,"" said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers, referring to the meeting by the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm. ""Once the announcement came out, the uncertainty was removed and the market began to pay attention to earnings and dividends and momentum.""

Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday, as the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting and the Treasury sold two-year notes in a successful auction.The 30-year bond slipped 8/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 99 28/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was 6.89 percent, compared with 6.87 percent on Monday.The only data out, a weekly retail sales report by Johnson Redbook, showed a drop of 1.1 percent for sales so far this month, compared with the previous one-month period, little changed from last week's reading of a 1 percent decline. Analysts said this was consistent with recent reports of disappointing back-to-school retail activity, but since the market was already aware of the trend, the report had little market impact. What it did do was raise hopes for another easing by the Fed later this year.Supply concerns also weighed on the market, particularly so soon after the quarterly refunding earlier this month. But after the recent flurry of dollar-buying interventions by central banks, market expectations were that there could be demand for Treasury securities to make use of the dollars purchased by the central banks. And traders thought that the two-year note would be a decent vehicle to be considered.

Yesterday's sale of $17.25 billion in two-year notes saw the high yield taken at 6.09 percent, lower than analysts' expectations of a 6.10 percent yield, but higher than last month's yield of 5.955 percent. There was the customary drop in prices just ahead of the auction as some dealers sold off in hopes of lowering prices enough to make the two-year issue that much more attractive.

The committee, accordingly, continues to see a risk of heightened inflation pressures. However, softening in business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets over recent months suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce.Nonetheless, to date the easing of demand pressures has not been sufficient to warrant a change in the committee's judgment that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

409,2000-11-16 00:00:00,"Citing clear evidence that the economy has shifted into a lower gear, the Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, but with unemployment low and energy prices high the central bank said it was not yet ready to proclaim that inflation was no longer a threat.The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not allude to the uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election or to the recent uncertainty in the stock market, but instead projected a business-as-usual tone in a statement that stressed the gradual cooling of the economy. The statement said economic growth appeared to have slowed to a rate below what most economists consider its noninflationary speed limit of about 4 percent a year.The Fed imposed six rate increases, totaling 1.75 percentage points, between June 1999 and May of this year, in an effort to bring economic growth into a range that would diminish inflation pressures.But the committee stressed that it still saw ''a risk of heightened inflation pressures'' stemming from the low rate of joblessness -- 3.9 percent in October -- and the rise earlier this year in oil prices.

411,2003-08-13 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period shows that spending is firming, although labor market indicators are mixed. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

412,2003-08-13 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve left its overnight interest rate unchanged at 1 percent today, but it cheered financial markets by strongly suggesting that it would not raise interest rates until at least some time next year.Today's decision -- almost universally anticipated by analysts and investors -- leaves short-term rates at their lowest levels since the 1950's.But the Fed also gave investors a big clue about its plans for the months ahead and that clue came as a pleasant surprise to the markets.In its statement accompanying today's decision, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated almost verbatim its previous assessment of the economy. It added a new sentence, however, on top of its familiar formulations, declaring that ''the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''

413,2003-08-13 00:00:00,"While Federal Reserve policy makers were not very upbeat about the outlook for the economy yesterday, their statement that they would keep their benchmark interest rate low for a long time could help start the stock market moving again.The three main stock gauges have been locked in a trading range this summer. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are still below the highs they reached on June 17. The Nasdaq composite index is still below where it was on July 14. Many economists expected the long decline in jobs to turn the corner in July. Instead, they were surprised by another loss.And the tone of the Fed's statement was not so rosy. It said that the upside and downside risks to the economy were still ''roughly equal'' and that ''on balance'' the threat of deflation, though minor, was greater than inflation in the foreseeable future.But some analysts argue that the Fed's interest rate commitment should restrain the increase in longer-term rates, giving the weak recovery time to gain strength. With this limit on rate increases, investors are also more likely to believe that the recent rebound in corporate profits, a significant driver of share prices, can continue, setting the stage for a stock market rally.

Corporate profits, as included in the gross domestic product, have been rising the last five quarters, from the quarter in which the National Bureau of Economic Research said the most recent recession ended. Economists forecast that such profits also rose in the second quarter and should climb even higher in the current one.

Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions have improved. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 3 percent.

415,2004-11-11 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 - The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday for the fourth time this year, and suggested that it would continue to raise them gradually through much of next year.The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter point, to 2 percent, a move that was widely expected.Saying that monetary policy is still ""accommodative,"" the central bank repeated its assertion of the last several months that it would continue to raise short-term rates at a ""measured pace"" from their historic lows earlier this year. The stock market had little reaction, with the three main gauges trading slightly lower. Bond prices fell on the possibility of further rate increases.""Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices,"" the Fed said in a statement announcing its decision.

416,2000-03-22 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 6 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 5 1/2 percent.Economic conditions and considerations addressed by the committee are essentially the same as when the committee met in February. The committee remains concerned that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

417,2000-03-22 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve clamped down a bit more on the economy today, raising interest rates a quarter percentage point in an effort to prevent an outbreak of inflation.The move was no surprise to economists and investors, who had heard repeated hints the last month from Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, that he intended to stick to his policy of raising rates in small, steady steps until he saw signs that the supercharged economy was throttling back.The stock market, which some analysts consider Mr. Greenspan's main target in raising rates, shrugged off the news and moved higher after the Fed's announcement this afternoon. Apparently relieved that the central bank did not raise rates a half-point, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 227.10 points, to 10,907.34. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,711.68, up 101.68 points.It was the Fed's fifth quarter-point rate increase since June, and it lifted the benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 6 percent, its highest level in almost five years.

However, both the upward impetus from the swing in inventory investment and the growth in final demand appear to have moderated. The committee expects the rate of increase of final demand to pick up over coming quarters, supported in part by robust underlying growth in productivity, but the degree of the strengthening remains uncertain.In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the committee believes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

And it concluded that the risks remained evenly balanced for now between an economic rebound and a slowdown that could lead to another recession or a broad-based decline in prices.In its statement, the Fed did not mention the stock market's dive, the dollar's weakness or the corporate malfeasance that has undermined confidence among investors in the United States and around the world.

Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that no taxpayer bailout of the nation's banks would be necessary if Congress approved the Administration's proposed banking legislation and if the economy avoided a complete collapse.In an interview in his office, Mr. Brady gave an upbeat appraisal of economic prospects, but he suggested that the Federal Reserve could prolong the recession if it became ""preoccupied with inflation"" and kept interest rates too high.Over the course of an hour, Mr. Brady addressed these other topics:*The Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout, will not be able to go out of business by the summer of 1992 as the law requires, and new legislation will be needed to allow the agency to continue to take over failed institutions after that.*The United States should not help rebuild Iraq, as it did Germany and Japan after World War II, as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.

421,2008-12-17 00:00:00,"From Palm Beach to Wall Street, Bernard L. Madoff’s wealth and reputation permeated high society.  
The man allegedly behind a $50 billion Ponzi scheme also had a considerable presence in Washington, contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to politicians and lobbying firms.
The Center for Responsive Politics has found that Mr. Madoff and his wife, Ruth, have given $238,200 to federal candidates, parties and committees since 1991, with Democrats getting 88 percent of that. “Madoff made a fortune, and he played politics with some of that money,” the nonpartisan interest group said on its Web site, OpenSecrets.org. 
Mr. Madoff gave extensively to some of his favorite politicians, including Charles E. Schumer, the Democratic Senator from New York; and Ron Wyden, the Democratic Senator from Oregon. Both lawmakers are members of the powerful Senate Finance Commmitee.
Overall, Mr. Madoff and other individuals at his company, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, gave $372,100 in campaign contributions since 1991, with 89 percent to Democrats.
But that’s not all: The firm also spent $590,000 on lobbying in the last 11 years, all but $10,000 of it with the lobbying firm of Lent, Scrivner & Roth.
DealBook took a look at the lobbying records, which showed that Mr. Madoff had his K-Street crew lobby the Securities and Exchange Commission and members of both houses of Congress. 
The lobbying issues included public ownership of equity markets, securities transaction fees and stock exchange mergers — topics that appear to relate to his firm’s market-making business, which is separate from its asset-management unit. (He also paid to lobby the National Park Service in relation to funding for the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City.)
The latest filing shows that Mr. Madoff’s lobbying interests include market regulation, and specifically, the consolidation of certain regulatory functions.
It is not clear what Mr. Madoff’s position was on the topic. But any attempt by Mr. Madoff to shape the future of financial regulation could raise eyebrows now that the S.E.C. is under fire for failing to identify and shut down Mr. Madoff’s alleged fraud.

422,2008-12-17 00:00:00,"TYSONS CORNER, Va. —  This intersection in Fairfax County is a mecca for shoppers: it is the Washington region’s largest retail center, with 5.9 million square feet of shopping, and it includes the country’s 10th-largest mall. It is also due for a major makeover — after the sinking economy rebounds.In October, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors accepted the recommendations of a 36-member task force that had labored for three years on a plan to turn this traffic-clogged maze of malls and office parks into an urban center that has more housing and is less dependent on cars. This month, the supervisors said they would move quickly in 2009 to pass regulations allowing for greater density, consistent with the long-range plan for Tysons.The plan has been widely applauded as a forward-thinking blueprint to convert this “edge city,” 13 miles from downtown Washington, into the epitome of “smart growth” by 2050. The area is ultimately envisioned as having high-rise apartments adjoining four new rail transit stations built along an extension of the Metro system, shuttle buses, a pedestrian-friendly street grid, urban parks and outdoor plazas.The plan aims to be a guideline to be followed over decades, which is fortunate, because it was being completed just as the economy took a sharp downturn.

But it is not clear how soon this will happen. “Our plans are really tied to market demands,” said John E. Harrison, the vice president for development at Tysons.

The long end of the Treasury market rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced its sixth and largest interest rate increase of the year, easing traders' fears of inflation.By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 8/32 , to a price of 9327/32 , for a yield of 8.05 percent, down from 8.07 percent on Monday. Despite the rise in the long end of the Treasury market, prices in shorter maturities were mixed.The central bank raised short-term rates three-quarters of a percent, a quarter-point more than many had predicted. Expectations were running high as the Federal Open Market Committee met to determine monetary policy for the months ahead.While investors and dealers were expecting a rise of at least 50 basis points in the discount and Federal funds rates, they were hoping for something a little more aggressive -- and got it. The Fed lifted the discount rate that it charges banks for loans to 4.75 percent and the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for money, usually overnight, to 5.5 percent.

Determined to prevent strong economic growth from feeding inflation, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates today by the largest amount since 1981 and left open the possibility of further increases. Banks followed by raising the rates they charge for loans.The increases are likely to show up immediately in the rates charged millions of Americans on everything from home equity loans to credit cards to small-business loans. Already, interest rates on 30-year mortgages that were available at slightly more than 7 percent at the start of the year have risen to 9.05 percent.While rising rates are intended to slow economic growth, the Federal Reserve's five previous increases, which began in February, have had mixed results. Some industries, like auto making, that depend on customers who need loans have had robust sales, while others, like home building, have begun to slow. Critics of the Federal Reserve say that interest rate changes take up to 18 months to show results and that the previous increases may yet do so.The central bank today raised by three-quarters of a percentage point each of two short-term interest rates that it controls. Stocks, bonds and the dollar bounced up and down in value following the Federal Reserve's action but closed with little change.

The decision by the Federal Reserve came five hours after it reported that American factories operated at 84.9 percent of capacity in October, the highest level in nearly 15 years. When factories are working at top speed, production bottlenecks often occur and can lead to inflation as companies bid up the prices of scarce materials and skilled workers.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 — The Federal Reserve rolled out its most powerful interest rate weapon on Tuesday in a bid to stop the turmoil in housing and financial markets from bringing down the overall economy.But even as stock markets soared in a thunderous rally, the Fed carefully stopped short of implying any commitment to reduce rates even more in the months ahead. Indeed, policy makers cautioned that they still have lingering worries about inflation  — a concern that would weigh against stimulating the economy further with cheaper money.In reducing its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large one-half percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, the central bank made it clear that policy makers viewed the turbulence and disruptions of the past couple of months as too dangerous to ignore.The reaction in stock markets was ecstatic: the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points almost instantly and ended the day up 335 points, or 2.51 percent, at 13,739.39.

But domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall.Against the background of already-tight domestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation.

Instead, it said it was now leaning toward imposing higher rates.The shift was subtle, but it signaled a clear change in the Federal Reserve's outlook from last fall, when it made three reductions in interest rates in response to the global financial crisis.In a statement, the Fed said it was ''concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy.''

Investors and economists, who considered the odds of such a shift to be roughly 50-50, were well prepared for the announcement, which came just after 2:15 P.M. It rattled Wall Street, but only briefly. Stocks, which had been up modestly, turned down  before recovering most of their losses. Bond prices fell, and the dollar dipped slightly.

431,1999-05-19 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to leave interest rates unchanged but to warn that it was thinking of raising them in the future reaffirms how unsure the policy makers are about the state of the economy.The Fed cut rates three times late last year when it believed that the financial panic following the Russian default would slow American growth  and might bring on a world recession. In retrospect the Fed seems to have overreacted, although the  cuts appeared prudent at the time. Now, with the United States' economy growing far more rapidly than expected, a world recession seemingly unlikely and with some signs of a rebirth of inflation, a modest increase in rates could easily be justified.That the Fed did not dictate such an increase, but instead announced a ''bias'' in favor of raising rates in the future, probably reflects a continued argument within the Fed's open market committee about the extent to which inflation is a threat. Some believe that thanks to increases in productivity brought on by computers, the economy is now able to grow much faster than in the past without any appreciable threat of inflation. But it is also possible that inflation has been held down by overseas weakness that is now reversing. The Fed should be vigilant about inflation, and may rightly conclude next month that a rate increase is wise.

But the blue-chip average subsequently regained much of that loss and closed at 10,836.95, a drop of 16.52 points.Elsewhere in the stock market, declines in oil stocks and regional telephone companies helped push the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 6.17 points, or half a percent, to 1,333.32. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.48 points, to 2,558.36. But the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.10, or 0.25 percent, to 442.45.

433,1999-05-19 00:00:00,"PROPELLED in part by increased alcohol sales on the Internet, intensive campaigns to restrict wine distribution further are afoot in state legislatures and in Washington.The proposed regulations would make it much harder for producers of scarce or unevenly distributed wines to ship directly to consumers, and for retailers to ship across state lines. Order those alluring bottles of Rochioli pinot noir or Screaming Eagle cabernet sauvignon you see on the Web, and you could wind up with a felony charge -- if you live in the wrong state and if anyone can figure out how to enforce the new legislation.It could be that the campaigns, financed mostly by wholesalers who fear the loss of business, will fizzle out. But they could succeed, and some fear that if they do, the choice of wines will be severely constricted for almost all wine drinkers.Michael Aaron, chairman of Sherry-Lehmann in Manhattan, one of the country's largest wine retailers, argues that attempts to tighten the rules for shipments across state lines will lead to the disruption of shipments within states, even package store deliveries.

But the Fed's warning about its possible next move -- in the form of a formal tilt toward a tighter monetary policy -- nonetheless jolted Wall Street and suggested that financial markets would remain jittery in coming weeks in anticipation of new data about the momentum of the economy.The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up over 100 points just before the Fed's announcement, plummeted immediately and was down around 125 points before rebounding. It closed at 10,400.59, down 0.64 point on the day. Bond prices tumbled, sending longer-term interest rates higher.In holding rates steady for now but putting investors on notice that a rate increase could be in the offing, the Fed was trying to strike a policy balance that acknowledged both the warning signals of inflation being generated by the robust economy and the almost total lack of actual inflation outside of surging oil prices.

If the increasingly tight labor market pushes wages higher and forces companies to raise prices for their goods and services, the inflation rate could rise, they warned.The tightening bias suggests the panel could opt to raise its target on federal funds, the overnight interbank loan rate, at its next meeting, scheduled for Nov. 16, but the central bank has said it would make as much credit available as necessary late in the year to quell fears surrounding the Year 2000 computer problem.Markets reacted negatively.

yield on the 30-year issue to 6.15 percent from 6.09 late Monday.Harvinder Kalirai, senior economist at the IDEAglobal.com economics consultancy, said he thought the Fed should be pushing rates higher. The economy is expanding at roughly a 4 percent annual rate, and this is about 1 percentage point faster than it can stand without igniting inflation, he said. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, has suggested that, with productivity rising at about 2 percent a year and the population growing by 1 percent, a 3 percent growth rate is the natural pace for the economy.Some economists say productivity is growing faster than measured by traditional indicators, which do not take into account changes in the composition of the economy. Mr. Kalirai noted, however, that the U.S. unemployment rate has dropped to 4.2 percent from more than 7 percent earlier this decade, and he said the declining level is mathematical proof that productivity does not account for all the economic growth.

However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth.Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated. The committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee. The committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I. Plosser; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M.

Faced with a revolt in his party's Congressional ranks and wariness around the country, President Bush appealed on television tonight for public support of the budget compromise he and Congressional leaders struck last weekend. He predicted ''economic chaos if we fail to reduce the deficit.''In a show of bipartisanship that verged on coalition Government, the President was followed with a broadcast by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader. He urged support for the President ''because the nation is more important than partisan differences.'' [Transcripts of the Bush and Mitchell speeches appear on page D28.]  Mr. Mitchell was preaching to the converted for the most part. Despite considerable opposition among liberals, a majority of Congressional Democrats appear to support the agreement.Tough Task for BushBut Mr. Bush has the more difficult task of swaying enough dissident Republicans to win enactment of the plan.The President said that neither he nor anyone else was completely satisfied with the compromise, but he said it was ''the best agreement that can be legislated now.''

Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity have temporarily depressed output and employment. However, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity that will likely be augmented by planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas. The cumulative rise in energy and other costs has the potential to add to inflation pressures; however, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.The committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H.

Immediately after the rate cut of half a percentage point, stocks rallied then fell, and then reversed course again and climbed higher, as positive interpretations of the Fed rate cut won out, for now.At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 92.74 points, or 1.1 percent, to 8,771.01. After the Fed announcement, the Dow made a 209-point swing, down to 8,590.19 and up to 8,800. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 8.37 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 923.76. The Nasdaq composite index rose 17.82 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,418.99.Despite a four-week rally and the Fed rate cut, all three gauges are still below the peaks they reached during the summer rally, which ended in late August as the overall market plunged to a five-and-a-half-year low in the second week of October.

Drug companies were among the stocks leading the market higher yesterday. Analysts said that with Republicans in control of Congress, price caps in a prescription drug bill were less likely. Merck rose $1.80, or 3.3 percent, to $56. Military contractors, who could benefit from a war in Iraq, also rose. Boeing was up $2.06, or 6.5 percent, to $33.58.

445,2002-11-07 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate today by half a percentage point, an aggressive move to ward off renewed economic weakness at a time when threats of terrorism and an impending confrontation with Iraq are weighing down business and consumer confidence.As the political parties in Washington digested the economic policy implications of Tuesday's Republican victory in the midterm election, the Fed put aside internal differences over the need for further rate cuts and voted unanimously for the half-point reduction. The step was intended to stimulate business investment and consumer spending by lowering borrowing costs.But the Fed also hinted that it does not plan to cut rates again when it next meets in five weeks, reflecting a view at the central bank that rates are now low enough and that it is in any case running out of room to reduce them much further.Economists said the United States would now have to rely increasingly on stimulative fiscal policy -- some combination of tax cuts and increased government spending -- to give the economy a boost if it does not bounce back soon.

He listed the association's top goals as expanded tax cuts, a new law governing terrorism insurance, a prescription drug policy for the elderly and a resolution of asbestos-related lawsuits that have hurt the stock prices of manufacturers and prompted numerous companies to seek protection in bankruptcy court.Other business leaders and executives, when asked what they most hoped the new Republican majorities in both House and Senate would be able to accomplish for American business, cited the swift passage of terrorism insurance rules, a lessening of environmental regulations and a bankruptcy law that will make it more difficult for people to escape their debts.Many also foresaw a more receptive climate for new limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and punitive damages awards. Lester Brickman, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School, recalled that President Bush gained popularity in Texas as ""a direct outcome of the largely successful tort reform efforts,"" and would be emboldened by the Republican victories.

447,2002-11-07 00:00:00,"The resignation of Harvey L. Pitt from the Securities and Exchange Commission will set back by months the efforts of the agency to clean up Wall Street, provide vigorous oversight of the accounting profession and impose tougher regulations on company directors, government officials and corporate law experts said today.Even before Mr. Pitt's announcement on Tuesday evening that he would step down as the commission's chairman, the agency faced difficult challenges. It has suffered huge morale problems and high turnover among its more experienced staff, whose pay was lower than that of officials from other federal agencies. And although its mission was enlarged substantially this summer when Congress adopted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, authorizing a 77 percent increase in its budget, the financing has remained in doubt because the White House has wavered over its commitment for such a large increase.Moreover, Mr. Pitt's choice to head the new accounting oversight board, William H. Webster, has said he is reconsidering whether to head that board in light of the disclosure that he headed the audit committee of a virtually insolvent company facing accusations of fraud. Should Mr. Webster step down, as some top officials today predicted, the vacancy would not be filled until after the commission gets a new permanent chairman, a process that will take months.''The agenda of the Securities and Exchange Commission is in shambles right now,'' said Donald C. Langevoort of Georgetown University, a former commission official who is an authority on securities and corporate law. ''Simply responding to the demands of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the corporate scandals was a massive management task. Now the commission has to go through a new search for leadership, and the accounting board probably will, too. This has to be a great setback.''

449,2004-12-15 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 2.25 percent.The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, to 3.25 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.In addition, the committee unanimously decided to expedite the release of its minutes. Beginning with this meeting, the minutes of regularly scheduled meetings will be released three weeks after the date of the policy decision. The first set of expedited minutes will be released at 2 p.m. E.S.T. on Jan. 4, 2005.

Interest rates on short-term issues moved lower again yesterday and bond prices rose as the continuing crisis in the Soviet Union gave investors ample excuse to redirect funds into high-quality, safe securities.In addition to the Soviet crisis, traders said prices had also risen in anticipation that the Federal Reserve Board is about to lower short-term interest rates again soon and the idea that the economy may be falling back into recession.""Given those three factors, how can you bet against the market?"" one government bond trader said.Compared with Monday, when trading activity bordered on the chaotic after news of the ouster of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, dealers said yesterday's session was much quieter.""People are just waiting, but right now the fundamentals for the market are in pretty good shape,"" another bond trader said.

But analysts cautioned that events in the Soviet Union could yet create further havoc in markets - particularly a worst-case scenario of a full-scale civil war with millions of refugees flooding into Scandinavia and Central Europe.""There are no long-term conclusions to be drawn"" from Tuesday's price movements, said David Hale, analyst at Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. ""We've made one big price adjustment in the dollar, but there's more to go for. If fighting starts we could see further gains for the dollar and in the price of oil.""""If the government clamps down but stays in charge and civil war is averted, markets will stabilize. What's haunting markets is that there could be a civil war,"" he said.Just how nervous and unsettled markets were was shown Tuesday when the dollar dropped 3 pfennig to 1.78 Deutsche marks within minutes on an unfounded rumor that Mikhail S.

452,2007-08-08 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed’s monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged.The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5 1/4  percent.Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year. Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 — The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged on Tuesday and signaled that it still expected to avoid cutting short-term rates despite the recent tumult in credit markets and on Wall Street. The Fed suggested that it would change course only if economic conditions deteriorate badly in the weeks and months ahead.In a statement announcing that the overnight lending rate it controls  would remain unchanged at 5.25 percent, the Fed’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not drift significantly from its core message that inflation remains a greater risk to the economy than recession.The central bank, however, softened its tone slightly by giving some recognition to worsening conditions in financial markets, by adding a new phrase to its statement saying that the risk of an economic downturn has “increased somewhat.”“The Fed threw the markets a bone, commenting on recent market volatility and tighter credit conditions,” Steven A. Wood of Insight Economics wrote in a commentary. “However, they gave no hint that they would act anytime soon.”

DEKALB, Ill. — While much of the nation worries about a slumping real estate market, people in Midwestern farm country are experiencing exactly the opposite. Take, for instance, the farm here — nearly 80 acres of corn and soybeans off a gravel road in a universe of corn and soybeans — that sold for $10,000 an acre at auction this spring, a price that astonished even the auctioneer.“If they had seen that day, they would have never believed it,” Penny Layman said of her sister and brother-in-law, who paid $32,000 for the entire spread in 1962 and whose deaths led to the sale.Skyrocketing farmland prices, particularly in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, giddy with the promise of corn-based ethanol, are stirring new optimism among established farmers. But for younger farmers, already rare in this graying profession, and for small farmers with dreams of expanding and grabbing a piece of the ethanol craze, the news is oddly grim. The higher prices feel out of reach.“It’s extremely frustrating,” said Paul Burrs, who farms about 400 acres near Dixon, Ill., and says he regularly bids on new farmland in the hopes of renting it. Mostly, he said, he loses out to higher bidders. “I crunch the numbers and go as high as I can. But then that’s it. There’s nothing more I can do.”

457,2009-03-19 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve sharply stepped up its efforts to bolster the economy on Wednesday, announcing that it would pump an extra $1 trillion into the financial system by purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage securities.
Having already reduced the key interest rate it controls nearly to zero, the central bank has increasingly turned to alternatives like buying securities as a way of getting more dollars into the economy, a tactic that amounts to creating vast new sums of money out of thin air. But the moves on Wednesday were its biggest yet, almost doubling all of the Fed’s measures in the last year, The New York Times’s Edmund L. Andrews reports.
The action makes the Fed a buyer of long-term government bonds rather than the short-term debt that it typically buys and sells to help control the money supply.
The idea was to encourage more economic activity by lowering interest rates, including those on home loans, and to help the financial system as it struggles under the crushing weight of bad loans and poor investments.
Investors responded with surprise and enthusiasm. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down about 50 points just before the announcement, jumped immediately and ended the day up almost 91 points at 7,486.58. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds dropped markedly, and analysts predicted that interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages would soon drop below 5 percent.
But there were also clear indications that the Fed was taking risks that could dilute the value of the dollar and set the stage for future inflation. Gold prices rose $26.60 an ounce, hitting $942, a sign of declining confidence in the dollar. The dollar, which had been losing value in recent weeks to the euro and the yen, dropped sharply again on Wednesday.
In its announcement, the central bank said that the United States remained in a severe recession and listed its continuing woes, from job losses and lost housing wealth to falling exports as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown.
“In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability,” the central bank said.
As expected, policy makers decided to keep the Fed’s benchmark interest rate on overnight loans in a range between zero and 0.25 percent.
But to the surprise of investors and analysts, the committee said it had decided to purchase an additional $750 billion worth of government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities on top of the $500 billion that the Fed is already in the process of buying.
In addition, the Fed said it would buy up to $300 billion worth of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months. That would tend to push down longer-term interest rates on all types of loans.
All these measures would come in addition to what has already been an unprecedented expansion of lending by the Fed. The central bank also said it would probably expand the scope of a new program to finance consumer and business lending, which gets under way this week.
In effect, the central bank has been lending money to a wider and wider array of borrowers, and it has financed that lending by using its authority to create new money at will.
Since last September, the Fed’s lending programs have roughly doubled the size of its balance sheet, to about $1.8 trillion, from $900 billion. The actions announced on Wednesday are likely to expand that to well over $3 trillion over the next year.
Despite a trickle of encouraging data in the last few weeks, Fed officials were clearly still worried and in no mood to cut back on their emergency efforts.
Fed policy makers sharply reduced their economic forecasts in January, predicting that the economy would continue to experience steep contractions for the first half of 2009, that unemployment could approach 9 percent by the end of the year and that there was at least a small risk of a drop in consumer prices like those that Japan experienced for nearly a decade.
The Fed rarely buys long-term government bonds. The last occasion was nearly 50 years ago under different economic circumstances when it tried to reduce long-term interest rates while allowing short term rates to rise.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has been extremely cautious in recent weeks about predicting an end to the recession, saying that he hoped to see the start of a recovery later this year but warning that unemployment, a lagging indicator, would probably keep climbing until some time in 2010.
In contrast to several recent Fed decisions, with the presidents of some regional Fed banks dissenting, the decision at Wednesday’s meeting of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank’s policy making group, was unanimous.
Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told The Times the Fed had adopted a “kitchen sink” strategy of throwing everything it had to jolt the economy out of its downward spiral.
But while Mr. Hatzius applauded the decision, he cautioned that the central bank could not solve the economy’s problems by expanding cheap money.
“Even if the Fed could make interest rates negative, that wouldn’t necessarily help,” Mr. Hatzius told The Times. “We’re in a deep recession mainly because the private sector, for a variety of reasons, has decided to save a lot more. You can have a zero interest rate, but if you just offer more money on top of the money that is already available, it doesn’t do that much.”
Fed officials have been wrestling for months with the fact that lenders remain unwilling to lend and borrowers are unwilling or unable to borrow. Even though the Fed has been creating money at the fastest rate in its history, much of that money has remained dormant.
The Fed’s action is an expansion of its effort to bypass the private banking system and act as a lender in its own right.
The Fed and the Treasury are starting a joint venture this week called the Consumer and Business Lending Initiative in their latest effort to thaw the still-frozen credit markets. The program will start out with $200 billion in financing for consumer loans, small-business loans and some corporate purposes.
Fed officials have said they hope to expand the program next month, possibly to include the huge market for commercial mortgages, and both the Fed and Treasury hope the program will eventually provide up to $1 trillion in total financing.

458,2001-11-07 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again yesterday, pushing down short-term rates as far this year as it has usually done before the economy comes out of a recession. Stock market investors now seem to believe a recovery will begin by the middle of next year.Despite some hesitation after the announcement of the half-point reduction, share prices ended the day with a solid rally -- making it the most enthusiastic reaction of the year for any of the cuts that have come at regularly scheduled meetings of the central bank's policy making Federal Open Market Committee.The cut leaves the rate on overnight loans between banks at 2 percent, the lowest since 1961.The three major market averages, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, ended the day up 1.5 percent or more. They had been mixed to down after the first five expected moves this year, but rose, albeit not as strongly as yesterday, after the last move, on Oct. 2.Lower interest rates are expected to stimulate the economy by making it less expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow money. One rate the Fed directly controls is now down more than two-thirds from where it began the year. That is about the same amount as rates fell before recent recessions ended.

In part, yesterday's market advance reflected more mystery than usual surrounding the Fed meeting.

459,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent.The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee suggests that aggregate demand is growing at a moderate pace.Over time, the current accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, should be sufficient to foster an improving business climate. However, considerable uncertainty persists about the extent and timing of the expected pickup in production and employment owing in part to the emergence of heightened geopolitical risks.Consequently, the committee believes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Jerry L. Jordan; Donald L. Kohn; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero, and Gary H. Stern.Voting against the action were: Edward M. Gramlich and Robert D. McTeer Jr.Governor Gramlich and President McTeer preferred a reduction in the target for the federal funds rate.

460,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"The Dow Jones industrial average plunged to a four-year low yesterday, as investors digested a surprise dissent from two Federal Reserve policy makers.Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which met yesterday to discuss interest rate policy, voted against the decision of the majority of the committee to keep the Fed's benchmark interest rate at 1.75 percent. They wanted to reduce it.The dissent, from Edward Gramlich, a Fed governor, and Robert McTeer, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, was read both negatively and positively by investors, as was evident in the gyrations in the market after the 2:15 p.m. announcement. But by the end of the session, it appeared that the negative interpretation was holding sway for now.The Dow dropped 189.02 points, or 2.4 percent, to 7,683.13, its lowest close since October 1998, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.41 points, or 1.7 percent, to 819.29. The Nasdaq composite index, which eked out small gains earlier in the day, slipped 2.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,182.17, a six-year low.

461,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave official interest rates unchanged, but 2 of its 12 voting members took the rare step of opposing the decision and instead backed an immediate rate cut.The split decision did little to calm the tumult on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at its lowest level in four years. But it was a clear indication that Fed officials, like economists generally, are divided over how to deal with the fears of further weakness in the economy and the uncertainty created by the prospect of war with Iraq. [Page C1.]It was the first time since 1998 that two members of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee simultaneously broke ranks with Alan Greenspan, the chairman. While there is no indication that Mr. Greenspan's leadership or stature are at risk -- he left for Britain after the meeting to receive an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday -- the dissents highlighted the unease in Washington and the markets about whether the economy is at risk of stalling again.The vote left investors and analysts uncertain about the Fed's next step. It disappointed some investors, who had hoped the Fed would address the swoon in stock prices, declining consumer confidence and reluctance on the part of businesses to expand and invest.

But the willingness of two Fed members to call for lower rates today suggested to analysts that a rate cut would be on the agenda at the next Fed meeting, on Nov. 6, the day after Congressional elections, when any move the central bank might make would have fewer political implications. If economic indicators point to further weakness, many predicted, the Fed is likely to lower rates at that meeting.

462,2005-03-23 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 23/4 percent.The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output evidently continues to grow at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident. The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices.The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

It restated its intention to keep raising them at a ""measured"" pace in the months ahead.But in a departure from previous declarations, the central bank said there were rising inflationary pressures beyond those tied directly to the recent jumps in oil prices.""Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident,"" the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.

The Fed also changed its assessment of risks to the economy. Last month, it said the risks to inflation and growth were ""roughly equal."" On Tuesday, it said the risks ""should be kept roughly equal,"" but said its outlook was dependent on ""appropriate monetary policy action.""

The Dow Jones industrial average, off 2.9 percent for the year, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, off 3.3 percent for the year, are both within striking distance of the 2005 lows they reached in January.""As long as energy prices remain elevated, they will keep a level of fear in the market,"" said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at J.P.

465,2009-08-13 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent:Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out. Conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks. Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities. To promote a smooth transition in markets as these purchases of Treasury securities are completed, the committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these transactions and anticipates that the full amount will be purchased by the end of October. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S.

The policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve pointedly kept the central bank out of the impasse between the White House and Congress at a time the economic outlook was uncertain anyway.The committee adjourned leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at 5percent. It meets next on Dec. 19, when Wall Street expects consumers to have clarified the outlook for the economy by their Christmas buying patterns and the political impasse to have ended with a plan to eventually eliminate the federal budget deficit.""The major negative in the economy is the budget imbroglio,"" said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Lehman Brothers Inc. ""The economy is on the soft side at the moment, but if the consumer revives during the Christmas season under the impetus of lower prices, that will keep the economy from caving in the last quarter of the year, and then I would not expect the Fed to ease in December.""On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in October, the largest rise in five months. Even with the latest figure, inflation for the past 12 months is running at 2.8 percent.The Fed's own index of industrial production fell 0.3 percent in October, the first decline since April, when it fell 0.6 percent in an inventory correction after last winter's gains.

Treasury prices were little changed yesterday as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.While the outcome of the Fed's policy-committee meeting was expected, it did  hold down prices by turning the market's attention back to the impasse on the Federal budget and debt limit, as well as to the next Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting.In terms of the Fed easing, the question is now whether they will ease at the Dec. 19 F.O.M.C. meeting,"" said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Money Watch in New York, a market research and analysis firm.The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to 10727/32 , leaving its yield  unchanged at 6.29 percent.Treasury prices were also weighed down by a report on consumer prices for October that was above expectations. The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts had expected an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent. The core rate, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy prices, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the month.

The Dow Jones industrial average soared past 4,900 for the first time yesterday, and the broader-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set a record.Benign news on inflation put traders in a buying mood, even though the Federal Reserve took no action on cutting interest rates at yesterday's meeting  of its Federal Open Market Committee and the debt squabble in Washington was unresolved. In addition, four rounds of computer-guided ""buy"" orders in advance  of tomorrow's double-witching options expiration helped push the stock market upward late in the day.Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers, suggested the Fed would be ready to reduce rates once an agreement had been reached to balance the Federal budget. ""Such a move would make the total return on stocks more competitive than the return on bonds.""Bond prices and yields showed little movement during the day. The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 6.29 percent.

The Dow climbed 50.94 points, or more than 1 percent, to 4,922.75, its top level of the day and its 57th new high this year. It surged through the 4,800 milestone just two months ago. Although a gain of 50 points or more is supposed  to set off a New York Stock Exchange rule that curbs stock-index arbitrage, the  30-stock average did not pass the 50-point mark until the market had closed, when last-minute orders were reflected in the final prices.

Despite mounting evidence of some economic slowing, the Federal Reserve decided today against lowering interest rates, which would have made borrowing less costly at the start of the holiday shopping season.Analysts generally attributed the decision to the Federal Government's stalemated budget negotiations and to the absence of compelling evidence that the economy needs to be spurred, though it is less robust than during the summer.It looks like they're waiting until some of the uncertainty over fiscal policy and the economy is cleared up,"" said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan. ""It's debatable whether the economy needs any stimulus.""Others disagreed, pointing to weak retail sales and heavy levels of consumer  debt, and to fresh figures released today that showed flat industrial production and subdued inflation in October. Consumer prices were up three-tenths of 1 percent in the month, a bit more than expected, but not enough to bother economists.

The central bank has cut short-term interest rates only once this year, by one-quarter of a percentage point in early July, after a 12-month pre-emptive strike against inflation in which it had doubled the Federal funds rate, the benchmark overnight lending rate for the banking system, to 6 percent.

470,2007-11-01 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed’s monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4.5 percent.Economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance. However, the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction. Today’s action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.The committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth. The committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric S. Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Thomas M. Hoenig, who preferred no change in the federal funds rate at this meeting.In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis-point decrease in the discount rate, to 5 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco.

Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in light trading yesterday, as longer-dated issues outperformed short-term notes and bills for the second consecutive session.Prices of all securities weakened during overnight trading overseas, as market participants took some profits. But the modest declines were erased later, buttressed by a report on April housing activity that showed continued softness in that sector of the economy. Analysts also said traders were encouraged by a drop in commodity prices.''There is definite demand for Treasury securities, especially after they dip to lower price levels,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. Overnight Funds Rate DipsHopes that the Federal Reserve Board might ease monetary policy arose in the afternoon, as the overnight Federal funds rate dipped a bit below the 9 3/4 percent to 9 7/8 percent range it has occupied for the last two months. The funds rate fell as low as 9 5/8 percent during the afternoon before bouncing back to a late quote of 9 11/16 percent. For the third straight day, the Fed did not undertake any open-market operations.

Market participants are particularly sensitive to any possible change in policy because members of the Fed's Open Market Committee began two days of meetings yesterday in Washington. Recent weak economic reports and a sense that inflationary pressures may be easing have helped to push short-term interest rates lower in anticipation of a less restrictive monetary policy.

LEAD: Stock prices fell yesterday after climbing for four consecutive sessions, and the Dow Jones industrial average declined 10.44 points to close at 2,453.45.Stock prices fell yesterday after climbing for four consecutive sessions, and the Dow Jones industrial average declined 10.44 points to close at 2,453.45.Traders said the market's pullback was to be expected after the Dow's recent strong run-up, which included last Friday's 56.82-point surge, the Dow's best one-day move in almost a year. In the four sessions before yesterday's, the Dow gained 92.56 points, reaching 2,463,89, its highest level since the October 1987 market crash.''It's profit taking after a couple of explosive days,'' said Robert H.

Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen. The committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.Today’s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, including measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, downside risks to growth remain.

474,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"UNITED STATES: Fed forecastingThe US Federal Reserve yesterday cut its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points. The Fed has dramatically reduced interest rates in its efforts to stimulate the US economy, even in the context of an inflationary environment. It has also started to make publicly available distributions of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' forecasts of inflation, unemployment and GDP growth out to three years. This raises the question of whether the FOMC has become an inflation targeter -- and to what extent it will be able to achieve its objectives.The FOMC's summary statistics will be made available four times a year. The first such release accompanied the minutes of the October 2007 FOMC meeting. This is significant for several reasons:Better guidance? The FOMC is providing better guidance to markets in terms of possible macroeconomic outcomes. Whether this is useful depends on whether or not the FOMC is a better forecaster than private agents:•It is known that the Federal Reserve Board staff's Greenbook forecasts outperform private forecasts. Yet the Greenbook is released publicly with a five-year delay. On the other hand, FOMC forecasts are released in a timely manner.•Recent research has shown that Greenbook forecasts are superior to FOMC forecasts. It is thus not clear that FOMC forecasts will provide the best guidance about the macroeconomy.Policy clarity. Fed actions presumably will become easier to anticipate as FOMC members decide on the policy path based on their forecasts of macroeconomic developments. As those forecasts are now known, financial markets can have a better understanding of what FOMC members think they are facing.

Communication compromise. The debate on FOMC communication strategy will leave centre stage for a while. More frequent and longer-term FOMC forecasts are among the recommendations of a committee on FOMC communications chaired by Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman Donald Kohn:•Kohn was known to be against an explicit Fed inflation target. However, last September he said that he was ""relatively more persuaded that inflation targeting helps reduce the variance of inflation expectations.""

•Publishing long-term forecasts is thus a compromise between announcing an inflation target and not providing any more information than under the Greenspan chairmanship.Forecasting behaviour? Most importantly, FOMC long-term inflation forecasts are fundamentally different from private sector forecasts:•Monetary policy usually affects inflation with a lag of three to four quarters, therefore inflation forecasts at horizons longer than this in part are forecasts of Fed behaviour.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates for the sixth time in six months on Tuesday, capping an extraordinary series of measures it has taken to stabilize financial markets. The cut was smaller than investors had been expecting, though, and exposed some signs of a split among policy makers.The central bank lowered its federal funds rate — the rate it charges banks for overnight loans —  by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 2.25 percent, and left the door open to additional rate cuts in the months ahead.Though it was one of the biggest one-day rate cuts in decades, investors had been betting heavily that the Fed would cut its benchmark rate a full percentage point in response to strong evidence that a recession has begun and to the deepening crisis on Wall Street.But two members of the Fed’s policy-making committee dissented, saying they favored an even smaller rate cut, and the policy group as a whole expressed new worries about inflation — a possible argument against aggressive rate cuts.

476,2000-05-17 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 6 1/2 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate to 6 percent.Increases in demand have remained in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply, exerting continued pressure on resources. The committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance.Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

477,2000-05-17 00:00:00,"Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, still believes that his medicine -- higher interest rates -- will reduce the economy's feverish growth. But it appears that the medicine is much weaker than he thought just a year ago, and that much higher doses will be needed to have the desired effect.Last June, when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee raised interest rates for the first of what has now become six times, the committee's minutes reflected a general expectation of ''appreciable moderation in the trend'' of economic growth in the months ahead.At that time, a divided Fed decided not to signal that there would be future interest rate increases. This was despite warnings by some members that the lack of such a signal could be interpreted as meaning that no further raises in rates were likely. In fact, that exact interpretation took hold as financial markets rallied on the news.Since June, the economy has behaved in a way that few if any would have expected. The boom has continued, and economic growth has accelerated. Housing starts, industrial production and inflation are up, while unemployment is down.

Yesterday, when the Fed announced its sixth rate increase -- and the first in that series to bolster the federal funds rate target by half a percentage point, not the usual quarter-point rise -- it went out of its way to warn that it was still worried about inflation, and to hint that more increases would come unless and until the economy began to cool.

With the forces restraining the economy starting to diminish, and with the long-term prospects for productivity growth remaining favorable and monetary policy accommodative, the outlook for economic recovery has become more promising.The degree of any strength in business capital and household spending, however, is still uncertain. Hence, the committee continues to believe that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.

The money, secured by Representative Nita M. Lowey, could be used to equip a county laboratory for identification of biological agents or train emergency workers to deal with casualties. Ms. Lowey, a Democrat who represents most of the county, plans a formal announcement today. The National Association of Counties released a survey on Tuesday in which 90 percent of the county governments questioned said they were unprepared to handle biological or chemical attacks.(AP)MANHATTAN: FIRE DAMAGES 2 BUILDINGSA four-alarm fire caused by a fallen candle displaced several families and damaged two Upper Manhattan apartment buildings early yesterday morning, a Fire Department official said. Four firefighters suffered minor injuries, and a resident with chest pains was taken to the hospital. Heat from the fire, which started about 3 a.m., roused Efrain Pizarro, 35, an off-duty firefighter who lives on the second floor of the building, at 117 East 101st Street. Mr. Pizarro ""went around the building and got everyone out,"" said Firefighter Louis Giaconelli, a department spokesman. The fire took about an hour to control and was ruled accidental.

Tara Bahrampour (NYT)NEW JERSEY MONROE: 3 STUDENTS SICKENEDThree teenage boys were hospitalized yesterday morning after officials said they drank a clear liquid, drove to school, vomited and then lost consciousness in class. Notices were immediately sent to the district's 5,100 students to quell a rumor that an environmental hazard had hospitalized scores of students. The teenagers, students at Williamstown High School in Monroe Township, were taken to nearby hospitals. They are 18, 17 and 15, and their names were not released. John Hagerty, a State Police spokesman, said it would take about a week to analyze the liquid. Continue reading the main story",Metro Briefing,2002-01-30,The New York Times
480,2007-05-10 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed’s monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged.The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at  5  1/4 percent.Economic growth slowed in the first part of this year and the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.Core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.In these circumstances, the committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Cathy E. Minehan; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole and Kevin M. Warsh.

When Anya Bailey developed an eating disorder after her 12th birthday, her mother took her to a psychiatrist at the University of Minnesota who prescribed a powerful antipsychotic drug called Risperdal.Created for schizophrenia, Risperdal is not approved to treat eating disorders, but increased appetite is a common side effect and doctors may prescribe drugs as they see fit. Anya gained weight but within two years developed a crippling knot in her back. She now receives regular injections of Botox to unclench her back muscles. She often awakens crying in pain.Isabella Bailey, Anya’s mother, said she had no idea that children might be especially susceptible to Risperdal’s side effects. Nor did she know that Risperdal and similar medicines were not approved at the time to treat children, or that medical trials often cited to justify the use of such drugs had as few as eight children taking the drug by the end.Just as surprising, Ms. Bailey said, was learning that the university psychiatrist who supervised Anya’s care received more than $7,000 from 2003 to 2004 from Johnson & Johnson, Risperdal’s maker, in return for lectures about one of the company’s drugs.

482,1997-12-17 00:00:00,"Last Thursday, as a Federal district judge was ruling that the Microsoft Corporation had violated a 1995 antitrust agreement with the Justice Department, attorneys general from some of the nation's most populous states were concluding a secret three-day meeting in Chicago to assess their own strategy for a possible antitrust action against Microsoft's marketing practices.The meeting -- coupled with government investigations under way in Europe and Asia, a continuing private antitrust suit and the specter of hearings in the United States Senate -- suggest that the world's most powerful software company could soon find that it has become a Gulliver enmeshed in Lilliputian legal entanglements around the globe.''Microsoft is going to find that it is looking at a shotgun with multiple barrels,'' said Gary Reback, a lawyer with the firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rasati in Palo Alto, Calif., which represents a number of Microsoft's competitors.Nine states have subpoenaed information from Wilson, Sonsini, Mr. Reback said. Among the states that participated in the strategy session last week, he said, were Florida, Illinois, Minnesota and New York.

483,1997-02-06 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that a recent surge in economic growth will moderate and leave wage and price inflation under control.The decision continues a yearlong pattern in which the Fed has kept monetary policy on hold as the economy has accelerated, slowed and then accelerated again. The Fed's last move was on Jan. 31, 1996, when it reduced its Federal funds target rate, its overnight loan rate for banks, to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, and its discount rate for loans to financial institutions to 5 percent from 5.25 percent.Because the Fed's decision today not to raise rates had been widely anticipated for weeks in the financial markets, it was not a powerful enough dose of good news to stop a technology-led swoon in stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 86.58 points, to 6,746.90.Since last summer the Fed's official policy has been a ''bias'' toward  tightening, a way of signaling that it will raise rates at the first compelling evidence that inflation might be taking root. Economists said they expected that the Fed kept the policy in place today, although it would not disclose its decision until after the next meeting of its policy-making body on March 25.

By keeping rates unchanged, the Fed is once again waiting for further evidence of whether growth will slow sufficiently to keep wages from spiking up and setting off an upward spiral in inflation. Despite the economy's torrid 4.7 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter, wage increases have remained muted and there is almost no sign of rising inflation.

The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.85 percent, from 5.86 percent on Tuesday.The Federal Open Market Committee, at its first meeting of the year, kept the Federal funds rate at 5.50 percent, where the short-term benchmark rate has remained for almost a year.What was not disclosed at the end of the two-day meeting is whether committee members have shifted to a neutral stance from their previous position of maintaining a bias toward raising rates. But given the prevailing evidence of benign inflation and the expected economic slowdown due to Asia's financial crisis, bond market analysts said such a change would not surprise them.

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders reached a compromise Wednesday that would allow New York City to build a much disputed garbage incinerator in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But in doing so, they imposed new hurdles that could slow the project or make it more expensive.The agreement, which will partly exempt the incinerator from strict air-pollution regulations, left both its proponents and critics claiming victory.The compromise came late Wednesday afternoon, as the Legislature rushed to close an extended 1993 session. In a flurry of activity, dozens of bills that had languished in what has been a slow and largely unproductive year came under last-minute consideration. New Hurdles for CityLater Wednesday, negotiators for Mr. Cuomo, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican, were trying to wrap up several major bills before daybreak today, when the lawmakers were hoping to adjourn until the fall.

488,1997-08-20 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, continuing a remarkable economic experiment in which the central bank has kept interest rates low despite shrinking unemployment and unusually strong economic growth.Today's meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee was the third consecutive time that the central bank has passed up a chance to raise short-term interest rates. The last increase in the key short-term rate that the Fed controls came in March, a quarter-point rise, to 5.50 percent.The Fed's action today was no surprise. A wide variety of recent economic measurements have shown that inflation remains at barely noticeable levels, below an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of the year. That is the lowest inflation rate since the early 1960's, and wholesale prices have declined this year, the first time that has happened in more than four decades.But the Federal Reserve's job is to anticipate economic trends and to act on such assumptions months in advance. So its decision today to hold its fire may only spur arguments over whether it is missing signs that wages and prices will increase toward the end of this year or in the beginning of 1998.

The Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting committee met here today without changing short-term rates, the latest sign the central bankers think that the United States economy is settling down to steady growth with low inflation.The policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, issued a characteristically brief statement at the end of the meeting, which was the first since the panel raised rates by half a percentage point on Feb. 1.""The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 1:15 P.M.,"" said Joseph R.

""There is no further announcement.""Stock and bond markets were already down slightly before Mr. Coyne's statement shortly after 2 P.M., and edged down a little further. The stock markets later recovered and closed little changed over all.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 2 percent.The terrorist attacks have significantly heightened uncertainty in an economy that was already weak. Business and household spending as a consequence are being further damped. Nonetheless, the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate.The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco.
