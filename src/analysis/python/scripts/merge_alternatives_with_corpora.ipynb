that the committee expects inflation to moderate , but the outlook is uncertain ; and that , although downside risks to growth remain , upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern .', ' futures and options quotes as well as', ' the desk ’s survey of primary dealers suggest that market participants do not expect any change in policy until the third quarter of next year .', ' investors read the statement released in august as consistent with an outlook for unchanged policy , so alternative b , which is very similar , would probably not lead them to revise their views .', ' market participants will note the shift in focus of the discussion to the weaker economic activity in the current quarter , but they will probably take more direction from the forward - looking parts of the statement , which are unchanged .   in sum , short- and longer - term interest rates , equity prices , and the exchange value of the dollar would probably be little changed in response to an announcement along the lines of alternative b .'], 'c': [' if the committee both thinks that it is important that it be seen to be responding to the continued high levels of inflation and has fairly high confidence in the resilience of financial markets and economic activity , it may prefer to tighten policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in alternative c .   pce inflation in the third quarter is projected to be its highest since the first quarter of 1990 – and above 2 percent for its eleventh consecutive quarter – and some measures of longer - term inflation expectations remain above their levels of recent years .   against this backdrop , the committee may feel that failing to tighten policy could lead market participants and households to question its commitment to price stability , as in the “ unanchored inflation expectations ” alternative scenario in the greenbook .', ' moreover , most simple policy rules call for a federal funds rate that is considerably above its current level ( chart 8) .', ' although financial market conditions remain strained , members may judge that the financial situation is being adequately addressed class', ' i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 31 of 41 by the various measures that the federal reserve has put in place to support market liquidity and by the treasury', ' ’s actions to stabilize fannie mae and freddie mac .', ' as a result , the committee may see the slowdown in growth as transitory , along the lines of the “ financial rebound ” greenbook alternative scenario , and be concerned that holding the federal funds rate at its current level would impart excessive momentum to the economy going forward , undercutting efforts to bring inflation down .', '-- the inflation paragraph in alternative c indicates that “ inflation has remained high . ”', ' market participants are very confident in their outlook for no change in policy at this meeting and would be quite surprised by the adoption of alternative c .', ' the expected trajectory of the federal funds rate for the next several months would likely be marked up at least 25 basis points , and might move up further if investors thought the committee was more likely to raise rates going forward .', ' other short- term interest rates would rise accordingly .', ' longer - term rates would probably increase as well .', ' inflation compensation would likely decline a bit , as investors concluded that the committee was taking a more aggressive stance toward inflation .', ' equity prices would fall , perhaps sharply , while the exchange value of the dollar would probably class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 32 of 41 appreciate .', ' the policy surprise , along with the potentially large and unexpected movements in asset prices , would likely intensify strains in financial markets , perhaps significantly .'], 'd': []}\n"
