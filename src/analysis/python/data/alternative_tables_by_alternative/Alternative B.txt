The evidence accumulated over the
intermeeting period indicates that labor
market conditions continue to
improve. Although output growth has
moderated in recent months, the
economy appears poised to expand at
a solid pace going forward absent
significant further increases in energy
prices.

Recent inflation data have been
somewhat elevated, though a portion
of the rise in prices evidently reflects
transitory factors.

Output appeared poised to continue
growing at a good pace before the tragic
toll of Hurricane Katrina. The
widespread devastation in the Gulf
region, the associated dislocation of
economic activity, and the boost to
energy prices imply that spending,
production, and employment will be set
back in the near term. Moreover, the
disruption to the production and refining
infrastructure has elevated premiums for
energy products and may add to market
volatility

While these unfortunate developments
have increased uncertainty about near-
term economic performance, it is the
Committee’s view that they do not pose a
more persistent threat. Rather, remaining
monetary policy accommodation, coupled
with robust underlying growth in
productivity, is providing ongoing
support to economic activity.

Higher energy and other costs have
the potential to add to inflation
pressures. However, core inflation
has been relatively low in recent

The slowing of the growth of real GDP in
the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to
have reflected temporary or special
factors. Economic growth has rebounded
in the current quarter, and the underlying
pace of expansion appears to be solid.

As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy
and other commodities has had only a
modest effect on core inflation, ongoing
productivity gains have held the growth of
unit labor costs in check, and inflation
expectations remain contained. Still,
increases in resource utilization, in
combination with the elevated prices of
energy and other commodities, have the
potential to add to inflation pressures
going forward.

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to raise its target for the
federal funds rate by 25 basis points to
5 percent.

Economic growth rebounded to nearly a
5 percent annual rate in the first quarter.
The Committee sees growth as likely to
moderate toward a more sustainable
pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling
of the housing market, other lagged
responses to previous rate increases, and
the effects of energy price increases.

As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy
and other commodities appears to have
had only a modest effect on core
inflation, and ongoing productivity gains
have helped to hold the growth of unit
labor costs in check. The Committee
expects core inflation to remain
contained. However, the recent climb in
energy and other commodity prices, an
apparent slight rise in inflation
expectations, and possible increases in
resource utilization have the potential to
add to inflation pressures.

To keep the risks to the attainment of
both sustainable economic growth and
price stability roughly in balance, some
further policy firming may be needed.
The Committee judges that any
additional firming is likely to be modest.
However, the extent and timing of any
such firming will depend importantly on
the evolution of the economic outlook as
implied by incoming information.

In any event, the Committee will
respond to changes in economic
prospects as needed to support the
attainment of its objectives.


The Federal Open Market Committee

Recent indicators suggest that
economic growth is moderating from
its quite strong pace earlier this year.

Readings on core inflation have been
elevated in recent months. Ongoing
productivity gains have held down the
rise in unit labor costs, and inflation
expectations remain contained.
However, the high levels of resource
utilization and of the prices of energy
and other commodities have the
potential to sustain inflation pressures.

Although the moderation in the
growth of aggregate demand should
help to contain inflation pressures, the
Committee judges that the risks to the
attainment of price stability remain
tilted to the upside. The extent and
timing of any further policy action will

Readings on core inflation have been

to the pass-through of increased energy

Although the Committee expects
inflation pressures to diminish gradually,

The Federal Open Market Committee

Economic growth was moderate during
the first half of the year, but the
tightening of credit conditions has the
potential to intensify the housing
correction and to restrain economic
growth more generally. Today's action
is intended to help forestall some of the
adverse effects on the broader economy
that might otherwise arise from the
disruptions in financial markets and to
promote moderate growth over time.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly this year. However,

Economic growth was solid in the
third quarter, and strains in financial
markets have eased somewhat on
balance. The pace of economic
expansion will likely slow somewhat in
the near term, partly reflecting the
intensification of the housing
correction. But, to date, other sectors
of the economy have proven resilient
and the global economy remains
strong. The Committee anticipates
that the economic expansion will
return to a moderate pace over time,
but sees continuing risks to growth,
notably the potential impact of the
tightening of credit conditions for
some households and businesses.

Readings on core inflation have

However, the Committee judges that

The Federal Open Market Committee

Incoming information suggests that
economic growth is slowing, reflecting

Moreover, strains in financial markets

action, combined with the policy actions
taken earlier, should help promote
moderate growth over time.

Readings on core inflation have

elevated energy and commodity prices,
among other factors, may put upward

developments carefully.

Recent developments, including the
deterioration in financial market
conditions, have increased the

Financial markets remain under
considerable stress, and credit has

information indicates a deepening of
the housing contraction as well as
some softening in labor markets.

The Committee expects inflation to
moderate in coming quarters, but it
will be necessary to continue to

Today’s policy action, combined with
those taken earlier, should help to
promote moderate growth over time
and to mitigate the risks to economic

economic prospects and will act in a
timely manner as needed to address
those risks.


The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 50 basis points

Recent information indicates that the
outlook for economic activity has
weakened further and that downside
risks persist. Growth in consumer
spending has slowed and labor markets
have softened. Financial markets remain
under considerable stress, and the
tightening of credit conditions and the
deepening of the housing contraction
are likely to continue to weigh on
economic growth.

Inflation has been elevated, and some
measures of inflation expectations have
risen. The Committee expects inflation
to moderate in coming quarters,
reflecting a projected leveling-out of
energy and other commodity prices and
an easing of pressures on resource

The Committee judged that a further
reduction in interest rates was
appropriate to foster moderate growth
over time and to mitigate the risks to
economic activity. At this juncture,
some time may be needed to better
assess the effects of the policy actions
taken to date. However, the
Committee remains prepared to act as
needed to promote sustainable
economic growth and price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to keep its target for the

Recent information indicates that overall
economic activity continues to expand, partly
reflecting some firming in household
spending. However, labor markets have
softened further and financial markets
remain under considerable stress. Tight
credit conditions, the ongoing housing
contraction, and the rise in energy prices are
likely to weigh on economic growth over the
next few quarters.

The Committee expects inflation to
moderate later this year and next year.
However, in light of the continued increases
in the prices of energy and some other
commodities and the elevated state of some
indicators of inflation expectations,
uncertainty about the inflation outlook
remains high.

The substantial easing of monetary policy to
date, combined with ongoing measures to
foster market liquidity, should help to
promote moderate growth over time.
Although downside risks to growth remain,
they appear to have diminished somewhat,
and the upside risks to near-term inflation
and inflation expectations have increased.

highly uncertain.

Although downside risks to growth
remain, the upside risks to inflation
are also of significant concern to the
Committee. The Committee will
continue to monitor economic and
financial developments and will act as
needed to promote sustainable
economic growth and price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 25 basis points
to 11⁄4 percent.

The pace of economic activity appears
to have slowed markedly, owing
importantly to a decline in consumer
expenditures. Moreover, the
intensification of financial market
turmoil is likely to exert additional
restraint on spending, partly by further
reducing the ability of households and
businesses to obtain credit.

In light of the declines in the prices of
energy and other commodities and the
weaker prospects for economic
activity, the Committee expects
inflation to moderate in coming
quarters to levels consistent with price
stability.

Policy actions taken in recent weeks,
including coordinated interest rate cuts
by central banks, extraordinary
liquidity measures, and official steps to
strengthen financial systems, should
help over time to improve credit
conditions and promote a return to
moderate economic growth.
Nevertheless, significant downside
risks to growth remain. The
Committee will monitor economic and
financial developments carefully and
will act as needed to promote
sustainable economic growth and price
stability.

agency-guaranteed MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of
providing support to the mortgage and housing markets. The timing and pace
of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such
securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage

the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE
debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS.
