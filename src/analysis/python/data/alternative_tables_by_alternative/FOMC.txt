The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to raise its target for the
federal funds rate by 25 basis points
to 1-1/4 percent.

The Committee believes that, even
after this action, the stance of
monetary policy remains
accommodative and, coupled with
robust underlying growth in
productivity, is providing ongoing
support to economic activity.

The evidence accumulated over the
intermeeting period indicates that
output is continuing to expand at a
solid pace and labor market
conditions have improved.

Although incoming inflation data are
somewhat elevated, a portion of the
increase in recent months appears to
have been due to transitory factors.

The Committee perceives the upside
and downside risks to the attainment
of both sustainable growth and price
stability for the next few quarters are
roughly equal.

With underlying inflation still
expected to be relatively low, the
Committee believes that policy
accommodation can be removed at a
pace that is likely to be measured.
Nonetheless, the Committee will
respond to changes in economic
prospects as needed to fulfill its
obligation to maintain price stability.

The Committee believes that, even
after this action, the stance of
monetary policy remains
accommodative and, coupled with
robust underlying growth in
productivity, is providing ongoing
support to economic activity.

In recent months, output growth has
moderated and the pace of
improvement in labor market
conditions has slowed. This softness
likely owes importantly to the
substantial rise in energy prices. The
economy nevertheless appears
poised to resume a stronger pace of
expansion going forward.

Inflation has been somewhat
elevated this year, though a portion
of the rise in prices seems to reflect
transitory factors.

After moderating earlier this year
partly in response to the substantial
rise in energy prices, output growth
appears to have regained some
traction, and labor market conditions
have improved modestly.

Despite the rise in energy prices,
inflation and inflation expectations
have eased in recent months.

The Committee perceives the upside
and downside risks to the attainment
of both sustainable growth and price

The Committee believes that, even
after this action, the stance of
monetary policy remains
accommodative and, coupled with
robust underlying growth in
productivity, is providing ongoing
support to economic activity.

Output evidently continues to grow
at a solid pace despite the rise in
energy prices, and labor market
conditions continue to improve
gradually.

Though longer-term inflation
expectations remain well contained,
pressures on inflation have picked
up in recent months and pricing
power is more evident. The rise in
energy prices, however, has not
notably fed through to core
consumer prices.

The Committee perceives that, with
appropriate monetary policy action,
the upside and downside risks to the
attainment of both sustainable
growth and price stability should be
kept roughly equal.

With underlying inflation expected
to be contained, the Committee
believes that policy accommodation
can be removed at a pace that is

The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to raise its

25 basis points to 3 percent.

The Committee believes that, even
after this action, the stance of
monetary policy remains
accommodative and, coupled with
robust underlying growth in
productivity, is providing ongoing
support to economic activity.

Recent data suggest that the solid
pace of spending growth has slowed
somewhat, partly in response to the
earlier increases in energy prices.
Labor market conditions, however,
apparently continue to improve
gradually.

Pressures on inflation have picked
up in recent months and pricing
power is more evident. Longer-term

Aggregate spending, despite
high energy prices, appears to have
strengthened since late winter, and
labor market conditions continue

The Federal Open Market Committee decided
today to raise its target for the federal funds
rate by 25 basis points to 33⁄4 percent.

Output appeared poised to continue growing at a
good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane
Katrina. The widespread devastation in the Gulf
region, the associated dislocation of economic
activity, and the boost to energy prices imply that
spending, production, and employment will be set
back in the near term. In addition to elevating
premiums for some energy products, the disruption
to the production and refining infrastructure may
add to energy price volatility.
While these unfortunate developments have
increased uncertainty about near-term economic
performance, it is the Committee's view that they
do not pose a more persistent threat. Rather,
monetary policy accommodation, coupled with
robust underlying growth in productivity, is
providing ongoing support to economic activity.

Higher energy and other costs have the
potential to add to inflation pressures.
However, core inflation has been relatively
low in recent months, and longer-term
inflation expectations remain contained.

The Committee perceives that, with
Assessment

appropriate monetary policy action, the upside
and downside risks to the attainment of both

The Federal Open Market Committee decided
today to raise its target for the federal funds
rate by 25 basis points to 4 percent.

Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related
disruptions in economic activity have
temporarily depressed output and
employment. However, monetary policy
accommodation, coupled with robust
underlying growth in productivity, is providing
ongoing support to economic activity that will
likely be augmented by planned rebuilding in
the hurricane-affected areas.

The cumulative rise in energy and other costs
has the potential to add to inflation pressures;
however, core inflation has been relatively low
in recent months and longer-term inflation
expectations remain contained.

The Committee perceives that, with
appropriate monetary policy action, the upside
and downside risks to the attainment of both

The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to raise its
target for the federal funds rate by
25 basis points to 41⁄4 percent.

Despite elevated energy prices and
hurricane-related disruptions, the
expansion in economic activity
appears solid.

Core inflation has stayed relatively
low in recent months and longer-
term inflation expectations remain
contained. Nevertheless, possible
increases in resource utilization as
well as elevated energy prices have
the potential to add to inflation
pressures.

The Committee judges that some
further measured policy firming is
likely to be needed to keep the risks
to the attainment of both sustainable
economic growth and price stability
roughly in balance.

In any event, the Committee will
respond to changes in economic
prospects as needed to foster these
objectives.

The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to raise
its target for the federal funds
rate by 25 basis points to
4-3/4 percent.

The slowing of the growth of
real GDP in the fourth quarter of
2005 seems largely to have
reflected temporary or special
factors. Economic growth has
rebounded strongly in the current
quarter but appears likely to
moderate to a more sustainable
pace.

As yet, the run-up in the prices
of energy and other commodities
appears to have had only a
modest effect on core inflation,
ongoing productivity gains have
helped to hold the growth of unit
labor costs in check, and inflation
expectations remain contained.
Still, possible increases in
resource utilization, in
combination with the elevated
prices of energy and other
commodities, have the potential
to add to inflation pressures.

The Committee judges that
some further policy firming may
be needed to keep the risks to
the attainment of both
sustainable economic growth and

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to raise its target for the
federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5
percent.

Economic growth has been quite
strong so far this year. The Committee
sees growth as likely to moderate to a
more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a
gradual cooling of the housing market
and the lagged effects of increases in
interest rates and energy prices.

As yet, the run-up in the prices of
energy and other commodities appears
to have had only a modest effect on core
inflation, ongoing productivity gains
have helped to hold the growth of unit
labor costs in check, and inflation
expectations remain contained. Still,
possible increases in resource utilization,
in combination with the elevated prices
of energy and other commodities, have
the potential to add to inflation
pressures.

The Committee judges that some
further policy firming may yet be needed
to address inflation risks but emphasizes
that the extent and timing of any such
firming will depend importantly on the
evolution of the economic outlook as
implied by incoming information.

In any event, the Committee will
respond to changes in economic
prospects as needed to support the
attainment of its objectives.


The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep its
target for the federal funds rate at
51⁄4 percent.

Economic growth has moderated
from its quite strong pace earlier this
year, partly reflecting a gradual
cooling of the housing market and
the lagged effects of increases in
interest rates and energy prices.

Readings on core inflation have
been elevated in recent months, and
the high levels of resource
utilization and of the prices of
energy and other commodities have
the potential to sustain inflation
pressures. However, inflation
pressures seem likely to moderate
over time, reflecting contained
inflation expectations and the
cumulative effects of monetary
policy actions and other factors
restraining aggregate demand.

Nonetheless, the Committee
judges that some inflation risks
remain. The extent and timing of
any additional firming that may be
needed to address these risks will
depend on the evolution of the
outlook for both inflation and
economic growth, as implied by
incoming information.
The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep its
target for the federal funds rate at
51⁄4 percent.

The moderation in economic
growth appears to be continuing,
partly reflecting a cooling of the
housing market.

Readings on core inflation have
been elevated, and the high levels of
resource utilization and of the prices
of energy and other commodities
have the potential to sustain
inflation pressures. However,
inflation pressures seem likely to
moderate over time, reflecting
reduced impetus from energy prices,
contained inflation expectations,
and the cumulative effects of
monetary policy actions and other
factors restraining aggregate
demand.

Nonetheless, the Committee

The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep its

Economic growth has slowed
over the course of the year, partly
reflecting a substantial cooling of the
housing market. Although recent
indicators have been mixed, the
economy seems likely to expand at a
moderate pace on balance over
coming quarters.

Readings on core inflation have

The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep its
target for the federal funds rate at

Recent indicators have suggested
somewhat firmer economic growth,
and some tentative signs of
stabilization have appeared in the
housing market. Overall, the
economy seems likely to expand at a
moderate pace over coming quarters.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly in recent months,
and inflation pressures seem likely to
moderate over time. However, the
high level of resource utilization has

Recent indicators have been mixed
and the adjustment in the housing
sector is ongoing. Nevertheless, the
economy seems likely to continue to
expand at a moderate pace over
coming quarters.

Recent readings on core inflation
have been somewhat elevated.
Although inflation pressures seem
likely to moderate over time, the
high level of resource utilization has
the potential to sustain those
pressures.

In these circumstances, the
Committee’s predominant policy
concern remains the risk that
inflation will fail to moderate as
expected. Future policy adjustments
will depend on the evolution of the
outlook for both inflation and
economic growth, as implied by
incoming information.

The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep its
target for the federal funds rate at
51⁄4 percent.

Economic growth slowed in the first
part of the year and the adjustment
in the housing sector is ongoing.
Nevertheless, the economy seems
likely to expand at a moderate pace
over coming quarters.

Core inflation remains somewhat
elevated. Although inflation
pressures seem likely to moderate
over time, the high level of resource
utilization has the potential to
sustain those pressures.

In these circumstances, the
Committee’s predominant policy
concern remains the risk that
inflation will fail to moderate as
expected. Future policy adjustments
will depend on the evolution of the
outlook for both inflation and
economic growth, as implied by

The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep
its target for the federal funds rate
at 51⁄4 percent.

Economic growth appears to have
been moderate during the first half
of this year, despite the ongoing
adjustment in the housing sector.
The economy seems likely to
continue to expand at a moderate
pace over coming quarters.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly in recent
months. However, a sustained
moderation in inflation pressures
has yet to be convincingly
demonstrated. Moreover, the high
level of resource utilization has the
potential to sustain those
pressures.

In these circumstances, the
Committee’s predominant policy
concern remains the risk that
inflation will fail to moderate as
expected. Future policy
adjustments will depend on the
evolution of the outlook for both
inflation and economic growth, as
implied by incoming information.

The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to lower
its target for the federal funds rate
50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.

Economic growth was moderate
during the first half of the year,
but the tightening of credit
conditions has the potential to
intensify the housing correction
and to restrain economic growth
more generally. Today’s action is
intended to help forestall some of
the adverse effects on the broader
economy that might otherwise
arise from the disruptions in
financial markets and to promote
moderate growth over time.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly this year.
However, the Committee judges
that some inflation risks remain,
and it will continue to monitor
inflation developments carefully.

Developments in financial markets
since the Committee’s last regular
meeting have increased the
uncertainty surrounding the
economic outlook. The
Committee will continue to assess
the effects of these and other
developments on economic
prospects and will act as needed to
foster price stability and
sustainable economic growth.
The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to lower
its target for the federal funds rate
25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent.

Economic growth was solid in the
third quarter, and strains in financial
markets have eased somewhat on
balance. However, the pace of
economic expansion will likely slow
in the near term, partly reflecting the
intensification of the housing
correction. Today’s action,
combined with the policy action
taken in September, should help
forestall some of the adverse effects
on the broader economy that might
otherwise arise from the disruptions
in financial markets and promote
moderate growth over time.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly this year, but
recent increases in energy and
commodity prices, among other
factors, may put renewed upward
pressure on inflation. In this
context, the Committee judges that
some inflation risks remain, and it
will continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully.

The Committee judges that, after
this action, the upside risks to
inflation roughly balance the
downside risks to growth. The
Committee will continue to assess
the effects of financial and other
developments on economic
prospects and will act as needed to
foster price stability and sustainable
economic growth.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for the
federal funds rate 75 basis points to 2-
1/4 percent.

Recent information indicates that the
outlook for economic activity has
weakened further. Growth in consumer
spending has slowed and labor markets
have softened. Financial markets
remain under considerable stress, and
the tightening of credit conditions and
the deepening of the housing
contraction are likely to weigh on
economic growth over the next few
quarters.

Inflation has been elevated, and some
indicators of inflation expectations have
risen. The Committee expects inflation
to moderate in coming quarters,
reflecting a projected leveling-out of
energy and other commodity prices and
an easing of pressures on resource
utilization. Still, uncertainty about the
inflation outlook has increased. It will
be necessary to continue to monitor
inflation developments carefully.

Today’s policy action, combined with
those taken earlier, including measures
to foster market liquidity, should help to
promote moderate growth over time
and to mitigate the risks to economic
activity. However, downside risks to
growth remain. The Committee will act
in a timely manner as needed to
promote sustainable economic growth
and price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for the
federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2
percent.

Recent information indicates that
economic activity remains weak.
Household and business spending has
been subdued and labor markets have
softened further. Financial markets
remain under considerable stress, and
tight credit conditions and the deepening
housing contraction are likely to weigh on
economic growth over the next few
quarters.

Although readings on core inflation
have improved somewhat, energy and
other commodity prices have increased,
and some indicators of inflation
expectations have risen in recent months.
The Committee expects inflation to
moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a
projected leveling-out of energy and other
commodity prices and an easing of
pressures on resource utilization. Still,
uncertainty about the inflation outlook
remains high. It will be necessary to
continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully.

The substantial easing of monetary
policy to date, combined with ongoing
measures to foster market liquidity,
should help to promote moderate growth
over time and to mitigate risks to
economic activity. The Committee will
continue to monitor economic and
financial developments and will act as
needed to promote sustainable economic
growth and price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to keep its target for the federal
funds rate at 2 percent.

Recent information indicates that overall
economic activity continues to expand, partly
reflecting some firming in household
spending. However, labor markets have
softened further and financial markets remain
under considerable stress. Tight credit
conditions, the ongoing housing contraction,
and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh
on economic growth over the next few
quarters.

The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year.
However, in light of the continued increases in
the prices of energy and some other
commodities and the elevated state of some
indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty
about the inflation outlook remains high.

The substantial easing of monetary policy
to date, combined with ongoing measures to
foster market liquidity, should help to promote
moderate growth over time. Although
downside risks to growth remain, they appear
to have diminished somewhat, and the upside
risks to inflation and inflation expectations
have increased. The Committee will continue
to monitor economic and financial
developments and will act as needed to
promote sustainable economic growth and
price stability.
The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep
its target for the federal funds rate
at 2 percent.

Economic activity expanded in
the second quarter, partly reflecting
growth in consumer spending and
exports. However, labor markets
have softened further and financial
markets remain under considerable
stress. Tight credit conditions, the
ongoing housing contraction, and
elevated energy prices are likely to
weigh on economic growth over the
next few quarters. Over time, the
substantial easing of monetary
policy, combined with ongoing
measures to foster market liquidity,
should help to promote moderate
economic growth.

Inflation has been high, spurred
by the earlier increases in the prices
of energy and some other
commodities, and some indicators
of inflation expectations have been
elevated. The Committee expects
inflation to moderate later this year
and next year, but the inflation
outlook remains highly uncertain.

Although downside risks to
growth remain, the upside risks to
inflation are also of significant
concern to the Committee. The
Committee will continue to monitor
economic and financial
developments and will act as needed
to promote sustainable economic
growth and price stability.
The Federal Open Market
Committee has decided to lower its
target for the federal funds rate 50
basis points to 11⁄2 percent.

The Committee took this action in
light of evidence pointing to a
weakening of economic activity and
a reduction in inflationary pressures.
Incoming economic data suggest
that the pace of economic activity
has slowed markedly in recent
months. Moreover, the
intensification of financial market
turmoil is likely to exert additional
restraint on spending, partly by
further reducing the ability of
households and businesses to obtain
credit.

Inflation has been high, but the
Committee believes that the decline
in energy and other commodity
prices and the weaker prospects for
economic activity have reduced the
upside risks to inflation.

The Committee will monitor
economic and financial
developments carefully and will act
as needed to promote sustainable
economic growth and price stability.
