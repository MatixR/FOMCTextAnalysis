The Federal Open Market Committee decided
today to raise its target for the federal funds rate
by 50 basis points to 1-3/4 percent.

The Committee continues to believe that robust
underlying growth in productivity is providing
ongoing support to economic activity.

The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting
period indicates that output growth has
moderated but appears poised to resume a
stronger pace going forward and that labor
market conditions continue to improve.

Although a portion of the rise in inflation this
year appears to have been due to transitory
factors, continuing and substantial increases in
energy prices are putting persistent upward
pressure on costs and overall prices.

In current circumstances, the Committee believes
that the existing degree of policy accommodation, if
sustained over the next few quarters, could foster
economic growth that is more likely to be above
than below its long-run sustainable pace. Similarly,
with respect to the Committee’s goal of price
stability, such an unchanged policy stance implies
greater risks to the upside than the downside.

next few quarters to be roughly equal that, if
the current target for the federal funds rate
were maintained for the next few quarters, it
is more likely than not that output would

The Federal Open Market Committee

Economic growth rebounded to nearly
a 5 percent annual rate in the first
quarter. The Committee sees growth as
likely to moderate somewhat in coming
quarters, though data confirming a
slowing in growth have been sparse.

As yet, the run-up in the prices of
energy and other commodities appears
to have had only a modest effect on
core inflation, and ongoing productivity
gains have helped to hold the growth of
unit labor costs in check. However, the
recent climb in energy and other
commodity prices, an apparent rise in
inflation expectations, and possible
increases in resource utilization have the
potential to add to inflation pressures.

The Committee judges that, with this
action, the risks to the attainment of
both sustainable economic growth and
price stability are roughly in balance.

The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to raise its
target for the federal funds rate by

Recent indicators suggest that
economic growth is moderating
from its quite strong pace earlier
this year, but the level of resource
utilization remains relatively high.

Ongoing productivity gains and
contained inflation expectations
should restrain inflation going
forward. However, recent readings
on core inflation have been
elevated, which the Committee
views as unwelcome.

In order to foster price stability and
sustainable economic growth, the
Committee seeks a medium-term
decline in core inflation from its
recent elevated levels. The
Committee judges that some further
policy firming may yet be needed to
accomplish this outcome. The
extent and timing of any such
firming will depend importantly on

Economic growth was moderate during
the first half of the year, but the
tightening of credit conditions has the
potential to intensify the housing
correction and to restrain economic
growth more generally. Today's action
is intended to help forestall some of the
adverse effects on the broader economy
that might otherwise arise from the
disruptions in financial markets and to
promote moderate growth over time.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly this year. However,
the Committee judges that some
inflation risks remain, and it will

Economic growth was solid in the

financial markets have eased
somewhat on balance, reducing the
downside risks to growth. Though
incoming indicators point to some
near-term slowing in the pace of
economic expansion, the recent easing
of monetary policy should help
promote moderate growth over time.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly this year, but the
high level of resource utilization and
recent increases in energy prices may

risks to inflation roughly balance the
downside risks to growth. Future
policy adjustments will depend on the
outlook for both inflation and

The Federal Open Market Committee

As the Committee had anticipated,
economic growth appears to be slowing,

financial markets have increased in
recent weeks and now pose greater
downside risks to growth, the monetary
policy actions taken earlier are expected
to help promote moderate growth over

Readings on core inflation have

Financial markets remain under
considerable stress, and credit has
tightened further for some businesses
and households. Moreover, recent
information indicates a deepening of
the housing contraction as well as
some softening in labor markets.

The Committee expects inflation to

However, upward pressure on
inflation could result from several
factors, including further increases in
energy, commodity, and other import
prices. Therefore, it will be necessary
to continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully.

Today’s policy action, combined with
those taken earlier, should help
promote moderate growth over time.
However, appreciable downside risks
to growth remain. The Committee
will continue to assess the effects of
financial and other developments on
economic prospects and will act in a
timely manner as needed to address
those risks.
The Federal Open Market Committee

Growth in consumer spending has

tightening of credit conditions and the
deepening of the housing contraction

downside risks to growth remain.

Inflation has been elevated, and upward

have increased. The Committee will
continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully.

The Committee judges that the risks to

particularly in light of stresses in
financial markets. The Committee will
continue to assess the effects of
financial and other developments on
economic prospects and will act in a

evolving risks.
The Federal Open Market Committee

Recent information indicates that
economic activity remains weak.
Household and business spending has
been subdued and labor markets have

remain under considerable stress, and
tight credit conditions and the
deepening housing contraction are
likely to weigh on economic growth
over the next few quarters.

Inflation has been elevated, and some
indicators of inflation expectations
have risen in recent months. The
Committee expects inflation to
moderate in coming quarters, but
uncertainty about the inflation outlook
remains high. It will be necessary to
continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully.

The Committee judges that downside
risks to growth remain but concluded
that more time is needed to better
assess economic prospects and the
effects of the policy actions taken to
date. The Committee will act in a
timely manner as needed to promote
sustainable economic growth and price
stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to raise its target for the
federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2-1/4
percent.

Recent information indicates that overall
economic activity continues to expand,
partly reflecting some firming in household
spending. However, labor markets have
softened further and financial markets
remain under considerable stress. Tight
credit conditions, the ongoing housing
contraction, and the rise in energy prices are
likely to weigh on economic growth over
the next few quarters.

Overall inflation has been elevated, energy
prices have continued to increase, and some
indicators of inflation expectations have
risen further. The Committee expects
inflation to moderate later this year and next
year, partly reflecting today’s policy action.
Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook
remains high. It will be necessary to
continue to monitor inflation developments
carefully.

Future policy adjustments will depend on
the evolution of the outlook for both
inflation and economic growth, as implied
by incoming information on the economy
and financial conditions.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to raise its target for the federal
funds rate 25 basis points to 21⁄4 percent.

Overall economic activity continues to
expand, partly reflecting growth in consumer
spending and exports. However, labor
markets have softened further and financial
markets remain under considerable stress.
Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing
contraction, and elevated energy prices are
likely to weigh on economic growth over the
next few quarters. Nevertheless, the
accommodative stance of monetary policy,
combined with ongoing measures to foster
market liquidity, should help to promote
moderate economic growth.

Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier
increases in the prices of energy and some
other commodities, and some indicators of
inflation expectations have been elevated.
Although the Committee expects inflation to
moderate later this year and next year, the
possibility that inflation may fail to decline as
anticipated is of significant concern.

The Committee took this action to better
balance the upside risks to inflation and the
downside risks to growth. The Committee
will continue to monitor economic and
financial developments and will act as needed
to promote sustainable economic growth and
price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to raise its target for
the federal funds rate 25 basis points
to 21⁄4 percent.

Incoming information suggests that
growth in economic activity has
slowed in recent months, partly
reflecting a softening of household
spending. In addition, labor markets
have weakened further and financial
markets remain under considerable
stress. Tight credit conditions, the
ongoing housing contraction, some
slowing in export growth, and past
increases in energy prices are likely to
weigh on economic growth over the
next few quarters. Nonetheless, the
accommodative stance of monetary
policy, combined with ongoing
measures to foster market liquidity,
should help to promote moderate
economic growth.

Inflation has remained high, and
some indicators of inflation
expectations have been elevated.
Although the Committee expects
inflation to moderate later this year
and next year, the possibility that
inflation may fail to decline as
anticipated is of significant concern.

The Committee took this action to
provide additional assurance that
inflation will abate as desired. The
Committee will continue to monitor
economic and financial developments
and will act as needed to promote
sustainable economic growth and
price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to keep its target for the
federal funds rate at 11⁄2 percent.

Reflecting in part the intensification of
financial market turmoil, the outlook for
economic activity has weakened.
Consumer spending and industrial
production have declined in recent
months. However, policy actions taken
in recent weeks, including coordinated
interest rate cuts by central banks,
extraordinary liquidity measures, and
official steps to strengthen financial
systems, should help over time to
improve credit conditions and promote a
return to moderate economic growth.

Inflation has been high, but the
Committee believes that the declines in
the prices of energy and other
commodities and the weaker prospects
for economic activity have reduced the
upside risks to inflation.

In these circumstances, the Committee’s
primary concern is the downside risks to
growth. The Committee will monitor
economic and financial developments
carefully in light of the recent policy
actions and will act as needed to
promote sustainable economic growth
and price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable
growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee has
established a target for the federal funds rate of 1⁄2 percent. In view of the large
volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve's various liquidity
programs, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to
average somewhat below the 1⁄2 percent target rate. The Committee directs the
Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS during the
intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to the mortgage and
housing markets. The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on
conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of
conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing sector. By the end of
the second quarter of next year, the Desk is expected to purchase up to
$100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-
guaranteed MBS.
