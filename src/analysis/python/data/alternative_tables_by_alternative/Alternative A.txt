The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep
its target for the federal funds rate
at 1-1/4 percent.

The Committee believes that the
accommodative stance of monetary
policy, coupled with robust
underlying growth in productivity, is
providing ongoing support to
economic activity.

The evidence accumulated over the
intermeeting period indicates a
moderation in output growth and
some slowing in the pace of
improvement in labor market
conditions.

Recent inflation data have been
somewhat elevated, though a
portion of the rise in prices
evidently reflects transitory factors.

[Unchanged]

With underlying inflation still
expected to be relatively low, the
Committee believes that policy
accommodation can be removed at
a pace that is likely to be measured.
Nonetheless, the Committee will
respond to changes in economic
prospects as needed to fulfill its
obligation to promote price stability
and sustainable growth.

Although month-to-month movements in
inflation have been volatile of late,
underlying inflation and longer-term inflation
expectations remain well contained.

The Committee perceives the upside and
downside risks to the attainment of both
sustainable growth and price stability for the
next few quarters to be roughly equal that, if
the current target for the federal funds rate
were maintained for the next few quarters, it
is more likely than not that output would
grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and
that inflation pressures would pick up.

The Committee deferred further
policy firming in light of the
uncertainties surrounding the
economic effects of Hurricane
Katrina.

Output appeared poised to
continue growing at a good pace
before the tragic toll of the
hurricane. The widespread
devastation in the Gulf region, the
associated dislocation of economic
activity, and the boost to energy
prices imply that spending,
production, and employment will
be set back in the near term.
Moreover, the disruption to the
production and refining
infrastructure has elevated
premiums for energy products and
may add to market volatility.

Higher energy and other costs have
the potential to add to inflation
pressures. However, core inflation
has been relatively low in recent
months and longer-term inflation
expectations remain well
contained.

Despite elevated energy prices and
hurricane-related disruptions, the
expansion in economic activity
appears solid.

While possible increases in resource
utilization as well as elevated energy
prices have the potential to add to
inflation pressures, core inflation has
stayed relatively low in recent months.
Moreover, longer-term inflation

[Unchanged]
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to keep raise its target for
the federal funds rate unchanged by 25
basis points to at 41⁄2 percent.

The slowing of the growth of real GDP in
the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to
have reflected temporary or special
factors. Economic growth has rebounded
in the current quarter, and the underlying
pace of expansion appears to be solid.
Resource utilization has risen further this
year. Some recent data and anecdotal
information suggest that the housing
market is moderating, which the
Committee believes will contribute to a
slowing in economic growth to a more
sustainable pace.

In addition to increases in resource
utilization, the elevated prices of energy
and other commodities have the potential
to add to inflation pressures going
forward. As yet, however, the run-up in
those prices has had only a modest effect
on core inflation, ongoing productivity
gains have held the growth of unit labor
costs in check, and inflation expectations
remain contained.

The Committee judges that maintaining
the federal funds rate at its current level
will likely keep some further policy
firming may be needed to keep the risks to
the attainment of both sustainable
economic growth and price stability
roughly in balance.

Nevertheless, future policy action will be
determined by the evolution of the
economic outlook as implied by incoming
information.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to keep its target for the federal
funds rate unchanged at 4-3/4 percent.

Economic growth rebounded to nearly a
5 percent annual rate in the first quarter. The
Committee sees growth as likely to moderate
to a sustainable pace, partly reflecting a
gradual cooling of the housing market, other
lagged responses to previous rate increases,
and the effects of energy price increases.

As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and
other commodities appears to have had only
a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing
productivity gains have helped to hold the
growth of unit labor costs in check, and
inflation expectations remain contained. The
Committee expects core inflation to remain
well contained. Still, possible increases in
resource utilization, in combination with the
elevated prices of energy and other
commodities, have the potential to add to
inflation pressures.

Against this backdrop, the Committee
preferred to await additional information
about economic developments before taking
any further action. The Committee sees the
risks to its price stability objective as slightly
to the upside and judges it more likely that its
next policy action will be a tightening rather
than an easing.

In any event, the Committee will respond to
changes in the economic outlook, as implied
by incoming information, as needed to foster
its objectives of sustainable economic growth
and price stability.


The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to leave its target for the
federal funds rate unchanged at 5
percent.

Recent indicators suggest that
economic growth is moderating
considerably from its quite strong pace
earlier this year.

The Committee views the pickup in
core inflation this spring as
unwelcome but likely to be transitory.
Ongoing productivity gains, anchored
inflation expectations, and moderate
economic growth should reduce
inflation in coming quarters.

The Committee judges that the risks to
the attainment of price stability remain
tilted to the upside but recognizes that
the moderation in the growth of
aggregate demand, along with other
forces, should work to contain
inflation going forward. While the
Committee judges that some further
policy firming may yet be needed to
address inflation risks, considerable
uncertainty attends the outlook,
making it prudent to await the
accumulation of additional
information.

[None]
The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep its
target for the federal funds rate at
51⁄4 percent.

Economic growth has moderated
from its quite strong pace earlier this
year, partly reflecting a gradual
cooling of the housing market and
the lagged effects of increases in
interest rates and energy prices.

Readings on core inflation have
been elevated in recent months,
owing in part to pass-through of
increased energy and other
commodity prices. However,
inflation pressures seem likely to
moderate over time, reflecting the
cumulative effects of monetary
policy actions and other factors
restraining aggregate demand,
ongoing productivity gains, and
contained inflation expectations.

In these circumstances, future
policy adjustments will depend on
the evolution of the outlook for
both inflation and economic
growth, as implied by incoming
information.

[None]
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to keep its target for the
federal funds rate at 51⁄4 percent.

The moderation in economic growth
appears to be continuing, in part
reflecting a cooling of the housing
market.

Although core inflation remains elevated,
recent readings have been slightly more
favorable. While some inflation
pressures persist, they seem likely to
moderate over time, reflecting reduced
impetus from energy prices, contained
inflation expectations, and the
cumulative effects of monetary policy
actions and other factors restraining
aggregate demand.

In recent weeks, the upside risks to
inflation appear to have diminished
somewhat and downside risks to growth
have become more significant. In these
circumstances, future policy adjustments
will depend on the evolution of the
outlook for both inflation and economic
growth, as implied by incoming
information.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to keep its target for the

Economic growth appears to have
slowed further in the third quarter, partly
reflecting a cooling of the housing
market. Although there is a risk that the
slowdown in economic growth may
become more pronounced, the economy
seems likely to expand at a moderate
pace.

Readings on core inflation have been
elevated, and the high level of resource
utilization has the potential to sustain
inflation pressures. However, inflation
pressures seem likely to moderate over
time, reflecting reduced impetus from
energy prices, contained inflation
expectations, and the cumulative effects
of monetary policy actions and other
factors restraining aggregate demand.

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to keep its target for the

Economic growth has slowed over the

market. Although that adjustment is
ongoing and could have a more
pronounced effect on growth in coming
quarters than anticipated, the economy
seems likely to expand at a moderate
pace.

Readings on core inflation have

economic growth.

Readings on core inflation have

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for the
federal funds rate 25 basis points to
5 percent.

The economy seems likely to expand at
a moderate pace over coming quarters,
supported in part by gains in personal
income and consumer spending.
However, sluggish business investment
and ongoing weakness in the housing
sector likely will exert a drag on growth.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly in recent months,
and inflation pressures seem likely to

after this policy action. However,
upside risks to inflation remain. Future
policy adjustments will depend on the

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 25 basis points
to 5 percent.

The economy seems most likely to
expand at a moderate pace over
coming quarters. But weakness in
housing and capital spending imply a
significant risk that economic activity
might grow more slowly than
anticipated.

Core inflation remains somewhat
elevated on balance. Although the
high level of resource utilization has
the potential to sustain inflation
pressures, those pressures seem likely
to moderate over time.

In these circumstances, future policy
adjustments will depend on the
evolution of the outlook for both
inflation and economic growth, as

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 25 basis points
to 5 percent.

So far this year, the economy appears
to have grown at a moderate pace and
seems likely to continue to do so over
coming quarters. But ongoing
weakness in the housing sector implies
a significant risk that economic activity
might grow more slowly than
anticipated.

Core inflation has edged lower in
recent months and is expected to
remain moderate over the next year or
so. However, the high level of
resource utilization has the potential to
add to inflation pressures going
forward.

With this policy action, the Committee
judges that the downside risk to
economic growth now roughly
balances the upside risk to inflation.
Future policy adjustments will depend

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 25 basis points
to 5 percent.

Overall economic activity seems likely
to continue to expand at a moderate
pace over coming quarters. However,
increased weakness in the housing
sector, along with reduced availability
and higher cost of credit to some
households and businesses, has raised
the risk that economic activity might
grow less than anticipated.

Readings on core inflation have been
relatively subdued in recent months
and core inflation is expected to be
moderate over coming quarters.
However, the high level of resource
utilization has the potential to sustain
inflation pressures.

After this action, the Committee
judges that the downside risk to
economic growth is roughly balanced
by the upside risk to inflation. Future
policy adjustments will depend on the
evolution of the outlook for both
inflation and economic growth, as
implied by incoming information.
The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to lower
its target for the federal funds rate
50 basis points to 43⁄4 percent.

Tighter credit conditions and the
intensification of the housing
correction appear likely to exert
appreciable restraint on economic
growth. Moreover, the potential for
significant spillovers from credit
market disruptions to business and
household spending poses a risk to
the outlook. Today’s action is
intended to help mitigate the
adverse effects on the broader
economy arising from the
disruptions in financial markets and
to promote moderate growth over
time.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly this year.
However, the Committee judges
that some inflation risks remain, and
it will continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully

Even after today’s action, the
Committee judges that the downside
risks to economic growth outweigh
the upside risks to inflation. Future
policy adjustments will depend on
the outlook for both inflation and
economic growth, as implied by
incoming information.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 25 basis points
to 4-1/2 percent.

Economic growth was solid in the
third quarter, and strains in financial
markets have eased somewhat on
balance. However, the pace of
economic expansion will likely slow
somewhat in the near term, partly
reflecting the intensification of the
housing correction. Today’s action,
combined with the policy action taken
in September, should help forestall
some of the adverse effects on the
broader economy that might otherwise
arise from the disruptions in financial
markets and promote moderate
growth over time.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly this year.
However, the Committee judges that
some inflation risks remain, and it will
continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully.

The Committee judges that the upside
risks to inflation roughly balance the
downside risks to growth. The
Committee will continue to assess the
effects of financial and other
developments on economic prospects
and will act as needed to foster price
stability and sustainable economic
growth.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for the
federal funds rate 50 basis points to
4 percent.

Incoming information suggests that the
housing correction has intensified and
that growth in business and consumer
spending is softening. Moreover, strains
in financial markets have increased in
recent weeks. Overall, the outlook for
the economy has weakened somewhat,
and downside risks to growth have
increased. Today’s action, combined
with the policy actions taken earlier,
should help promote moderate growth
over time.

Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly this year, but
elevated energy and commodity prices,
among other factors, may put upward
pressure on inflation. In this context,
the Committee judges that some
inflation risks remain, and it will
continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully.

The Committee judges that, after this
action, the upside risks to inflation
roughly balance the downside risks to
growth. The Committee will continue to
assess the effects of financial and other
developments on economic prospects
and will act as needed to foster price
stability and sustainable economic
growth.
The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to lower its
target for the federal funds rate 75
basis points to 2-3/4 percent.

Financial markets remain under
considerable stress, and credit has
tightened further for some businesses
and households. Moreover, recent
information indicates a deepening of
the housing contraction as well as
some softening in labor markets.

The Committee expects inflation to
moderate in coming quarters,
reflecting well-anchored inflation
expectations, a projected leveling out
of energy prices, and easing pressures
on resource utilization. However,
further increases in energy and
commodity prices, as well as other
factors, could put upward pressure on
inflation. Therefore, it will be
necessary to continue to monitor
inflation developments carefully.

Today’s policy action, combined
with those taken earlier, should help to
promote moderate growth over time
and to mitigate the risks to economic
activity. However, downside risks to
growth may well remain. The
Committee will continue to assess the
effects of financial and other
developments on economic prospects
to determine whether further action is
needed to address those risks.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for the
federal funds rate 75 basis points to
2-1/4 percent.

Recent information indicates that the
outlook for economic activity has
weakened further and that downside
risks persist. Growth in consumer
spending has slowed and labor markets
have softened. Financial markets remain
under considerable stress, and the
tightening of credit conditions and the
deepening of the housing contraction
are likely to continue to weigh on
economic growth.

Inflation has been elevated, and some
measures of inflation expectations have
risen. The Committee expects inflation
to moderate in coming quarters,
reflecting a projected leveling-out of
energy and other commodity prices and
an easing of pressures on resource
utilization. Still, uncertainty about the
inflation outlook has increased. It will
be necessary to continue to monitor
inflation developments carefully.

Today’s policy action, combined with
those taken earlier, should help to
promote moderate growth over time and

activity. However, the Committee
judges that the downside risks to growth

The Committee will act in a timely
manner as needed to promote
sustainable economic growth and price
stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 50 basis points
to 1-3/4 percent.

Recent information indicates that
economic activity remains weak.
Household and business spending has
been subdued and labor markets have
softened further. Financial markets
remain under considerable stress, and
tight credit conditions and the
deepening housing contraction are
likely to weigh on economic growth
over the next few quarters.

Inflation has been elevated, and some
indicators of inflation expectations
have risen in recent months. The
Committee expects inflation to
moderate in coming quarters,
reflecting a projected leveling-out of
energy and other commodity prices
and an easing of pressures on resource
utilization. Still, uncertainty about the
inflation outlook remains high. It will
be necessary to continue to monitor
inflation developments carefully.

The Committee judged that a further
reduction in interest rates was
appropriate to foster moderate growth
over time and to mitigate the risks to
economic activity. The Committee
will act in a timely manner as needed
to promote sustainable economic
growth and price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for the
federal funds rate 25 basis points to 1-3/4
percent.

Recent information indicates that
economic activity has remained weak in
recent months. Although consumer
spending appears to have firmed
somewhat, residential investment has
continued to contract sharply and labor
markets have softened further. Financial
markets remain under considerable stress,
and tight credit conditions and the
deepening housing contraction are likely
to weigh on economic growth over the
next few quarters.

Although energy prices have increased
further and some indicators of inflation
expectations have risen in recent months,
core inflation has been stable of late. The
Committee expects inflation to moderate
later this year and next year, reflecting a
projected leveling-out of energy prices and
an easing of pressures on resource
utilization. Still, uncertainty about the
inflation outlook remains high. It will be
necessary to continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully.

The substantial easing of monetary policy
to date, combined with ongoing measures
to foster market liquidity, should help to
promote moderate growth over time and
to mitigate risks to economic activity. The
Committee will continue to monitor
economic and financial developments and
will act as needed to promote sustainable
economic growth and price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to keep its target for
the federal funds rate at 2 percent.

Incoming information suggests that
growth in economic activity has
slowed in recent months, partly
reflecting a softening of household
spending. In addition, labor markets
have weakened further and financial
markets remain under considerable
stress. Tight credit conditions, the
ongoing housing contraction, some
slowing in export growth, and past
increases in energy prices are likely to
weigh on economic growth over the
next few quarters. Over time, the
substantial easing of monetary policy,
combined with ongoing measures to
foster market liquidity, should help to
promote moderate economic growth.

Inflation has been high, but the
Committee expects that the recent
decline in energy and other
commodity prices and increased slack
in resource utilization will foster a
moderation of inflation later this year
and next year. Nevertheless, the
inflation outlook remains highly
uncertain.

The downside risks to growth and the
upside risks to inflation are both of
significant concern to the Committee.
The Committee will continue to
monitor economic and financial
developments and will act as needed
to promote sustainable economic
growth and price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 50 basis points
to 1 percent.

The outlook for economic activity has
weakened, and downside risks to
growth appear to have increased.
Consumer spending and industrial
production have declined in recent
months, and slowing economic activity
in many foreign economies is damping
the prospects for U.S. exports.
Moreover, the intensification of
financial market turmoil is likely to
exert additional restraint on spending,
partly by further reducing the ability of
households and businesses to obtain
credit.

In light of the declines in the prices of
energy and other commodities and the
weaker prospects for economic
activity, the Committee expects
inflation to moderate in coming
quarters to levels consistent with price
stability.

The Committee will monitor
economic and financial developments
carefully and will act as needed to
promote sustainable economic growth
and price stability.
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable
growth in output. Over the intermeeting period, the Committee directs the
Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS, with the aim of
providing support to the mortgage and housing markets. The timing and pace
of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such
securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage
markets and the housing sector. By the end of the second quarter of next year,
the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE
debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS. The Committee has
suspended setting a target for the federal funds rate, and it anticipates that the
reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the liquidity
programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in federal funds rates
near zero.
The description of the economic outlook in Alternative A highlights the
weaker-than-expected incoming data, and Alternatives A and B note that global
demand is slowing significantly. Alternatives B and C state that the economic outlook
“remains weak.” Alternative A announces either a $250 billion increase in the Federal
Reserve’s commitment to purchase mortgage-backed securities or the establishment
of a program to purchase $250 billion of longer-term Treasury securities. Alternative
A also highlights the risk that inflation could persist below levels consistent with the
dual objectives of monetary policy; this language might help underscore the
Committee’s intent not to allow inflation to remain below its optimal level in the long
run and thus may help prevent an unwanted further decline in expectations of long-
run inflation. This sentence also may be seen as signaling that the Committee would
adopt further stimulative measures should inflation continue to decline significantly.
