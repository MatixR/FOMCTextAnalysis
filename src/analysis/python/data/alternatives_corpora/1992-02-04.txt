a PAR 16 as noted above , the staff projections for m2 , m3 , and domestic nonfinancial debt all are in the lower portions of their pro- visional 1992 or alternative a ranges , as shown in the table on page 13 and by the dots in charts 3 and 4 .
a PAR 16 this configuration gives consider- ably greater scope for reducing than for raising interest rates should output or inflation deviate from the staff forecast , or should the committee desire a different outcome .
a PAR 16 indeed , given the staff 's appraisal of spending propensities and money demand relationships , attaining the midpoint of the m2 range later this year implies a need for a prompt 3/4 percentage point easing in the federal funds rate , which would be expected to boost nominal gdp growth in 1992 from 5 to 5 - 1/2 percent .

a PAR 16 a s o n d r ccr r room for additional money growth should velocity not increase as much as projected by the staff .
a PAR 16 however , an even larger than projected short- fall in money demand , prompted say by especially aggressive reductions in deposit rates , might tend to breach the lower bound of the range without necessarily signalling weakness in the economy .
a SENT -- in comparison with alternative a , this alter-
a PAR 22 projected monetary growth under the two alternatives is presented below .
a PAR 22 under both alternatives , growth in m2 would strengthen a little over february and march from its december - january pace .
a PAR 22 still , growth in m2 would be fairly sluggish , despite the sharp decline in money market rates near the end of last year ; indeed , m2 velocity likely would move higher in the first quarter under both alternatives , as hold- ers of m2 , responding in part to large declines in offering rates on m2 , continue to shift into capital market instruments and to restrain expan- sion of balance sheets overall .
a PAR 22 m2 would remain in the lower half of its provisional 1992 range through march under both alternatives , but under alternative a would be on a trajectory to move up in its range over the second quarter .
a PAR 22 an expected resumption of rtc resolution activity would reappear as a drag on m2 late in the current quarter and would have an even greater effect on m3 .
a PAR 22 partly as a consequence , m3 would remain in the lower half of its provisional range .
a PAR 22 in contrast , m1 is expected to continue to expand at a double - digit pace , propelled by further large gains in transaction deposits .
a PAR 22 another technical upward adjustment to the borrowing specifica- tion might be called for in march to accommodate rising demands for seasonal credit .
a PAR 22 however , there is more uncertainty than usual about the extent of any pickup in view of the system 's new floating - rate seasonal credit program ; this program reduces the interest - rate incen- tive for banks to favor the seasonal program over other sources of funds .

a PAR 24 short - term interest rates would fall by nearly the 50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate under alternative a . with the funds rate around or perhaps a little below most assessments of the underlying inflation rate , market participants might see such a policy move as unsustainable , thereby limiting the decline in bond rates .
a PAR 24 the greater prospects for calls on corporate bonds and prepay- ments on mortgages would tend to widen spreads on such instruments relative to treasury yields .
a PAR 24 the exchange value of the dollar would fall under this alternative as u.s . money market interest rates drop- ped still further below those of our major trading partners .

a SENT -- 12 under the easier conditions of alternative a , m2 would be expected to be expanding at a percentage point faster pace in march and into the next quarter ; all of the added growth in m2 would occur in m1 , other liquid deposits , and m2 money funds .
a SENT -- under alternative a , growth in m3 would strengthen slightly more , to a 2 - 1/2 per- cent pace .

b SENT -- ( 17 ) if the committee were concerned about this outcome , it might consider alternative b , which would reduce each of the ranges by 1/2 percentage point .
b PAR 23 the markets appear to have built in no policy moves in the period just ahead and thus unchanged reserve market conditions under alternative b should have no effect on interest rates .
b PAR 23 the course of interest rates thus will depend on developments in fiscal policy and the economy .
b PAR 23 in the former area , investors will be assess- ing the implications of emerging agreements for the longer - term fiscal outlook .
b PAR 23 interest rates could move lower should incoming economic indicators , as in the staff economic forecast , continue to point to a flat economy in the near - term and further gains on inflation .
b PAR 23 if rates were to edge down , the dollar might come under some downward pressure , but it is not expected to change significantly under this alternative .

c PAR 13 the table below presents three alternative sets of ranges for growth of money and credit over 1992 .
c PAR 13 ( appendix b gives the ranges and outcomes for money and debt growth since 1979 . )
c PAR 13 native i represents the provisional ranges selected by the committee last july , which are identical to those used in 1991 .
c PAR 13 the staff projec-
c PAR 13 tions for m2 , m3 , and debt all are in the lower halves of these ranges .
c PAR 13 alternative
c PAR 13 ii allows for a tighter policy stance , lowering each of the ranges 1/2 percentage point .
c PAR 13 this alternative could be interpreted as according with the more restrictive longer - run strategy ii of the pre- vious section , which involves money growth 1 percentage point slower than in the extended staff projection .
c PAR 13 any of the alternatives would accommodate strategy iii , but the thrust of that easier strategy would be particularly consistent with the 1/2-percentage - point increase in the ranges that define alternative c .
c PAR 13 an optional targeting approach , which involves linking this year 's target ranges to last year 's ranges rather than to the actual outcomes , also is discussed in this section .
c PAR 18 it would convey a committee intention to make up for some of the monetary shortfall last year in order to ensure a reasonably vigorous economic recovery .
c PAR 18 this alternative would be most appropriate if the committee viewed the odds as still being tilted toward weaker economic performance than desired , or wanted appreciably more growth of nominal gdp growth in 1992 and 1993 than in the greenbook .
c PAR 18 moreover , the higher range would allow for an abatement or even reversal of recent money demand shifts , which would lower m2 velocity relative to the staff forecast .
c PAR 18 with m2 expected to be only a little above the 3 percent lower bound of its alternative c range by march , adopting this alternative would suggest a strong predilection towards a near - term easing of monetary policy .
