a PAR 18 an easing in the federal funds rate to 6 per cent , as envisioned under alternative a , could stimulate a substantial downward adjustment in short - term market rates .
a PAR 18 however , the lower level of rates could not be maintained for long if growth in the aggregates is to be held within the committee 's longer - run ranges .
a PAR 18 thus , interest rates would soon need to begin rising , and would reach levels next year higher than those necessary under alternatives b and c. under alternative a , m-1 is likely to expand at a 6¼ per cent average rate of growth over the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978 , requiring interest rate increases sufficient to hold m-1 growth in the second and third quarters of 1978 to about a 4 per cent annual rate .
a PAR 18 the projected federal funds rate pattern to achieve such a slowdown calls for an increase to around 8¼ per cent in the third quarter of 1978 .
a PAR 18 such rate levels would likely warrant consideration of adjustments to regulation q ceilings by next summer .

b PAR 11 against that background , m-1 growth is likely to pick up in the december - january period .
b PAR 11 given the federal funds rate assump- tions of alternative b -- where the rate is centered at the prevailing level of 6 - 1/2 per cent -- m-1 growth over this period is likely to be alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m-2 alt .

b PAR 12 growth in m-2 over the december - january period is likely to be in a 6 - 10 per cent annual rate range under alternative b . commercial bank savings deposits , after contracting in november , are likely to resume modest growth over the period , even though market yields will remain above rate ceilings on such deposits , as the most interest sensitive holders have probably shifted to other instruments .
b PAR 12 small denomination time deposits with maturities in excess of 4 years , whose rates are still above those on marketable securities of com- parable maturity , are also expected to grow moderately in the december- january period .
b PAR 12 as in october - november , however , most of the expansion in the interest bearing component of m-2 is likely to occur in large denomination time deposits not subject to interest rate ceilings .
b PAR 14 if the federal funds rate remains near its present 6 per cent level over the inter - meeting period , as envisioned under alternative b , short - term rates probably will remain fairly near their current levels .
b PAR 14 credit demands are not likely to exert upward pressures on short - term rates in the weeks immediately ahead .
b PAR 14 the treasury is not expected to expand the supply of bills until late january or early february .
b PAR 14 in private short - term markets , banks are likely to issue a sizable amount of new large , negotiable cd 's in coming weeks , though the amount issued will probably drop below the exceptional volume of the fourth quarter , as other deposit inflows pick - up somewhat and loan demands moderate .

c PAR 17 in light of the recent moderation in the growth of the monetary aggregates , an increase in the federal funds rate to the 7 per cent mid - point of the alternative c range over the next few weeks would probably surprise market participants and involve a substantial upward adjustment in short rates -- with the 3-month bill rate , for example , rising to about 6½ per cent .
c PAR 17 longer - term rates would also probably be subject to upward pressures , but the large volume of invest- ible funds from insurance companies and pension funds would very likely restrain the net increase in such rates .
c PAR 17 member bank borrowing from the discount window would rise substantially , and pressure for another increase in the discount rate would develop .
