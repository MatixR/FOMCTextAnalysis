a PAR 13 under alternative a , the mid - point of the longer - run growth target for m1 is 7 per cent .
a PAR 13 in order to achieve this more rapid growth , money market conditions would probably have to ease somewhat over the next few weeks , and the funds rate would probably remain below 5 per cent until well into the summer months .
a PAR 13 thereafter , however , interest rates would need to rise , with the federal funds rate probably reaching the 6 per cent area in early 1977 .
a PAR 13 given the expected pattern of market interest rates , interest - bearing deposits would likely remain quite strong into the third quarter , but inflows would begin to slow later on as rates on market instruments became more attractive .
a SENT -- alternative " monetary aggregates " proposals alternative a to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets , [ del : and the sensitive state of foreign exchange markets , ] the committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with [ del : moderate ] substantial growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead .

b SENT -- the ranges shown under alternative b are the same as those adopted in january for the qiv ' 75-qiv ' 76 period .
b SENT -- from the fourth quarter of ' 75 to first quarter of ' 76 , m2 and m3 expanded at annual rates very near the mid - points of the ranges adopted previously ( and shown above under alternative b ) ; thus , continuation of growth near these rates would be associated with qiv ' 76 levels close to those implied by the earlier targets .
b PAR 8 the federal funds rate range of alternative b is centered on the recently prevailing 4¾ per cent level .
b PAR 8 given the bulge in m1 in early april , we expect that such a funds rate would be accompanied by m1 growth in a 5 - 9 per cent , annual rate , range over the april - may period .
b PAR 8 with expansion in time and savings deposits other than large cd 's remaining relatively strong , m2 growth over the same period is likely to be in an 8½-12½ per cent annual rate range .

b PAR 10 while the volume of corporate and municipal bond offerings appears to be dropping off from its exceptional march pace , the forward calendar remains high , and substantial longer - term offerings by the treasury could exert some upward pressure on bond yields .

c PAR 11 in the short - run , however , the impact on m1 and m2 probably would be no more than minor because member banks would respond to the reduced availability of nonborrowed reserves contemplated under this alternative by increasing their borrowing .
c PAR 11 it is possible , though , that a substantial upward adjustment in the treasury bill and other short - term rates would occur in response to signs of a sustained upward movement in the funds rate .
c PAR 11 under these conditions , if short - rates moved well above the 5 per cent passbook ceiling rate , there could be sizable outflows of interest - sensitive funds from savings accounts , particularly those held by businesses and state and local governments .
c PAR 11 this would tend to drop the rate of growth in m2 toward the bottom of the indicated april - may range .
