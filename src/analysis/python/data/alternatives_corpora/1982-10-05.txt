a PAR 17 the funds rate might fall to around 9 to 9 - 1/2 percent , with total reserves rising at an 8 percent annual rate during the final three months of the year .
a PAR 17 at the current discount rate , adjustment ( plus seasonal ) borrowing would fall to frictional levels of $ 150 million or less , and nonborrowed reserves would expand at a 15 percent annual rate .
a PAR 17 the market would come to expect a further drop in the discount rate .

b PAR 10 borrowing from the federal reserve would be around $ 450 million , and nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 9 percent annual rate .
b PAR 12 growth of m2 would also be at a relatively moderate 8 - 1/2 percent pace under alternative b over the last three months of the year .
b PAR 12 expansion in the nontransactions component of m2 may speed up from september , but is likely to remain below the very rapid pace of july and august .
b PAR 12 money market fund growth should remain slow , and some part of the sizable volume of ascs maturing in october might shift to market instruments , particularly municipals , though the staff believes that the bulk will be either rolled over or otherwise remain in m2 .
b PAR 12 1/ no allowance has been made for the effects of legislation requiring didc to establish a ceilingless account for depository institutions that is competitive with money market mutual funds .
b PAR 12 this account must be made available to the public 60 days after date of enactment .
b PAR 12 when it be- comes available , possibly in early december , the new instrument is likely to have a substantial impact on m1 and on the composition and possibly the total of m2 , depending on the exact character of the account or accounts authorized by didc .
b PAR 12 2/ a bulge in m1 related to ascs can not be ruled out for the first week of october , when certificates with a maturity value of $ 25 billion come due .
b PAR 12 some of the proceeds of maturing ascs could be temporarily placed in de- mand deposits or now accounts in the process of being reinvested or used to support consumption .
b PAR 13 bond rates are likely to remain near current levels under alternative b , and could even decline a bit further if investors continue to see little , if any , sign of an economic recovery .
b PAR 13 despite the further reduction in deposit costs at s&ls and msbs -- as higher - cost deposits are rolled over -- thrift hesitancy to commit funds and a leveling off of bond rates is likely to keep mortgage rates from falling much below 15 percent .

c PAR 15 total reserves would be expected to expand at a 2 percent rate over the fourth quarter .
c PAR 15 such reserve and money growth would probably involve a federal funds rate moving rather promptly into the 11 to 11 - 1/2 percent area . assuming no change in the discount rate , borrowing would likely be around $ 1 billion and nonborrowed reserves would show little net change .
