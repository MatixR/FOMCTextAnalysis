a PAR 9 of the alternatives shown , alternative a encompasses the 6 per cent annual growth rate for m1 specified by the committee at its last meeting in its longer - run targets for the first half of ' 75 .
a PAR 9 this alternative also shows a 9¾ per cent growth rate for m2 , slightly higher than the rate specified by the committee last time .
a PAR 9 the projected relationship between m 1 and m2 is changed because a further decline in market interest rates is now assumed to be necessary if the indicated m1 growth rate is to be attained by mid - year , and that should result in larger inflows of consumer - type time and savings deposits .
a PAR 10 given the january shortfall in m1 and the sharply weaker economy now projected by the staff for the first and second quarters of this year , we would expect it to be necessary for the federal funds rate to decline to around the middle of a 4 - 5 per cent range between now and mid - march if the growth in the aggregates as shown under alternative a were to be attained .
a PAR 10 some further decline in the funds rate might be needed by early spring .

b PAR 12 the specifications of alternative b involve attainment of a 6 per cent rate of growth in m1 by september , rather than by mid- year .
b PAR 12 with the target horizon stretched out , interest rates are likely to decline more moderately over the near - term , and the later upward movement is likely to be more delayed and probably less sharp .
b PAR 12 the annual growth rate for m1 over the first half of this year under this alternative would be around 4½ per cent , while m2 would expand at about a 7½ per cent rate .
b PAR 13 further significant declines in the funds rate in the spring may not prove necessary , assuming that gnp is no weaker than projected for the first half of this year and that the sharp expansion in economic activity projected for the third quarter develops .
b PAR 14 private short - term credit demands are expected to remain weak into early spring , but the treasury is likely to borrow an additional $ 15-$18 billion of new cash between now and mid - april .
b PAR 14 the provision of bank reserves and easing of money market conditions needed to sustain growth in the monetary aggregates , as specified in alternative b , should , at least over the near - term , permit the new treasury debt to be absorbed at declining interest rates , though the reductions may be modest .
b PAR 14 the 3-month bill rate could drop by about ½ percentage point to around 5 per cent between now and the next committee meeting .
b PAR 14 given the shift in borrowing demands from private sectors to the treasury , private short - term rates may decline more .
b PAR 14 longer - term rates may show rather modest further declines , however , since corporate and state and local government demands on bond markets are expected to remain sizable .

c PAR 16 under alternative c , the funds rate would be expected to decline to around 6 per cent -- the mid - point of the range shown in paragraph ( 7 --or a little below , between now and the next committee meeting .
c PAR 16 such a decline is probably not much more than the market has already discounted .
c PAR 16 as a result , interest rates may decline little further over the next few weeks under this alternative .
c PAR 16 moreover , the weight of treasury financings could place upward pressure on the rate structure rather soon .
