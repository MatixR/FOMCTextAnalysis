a SENT -- the approach of alternative a would also provide more leeway for greater m1 growth should the committee believe that is needed to accommodate to a real gnp growth that is as rapid as , or more rapid than , projections .
a PAR 21 however , a further reduction in the discount rate , or provision of above average excess reserves through open market operations at least for a while , may also be needed if the federal funds rate is to drop nearer to the 7 - 1/2 percent area that seems more consistent with the reserve growth needed to attain the money specifications of this alternative .
a PAR 21 non- borrowed reserves would be expected to grow at about a 20 percent annual rate over the february - march period .
a PAR 22 market interest rates would be expected to drop fairly sharply in the near term under alternative a , especially if it was accompanied by a lower discount rate .
a PAR 22 the treasury bill rate might decline to around 7 - 1/4 percent and cds to about 7 - 1/2 percent , putting the prime rate under considerable downward pressure .
a PAR 22 such yield declines would probably lead to continued strong growth of m2 and m3 , particularly of their nontransactions components .
a PAR 22 in long - term markets , yields would also fall , though the extent of such declines might be reduced by the very heavy volume of corporate and state and local bond issuance that would probably ensue .
a PAR 22 in addition , rate declines in long - term markets could be limited by concerns that such an approach might lead to an intensification of inflationary pressures , or in any event to a tightening of market conditions later in the year to avert such pressures and to constrain growth in the aggregates to within the long - term ranges adopted .
a PAR 22 in exchange markets , the dollar would be likely to come under downward pressure .

b PAR 7 three alternative long - run growth ranges for the year 1985 ( qiv to qiv basis   are shown below for committee consideration , along with the tentative ranges for that year adopted in mid-1984.1 alternative b encompasses the growth ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted in july , but includes a higher range for credit .
b PAR 7 alternatives i and iii call for somewhat higher and somewhat lower rates of growth , respectively , in the monetary and credit aggregates .
b PAR 7 adopted in alt .
b PAR 7 iii mid-1984 ml 4 to 8 4 to 7 3 - 1/2 to 6 - 1/2 4 to 7 m2 6 to 9 6 to 8 - 1/2 5 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2
b PAR 7 6 to 8 - 1/2 m3 6
b PAR 7 -1/2 to 9 - 1/2 6 to 9 5 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 6 to 9 total credit 9 - 1/2 to 9 to 12 8 - 1/2 to 11 - 1/2 8 to 11 12 - 1/2 
b PAR 8 the growth ranges of alternative b were taken as the basis for the staff 's projection of growth in nominal gnp for 1985 of 7 - 1/4 per- cent ; it was assumed that growth of m1 would be in the upper part of its range , with interest rates expected to be around , or somewhat higher than , current levels .
b PAR 8 growth in the other monetary aggregates may be close to the upper limits of their ranges , in part reflecting the strong expansion 1 .
b PAR 8 a number of background issues in connection with monetary targets and operating procedures in 1985 were discussed by the fomc at its last meeting .
b PAR 8 at that time , the committee considered , in terms of ml , questions about the appropriate base for the 1985 range -- whether it should be the actual average level for the fourth quarter of 1984 , as assumed in the presentation of the alternatives , or the fourth - quarter level that represents the midpoint of the 4 to 8 percent range for last year .
b PAR 8 with growth for 1984 on a qiv to qiv basis at 5.2 percent , the amount of " shortfall " from the 6 percent midpoint growth of last year 's range seems moderate enough to be readily compensated , should the committee wish , by encouraging growth in the upper part of whatever range for 1985 is adopted . expected in the first quarter .
b PAR 8 to the degree that interest rates rose somewhat as the year progressed , m2 and m3 growth would more likely be held within the ranges .
b PAR 10 credit growth under alternative b is expected to be just below the upper end of the range shown .
b PAR 10 the higher range for credit growth in alternative b than had been tentatively adopted provides a greater chance of encompassing actual growth , but has the disadvantage of possibly signalling to the market a more accommodative posture by the federal reserve vis - a - vis the large federal budgetary deficit .
b PAR 10 growth of federal debt is expected to decelerate some in 1985 , but to remain quite high relative to historical experience , and to be faster than private debt growth .
b PAR 10 expansion in private debt is likely to be lower this year , as growth of nominal gnp slows .
b PAR 10 but we still expect the rate of increase in total debt to exceed expansion in nominal gnp by about as much as last year .
b PAR 10 debt growth is expected to be sustained by larger than normal merger financing , though less than last year ; by the still rapid expansion of federal debt : a wider corporate financing gap ; and by the continuing need to finance an expansion of spending by domestic sectors that is greater than the rise in nominal gnp ( given the projected continued deterioration in our international balance on goods and services ) .
b PAR 11 the lessened rate of debt expansion should help restrain growth in the broad monetary aggregates , particularly m3 .
b PAR 11 given the portfolio quality problems faced by depository institutions , and the need to increase their capital , we do not expect them to be significantly more aggressive than last year in seeking to finance credit demands .
b PAR 11 part of the increase in credit demands is also expected to continue to be met by net borrowings from abroad by banks , displacing issuance of cds or other deposits that might appear in m3 ( and possibly also m2 ) .
b PAR 11 nonethe- less , as noted earlier , m2 and m3 are likely to grow close to the upper limits of the proposed alternative b ranges .
b PAR 11 somewhat higher growth ranges for these aggregates would increase the odds of encompassing the actual outcome for the year , providing leeway should credit demands fall more heavily than expected on depository institutions or should funding patterns change .
b PAR 16 the specifications of alternative b , which are expected to involve continuation of about the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions , can be considered most consistent with growth over a longer period within the ranges of alternative b .
b PAR 16 under the speci- fications of b , m1 growth would slow to around a 7 - 1/2 percent annual rate on average over february and march .
b PAR 16 such a moderation of m1 is expected to develop without appreciable firming in money markets as the 1 .
b PAR 16 all of the alternatives imply higher growth from november ' 84 to march ' 85 than adopted by the committee at its last meeting .
b PAR 16 in terms of m1 , attainment of the 7 percent november - march growth rate previously adopted would require growth from december to march of around 5 - 3/4 percent .

b PAR 16 -actual level -- estimated level sshort run alternatives upward effects on money demand of the steep decline of interest rates over recent months abate .
b PAR 16 moreover , given the rapid growth of money late in the fourth quarter and in january , a slowing in growth would still be consistent with the expected increase in spending on goods and services in the first quarter .
b PAR 16 on a quarterly average basis , m1 would increase at a 9 - 1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter under alternative b , and velocity would decline at about a 1 - 1/4 percent annual rate , given the staff 's gnp projection . by march , m1 under this alternative would have increased by about 8 - 3/4 percent from the qiv ' 84 long - run base .
b PAR 17 a less rapid expansion in the nontransactions components of m2 and m3 is also expected to contribute to a slowdown in growth in the broader monetary aggregates under alternative b . weakness in inflows to mmmfs is already evident in the most recent data , as yields on these assets have declined into fairly close alignment with the lower level of market interest rates ; a similar pattern for mmdas can be expected as their offering rates continue to drop in response to previous declines in other yields .
b PAR 17 as more normal rate alignments are restored , m2 growth should slow considerably .
b PAR 17 however , m2 velocity in the first quarter would decline at around a 4 percent annual rate under alternative b , owing mostly to the surge in growth of this aggregate around year - end .
b PAR 17 m3 growth is expected to be held down by continued moderate bank cd issuance as well as weakness in institution - only money funds .
b PAR 19 the specifications of alternative b are expected to in- volve reserve conditions consistent with borrowing at the discount window remaining around $ 300 million .
b PAR 19 with borrowing remaining a little above its frictional level , federal funds should trade in the neighborhood of 8 - 1/4 percent .
b PAR 19 nonborrowed and total reserves would increase at 12 - 1/4 and 11 - 1/2 percent annual rates , respectively , over the february- march period .

c PAR 13 the marked tightening of credit market conditions , at least for part of this year , that is probably consistent with this alternative would work toward slower growth in real gnp in 1985 than in the staff projection .
c PAR 13 however , this alternative would also foster more restraint on price increases than under either alternatives i or ii , which do not entail a significant price deceleration this year or probably next .
c PAR 13 if the deceleration of inflation under alternative c occurred at the expense of a slower real gnp growth than currently projected , it would nonetheless lay the groundwork for a stronger real growth later consistent with continued abatement of inflation and inflationary expectations and a lowering of interest rates over time .
c PAR 23 m1 growth of around 6 - 1/4 percent over february and march under this alternative would require restraining growth in total reserves to a 7 percent annual rate .
c PAR 23 this may be consistent with growth of nonborrowed reserves of 2 - 1/2 percent , and a rise in borrowing to the $ 600 - 700 million area .
c PAR 23 the federal funds rate would probably rise to around 9 percent .
c PAR 24 other interest rates would also be expected to rise substantially under alternative c , with the treasury bill rate increasing to around 8 - 3/4 percent .
c PAR 24 long - term rates are also likely to advance significantly in the short run .
c PAR 24 upward pressures on the dollar on foreign exchange markets would intensify , and u.s . trading partners also would be under pressure to raise short - term rates .
