a SENT -- this requires a 10 percent annual rate of growth , which would , if continued , result in a fourth- quarter average level in line with the midpoint of the 1981 range . assuming a fairly smooth month - by - month trajectory , the quarterly average growth of m1-b under alternative a would be 4 percent at an annual rate , as compared to a projected third - quarter growth of nominal gnp of about 7½ percent .

b PAR 21 under alternative b , m1-b would grow at a rate that would leave it below the lower end of the fomc 's 1981 range until november .
b PAR 21 if this growth rate were continued through year - end , it would result in growth for the year just marginally above the low end of the 3 to 6 percent range for m1-b .
b PAR 21 the resulting combination of lower gnp and higher interest rates would tend to hold m2 growth down .
b PAR 21 growth of total reserves of about 10½ percent , at an annual rate , from june to august , would be consistent with the alternative b monetary target .
b PAR 21 given the present discount window structure , borrowing likely would run $ 2 billion or a bit more .
b PAR 22 the federal funds rate probably would be around the 19 to 20 percent area during the intermeeting period under alternative b . other interest rates would probably rise from recent levels , perhaps substantially as the market is disappointed in its expectations that the funds rate would decline gradually as the summer progresses .
b PAR 22 the 3-month treasury bill yield might approach , and possibly exceed , 16 percent .
b PAR 22 business demands on commercial banks could surge for a time , partly in response to higher bond market yields , possibly requiring heavy cd issuance and/or eurodollar borrowing .
