c PAR 13 the case for increasing the intended federal funds rate only 25 basis points as under alternative c would seem to hinge on the judgment that financial market participants have exaggerated the like- ly strength of future spending relative to the economy 's potential and hence of prospective inflation pressures .
c PAR 13 in this view , taking the fundamentals reasonably into account , the markets have gotten " ahead of the curve " and the risk of disappointing them should not be allowed to divert the federal reserve from a gradual course of 25-basis - point adjustments in the stance of policy toward neutrality .
c PAR 13 with the loca- tion of a neutral funds rate itself a moving target -- and lower to the extent that real long - term interest rates are higher -- such an approach would allow more time to assess the needed federal funds rate in- creases as new information on the economy and prices becomes avail- able .
c PAR 13 short - term rates likely would edge off immediately after a modest policy tightening .
c PAR 13 the initial reaction in capital and foreign exchange markets could be adverse if the small size of the move were seen as signalling a reluctance to move aggressively to head off an inflationary buildup .
c PAR 13 however , the odds on such a reaction may have been reduced by the recent favorable price data .
c PAR 13 in this context , market participants might be more inclined to interpret the smaller move as sufficient to counter coming inflation pressures and to project a lower trajectory of short - term rates , which would pass through to lower longer - term rates .

d SENT -- under alternative d , the federal funds rate would be raised to 4 - 1/4 per- cent , either by increasing the initial borrowing allowance to $ 225 million or by raising the discount rate to 3 - 1/2 percent , while keep- ing the initial allowance for discount window borrowing at $ 175 mil- lion .
d PAR 12 compared with the staff 's assessment , financial market participants now appear to be anticipating appreciably more federal reserve tightening by the fall , judging by the rate of 5 - 1/4 percent on federal funds futures for october .
d PAR 12 many in the market expect the committee to increase the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting , though others anticipate only a 25 basis point increase , and the federal funds futures quote is in between .
d PAR 12 very short - term rates might thus increase slightly under alternative d .
d PAR 12 the behavior of rates on instruments of a few months ' maturity or longer would depend importantly on whether the market interpreted the larger increase of alternative d as indicating a steeper trajectory of future policy actions , and perhaps the need for greater cumulative tightening .
d PAR 12 if expectations were to ratchet up in this manner , as appeared to have been the case in some of the tightenings earlier this year , there could be sizable hikes along the maturity spectrum .
d PAR 12 however , several factors suggest that the market may react more favorably this time .
d PAR 12 for one , such a move -- larger than recent ones -- might assuage concerns that the federal reserve was " falling behind the curve .
d PAR 12 " a rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar , which would be expected under this alternative , would also help to reduce inflation concerns .
d PAR 12 moreover , an action of this magnitude coupled with a discount rate increase , depending perhaps on the wording of the associated announce- ment , might be seen as suggesting that the federal reserve thought it had reached the neighborhood of " neutrality .
d PAR 12 if the action is seen this way , policy would be expected to be kept on hold for a while , or at least to tighten more slowly and be more dependent on incoming data .
d PAR 12 with one source of uncertainty diminished , at least for a time , investors who had been avoiding longer - term instruments pending the federal reserve 's action might be tempted to extend maturities .
d PAR 12 bond yields could still back up somewhat in the aftermath of an announce- ment of the federal reserve 's choice of alternative d , but these other influences should limit any increase and work to reduce yields over time .
d PAR 12 provided incoming data on the economy indicate a moderate path for activity , in line with the staff forecast .

d PAR 16 the recent increases in opportunity costs on liquid retail deposits aris- ing from the previous tightenings in the stance of monetary policy , and under alternative d from an additional firming move as well , will serve to hold back growth of m1 and some of the other components of m2 and m3 . with any further backup in long - term interest rates not ex- pected to be sustained under either policy alternative , another surge in outflows from bond mutual funds does not appear to be in the cards .
