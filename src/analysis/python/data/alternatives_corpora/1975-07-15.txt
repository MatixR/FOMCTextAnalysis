a PAR 15 market interest rates would tend to decline in sympathy , but declines might be quite modest as many market participants may assume that the easing in money market conditions will be transitory , given the consensus forecast of a strengthening in economic activity .
a PAR 15 indeed , the staff believes that under this alternative , short - term rates would have to begin rising again by late summer or early fall to achieve longer - term objectives for the monetary aggregates .

b PAR 6 preliminary data for m1 in late june and early july indicate an unwinding of the recent deposit expansion and support the view that the upsurge in good part reflected temporary factors ( tax rebates and one - time payments to social security recipients ) .
b PAR 6 for july , m1 growth is expected to be slightly negative , while growth in august is expected to resume at a pace more consonant with underlying transactions demands , given prevailing money market conditions .
b PAR 6 ( 6)+(7)+(8)-(9 ) reserves 5/
b PAR 9 while alternative b calls for maintenance of prevailing money market conditions in the short - run , given the temporary slowing expected in m1 growth , it appears likely that money market conditions will need to be tightened further later on in order to achieve growth in the aggregates as indexed by expansion in m1 over the next year at around the center of the 5 - 7½ per cent range adopted by the committee at its last meeting .
b PAR 9 the staff at this point believes that the funds rate might need to rise to the neighborhood of 8 per cent by fall , if the projected 13 per cent annual rate of increase in nominal gnp for the second half of 1975 materializes .
b PAR 9 on that assumption we would expect m1 growth in the second half of 1975 to be at about a 7 per cent annual rate ; a lower growth rate in the first half of 1976 would hence be required if the committee 's longer - run m1 target is to be achieved .
b PAR 10 in the table on p. 6a , under alternative b , the one - year growth rate for m1 from june ' 75 to june ' 76 is shown as 5¾ per cent-- which is ½ point below the mid - point of the 5 - 7½ per cent target range .
b PAR 10 the staff used such a rate in the alternative b calculations because the substantial overshoot in m1 growth during june raised the base level for that month by about $ 1.7 billion above the estimate made at the previous fomc meeting .
b PAR 10 over the 12-month period from june 1975 to june 1976 , m1 would therefore have to grow about per cent less than indicated earlier if the committee wished to ensure that the june overshoot did not permanently raise the money supply .
b PAR 10 the long - run growth rate under alternative b measured on a quarterly average basis -- that is , from the average level for m1 in the second quarter of 1975 to the average level in the second quarter of 1976 - -is around 6¾ per cent , as is also shown in the table .
b SENT -- however , if the federal funds rate were stabilized at around 6 per cent , as is contemplated under alternative b , no more than minor upward market rate adjustments , if any , would seem likely in the weeks immediately ahead .

c PAR 16 under all three alternatives net inflows of time and savings deposits ( other than large money market cd 's   to banks and to thrift institutions are expected to slow from their recent unusually rapid pace that included the effects on savings of tax rebates and one - time social security payments .
c PAR 16 the slowdown would be greatest over the near - term under alternative c , which involves the probability of a significant further rise in short - term market interest rates .
c PAR 16 net inflows of consumer - type time deposits are still likely to be good - sized during the summer .
c PAR 16 later this fall reduced inflows might be expected to exert more pronounced pressures on banks to raise additional funds in the cd market and on thrift institutions to borrow from home loan banks and commercial banks under either alternatives b or c.
