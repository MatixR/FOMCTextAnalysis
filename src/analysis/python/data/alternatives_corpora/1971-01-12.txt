a SENT -- the three growth paths shown for the narrowly - defined money supply present alternatives that take account in differing ways of the recent shortfalls relative to expectations , as follows : ( a ) alternative a shows a pattern consistent with a 6 per cent annual rate of growth for m1 over the first quarter of 1971 .
a SENT -- thus alternative a does not make up for the fourth quarter shortfall .
a SENT -- as a result , under alternative a the march level of the money supply would be about $ 1 billion below previous expectations .
a PAR 9 realization of alternative a aggregates would require , in the staff 's judgment , pushing the federal funds rate up from its recent trading range of around 4 - 1/2 per cent .
a PAR 9 with nominal gnp projected to rise at an 11.7 per cent rate in the first quarter , strong transaction demands for money and a pick - up in short - term private credit demands are expected .
a PAR 9 should the gnp projection and these money and credit demands be realized , short - term rates would rise in the process of keeping money growth down to 6 per cent .

a PAR 9 to the market , it would probably be interpreted as an effort to keep short rates up , and , with some lag , the 3-month bill rate would likely move back up toward the new 5 - 1/4 per cent discount rate .
a PAR 9 marginal reserve measures would be tighter than recently prevailing .
a PAR 12 with the forthcoming treasury refunding probably largely discounted by the market , with recent corporate issues well received , and in light of the still large spread of long- over short - term rates , it seems likely that longer - term interest rates will drop further , except under conditions specified for alternative a . interest rate declines would tend to accelerate should the federal funds rate move down significantly from prevailing levels .

b PAR 1 weekly deposit data now available on a preliminary basis through december 30 and on a partial basis through january 6 indicate that growth in the narrowly - defined money supply was at an annual rate of about 6.7 per cent on average in december , and only about 3.6 per cent for the fourth quarter .
b PAR 1 while the rate of growth in money supply during december exceeded that of any previous month since august , it still fell appreciably short of the projected 9.5 per cent rebound that was indicated at the last meeting of the committee .
b PAR 1 moreover , the november money supply growth rate was revised downward to 2.8 per cent from the 4.5 per cent rate estimated in mid - december .
b PAR 1 the combination of these developments resulted in a fourth quarter money supply growth rate that was about 1 - 1/2 percentage points below the roughly 5 per cent rate of growth that had been expected in consequence of the fomc 's decision at the last meeting .
b PAR 1 in the case of the adjusted bank credit proxy , it too grew somewhat less in december than had been indicated at the mid - december meeting , but the rate of growth was still substan- tial as extremely strong time deposit growth more than offset further declines in non - deposit funds .
b PAR 1 the latest estimates and the original target paths for the various monetary aggregates are compared in the following table : month week ending fourth quarter recent paths of key monetary ( seasonally adjusted , billions money supply ( m1 ) indicated at actual last meeting 1/ results % annual rates of change aggregates of dollars ) adjusted credit proxy indicated at actual last meeting 1/ results % annual rates of change november over december over 1/ alternative b path of previous blue book .
b PAR 1 2/ 3.8 per cent annual rate for fourth quarter average over third quarter average .
b SENT -- ( 10 ) under alternative b , the money market may have to be eased from currently prevailing conditions ; the funds rate was around 4 - 1/2 per cent on friday and might have to be moved down into the lower half of the 4 - -4 - 3/4 per cent range specified .
b PAR 20 alternative
b PAR 20 this alternative is proposed for possible use if the committee decides to seek growth in money over the first quarter at a faster rate than would be required simply to make up the fourth quarter shortfall .
b PAR 20 one possible growth rate under this alternative--8 - 1/2 per cent -- was noted in paragraph ( 6c ) above .
b PAR 20 to implement this policy , the committee seeks to promote easing of conditions in credit markets and more rapid growth in money , with attendant bank credit expansion , over the months ahead .
b PAR 20 system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and
b PAR 20 [ del : the recently attained ] money market conditions consistent with those objectives , taking account of the forthcoming treasury financing [ del : until the next meeting of the committee , provided that the expected rates of growth in money and bank credit will at least be achieved]. whereas alternative b includes a statement to the effect that " the committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets , " the word " some " is omitted in the corresponding statement in this alternative .
b PAR 20 this difference reflects the expectation that interest rates would decline somewhat more under this alternative -- which calls for " more rapid growth in money"--than under alternative b . table 1 paths of key monetary aggregates seasonally adjusted strictlyconfidential ( fr ) january 11 , 1971 1970 : sept .
