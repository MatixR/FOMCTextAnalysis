a PAR 12 this would tend to strengthen forces making for a rebound in growth of the monetary aggregates and would also be more accommodative of any increase in demands for liquidity
a PAR 12 should uncertainties with regard to municipal markets and banks continue .
a PAR 12 we would expect that such a reduction in the funds rate would have to be reversed at least by early next year in order to keep longer - run growth in m1 at around the mid - point of the 5 - 7½ per cent range , and that by spring the funds rate would be around 7¾ per cent .
a PAR 13 a reduction in the funds rate over the next few weeks of about the dimensions contemplated under alternative a would probably be accompanied by similar declines in other short - term rates and by some further decline in longer - term market rates .
a PAR 13 mortgage market yields would also be likely to drop as the outlook for continued savings inflows brightens .
a PAR 13 but declines in mortgage yields , as well as in security rates , may be limited insofar as market participants view the easing in money market conditions as temporary .
a PAR 13 market attitudes will , of course , be influenced by the nature of incoming economic news and by the degree of use , if any , of other monetary policy instruments .

b PAR 8 under alternative b the federal funds rate range is centered around the recently prevailing 5¼ per cent level .
b PAR 8 m is once again expected to begin growing at a reasonably rapid rate ; under this alternative growth over the two - month november - december period is estimated to be in a 6½-8½ per cent annual rate range .

b PAR 8 75-qiii ' 76 result in expansion from qiii ' 75 to qiv ' 75 at a rate of about 2¾ per cent , implying a rise in income velocity at about an 11 per cent annual rate between those quarters .
b PAR 8 this would be an extremely large rise even for the early stages of an economic recovery , particularly if , as assumed , it is not associated with upward interest rate pressures during the quarter .
b PAR 8 ( 8) such a large rise in velocity would not appear to be long sustainable at current interest rate levels , given the reduction in the public 's cash balances relative to income that has already occurred and given the continued , even though somewhat diminished , rate of expansion projected for nominal gnp in 1976 .
b PAR 8 with the demand for money likely to continue to rise , the staff would expect the federal funds rate to increase in the course of next year if the rate of growth in m1 is to average near the mid - point of the fomc 's longer - run target range of 5 - 7 per cent .
b PAR 8 by summer , the funds rate might peak out at around 7½ ½er cent .
