a SENT -- ( 19 ) to attain the somewhat higher monetary targets of alternative a total reserves would have to increase at a 2¾ percent , at an annual rate , between november and march and by a 3½ percent rate in the two - month december - january period .

b PAR 3 with demand for reserves outpacing the amount supplied through open market operations , and with further pressure on short - term markets generated by the percentage point increase in both the basic discount rate and the surcharge , short - term interest rates have risen another 2 to 5 percentage points since the november fomc meeting .
b PAR 3 pressures have been particularly intense on very short - term instruments .
b PAR 3 the federal funds rate averaged 18.82 percent in the most recent full statement
b PAR 3 week.1/ rates on 3-month treasury bills and 3-month cds rose to as high as 17 and 21 percent , respectively , above peaks reached in early spring .
b PAR 3 with bank credit demand strong , banks have pressed large cd offerings on the market .
b PAR 3 in addition , the treasury raised more than $ 6 billion of new cash through short - term bills since the previous meeting .
b PAR 3 with business loan demands 1/ at a telephone meeting on november 26 , the committee raised the upper end of the federal funds rate range adopted in november from 17 to 18 percent .
b PAR 3 on december 5 and then again on december 12 , the committee agreed that open market operations would not be precisely constrained by the 18 percent limit .
b PAR 3 remaining quite strong and costs of loanable funds rising , banks raised their prime lending rates from 16 1/4 percent to 20 percent .

b PAR 3 total and nonborrowed reserve paths adjusted upward by $ 90 million on december 5 due to multiplier changes .
b PAR 3 total and nonborrowed reserve paths adjusted upward by $ 40 million on decembe 12 due to multiplier changes .
b PAR 3 as of appendix ii alternative econometric estimates of the drift in the demand for m-1a in recent years and projections for qiv ' 80 to qiv ' 81 since the mid-70 's several developments have likely worked to reduce the demand for m-1 .
b PAR 3 legislative and regulatory changes have created new kinds of deposits or permitted expanded use of existing ones .
b PAR 3 at the same time high interest rates have encouraged the use of very liquid deposit substitutes such as rps and mmfs , while also providing a greater incentive for investment in cash management systems designed to lower average cash holdings .
b PAR 3 as a result , m-1 velocity has tended to rise somewhat more than might be expected on the basis of the prior established relationships .
b PAR 3 to provide a quantitative indication of the amount of this downward demand shift or drift , three representative money demand models have been selected .
b PAR 3 as shown in appendix table ii-1 , these models differ mainly in the specification of the opportunity cost of holding transactions balances .
b PAR 3 the first of these models is the board 's quarterly econometric model .
b PAR 3 in this model the opportunity cost of holding money balances is represented by two money market yields -- the three - month treasury bill rate and the federal funds rate -- and the passbook savings rate .
b PAR 3 the second model shown in the table was developed by michael hamburger , while he was on the staff of the federal reserve bank of new york .
b PAR 3 the opportunity cost of holding m-1 balances in his model is depicted by a long - term rate of interest -- a bond rate -- and a dividend - price ratio for common stocks as well as the passbook rate .
b PAR 3 the last one shown was developed by two members of the board staff , richard porter and thomas simpson .
b PAR 3 their model is like the board 's quarterly model with one major exception : it includes a ratchet variable designed to capture the incentive to invest in new money management systems that enable the depository to conduct transactions with a smaller amount of money balances .
b PAR 3 when market rates of interest are high and expected to remain ii - 2 high for some time in the future , the perceived profitability of adopting new cash management systems increases and new systems are implemented that reduce deposit demands , not only in the current period but also in the future .
b PAR 3 appendix table 11 - 2 shows the annual rate of demand errors or drift in m-1a for each of these models over the six - year period from qiv ' 74 - qiv ' 75 to qiv ' 79 - qiv ' 80 and for the qiv ' 80 to qiv ' 81 longer - run target periods .
b PAR 3 in each case , money demand drift , shown in the third panel of the table , is measured as the difference between actual ( or targeted ) money growth and predicted money growth , shown in the upper panels of the table .
b PAR 3 since each of the econometric models was estimated based on data prior to mid-1974 , none of them could be expected to predict the weakness in m-1a growth associated with regulatory changes permitting now / ats accounts and savings deposits for businesses and for state and local governments .
b PAR 3 the lower panel in table ii-2 modifies the drift estimates by adjusting the predicted growth rates for an estimate of the impact of such regulatory actions on m-1a .
b PAR 3 the board 's quarterly model , which tended to be the best equation of the three prior to the mid-70 's , generates large drift estimates in 1975 and 1976 , even when adjusted for the regulatory changes .
b PAR 3 neither it nor the porter - simpson model generates particularly large errors in the period from 1977 to 1980 , especially when the adjustment for the regulatory changes is made .
b PAR 3 the porter - simpson model produces somewhat smaller estimates of demand drift than the board 's quarterly model in the years 1975 and 1976 and again in 1980 , in large measure because of the behavior of the ratchet cash management variable in periods during or just following high long - term rates .
b PAR 3 making the adjustment for the regulatory changes , the hamburger model correctly forecasts the average rate of expansion of the money stock over the six - year period .
b PAR 3 in large part the slower growth predicted by ii - 3 this model than the others can be attributed to the historically high value of the dividend - price ratio over this period and the sluggish response of this model to the increasing inflation since 1977 .
b PAR 3 for the qiv ' 80 to qiv ' 81 longer - run target period the models pro- vide a wide range of estimates of demand drift .
b PAR 3 abstracting from the intro- duction of nationwide now accounts , the predictions bracket the 4¼ percent midpoint of the longer - run target range for m-1a .
b PAR 3 the board 's model implies that m-1a will be about 2¾ percentage points above this midpoint , while the porter - simpson model predicts growth at about 1¼ percentage points below the midpoint .
b PAR 3 the latter model is , in effect , predicting that the relatively high long - term rates expected to prevail over the coming year will induce a further increase in the efficiency of cash management and a fairly rapid increase in velocity .

b PAR 3 thereafter , they are based on the staff 's judgmental greenbook projection for interest rates and output .
b PAR 3 2/ the adjustments are based on the assumption that the introduction of ats accounts nationwide , now accounts in the northeast , and savings accounts for businesses and for state and local governments has had a depressing effect on m-1a growth .
b PAR 3 an adjusted m-1a series is constructed as an estimate of what m-1a would have been if these new deposit cate- gories had not been created .
b PAR 3 the series added to m-1a essentially consists of two - thirds of other checkable deposits , one - fourth of business savings deposits and one - fifth of state and local savings deposits .
b PAR 3 since the latter two series tend to fluctuate with interest rates , the actual adjustment is made by assuming that these series grow at half the rate of increase of nominal income after the initial introductory phase for each .
b PAR 3 iii estimated impact of nationwide now accounts on the monetary aggregates in 1981 as the public adjusts to the year - end introduction of nationwide now accounts , growth in m-1a will be slowed by shifts from household demand deposits to other checkable deposits ( ocds ) , while growth in m-1b will be enlarged by shifts of funds from savings and other liquid assets to ocds .
b PAR 3 no significant impact is expected on m-2 because it includes virtually all of the funds likely to shift to nows .
b PAR 3 the advent of nationwide nows ( and continued shifting into similar accounts ) will affect principally the approximately $ 88 billion of house- hold demand deposits currently held in the 42 states where nows are not yet authorized .
b PAR 3 however , some further shifting to now accounts is also expected from the roughly $ 13½ billion of household demand deposits in the northeast , especially in new york and new jersey.1/
b PAR 3 some inferences about the propor- tion of household demand deposits in the 42 states likely to be converted to nows may be drawn from the earlier experience with now and ats accounts .
b PAR 3 in massachusetts and new hampshire , shifting to now accounts initially was slow , reflecting the novelty of the now concept in 1974 as well as the uncer- tainty about its future status .
b PAR 3 similarly , the public 's adjustment to the introduction of ats accounts nationwide in 1978 has been rather slow .
b PAR 3 in contrast , when nows were first authorized in the four other new england 1/ nows have been authorized in massachusetts and new hampshire for all depository institutions except credit unions since january 1 , 1974 , in the other four new england states since february 27 , 1976 , in new york since november 10 , 1978 , and in new jersey since december 28 , 1979 .
b PAR 3 nows may be held only by individuals and nonprofit organizations .
b PAR 3 ats were authorized nationwide at banks and thrifts on november 1 , 1978 and share drafts first became available at federal credit unions on october 1 , 1974 .
b PAR 3 ats accounts may be held only by individuals , and share drafts only by credit union members .
b PAR 3 iii - 2 states in 1976 and in new york in 1978 , the growing awareness and acceptance of nows resulted in much faster adjustment .
b PAR 3 based on the historical growth rate of household demand deposits , such deposits would probably grow to a level of about $ 110 billion by the end of 1981 if there were no shifts into ocds .
b PAR 3 the varied now and ats experience suggests a fairly wide range for the possible proportion of personal demand deposits shifting to nows in 1981 .
b PAR 3 if the adjustment by the public to the availability of nows outside the northeast is extremely rapid ( that is 25 percent shift in the first year ) , a diversion to nows of about $ 24 billion of these household demand deposits may occur in 1981 .
b PAR 3 another $ 1 billion is expected to be shifted in the northeast .
b PAR 3 on the other hand , if the adjustment is slow , total shifts may come to only about $ 6 billion .
b PAR 3 these figures translate into an estimated reduction of m-1a growth ranging from 1½ to 6½ percentage points in 1981 ( table 1 ) .
b PAR 3 surveys in early 1979 , experience in new england , and a recent sampling by reserve banks suggests that roughly one - third of existing now deposits were diverted from assets other than demand deposits . assuming that a similar pattern emerges in the rest of the nation , roughly $ 3 to $ 12½ billion of savings deposits and other liquid assets will shift to nows during 1981 .
b PAR 3 these figures imply an estimated boost to m-1b ranging from ¾ to 3 percentage points.1/ the width of these ranges reflects the high degree of uncertainty regarding the speed of adjustment to nationwide nows in light of the 1/ if the mix of growth in ocd included a shift of savings deposits equal to that- of demand deposits , the impact on m-1b would be twice as large as shown while the impact on m-1a would be unchanged .
b PAR 3 the interest rate ceiling at banks on nationwide nows and ats accounts will equal the ceiling on their regular savings accounts , and this might provide an incentive for the public to shift more of their savings into such accounts .
b PAR 3 iii - 3 diversity of experience with now and ats accounts .
b PAR 3 several factors argue for expecting a rate of growth in the vicinity of the lower bound : ( 1 ) about one - third of commercial banks -- holding around 87 percent of total commercial bank individual savings de- posits and an estimated 70 percent of household demand deposits -- already offered either now or ats ( or both ) accounts at the end of 1979 .
b PAR 3 in addition , over 70 per- cent of mutual savings banks offer now - ats , and over 90 percent of such institutions offer some form of transac- tion account that could act as a vehicle for offering ats .
b PAR 3 only s&ls and cus have yet to enter the market for household transaction balances in large numbers .
b PAR 3 thus , since now and ats accounts are close substitutes from the viewpoints of both offering institutions and depositors , the nationwide now authority does not seem to be the sort of innovation that should cause massive shifts of funds .
b PAR 3 ( 3 ) money market mutual funds may divert some of the more interest - sensitive funds from nows , particularly if market rates remain at high levels .
b PAR 3 on the other hand , there are bases for arguing for a relatively fast rate of conversion : ( 1 ) recent high market interest rates have heightened consumer awareness of the value of interest - bearing transaction deposits thus increasing the marketability of nows .
b PAR 3 more- over , from the point of view of depository institutions , relatively high market interest rates during 1981 might increase incentives to market now accounts more aggressively in an effort to retain or attract funds .
b PAR 3 ( 3 ) nows afford most s&ls nationwide their first opportunity to compete in the household transaction deposit market .
b PAR 3 typical pricing structures announced by s&ls suggest an aggressive stance , aimed to acquire a large market share by offering nows free of service charges with minimum balance require- ments of at least $ 1,000 - -frequently $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 - -for service charge - free accounts .
b PAR 3 iii - 4 midpoints of the estimated ranges may be viewed as the most likely impact of shifts to now accounts in 1981 , namely a 4 percentage point reduction in m-1a growth and a 2 percentage point boost in m-1b growth .
b PAR 3 the adjustment by the public to the introduction of nationwide nows is expected to continue , but at a reduced pace , in 1982 and 1983 .
b PAR 3 the ultimate shift to now accounts likely will be quite large ; after more than six years of now accounts at all depository institutions in massa- chusetts and new hampshire , roughly two - thirds of household demand deposits are estimated to have shifted .

b PAR 3 ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 2 ) note : these figures exclude the estimated ¼ percentage point divergence in m-1a and m-1b growth rates in 1981 due to more rapid growth in existing ocd than in m-1a .
