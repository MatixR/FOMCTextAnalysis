a PAR 11 the projected slowing of real and nominal gnp this quarter , as well as the recent increases in interest rates , should tend to retard narrow money growth from the extremely rapid april pace .
a PAR 11 however , money demand may remain fairly strong , and interest rates under upward pressure , unless the economy is considerably weaker than the staff now anticipates or unless the current level of interest rates induces another shift to more intensive cash management .
a PAR 11 even under alternative a -- which involves growth in total reserves from april to june at an 8 percent annual rate-- the federal funds rate seems likely to remain in a 17 to 20 percent range over the balance of the quarter.1/ assuming the present discount rate structure , adjustment borrowing would probably be around $ 1 to $ 2 billion .
a PAR 11 continued high long - term rates may tend to induce firms to focus their growing credit demands on banks and other sources of short - term credit over the near term -- although the limited flexibility of many borrowers and a desire to stem the deterioration of balance sheets likely will maintain bond issuance at a high level .

a PAR 15 given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the directive consistent with the form of the directives adopted at recent meetings .
a PAR 15 the specifications adopted at the meeting on march 31 are shown in strike - through form .
a PAR 15 in the short run the committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with a substantial deceleration of growth in m-1b from [ del : march ] april to june [ del : at ] to an annual rate of [ del : 5½ ]   percent [ del : or somewhat less , ] after allowance for the impact of flows into now accounts , and with growth in m-2 at an annual rate of about [ del : 10½ ]   percent .
a PAR 15 it is recognized that shifts into now accounts will continue to distort measured growth in m-1b to an unpredictable extent , and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions .
a PAR 15 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate , taken over a period of time , within a range of [ del : 13 ]   to [ del : 18 ]   percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths , the manager for domestic operations is promptly to notify the chairman , who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .

a PAR 15 embodied in the greenbook 19¾ appendix iii new seasonal adjustment procedure seasonal adjustment factors for the monetary aggregates recently were updated on the basis of data available through 1980 .
a PAR 15 in the process , other checkable deposits ( ocd ) were put on a seasonally adjusted basis for the first time.1 in calculating the new seasonal factors , observa- tions for several components over the spring and summer of 1980 were pre- adjusted by a time series modeling technique to eliminate the effect of the unusual - and likely nonrecurrent--
a PAR 15 patterns of deposit flows that ac- companied the imposition and subsequent removal of the special credit
a PAR 15 re- straint program.2
a PAR 15 revised seasonally adjusted m1-b in 1981 is constructed by adding the following seasonally adjusted components : currency ; the sum of de- mand deposits and of ocd ( apart from trend growth ) estimated to have been shifted or diverted from demand deposits ; ocd ( apart from trend growth ) estimated to have come from sources other than demand deposits ; and a relatively small trend growth in ocd , amounting to an increase of 1 .
a PAR 15 the new seasonal factors were published as appendix tables to the h.6 federal reserve statistical release on may 1 , 1981 .
a PAR 15 a preadjustment technique also was applied to the demand deposit com- ponent of m1-a to remove the distortions in early 1979 caused by the in- troduction of ats nationwide and now accounts in new york state .
a PAR 15 based on information currently available from a number of sources-- such as samples of depository institutions and households and econometric cross - section analysis -- the share of not seasonally adjusted ocd growth apart from trend since the beginning of the year attributable to demand deposits is estimated to be : about 75 to 80 percent in january , and 70 to 75 percent in february , march , and april .
a PAR 15 iii-2 $ 200 million per month in the first several months of the year .
a PAR 15 trend growth represents the expansion in ocd balances associated with accounts in existence prior to the nationwide extension of now accounts on decem- ber 31 , 1980 and is reflected in the fomc 's percent differential in the shift adjusted 1981 growth ranges for m1-a and m1-b .
a PAR 15 shift - adjusted m1-b is derived by subtracting from seasonally adjusted m1-b an estimate of seasonally adjusted inflows into ocd ( apart from trend growth ) from non - demand deposit sources .
a PAR 15 seasonally adjusted ocd equals seasonally adjusted m1-b less seasonally adjusted m1-a .
a PAR 15 table 1 compares seasonally adjusted m1-b on the previous and re- vised basis .
a PAR 15 differences mainly reflect the seasonal adjustment of ocd for the first time , rather than updated seasonal adjustment factors for other components .
a PAR 15 the december and april levels were both revised down- ward a bit and average growth over this period was only moderately af- fected .
a PAR 15 however , the monthly growth pattern has been affected more sig- nificantly .
a PAR 15 growth in january and february of this year has been raised while growth in april , and to a lesser extent march , has been lowered .
a PAR 15 growth in shift - adjusted m1-b in the first quarter -- shown on the right- hand side of the table - was slightly in excess of 1 percent at an annual rate under the new procedure , about 1¾ percentage points more than under the previous one .
a PAR 15 1 . such amounts are derived by cumulating monthly inflows from non- demand deposit sources ( not seasonally adjusted ) .
a PAR 15 these amounts in turn are estimated by multiplying the monthly increase in ocd ( not seasonally adjusted ) in excess of trend in end - of - year ocd balances ( not seasonally adjusted ) by the mid - points of the monthly ranges for the share estimated to have come from non - demand deposits .
a PAR 15 cumulative amounts are then sea- sonally adjusted by applying the seasonal factor for commercial bank sav- ings deposits .
a PAR 15 iii-3 table 2 presents revisions to m-2 .
a PAR 15 changes in m-2 reflect revi- sions to m1-b as well as changes in seasonal adjustment factors for non- transaction deposits at banks and thrifts .
a PAR 15 growth in the first four months of 1981 is smoother under the revised procedure , as relatively slow growth in january and february has been boosted while growth in march and april has been lowered .

a PAR 15 iv estimates of the sources of growth in other checkable deposits to put recent movements in the transaction component of the narrow money stock in an economically meaningful perspective requires that ob- served data for m1-a and m1-b be adjusted for the distorting effects of the public 's response to the authorization of nationwide now accounts .
a PAR 15 the magnitudes of the adjustments each month are computed on the basis of estimates of the sources of funds deposited in other checkable
a PAR 15 depos- its ( ocd ) .
a PAR 15 available evidence suggests the following fractions of net inflows to ocd were shifted or diverted from demand deposits : 75 to 80 percent in january and 70 to 75 percent in february , march , and april .
a PAR 15 application of the midpoints of the estimated ranges to observed deposit flows for each month yields an adjusted measure of m-1b in the first quarter of 1981 that rose 1 percent at an annual rate from the observed level of the preceding quarter ( table 1).1 the estimated proportion of growth in ocd coming from demand depos- its may be viewed as a weighted average of that fraction applicable to inflows at commercial banks and that applicable at thrifts , with the weights being the institutions ' respective shares of growth in ocd .
a PAR 15 ta- ble 2 displays key results of sample surveys conducted by the federal reserve banks and the federal home loan bank board and results of cross- 1 . to derive seasonally adjusted m1-b that abstracts from shifts in 1981 into ocd from non - demand deposit sources , an estimate of seasonally adjusted inflows to ocd from these sources must be subtracted from m1-b .
a PAR 15 for a description of this procedure , see appendix iii .
a PAR 15 iv-2 section regression analyses of deposit flows .
a PAR 15 the figures in the final column provide the primary basis for the range of the estimated propor- tions of inflows to ocd that originated in demand deposits .
a PAR 15 both regression analysis of deposit flows at individual commercial banks and special surveys of commercial banks conducted by the reserve banks suggest a slight drop in the proportion of ocd growth at commer- cial banks coming from demand deposits after january .
a PAR 15 on the other hand , the fhlbb surveys indicate that the proportion of growth in ocd at thrifts coming from outside such institutions rose somewhat - from 59 per- cent in january to 66 percent in march .
a PAR 15 assuming the composition of these funds from outside thrifts is the same as the overall composition of inflows to ocd at commercial banks , the estimated fraction of ocd at thrifts coming from demand deposits appeared to stay in the vicinity of 50 percent .
a PAR 15 consideration was also given to results of three surveys of households conducted by the survey research center of the university of michigan in february , march , and april .
a PAR 15 taking combined results of the three surveys , households estimated on average that about 71 percent of 1 .
a PAR 15 the sample surveys elicited estimates by commercial banks and sav- ings and loan associations of the sources of inflows to their new now accounts .
a PAR 15 respondents consisted of 9 banks in each federal reserve dis- trict and 8 s&ls in each federal home loan bank district .
a PAR 15 in the re- gression analyses , estimates of the proportion of ocd growth coming from demand deposits were obtained by regressing ( across commercial banks )
a PAR 15 changes in demand deposits on changes in ocd , using data from about 9,000 banks that report weekly for reserve requirement purposes .
a PAR 15 the estima- ted slope coefficient represents the share of ocd growth accounted for by intrabank shifts from demand deposits .
a PAR 15 a similar technique was used to estimate intrabank shifts from savings deposits .
a PAR 15 the regression re- sults were combined with information from the sample surveys to obtain estimates of the proportion from interbank and other sources .
a PAR 15 iv-3 the funds used to open new interest - bearing transaction accounts in 1981 originated in demand deposits .
a PAR 15 1 . although about 700 households were interviewed in each survey , the number of new interest - bearing transaction accounts opened since year- end by the respondents in the three surveys combined was only 170 .
a PAR 15 in light of the small sample size , less weight was given to the household surveys than to other results .
a PAR 15 current plans are to conduct an expan- ded one - time survey in june that will include about 5,000 households , likely providing a sample of about 500 now accounts opened this year .

a PAR 15 i/ the adjusted growth rates in january reflect changes from the observed decenber 1980 levels ( unadjusted for the impact of shifting to ats accounts last year ) to january levels adjusted to eliminate the estimated effects of shifts to new now accounts .
a PAR 15 such adjustment facilitates consistent comparison with target ranges for growth in 1981 , which are expressed in terms of changes from observed ( unadjusted ) levels outstanding in the fourth quarter of 1980 to adjusted levels in the fourth quarter of 1981 .

a PAR 15 s&ls provided estimates for the proportion of growth in ocds that came from outside their institutions , but they did not estimate the frac- tion coming specifically from demand deposits .
a PAR 15 each method below assumes the proportion of these funds from outside thrifts that came from demand deposits to be equal to the overall fraction estimated for commercial banks .
a PAR 15 for example , in january s&ls estimated that 59 percent of their new ocds came from outside their institutions .
a PAR 15 thus , the thrift fraction used in the top line of the table-48.7-is the product of 59 percent and the 82.5 percent fraction at commercial banks .
a PAR 15 2 . commercial bank surveys were conducted for the january period , for the february to early march period , and for the april period ; s&l surveys were conducted for january and for march .

c PAR 6 the m-1b growth targets abstract from the estimated impact of nationwide now accounts , as do the committee 's longer - run targets.1/ ( more detailed and longer - run data for the aggregates , on both an adjusted and unadjusted basis , including those for m-1a , are shown in the tables on pp .
c PAR 6 6 and 7 . )
c PAR 6 the last line of the table indicates federal funds rate ranges thought by the staff to be consistent with the three alternatives .
c PAR 6 c growth from april to june growth from march to june intermeeting federal funds rate range 15 to 20 16 to 21 17 to 22 1/ the estimated portion of now growth coming from demand deposits is 72.5 percent in march and april .
c PAR 6 this ratio for april is slightly higher than earlier expected .
c PAR 6 with no evidence of a drop in the ratio for the past three months , as noted in appendix iv , the staff has assumed that the ratio will remain between 70 and 75 percent over the balance of the year .
c PAR 6 in addition to more of the increase in now accounts coming out of demand deposits , the total increase in now accounts thus far this year is proceeding at a faster pace than had been assumed when the committee set its long - run target for 1981 in february .
c PAR 6 at that time , the observed increase in m-1b consistent with the shift - adjusted m-1b target for the year of 3 to 6 percent was expected to be 6 to 8½ per- cent ( assuming an increase above trend in now related accounts of about $ 40 billion , close to the increase that has already occurred ) .
c PAR 6 we would now estimate that the longer - run range for observed m-1b may have to be increased by about 1 percentage point to 7 to 9½ percent for 1981 ( with an increase in now and related accounts for the year of about $ 55 billion ) .
c PAR 6 the consistent observed m-1a range will probably be reduced by about 2 percentage points to a range of -7 to -4 percent for 1981 .

c PAR 6 to achieve this short - run target would require growth of narrow money at a 1¼ percent annual rate on average in may and june , with june probably needing to show a contraction in the outstanding level of money .
c PAR 10 all of the alternatives contemplate slower growth in m-2 than expected at the time of the committee 's previous meeting , when a march to june m-2 target of 10 percent was considered acceptable .
c PAR 10 we would now expect growth of m-2 at about a 7 to 8 percent annual rate over the march - june period for alternative c . somewhat higher growth rates would be expected under alternatives a and b. the slower march - june growth projected for m-2 essentially reflects the unexpectedly sharp deceleration recently in growth of its nontransactions component , including both small time and savings deposits and money market funds .
c PAR 10 money market fund growth is expected to remain weak over the near - term , and particularly so if market interest rates rise and thereby temporarily widen their spread over mmmf yields .
c PAR 10 as shown in chart 2 , the level of m-2 in june would be at the upper bound of its longer - run range for the year under alternative c , while it would remain somewhat above the range under the other two alternatives .
c PAR 14 the outlook for interest rates under all three alternatives suggests continued weakness in mortgage demands and also intense earnings pressures on thrift institutions , with alternative c implying a higher probability of a number of failures this summer .
c PAR 14 moreover , with their deposit flows weak -- and less than they may have anticipated -- some institu- tions may find it necessary to draw down their stock of liquid assets .
c PAR 14 although the new mortgage instruments recently approved by the fhlbb are likely to be translated into an increased willingness of thrifts to make mortgage loans , their impact on interest income will be modest for some time .
