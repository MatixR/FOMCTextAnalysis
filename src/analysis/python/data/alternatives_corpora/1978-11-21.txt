a SENT -- b m-1 1 to 6 ½ to 5½ m-2 6½ to 10½ 6 to 10 addendum : m-1 + 2 to 6 1½ to 5½ federal funds rate ( intermeeting period ) 9¼ to 10 9¾ to 10½ ( 9 ) alternative a contemplates a federal funds rate between now and the next meeting centered in the prevailing 9½ to 9¾ per cent range .
a PAR 11 expansion of m-2 under alternative a is likely to be in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range over the november - december period .
a PAR 11 the interest - bearing component of this aggregate will be buoyed by shifts from demand to ats savings accounts , as well as by some expected shifts of funds from thrift accounts and other nonbank sources as the public attempts to meet minimum balance require- ments on the new transactions accounts .
a PAR 11 the total of other interest- bearing deposits in m-2 is expected to moderate slightly from the third quarter pace , despite the recent higher level of market rates of interest .
a PAR 11 issuance of 6-month money market time deposits ( mmtds ) and large - denomination certificates is expected to offset a further contraction of nontransferable savings accounts and fixed ceiling rate time deposits .
a PAR 11 banks are likely to continue offering mmtds and large - denomination time deposits aggressively in order to finance their lending .
a PAR 11 mmtds are particularly attractive to large banks since their effective cost is currently below that on large- denomination cd 's by about 1 percentage point .

a PAR 11 p - preliminary
a PAR 13 if the federal funds rate remains around the 9½ to 9¾ per cent level over the intermeeting period , as envisioned under alternative a , short - term market rates may show mixed changes .
a PAR 13 private short - term credit demands are expected to remain relatively strong in coming weeks .
a PAR 13 nonetheless , the relatively wide spread between rates on private short - term instruments and the federal funds rate may tend to narrow as it becomes clear that the system is not tightening its policy stance further .
a PAR 13 the treasury is expected to offer a sizable volume of cash management bills in early december and to continue to put more emphasis on 3-month bills in its weekly bill offering .
a PAR 13 thus , rates on shorter - term treasury bills may tend to move up somewhat from current relatively low levels , unless foreign central bank acquisitions of these instruments once again become sizable .
a PAR 13 with regard to longer - term markets , the expected issuance of foreign - currency denominated securities will likely reduce the volume of debt issued in the u.s . market over the next few months .
a PAR 13 with a modest calendar of corporate and tax - exempt issues also in prospect , bond yields are unlikely to rise from current levels and may even decline .
a PAR 13 mortgage rates , on the other hand , can be expected to move higher as demands for loans continue strong at a time when the thrift inflows are expected to slow .
a SENT -- in view of the monetary restraint already in train , the midpoint of the alternative a path would call for no further increase in the funds rate over this period .
a SENT -- this additional restraint on monetary expansion implies that the funds rate could be lower than the alternative a path by next summer while still achieving the same growth in the aggregates over the qiii ' 78 to qiii ' 79 period .

b PAR 14 under alternative b , the federal funds rate would rise by mid - december to the midpoint of a 9¾ to 10½ per cent range .
b PAR 14 m-1 growth would likely be in a ½ to 5½ per cent annual rate range over november - december , and m-1 + and m-2 , respectively in 1½ to 5½ and 6 to 10 per cent ranges .
b PAR 14 the further increases in short - term rates would slow m-2 and m-3 growth only modestly , as more aggressive offerings of 6-month certificates and large - denomination time deposits could be expected partly to offset weakness in other deposits .
b SENT -- the alternative b pattern contemplates that the increase in the funds rate in the intermeeting period would be maintained through the first quarter of 1979 .
