a SENT -- a considerably higher ultimate level for the funds rate is envisaged under alternative a , since it would be necessary to offset later the effects of near - term easing in reserve conditions contemplated by that alternative .
a SENT -- alternative " money market " proposals alternative a to implement this policy , while taking account of develop- ments in domestic and international financial markets , the committee seeks to achieve somewhat easier bank reserve and money market condi- tions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period immediately ahead , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected .

b PAR 11 growth in m2 over the may - june period is expected to remain relatively rapid under alternatives a and b. nevertheless , growth under alternative b -- as measured by the mid - point of a 7 - 11 per cent , annual rate , range -- is expected to be slower than during the first four months of the year .
b PAR 11 this reflects the higher level of market interest rates that has developed as well as some shift of funds out of savings and time deposits in payment for the $ 4.7 billion of new 10-year notes recently offered by the treasury .

b PAR 11 appendix a comparison of " targeted " and actual reserves the table below compares the actual average level of reserves for the 4 week period ending may 19 with the " targeted " level that had been thought to be consistent with the mid - points of the short - run ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted at the last fomc meeting .
b PAR 11 actual 1/   " targeted " difference nonborrowed reserves 34,136 33,886 250 total reserves 34,190 33,964 226 monetary base 113,870 113,234 636 memorandum : member bank borrowing excess reserves 1/ includes week of may 19 , which is partly projected .
b PAR 11 as can be seen , nonborrowed reserves during the intermeeting period turned out to be $ 250 million higher than " targeted .
b PAR 11 " in evaluat- ing the relationship between " targeted " and actual reserves during the period just past , it needs to be recognized that the fomc adopted a federal funds rate range--4 - 1/2 to 5 - 1/4 per cent -- that was somewhat lower than the range the staff had believed consistent with the chosen monetary and reserve aggregates -- which was 4 - 3/4 to 5 - 3/4 per cent .
b PAR 11 thus , the chances of hitting the nonborrowed " target " were reduced by the particular federal funds rate constraint adopted .
b PAR 11 given the actual federal funds rate , about $ 50 million more in nonborrowed reserves had to be supplied to accomodate larger bank demands for free reserves ( excess reserves minus borrowings ) than the a - 2 have had to rise sufficiently in the short run to limit expansion in deposits and required reserves .
b PAR 11 upward rate pressures would have been most pronounced in pursuing a monetary base target , given the need to reduce total reserves in order to offset the very rapid expansion in currency that took place .
b PAR 11 a - 3 staff had assumed .
b PAR 11 in addition , reserve demands were considerably strengthened as required reserves turned out to be $ 200 million higher than originally expected at the time of the last fomc meeting .
b PAR 11 this reflected stronger deposits than earlier anticipated .
b PAR 11 however , the multiplier relationship between lagged deposits and current required reserves turned out to be higher than anticipated , and therefore held down the increase in required reserves that would otherwise have been associated with deposit growth .
b PAR 11 if the desk had restrained nonborrowed reserves further , banks would have been forced to borrow their required reserves and/or to reduce deposit expansion .
b PAR 11 however , given the sgrength in deposit demand , and assuming an orderly upward adjustment in the funds rate , the nonborrowed reserve " target " ( within a $ 50 million range ) probably would not have been achieved even if the upper limit of the funds rate constraint had been as high as 5 - 3/4 per cent .
b PAR 11 actual total reserves differed from " target " by about the same magnitude as nonborrowed reserves .
b PAR 11 the monetary base showed a much larger overshoot , reflecting the considerably greater than anticipated rise in currency .
b PAR 11 in sum , if the desk had adhered to a nonborrowed target , upward interest rate pressures would have been stronger over the intermeeting period .
b PAR 11 such pressures would have been even stronger if attempts had been made to achieve the total reserve target , since interest rates would appendix table 1-a money and credit aggregate measures may 14 , 1976 bank credit money stock bank reserves v measures measures total period adj .

b SENT -- as may be seen , the staff expects that under alternative b the funds rate would peak out at around 8 - 1/2 per cent early next year .

c PAR 12 under alternative c , growth in m2 is expected to slow more markedly over the may - june period .
c PAR 12 the further rise in the federal funds rate that is envisaged would lead to a continued rise in other short - term rates , with the 3-month treasury bill rate likely to move up to the 5 - 3/4 - 6 per cent area .
c PAR 12 this would probably lead to a considerable outflow from savings deposits of those interest - sensitive funds that were shifted into such accounts when short - term market rates first moved down to around 5 per cent , the regulation q ceiling rate on commercial banks ' savings deposits .
c PAR 13 the firming of money market conditions associated with alternative c would also exert upward pressure on longer - term interest rates over the next few weeks .
c PAR 13 loan demands are still focused more on securities markets than on banks .
c PAR 13 the corporate bond calendar has built up further in recent weeks , partly in anticipation of higher interest rates later , and the municipal calendar remains sizable .
c PAR 13 moreover , the treasury is likely to continue raising much of its new cash in the coupon area .
c PAR 13 even if the federal funds rate stabilizes around 5 - 1/4 per cent between now and the next committee meeting -- as is contemplated under alternative b-- some further upward adjustment in longer - term , as well as short - term inter- est rates may still occur , since markets probably have not yet fully adjusted to a 5 - 1/4 per cent funds rate .
