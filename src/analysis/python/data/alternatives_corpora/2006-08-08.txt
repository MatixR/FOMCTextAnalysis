b PAR 12 the current policy stance would be consistent with prescriptions from the estimated forecast - based policy rule ( chart 5 ) as well as the first - difference rule with a long - run inflation objective of 2 percent ( chart 6 ) .
b PAR 12 ( see the box “ intercept shifts in empirical taylor rules . ” )   a pause at this meeting , after seventeen consecutive actions , might be seen as desirable in order to limit the risk of over - tightening and the adverse consequences for employment and growth .
b PAR 12 with the real federal funds rate in the range of model - based estimates of its equilibrium value ( chart 8) , the risk that deferring action for a brief time might significantly worsen underlying inflationary trends would seem to be modest .
b PAR 12 nonetheless , the committee may feel that elevated energy   and commodity prices , possible further increases in these prices , and high levels of resource utilization imply that the upside risks to inflation remain substantial and perceive only limited downside risks to the economic expansion , and so see intercept shifts in empirical policy rules
b PAR 12 chart 5 shows the projections of two empirical policy rules — specified in terms of either outcomes or forecasts of the output gap and core inflation — that have been estimated using quarterly data from 1988q1 to 2005q4 .
b PAR 12 in previous bluebooks , both of these rules involved a time - invariant intercept , essentially implying that the medium - run equilibrium real rate ( r * ) and the implicit inflation objective ( π * ) remained constant throughout the sample period .
b PAR 12 however , recent staff analysis indicates that a significant upward shift in the intercept of each empirical rule occurred in the late 1990s .
b PAR 12 such a shift could arise from either a 75 basis point rise in r * , a 1 percentage point decline in π * , or some combination of the two .
b PAR 12 the funds rate projections and confidence intervals shown in chart 5 incorporate these intercept shifts .
b PAR 12 the projections generated by the forecast - based rule are broadly similar to the expectations of market participants , while the outcome - based rule points to some additional firming .
b PAR 12 reflecting the possibility of an upward shift in the value of r

b PAR 12 ( either 1½ or 2 percent ) , the new rule follows taylor ( 1999 ) with respect to the policy coefficients — which determine the responsiveness of the funds rate to movements in the output gap and core inflation — but specifies the value of r at 2.75 percent instead of 2 percent .

b PAR 12 explanatory notes the equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that , if maintained , would be projected to return output to its potential level over time .
b PAR 12 for the first three measures listed below , the short - run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model ’s projection of the economy .
b PAR 12 for the first two measures , the medium - run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter .
b PAR 12 the tips - based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead .
b PAR 12 the actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation , where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate , and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the staff ’s estimate of the core pce price index and its lagged value four quarters earlier .
b PAR 12 for the current quarter , the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the bluebook publication date .
b PAR 12 measure description single - equation model
b PAR 12 the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .
b PAR 12 in light of this model ’s simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .
b PAR 12 small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .
b PAR 12 unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .
b PAR 12 large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using
b PAR 12 frb / us—
b PAR 12 the staff ’s
b PAR 12 large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy — depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model ’s exogenous variables .
b PAR 12 these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .
b PAR 12 thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .
b PAR 12 greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .
b PAR 12 rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .
b PAR 12 frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,
b PAR 12 and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .
b PAR 12 the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .
b PAR 12 tips - based factor model yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) reflect investors ’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates , but also include term and liquidity premiums .
b PAR 12 the tips - based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven - year - ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date .
b PAR 12 this forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three - factor arbitrage - free term - structure model applied to tips yields , nominal yields , and inflation .
b PAR 12 because tips indexation is based on the total cpi , this measure is also adjusted for the medium - term difference — projected at 40 basis points
b PAR 12 —between total cpi inflation and core pce inflation .
b PAR 12 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 39 additional firming as more likely than easing in coming months .
b PAR 12 the committee may find communicating this posture particularly important if it were concerned that inaction at this meeting might lead investors to question its vigilance against inflation .
b PAR 13 under alternative b , the rationale paragraph in the statement would indicate that economic growth has moderated , noting the role of the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices and of the continuing cooling of the housing market .
b PAR 13 while acknowledging the elevated readings on core inflation , it would also cite the reasons to expect inflation to decline in coming quarters : contained inflation expectations , the cumulative effects of past policy firmings , and other factors restraining aggregate demand .
b PAR 13 in its assessment of risks , the committee would reiterate its judgment that some upside inflation risks remain and point to the possibility of additional firming
b PAR 13 should incoming information warrant such action .
b PAR 14 investors see about a one - third chance of a policy firming at this meeting and appear to anticipate a statement similar to that under alternative b .   as a result , the market reaction to implementation of this alternative would likely be fairly small .
b PAR 14 while short - term interest rates would decline somewhat , intermediate- and long - term rates , stock prices , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar probably would change little .

c PAR 18 the committee may judge instead that an additional 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting , as in alternative c , is needed to bring the risks to the outlook for inflation and economic growth into better balance .
c PAR 18 a firming at this meeting might be appropriate if the staff ’s inflation forecast were seen as likely and generally acceptable but the committee wished to have slightly greater assurance that inflation would diminish in coming quarters .
c PAR 18 members might worry that inflation pressures could turn out to be a little greater than projected in the greenbook .
c PAR 18 the economy has proved quite resilient in the face of higher oil prices and tighter monetary policy over the past two years , and members may see economic growth as most likely to rebound from its sharply slower pace in the second quarter .
c PAR 18 in light of the recent upside surprises in price data , raising the federal funds rate at this meeting class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 22 of 39 might also seem desirable as a signal of the committee ’s resolve to foster a decline in inflation .
c PAR 18 even with the firming action under this alternative , the committee may judge that significant upside risks to inflation remain .
c PAR 18 however , some members may see the slowing in the expansion of aggregate demand of late as suggesting that the downside risks to growth have increased since the last meeting .
c PAR 18 the committee might see alternative c as bringing the risks to the attainment of its growth and price stability objectives roughly in balance and believe that , after implementation of such a policy choice , an easing and a tightening of policy are about equally probable .
c PAR 20 with market participants placing less than fifty - fifty odds on a policy move at this meeting , short - term interest rates would likely jump in response to implementation of alternative c .   however , the effect on intermediate - term interest rates would be considerably more muted , and long - term rates could even decline a little should the announcement persuade investors that inflation pressures were less intense than they had appreciated or that the committee was seeking a slightly lower long - term rate of inflation than they had previously perceived .   despite the rise in short - term interest rates , with policy tightening evidently having drawn to a close , class
c PAR 20 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 23 of 39 equity prices might rally .
c PAR 20 the foreign exchange value of the dollar might be little affected .

d PAR 21 if members were dissatisfied with the gradual and limited reduction in inflation in the staff forecast and favored a trajectory of policy that would foster a steeper decline , they might wish to adopt the action and language of alternative
d PAR 21 the optimal policy path simulations of the frb / us model ( chart 7 ) and the first- difference rule ( chart 6 ) , with a long - term inflation objective equal to 1½ percent , would both call for additional firming of policy even following a 25 basis point tightening at the august meeting .
d PAR 21 the committee may also find alternative d attractive if it deems the outlook for employment and growth to be more favorable than the staff projection .
d PAR 21 moreover , members may be concerned that the staff has underestimated the persistence of the forces that have boosted inflation , possible consequences of which are illustrated by the “ persistent inflation ” alternative greenbook scenario .
d PAR 21 indeed , the optimal policy path suggested by a simulation of the frb / us model under perfect foresight in this scenario would call for considerable additional policy firming in coming months .
d PAR 21 however , the policy response would be tempered in the more realistic circumstance that the persistence of the inflationary forces became clear only gradually over time ( see box on next page ) .
d PAR 21 even if the committee saw the staff inflation forecast as the most likely outcome , and one that would be satisfactory , it might find this alternative appealing if it were persuaded by recent price data that the upside risks to inflation , and the potential costs should these risks be realized , continued to predominate despite an additional 25 basis points increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting .
d PAR 21 the potential for further increases in energy prices , for example as a result of mounting geopolitical tensions , could be a reason for such worries .
d PAR 22 while acknowledging the moderation in economic growth and other forces that are expected to contain inflation in coming quarters , the rationale paragraph class
d PAR 22 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 24 of 39 persistent inflation :   implications of alternative policy assumptions
d PAR 22 the policy path implied by a simple rule — such as the empirical outcome - based rule shown in chart 5 and used in analyzing the alternative scenarios in the greenbook— often differs from the optimal policy when policymakers fully understand the forces affecting the real economy and inflation , but may well yield prescriptions close to those under the optimal policy when these forces become evident only gradually .
d PAR 22 for example , the chart below compares these alternative policy assumptions in the context of the greenbook
d PAR 22 ’s ‘ persistent inflation ’ scenario , in which the recent rise in core inflation is much more persistent than in the staff ’s current projection .
d PAR 22 the solid lines depict the optimal policy and associated macroeconomic outcomes ( as deviations from baseline ) when policymakers have perfect foresight about the persistence of the inflation pressures and place equal weight on the objectives of stabilizing inflation , stabilizing unemployment , and avoiding sharp funds rate changes .
d PAR 22 in this case , the optimal policy involves a 75 basis point funds rate hike by the end of 2006 .
d PAR 22 in contrast , if the persistence of the shock does not become apparent until mid-2007 , the optimal policy with gradual learning ( dashed lines ) generates a funds rate trajectory over the next six quarters that lies between the path obtained under perfect foresight and the path associated with the empirical outcome - based rule ( dotted lines ) , in which policy responds to contemporaneous four - quarter average core inflation and to contemporaneous and lagged output gaps .
d PAR 22 all three policy paths generate fairly similar trajectories for inflation , reflecting the relatively sluggish inflation dynamics in the frb / us model .

d PAR 22 the risk assessment could be similar to the committee
d PAR 22 ’s statement in june , indicating that additional firming may be needed , but reference an intention to foster a moderation in inflation pressures .
d PAR 23 the policy choice and announcement of alternative d would come as a considerable surprise to market participants and lead to an upward revision of their outlook for the path of policy .
d PAR 23 short- and intermediate - term interest rates would climb significantly .
d PAR 23 longer - term rates probably would also rise , especially if investors read the statement as suggesting that they should be more concerned about inflation prospects , but the increase would be limited if market participants also revised downward their perceptions of the committee ’s long - term inflation objective .
d PAR 23 equity prices would likely fall , while the foreign exchange value of the dollar might rise .
