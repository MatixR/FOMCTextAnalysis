a PAR 11 for purposes of monetary targeting between now and the july 9 fomc meeting , however , the committee may wish to target a somewhat slower money growth of 7 percent for the two months of may and june , given the relatively moderate growth that is is not likely to involve any appreciable change in the funds rate from its recent trading range of 10½ to 11½ percent .
a PAR 11 the federal funds rate range suggested for alternative
a PAR 11 a is 10 to 14 percent .
a PAR 11 the suggested lower limit is a bit lower than that currently in place to provide for some operational flexibility .
a PAR 11 the proposed upper limit has been lowered to 14 percent on the thought that the committee might wish to limit fluctuations on the upside , given the recent shortfall in money growth and the apparent weakness in the economy .

a PAR 12 looking beyond the current quarter , some upward pressure on interest rates might develop .
a PAR 12 the recent weakness in m-1a has left it well short of what might have been expected on the basis of historical relationships among money , income , and interest rates .
a PAR 12 thus , although nominal gnp is projected to rise at only a 5½ percent annual rate in the second half of the year , our econometric models would suggest that , at current interest rates , money would tend to grow much more rapidly than that , and probably somewhat in excess of the 7½ percent alternative a path , as the public attempts to restore recently depleted cash balances .
a PAR 12 this would generate upward rate pressures at a time when income velocity of m-1a would be declining , a reversal of the normal situation.1/ if , however , the recent evident weakness in m-1a should prove largely to represent a lasting shift in the public 's liquidity preferences , then upward rate pressures might be minimal , or indeed there could be some further downward drift in rates .
a PAR 13 the specifications for alternative a call for a considerable pick - up in growth of m-2 for the may - june period , to about a 7¾ percent annual rate .
a PAR 13 the implied rate of growth for the nontransactions component of this aggregate period -- at around an 8 percent rate -- is considerably higher than has occurred recently .
a PAR 13 a return to mmmf growth after the decline associated with the march 14 actions appears already to have begun , and with market rates far below their recent peaks , growth of small time and savings deposits , especially the 2½ year variable ceiling certificates , is expected to pick up .
a PAR 14 with the federal funds rate essentially unchanged in the near term , as contemplated under alternative a , other market interest rates probably would hold near current levels or edge upward a bit , especially if and as monetary growth strengthened perceptibly .
a PAR 14 a limited back - up in market rates , however , is unlikely to halt the downtrend of bank loan and mortgage rates , rates that are still high relative to competitive instruments .
a PAR 14 business credit demands in the period ahead may still fall relatively heavily on the corporate bond markets , as firms continue efforts to restructure their balance sheets at what appear to be relatively attractive long - term yields .
a PAR 14 but even so loan growth at banks could pick up , particularly if recent loan weakness makes banks a bit more sanguine about their ability to remain within loan restraint guidelines .
a PAR 14 1/ of course , at this point it seems likely that the opposite , and also unusual , pattern will prevail in the second quarter -- a sharp rise in velocity and a substantial decline of interest rates .
a PAR 15 to achieve the growth in aggregates for the may - june period specified under alternative a , total reserves would have to expand at about a 4 percent annual rate from april to june .
a PAR 15 nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 27 percent annual rate , assuming a frictional level of adjustment borrowing from reserve banks on the order of $ 100 to $ 200 million ( and continued special borrowing of about $ 750 million ) .
a SENT -- with borrowing at frictional levels , as in alternative a , nonborrowed reserves would increase at a 28 percent rate .

b PAR 10 against this background , the committee , in framing its approach to operations between now and the next meeting , may wish to consider policies that recognize the high probability of a shortfall in growth of the aggregates over the first half of the year and that aim to get the aggregates back on path over a longer period .
b PAR 10 two such alternatives are presented below , and depicted in the charts on the following pages .
b PAR 10 alternative
b PAR 10 a is designed to achieve a level of m-1a in december equal to that implied by the midpoint growth path of the 3½ to 6 percent range for this aggregate over the qiv ' 79 to qiv ' 80 period .
b PAR 10 growth in m-2 would follow similar patterns .
