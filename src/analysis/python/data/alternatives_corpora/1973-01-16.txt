a PAR 18 the funds rate under such conditions is likely to be most frequently in the 5 - 3/8 - -5 - 7/8 per cent area .
a PAR 18 if the funds rate were to remain near the upper end of that band , the 3-month bill rate probably would be within a 5 - 1/4 - -5 - 1/2 per cent range over the next several weeks .
a PAR 18 upward bill rate pressures could be moderated in the near - term , however , by demands for bills from state and local governments who have just received their january revenue - sharing distribution .
a PAR 18 in addition , apart from additions to the weekly and monthly bill auctions , the next sizable bill offering is not expected until early march , as noted earlier .
a PAR 19 long - term interest rates may not rise very much under alternative a , but would probably show greater upward adjustments , at least in the short - run , under alternatives b and c. demands on bond markets can be expected to be generally moderate this month and next .
a PAR 19 the near - term forward calendar of new corporate and municipal issues is relatively modest in size , although there are indications that the volume could build up in the spring .
a PAR 19 mortgage market demands , though remaining large in volume , appear to have crested .
a PAR 19 pressures on long- term rates are thus most likely to come from the supply side , as.banks and other institutional investors find that their inflows of funds are dropping off or becoming significantly more expensive -- conditions most likely to develop under alternatives b and c. bank interest in secur- ities and mortgages is likely to be lessened in any event as business loan demands continue strong , partly to help businesses finance the anticipated acceleration in the rate of inventory accumulation .

b PAR 11 the short - run ranges of tolerance for the monetary aggregates remain on the high side of longer - run targets .
b PAR 11 for example , in alternative b , the january - february m 1 growth is indicated at per cent , as compared with the 5 - -6 per cent longer - run target .
b PAR 11 it is expected that revenue sharing payments in january and the beginning of tax refunds next month will exert some temporary stimulus to growth in holdings of cash and time and savings deposits .

b PAR 13 to achieve the aggregates of alternative b , the staff expects that money market conditions will tighten from around prevail- ing levels , given the continuing strong transaction demands for money implicit in the rapid growth in nominal gnp projected for the first and second quarters .
b PAR 13 the potential for money market tightening implied by the alternative b monetary target paths is indicated by the 5 - 5/8 - -6 - 1/4 per cent federal funds rate range shown for that alternative .
b PAR 13 even with rpd over the forthcoming january - february period rising in a 10 - -12 per cent annual rate range , we would expect the funds rate to move up to 6 per cent or somewhat above by the time of the next meeting .
b PAR 13 but it should be noted that even - keel considerations -- discussed in paragraphs ( 16 ) and ( 17)--would suggest that the most propitious time for a rise in the funds rate , should one be required , is before the end of january .
b PAR 13 a rise in the funds rate of the dimensions contemplated in alternative b would likely be accompanied by a further rise in short - term rates generally , with the 3-month treasury bill rate in particular moving upward in a 5 - 3/8 - -5 - 3/4 per cent range .

c PAR 15 efforts to achieve the reserve and monetary aggregates of alternative c are likely to entail an even greater firming of money market conditions , with the federal funds rate probably moving well above 6 per cent by the time of the next meeting .
c PAR 15 the 3-month bill rate would likely rise into the 5 - 3/4 - -6 per cent area , if not by the time of the next meeting
c PAR 15 then by early march when additional cash borrowing through tax bill offerings may be anticipated .
c PAR 15 if short - term rates attain these levels , there may be a rather marked dampening in flows of consumer- type time and savings deposits , which could eventually call into question the viability of current regulation q ceilings on such deposits .

c PAR 15 ueumao ' - " -- ' appendix a revisions in the m1 series the narrow money stock series -- m1 has been revised to reflect : ( 1 ) benchmark adjustments for domestic nonmember banks ; ( 2 ) benchmark adjustments to incorporate additional international banking institutions ; ( 3 ) the impact of the revised regulation
c PAR 15 j ; and ( 4 ) new seasonal factors .
c PAR 15 these revisions will be described below .
c PAR 15 it should be noted , however , that the revised m 1 series , as well as revisions in the other aggregates , will not be released to the public until early february because final revisions to credit proxy and reserve series are as yet incomplete .
c PAR 15 beginning january 19 , data supplied for internal system purposes only will include the new m1 and m2 series , as well as other revised series as they are completed .
c PAR 15 thus , for approximately two weeks the committee will be receiving revised data while public releases will show the series on the present basis .
c PAR 15 the revised series will be supplied to the public in a press release , with detailed technical explanations provided in the federal reserve bulletin for february .
c PAR 15 seasonal factors the seasonal factor revisions , incorporating the effect of 1972 developments , are minor .
c PAR 15 no changes were made in seasonal factors for january , march , or any month in the second quarter for the demand deposit component seasonal factors .
c PAR 15 the seasonal factors for each month in the third quarter were raised slightly , reducing the level of the seasonally adjusted series , and the factors for february and each month in the fourth quarter were reduced somewhat .
c PAR 15 minor changes also occurred in the seasonal factors for currency .
c PAR 15 in general , these were raised for the second and third quarter months and lowered for the first and fourth quarter months .
c PAR 15 for 1972 data , the seasonal adjustment revision alone reduces the third quarter seasonally adjusted annual rate of growt of m1 by 0.2 percentage points and increases the fourth quarter growth rate by 0.8 percentage points .
c PAR 15 in no month are annual rates of growth changed by more than 2.0 percentage points ( annual rate ) by the new seasonal factors taken alone .
c PAR 15 level adjustments
c PAR 15 other adjustments significantly increase the level of the m1 series back to 1959 .
c PAR 15 the amount of the level adjustment is $ 300 million in 1959 and increases to $ 9.5 billion at the end of 1972 .
c PAR 15 appendix chart 1 compares the level of the old and new seasonally adjusted series weekly for 1971 - 72 . appendix table a-1 displays the components of the level adjustment for three recent dates .
c PAR 15 benchmark revisions for domestic banks .
c PAR 15 m1 estimates are based initially on member bank data with estimates made for nonmember banks based on historical relationships between country member banks and non- member banks .
c PAR 15 these nonmember estimates are then revised when call report data become available .
c PAR 15 based on december 1971 and june 1972 call report information , the past relationship between nonmember and country bank data ( deposits and vault cash ) did not hold in the first half of 1972 , leading to an underestimation of m1 growth at nonmember banks over the year ending in june 1972 , and probably in the second half of 1972 as well .
c PAR 15 as shown in appendix table 1 , the level of m1 has been increased by about $ 1 billion at the end of 1971 and by $ 1.9 billion at the end of 1972 .
c PAR 15 foreign banking institutions .
c PAR 15 in december 1970 , the m1 series was revised to incorporate the impact of foreign banking institutions operating in the u.s .
c PAR 15 this adjustment eliminated the overstatement of cash items ( understatement of m1 ) associated with the clearings of these banks and also added their m 1 type balances to the money supply series .
c PAR 15 at that time , data for a few new york city institutions were not available .
c PAR 15 the new series now incorporates the impact of these institutions on the m1 series .
c PAR 15 as shown in appendix table a - l , this revision increases the narrow money stock by about $ 3 billion in 1972 , and by lesser amounts back to 1959 .
c PAR 15 j revisions .
c PAR 15 prior to the november 9 revision of regulation j , the m1 series had been biased downward by the timing of bank payment for federal reserve cash letters .
c PAR 15 this downward bias was eliminated by the revision in regulation j which reduced cash items and float , two items deducted from gross demand deposits in the calculation of m1 . since regulation j went into effect , the staff has been adjusting m1 data to remove the effect of the regulatory - induced changes in cash items and float .
c PAR 15 the new series uses actual data after november 9 but reduces cash items and float prior to november 9 to remote a one time break in m1 associated with the change in regulation
c PAR 15 j. this adjustment has been carried back to 1959 .

c PAR 15 2/ adjustment for overstatement of cash items associated with clearance of checks for a few new york city foreign banking operations and the addition of m1-type liabilities for these institutions .
c PAR 15 3/ adjustment for cash items and float reduction resulting from amended regulation
c PAR 15 j. actual data after november 9 , 1972 and estimated from reserve bank data prior to november 9 , 1972 .
c PAR 15 the regulation j increase in the level of m1 is estimated to be about $ 500 million in december 1959 , growing to about $ 4.5 billion in 1972 , as shown in appendix table a-1 .
c PAR 15 this adjustment adds an average about .1 percentage point per year to the growth in m1 since 1959 .
c PAR 15 annual rates of change while the level of m is raised $ 8 - $ 9 billion in 1972 , and less for previous years , the combined effect of the level adjustments and new seasonal factors on annual rates of change are small .
c PAR 15 comparison of rates of change in the old and new series for recent periods is shown in appendix table a-2 .
c PAR 15 for annual data , the biggest recent changes occur in 1970 and 1971 , which are raised by 0.6 and 0.7 percentage points , respectively .
c PAR 15 semi - annual growth rates for 1972 are changed little , but the second half of 1971 is raised by 1.0 percentage point .
c PAR 15 in 1972 , quarterly growth rates are lowered slightly in the first and third quarters and raised in the second and fourth quarters .
c PAR 15 the fourth quarter of 1971 is raised significantly .
c PAR 15 changes in the 1972 monthly pattern are shown in the right panel of appendix table a-2 .
c PAR 15 three months -- february , september , and october-- are increased by more than 2 percentage points at an annual rate .
c PAR 15 reduction exceeding 2 percentage points occurred in january , july , august , and december .
c PAR 15 finally , for the december - january period the staff 's projected m1 growth is 11 - 1/2 per cent ( annual rate ) on the old basis and 10 per cent ( annual rate ) in the new series .
