b PAR 11 under alternative b , m-2 is expected to accelerate into expected strengthening of m-1 , as well as continuation of the recent pick - up in growth of the interest - bearing component of m-2 .
b PAR 11 the decline in outstanding savings deposits appears to be abating .
b PAR 11 and banks are expected to continue to be more active in the mmc market , as seems to be the case since the mid - march elimination of the rate ceiling differential on these deposits .
b PAR 11 thrift institutions ' deposit inflows , on the other hand , are expected to moderate in the months ahead , largely reflecting the mid - march regulatory actions.1/ thus , their commitment activity is likely to remain limited over the near term , and in order to finance mortgage takedowns thrifts will likely reduce their liquidity and continue to borrow .
