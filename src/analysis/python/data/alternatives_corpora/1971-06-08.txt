a SENT -- under alternative a , we would expect the 3-month bill rate between now and mid - year to be in a 4 - 1/4 - -4 - 3/4 per cent range , and it may be expected to rise somewhat above that range in the summer as the treasury finances large and partly seasonal cash needs .
a SENT -- outstanding large cd 's are expected to show little net change from current levels under alternative a , given the relatively comfortable liquidity position of banks .
a PAR 16 alternative
a PAR 16 the following language is proposed for possible use if the committee decides to call for maintenance of prevail- ing money market conditions , subject to a proviso clause .
a PAR 16 " to implement this policy , [ del : the committee seeks to moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead , taking account of the current treasury financing , developments in capital markets , and uncertain- ties in foreign exchange markets . ]
a PAR 16 system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to [ del : aimed initially at ] maintaining [ del : currently ] prevailing money market conditions ; [ del : and thereafter conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with the above cited objectives . ]
a PAR 16 provided that somewhat firmer conditions shall be sought if it appears that the monetary and credit aggregates are significantly exceeding the growth paths expected and if capital markets are not under excessive pressure .
a PAR 16 if the committee adopts this alternative , it may wish to consider the money market conditions noted for alternative a in paragraph ( 9 ) as a description of " prevailing " conditions , and for purposes of the proviso clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connec- tion with alternative a as the " expected " paths .
a PAR 16 the proviso clause has been formulated in one - way terms , guarding against significant excesses but not shortfalls , on the assumption that the committee would not want money market conditions to be eased in the coming period if the aggregates should fall short of the indicated paths .
a PAR 16 as will be noted , the proposed proviso retains the sense of the reference to capital market developments in the present directive ( i.e. , to take account of such developments in any firming operations ) by indicating that somewhat firmer conditions are to be sought under the proviso only " if capital markets are not under excessive pressure .

b PAR 17 this language is proposed for possible use if the committee decides ( a ) to formulate its primary instruction in terms of desired growth rates for the monetary and credit aggregates ( subject to any constraints that might be imposed by developments in capital markets ) , and ( b ) to adopt as targets for the time being the growth rates discussed earlier in connection with alternative b . " to implement this policy , the committee seeks to moderate growth in monetary [ del : and credit ] aggregates over the months ahead , taking account of [ del : the current treasury financing , ] developments in capital markets [ del : , and uncertainities in foreign exchange markets]. system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be [ del : aimed initially at ]
b PAR 17 [ del : maintianing currently prevailing money market conditions , and thereafter ] conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with the [ del : above cited ] those objectives .
b PAR 17 it is proposed to use the phrase " to moderate growth in monetary aggregates in the months ahead " as a summary description of the objective for the aggregates , deleting the words " and credit " , on the assumption that the committee will not view recent rates of growth in the adjusted proxy as so large as to require moderation .

c PAR 8 the continued strengthening of the aggregates has led the staff to raise its estimates of both the levels of and growth rates in money supply and bank credit that might be expected in the near term at any given level of interest rates .
c PAR 8 in view of recent developments the 8 - 1/2 per cent growth rate in m1 for the second quarter acceptable to the committee at the last meeting appears practically impossible to achieve ( except for accidental developments or substantial projection misses not related to deliberate policy operations ) .
c PAR 8 moreover , the average 8 per cent growth rate over both the second and third quarters together -- which represented the intermediate path acceptable to the committee last time-- would also be very difficult to attain .
c PAR 8 at the present time , such a path would require a very sharp drop to around 4 per cent annual rate in third quarter growth in m1 .
c PAR 8 this would appear to entail a considerable wrench- ing of the money market , with a near - term rise in the federal funds rate so large as seriously to upset capital markets , possibly followed later in the summer or early fall by the need to induce a sharp drop in the funds rate in order to keep m1 growth from falling below even a 4 per cent rate over the fourth quarter .
c PAR 8 though not as magnified , similar control problems could develop in moving onto other less restrictive paths -- for instance , the alternative c path presented for consideration at this time .
c PAR 11 a tightening of the money market between now and mid - year to the degrees indicated by the suggested specifications for alternatives b
c PAR 11 and c would have little effect on growth in m1 during june , but would begin to have more noticeable effects in ensuing months.1/ under alternative
c PAR 11 b the m 1 growth rate in the third quarter would be expected to be reduced to 9 - 1/2 per cent and under alternative c to 8 per cent .
c PAR 11 however , by late summer or early fall , it is our best estimate that the growth rate would be sharply reduced , perhaps in alternative c to only about a 3 - -4 per cent annual rate , although there are great difficulties of course in pinpointing exact months in which low growth rates would be likely to emerge .
c PAR 11 growth at such low rates would continue for some months as sharply higher short - term interest rates gradually reduce the demand for money balances and as higher long - term interest rates over the next few months and possibly weakness in the stock market depress individuals ' net worth ( which also reduces money demand ) .
c PAR 11 thus , during fall the money supply could be growing considerably less than might be desired unless interest rates were moved sharply downward in the interim .
c PAR 18 this language is proposed for possible use if the committee decides to adopt as targets the growth rates dis- cussed earlier in connection with alternative c , and to instruct the desk to move to the money market conditions noted in paragraph ( 9 ) in connec- tion with that alternative . " to implement this policy , [ del : the committee seeks to moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregate over the months ahead , taking account of the current treasury financing , developments in capital markets , and uncer- tainties in foreign exchange markets . ]
c PAR 18 system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be [ del : aimed initially at maintaining currently prevailing money market conditions , and thereafter ] conducted with a view to moving actively to [ del : maintaining ] bank reserves and money market conditions
c PAR 18 [ del : consistent with the above cited objectives ] that will lead to a substantial moderation of growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead .
c PAR 18 this language has been formulated in a manner which the staff believes would underscore the committee 's determination to slow the growth rates in the aggregates .
