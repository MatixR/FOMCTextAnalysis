a SENT -- the more rapid 6½ per cent growth rate for m1 contemplated under alternative a would almost make up for the recent shortfall by year - end .
a PAR 14 expectational effects on markets would be quite strong , and market interest rates generally could be expected to decline rather sharply .
a PAR 14 improvement in the position of thrift institutions would be rather marked , and mortgage rates , after some time , may begin to decline .
a PAR 14 banks could expand cd offerings over the near - term to obtain funds for investment in longer - term market securities while high yields on the securities are still available .
a SENT -- however , the committee may wish to phase in any easing of market conditions over a longer period , particularly under alternative a . thus , the funds rate could be permitted to decline in the inter - meeting period by less than implied by the mid - points of the ranges shown in the summary table of paragraph ( 6 ) , in the expectation that some further decline would be sought later .
a SENT -- for example , under alternative a , a drop in the funds rate to 10¾ per cent over the next five weeks , followed by a further decline to around 10 per cent by mid - november , could be envisaged .
a SENT -- as will be noted , alternative a refers to the rate of growth in monetary aggregates " over recent months .

b PAR 12 adoption of the somewhat higher 5¾ per cent growth rate of alternative b would be expected to entail a further decline in the federal funds rate over the next few weeks to around 11 per cent , the center of the 10 - 12 per cent range shown for this alternative .
b PAR 12 growth of m1 in the september - october period in a 3¼-5¼ per cent annual rate range might be anticipated .
b PAR 12 growth over the fourth and first quarters would be con- siderably higher -- around 6 - 6 per cent , annual rate -- to compensate for the marked weakness expected in september .
b PAR 12 the stimulative impact of the easing in money market conditions on money demand would be felt mainly in the fourth and first quarters ; subsequently growth in m1 could be expected to drop back to around the 5¾ per cent rate .

c PAR 9 the 5¼ per cent growth path for m1 of alternative c is expected to be consistent with a federal funds rate range centering money supply and longer run target paths ratio scale .
c PAR 9 billions of dollars rate of growth a=6 12 % growth
c PAR 9 b=5%% growth c=51/% growth on 11¾ per cent , which is close to the rate that has prevailed on average since the last meeting .
c PAR 9 over the two month september - october period m 1 growth would be expected to be in a 2¾-4¾ per cent , annual rate , range .
c PAR 9 the expectation of a continued relatively low growth rate over the near - term in part reflects the weakness in the fragmentary information thus far available for the early days of september , a period when a substantial recovery in growth had earlier been expected .
c PAR 9 m 1 growth is projected to pick up in october , with growth more rapid over the fourth quarter as a whole , since transactions demands for cash are assumed to strengthen if the staff forecast for about a 7 per cent annual rate of growth in nominal gnp is realized .

c PAR 11 given the market interest rates assumed under alternative c , growth in savings deposits at thrift institutions would be expected to remain barely positive , while net inflows of time deposits other than money market cd 's to banks would be expected to expand at a modest pace .
c PAR 11 banks have reduced reliance on money market cd 's recently , and growth in these instruments over the months ahead would probably be slower than earlier in the year as bank loan growth is projected to abate some-
c PAR 11 the reduced rate of expansion in economic activity is likely to temper bank credit demands , although the needs of borrowers under liquidity pressure could remain substantial .
c PAR 11 the recent board action to remove the marginal reserve requirement on large time deposits maturing in four months or more is assumed to have a marginal effect on the structure of cd 's issued by banks , but to have an insignificant effect on the total amount of cd 's issued .
