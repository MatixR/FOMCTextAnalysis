a PAR 16 the lower interest rates associated with this alternative over the next few weeks are not likely to prove sustainable , however .
a PAR 16 in view of the apparent strength of the economy , interest rates may be expected to rise even with the more rapid longer - run growth in the monetary aggregates encompassed by alternative a . the increase in rates would probably be moderate , though , with the funds rate rising to about 5 per cent by the first quarter of next year .

b PAR 9 under alternative b ( as well as the other two alternatives   , growth in m1 is expected to be relatively sizable in the april - may period , reflecting the large increase in m1 that is apparently under way in april .
b PAR 9 we expect the exceptionally large april growth to be partly offset by relatively small growth rates in may and june .
b PAR 9 however , for the second quarter , m1 is anticipated to grow at about a 7 per cent annual rate , a more rapid pace than in the past few quarters , reflecting the recent strengthening of economic activity and presumably also of transactions demands for money .
b PAR 10 m2 growth under alternative b is expected to be in an 8 - 12 per cent annual rate range during the april - may period , and to expand at about a 9¼ per cent annual rate from the first to second quarter .
b PAR 10 time and savings deposits other than large cd 's are expected to expand over the next few weeks at close to their recent pace , given a federal funds rate around the mid - point of a 4¼-5¼ per cent range .
b PAR 12 after mid - year , treasury demands on credit markets will strengthen considerably .
b PAR 12 total private credit demands are also expected to expand along with continued relatively rapid growth in economic activity .
b PAR 12 with demands for money also anticipated to be rather substantial , interest rates , particularly short - term rates , are likely to rise substantially in the second half of the year if growth in the monetary aggregates is to be maintained around the mid - points of the longer - run ranges shown for alternative b . as shown in appendix iii , the staff expects the funds rate under alternative b to average around 4 - 7/8 per cent in the current quarter , to rise to 5½ per cent in the third , and to reach about 6½ per cent by the first quarter of 1978 .
b PAR 20 given below are alternatives for the operational para- graphs of the directive .
b PAR 20 the first formulation , like the directive adopted at the last meeting , places main emphasis on near - term rates of growth in monetary aggregates ; it shows -- in strike - through form--
b PAR 20 the specifications adopted at the last meeting .
b PAR 20 the second formulation places main emphasis on money market conditions .
b PAR 20 as suggested below , the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought ; the three alternatives shown -- calling , respectively , for somewhat easier , prevail- ing , and somewhat firmer money market conditions -- are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section under alternatives a , b , and c. " monetary aggregates " formulation the committee seeks to encourage near - term rates of growth in m-1 and m-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer - run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph .
b PAR 20 specifically , at present , it expects the annual growth rates over the [ del : march - april ]
b PAR 20 april - may period to be within the ranges of [ del : 4 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 ]   to   per cent for m-1 and [ del : 7 to 11 ]   to   per cent for m-2 .
b PAR 20 in the judgment of the committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average federal funds rate of about [ del : 4 - 5/8 to 4 - 3/4 ]   per cent .
b PAR 20 if giving , approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of [ del : 4 - 1/4 to 5 - 1/4 ]   to   per cent .
b PAR 20 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .
b PAR 20 " money market " formulation at this time , the committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions ( or to achieve somewhat easier or somewhat firmer money market conditions ) during the period immediately ahead , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected , which are believed to be on a path reasonably con- sistent with the longer - run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph .
b PAR 20 specifically , the committee seeks to maintain the weekly average federal funds rate at about   per cent , so long as m-1 and m-2 appear to be growing over the april - may period at annual rates within ranges of   to   per cent and   to   per cent , respectively .
b PAR 20 if , giving approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the weekly average federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of   to   per cent .
b PAR 20 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .

b PAR 20 the first column of numbers shows the level of m1 and m2 in the fourth quarter of 1977 implied by the mid - point growth rate of the longer - run path ( which takes qiv ' 76 as the base ) and in the first quarter of 1978 on the assumption that the mid - point growth rate is i - 2 extended for one more quarter .
