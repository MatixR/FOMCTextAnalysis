a PAR 14 declines in bond rates might be rather limited , however , as corporate borrowers would be expected to accelerate offerings in order to take advantage of a more favorable market environment .
a PAR 14 over the second and third quarters , m1 growth would be projected at around 8 per cent at an annual rate , while growth in m2 might be at an 11 per cent rate .
a PAR 14 a substantially lower rate of monetary growth would be required in the fourth and first quarters unless the committee were to raise its longer - run targets , and , as noted earlier , this would probably require a marked upward readjustment in interest rates later this year .

b PAR 11 the federal funds rate range for alternative b is centered near the 5 - 5 per cent area in which funds have been most frequently trading in recent days .
b PAR 11 given this funds rate , m1 in the may - june period is expected to increase at a 7½-9½ per cent annual rate .
b PAR 11 the rate of growth in m1 is expected to moderate in the third quarter , even though nominal gnp is projected to expand markedly , as the public reduces balances temporarily swollen by tax refunds .
b PAR 11 for the second and third quarters combined , m1 under this alternative is indicated to expand at about a 7 per cent annual rate .
b PAR 11 m2 over the same period would be expected to expand at about a 10 per cent annual rate , as inflows of consumer - type time and savings deposits to banks remain sizable .
