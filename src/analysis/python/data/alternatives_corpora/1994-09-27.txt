b SENT -- under alternative b , the federal funds rate would continue to trade around 4 - 3/4 percent , consistent with retaining an allowance of $ 475 million for adjustment plus sea-
b PAR 8 inaction might be deemed particularly appropriate if the committee believed that strains on capacity could be less pressing than in the staff forecast , either because potential output might be greater than assumed by the staff or because more restraint on spending could be in the pipeline in view of the substantial increases in interest rates over the past year .
b PAR 8 more- over , slow growth of a broad array of monetary and credit aggregates might be seen as suggesting that financial conditions are not con- ducive to a pickup in underlying inflation .
b PAR 8 a pause would allow the committee to accumulate more evidence on these questions . such a wait - and - see posture would accord with the tone of the press statement announcing the policy action taken at the august meeting .
b PAR 9 market opinions on what the committee might do at this meeting are split .
b PAR 9 some analysts have interpreted the recent economic news as implying sufficiently greater inflation potential to overcome any presumption of a policy pause ; they expect a firming action , per- haps of 50 basis points .
b PAR 9 others still anticipate a hiatus in the process of policy tightening ; however , even many of those in the latter camp seem to expect some action no later than the november meeting .
b PAR 9 while few actually foresee a 25 basis point increase , the composite effect of these different views has produced a federal funds futures rate for october that is 25 basis points above the current funds rate .
b PAR 9 nonetheless , maintenance of existing reserve conditions under alternative b might elicit little reaction in rates beyond the very shortest maturities because market participants would assume that tightening had simply been postponed .
b PAR 9 in these circumstances , longer- term instruments might trade in their current ranges at least for a time , although security prices probably will remain quite sensitive to news bearing on inflation pressures as market participants attempt to gauge the extent of future policy restraint .
b PAR 9 in that regard , under the staff forecast , economic releases over the next few months would suggest that inflation is on a slightly higher track and that final demand remains fairly vigorous .
b PAR 9 absent unanticipated changes in policy abroad , the foreign exchange value of the dollar most likely would remain around its current level , though it could come under some downward pressure if inflation expectations began to deteriorate further .
b SENT -- for illustrative purposes , the path under alternative b was derived assuming that the funds rate would hold at its current level for the remainder of the year .
b PAR 14 over the september - to - december period , m2 would expand at a 1 - 1/2 percent rate under alternative b .

b PAR 14 these factors will place a particular drag on liquid accounts , and m1 will expand at only a 2 - 1/2 percent rate over the period.6 while the growth of small time deposits should remain robust , not all the funds lost from liquid deposits will remain in m2 .
b PAR 14 direct purchases of securities , including noncompetitive tenders at treasury auctions , are anticipated to continue at a healthy clip .
b PAR 14 as a result , m2 velocity is expected to continue increasing rapidly in the fourth quarter -- at a rate near 5 percent .
b PAR 14 m3 growth should pick up a bit over the remainder of 1994 , reflecting somewhat reduced reliance of banks on nondeposit sources of funding .

c SENT -- ( 11 ) the 25 basis point tightening of alternative c is con- sistent with the current structure of market rates , and this policy action might well trigger only muted interest rate reactions .
c SENT -- ( the response of the aggregates under alternative c would lie midway between the two alternatives . ) alt .

d PAR 10 a tightening in reserve conditions at this meeting might be favored if the committee saw a significant risk that output is in the process of surpassing its long - run potential .
d PAR 10 waiting in these circumstances might risk the development of a degree of infla- tion momentum -- partly through expectations channels -- that could make it more difficult to contain inflation at recent rates , much less achieve the long - run goal of price stability .
d PAR 10 the 50 basis point firming of alternative d is the most likely of the three policy options to keep the federal reserve " ahead of the curve " of inflation pressures and consequently to limit the extent to which policy might later need to tighten .
d PAR 10 if the committee were uncertain about how much tightening would be required but wanted to respond to recent data , the more modest 25 basis point move of alternative
d PAR 10 c might be considered appropriate .
d SENT -- a considerable portion of the 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate under alternative d would pass through to other short - term rates .
d SENT -- the path for the aggregates under alternative d assumes that the funds rate moves up to 5 - 1/4 percent at this meeting and stays there for the balance of the year .
