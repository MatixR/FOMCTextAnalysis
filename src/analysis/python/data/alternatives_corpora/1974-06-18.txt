a SENT -- ( 14 ) the substantial injection of nonborrowed reserves that seems necessary to attain the aggregates of alternative a would probably lead to an easing of money market conditions .
a SENT -- as will be noted , alternative a refers to growth rates in the monetary aggregates prevailing over recent months .

b SENT -- this process may be completed by , or shortly after , the forthcoming committee meeting ; and little further , if any , upward rate movement is likely to develop subsequently if the funds rate remains around the center of alternative b range .
b SENT -- [ del : appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance]. alternative b to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets , the committee seeks to [ del : maintain about the prevailing restrictive ] achieve bank reserve and money market conditions
b SENT -- [ del : appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance]. ( 16 ) in the event that the committee again wishes to couch the operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market conditions , the specifications of alternative b might be associated with the language used in the directive adopted at the last meeting-- namely , that " ... the committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing restrictive money market conditions , provided that the monetary aggre- gates appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance .

c PAR 8 at its last meeting the committee adopted longer - run targets for the second and third quarters combined that included a 5½ per cent annual rate of growth in m1 from the march level .
c PAR 8 extension of such a growth rate to year - end is illustrated by the dashed line in the chart on the following page .
c PAR 8 rates of growth consistent with that extended path are shown in alternative
c PAR 8 these include a 4¾ per cent annual rate of growth in m1 between june and year - end , which would compensate for the estimated 7 per cent annual rate of growth for ml in the second quarter and would lead to an average 5½ per cent growth for the last three quarters of the year .

c PAR 8 projected growth in nominal gnp for the second half of the year is now slightly slower than at the time of the last committee meeting , but the growth rates for the third and fourth quarters -- annual rate of 8.8 and 10 per cent , respectively -- still suggest sizable increases in transactions demands for cash .

c PAR 11 the rise in interest rates expected under alternative c would further constrain inflows of consumer - type time and savings deposits to banks and thrift institutions , given current regulation q ceilings .
c PAR 11 as a result , growth in m 2 and m3 for the second half of 1974 would be reduced to about 5¼ and 4½ per cent , at annual rates , respectively .
c PAR 11 banks would be forced to raise interest rates offered for cd 's and euro - dollars .
c PAR 11 however , we would expect considerable moderation in the amount of net new funds raised through these instruments ; bank loan growth would probably be cut back by tighter lending terms , and banks would probably become increasingly wary of adding to cd holdings at ever higher interest costs .
