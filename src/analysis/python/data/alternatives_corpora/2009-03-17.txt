a PAR 47 a number of distinct factors might motivate a decision not to initiate purchases of longer - term treasury securities at this meeting but to preserve the option of pursuing such purchases at a later date .
a PAR 47 policymakers may be skeptical that large - scale purchases of treasury notes and bonds would be the most efficient means of improving private sector credit conditions , especially in an environment of elevated credit frictions and incomplete arbitrage across different financial markets .
a PAR 47 indeed , the committee may see a substantial risk that purchases of longer - term treasury securities could have detrimental effects on financial market functioning , perhaps by diminishing the value of treasury notes and bonds as hedging vehicles .
a PAR 47 moreover , the committee may be concerned that the federal reserve ’s credibility could be undermined if investors perceived this program as oriented towards monetizing the federal debt rather than as a tool for preserving price stability and promoting the resumption of sustainable economic growth ; such a weakening of federal reserve credibility could push up inflation risk premiums and thereby raise the cost of longer - term credit for households and businesses .
a PAR 47 finally , the recently announced expansion of the talf is likely to increase the size of the federal reserve ’s balance sheet , and expanded purchases of agency mbs would generate a substantial further increase in the size of the balance sheet that at some stage would need to be reversed ; thus , even if policymakers conclude that large - scale purchases of treasury notes and bonds would be helpful in providing additional economic class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 45 of 60 stimulus , they may prefer to hold off on initiating an even larger balance sheet expansion at the current juncture .
a PAR 47 the case for alternative a 
a PAR 48 if policymakers judge that a substantially greater degree of monetary stimulus is warranted to help promote a resumption of sustainable economic growth , the committee could decide at this meeting to initiate large - scale purchases of $ 500 billion in longer - term treasury securities and to expand purchases of agency mbs , as in alternative a .
a PAR 48 committee participants may concur that the federal reserve ’s current liquidity and credit facilities are crucial for stabilizing the financial system and providing the prerequisites for economic recovery , but they may nonetheless view the monetary and fiscal policy measures currently in train as unlikely to foster an acceptably rapid pace for that recovery .
a PAR 48 indeed , in the absence of any further macroeconomic stimulus , the greenbook projects that in mid-2012 the unemployment rate will still be above 7 percent and the core inflation rate will be less than ¾ percent .
a PAR 48 as noted above , a $ 500 billion expansion in purchases of agency mbs could be helpful in improving that outlook but still would not be likely to bring the economy to its potential even after five years .
a PAR 48 moreover , participants ’ projections for economic activity and inflation might be considerably worse than that of the greenbook if they anticipate that credit market frictions are likely to generate further sharp declines in spending and employment in coming quarters , as in the greenbook
a PAR 48 intensifying financial strains ” scenario , and hence they might see an even stronger rationale for providing additional monetary stimulus to the economy .
a SENT -- ( 51 ) in an environment of exceptionally high uncertainty , policymakers may judge that alternative a provides the most appropriate balance between downside risks to the economic outlook over the next several years and the risk that excessive expansion of the federal reserve ’s balance sheet could hamper the conduct of monetary policy at longer horizons .

b PAR 44 if policymakers judge that the economy is undergoing a severe economic contraction and that the subsequent recovery is likely to be feeble , and if they believe that a further increase in the size of the federal reserve ’s balance sheet would provide additional monetary stimulus and thereby improve the economic outlook , the committee could decide at this meeting to expand its purchases of agency mbs and to reiterate the possibility of purchasing longer - term treasury securities depending on evolving circumstances , as in alternative b .   incoming information over the intermeeting period may have led policymakers to mark down their projections for economic activity and inflation and hence to anticipate a deeper recession and a weaker recovery — perhaps lasting five years or more — in the absence of any additional policy stimulus .
b PAR 44 for example , the greenbook - consistent measure of short - run r * has fallen sharply since january and is now almost 4 percentage points below the actual real federal funds rate , indicating that a substantial further increase in the degree of policy stimulus would be required to close the output gap over a three - year period .
b PAR 44 this policy alternative might also be appealing to members who already considered the economic outlook to be quite bleak in late january but preferred at that time to postpone consideration of further monetary policy easing until after congress had approved the fiscal stimulus package and the administration had announced its plans for stabilizing the financial system and the housing sector .
b PAR 44 even members whose modal forecast is more optimistic than that of the staff might nonetheless believe that additional monetary stimulus would be appropriate to provide impetus to the economy and to help alleviate the risk of an accelerating feedback loop between financial conditions and economic activity that might lead to even more severe macroeconomic outcomes .

c SENT -- the draft statement for alternative c uses the same structure as in the january fomc statement .
c SENT -- as in january , alternative c refers to last fall ’s drop in energy and commodity prices and to “ prospects for considerable economic slack ” as factors explaining the outlook for inflation , which is expected to remain subdued “ in coming quarters ” before returning to rates consistent with the dual mandate ; this alternative does not give an assessment of risks to the inflation outlook .

c PAR 52 if policymakers anticipate a more robust economic recovery than in the staff outlook and perceive that further expansion in the size of the federal reserve
c PAR 52 ’s balance sheet would be associated with substantial risks to the future conduct of monetary policy , they may prefer not to initiate any new policy measures at this meeting , as in alternative c .
c PAR 52 committee participants may foresee that government actions to stabilize the financial system , together with the monetary and fiscal policies already in train , are likely to foster a stronger pace of economic activity later this year and in 2010 , as in the greenbook
c PAR 52 faster recovery ” scenario .
c PAR 52 participants may also judge that some portion of the current economic downturn reflects a falloff in trend productivity growth , perhaps reflecting the costs of adjustment associated with sectoral reallocation of capital and labor , as in the greenbook
c PAR 52 ’s “ more adverse supply conditions ” scenario ; in that case , the extent of economic slack would be substantially smaller than in the staff projection , and inflation could stay much closer to rates judged to be consistent with the dual mandate .
c PAR 52 even if policymakers see the class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 49 of 60 economy as likely to follow a trajectory similar to that of the staff projection , they may see fiscal policy as the most appropriate tool for providing additional stimulus .
c PAR 52 finally , policymakers may be particularly concerned about the risk that constraints arising from the size of the federal reserve ’s balance sheet could constrain the future conduct of monetary policy ; if so , they may be reluctant to adopt measures that would further expand its assets and liabilities , at least until the federal reserve receives new tools for managing the size and composition of its balance sheet .
