a SENT -- from qiv ' 75 to qiv ' 76 at rates near the mid - points of their respective one- year ranges , the near - term declines in interest rates anticipated under alternative a would be short - lived , and rates would begin rising , perhaps by late spring .
a SENT -- we have assumed that under alternative a the funds rate would average about 6¾ per cent in the fourth quarter of 1976 .
a SENT -- alternative " money market " proposals alternative a to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets , the committee seeks to [ del : maintain prevailing ] achieve somewhat easier bank reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately ahead , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates cur- rently expected .

b PAR 5 given such a funds rate , over the march - april period m1 is expected to expand in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 5 tax refunds are likely to con- tribute somewhat to growth in demand deposits in march .
b PAR 5 as april progresses , however , payments by the treasury will probably be moderating and might be more than offset by the public 's drawing down balances that had been built up by earlier refunds .
b PAR 5 thus , m 1 growth during the march - april period is expected to depend essentially on transactions demands associated with the projected relatively rapid expansion in nominal gnp .

b PAR 5 growth in time deposits other than money market cd 's is expected to slow from its exceptional january - february pace , when inflows were being influenced by the initial shift of funds in response to the decline in short - term market rates to levels near or below 5 per cent .
b PAR 5 nevertheless , such deposits will probably grow at a still fairly substantial 11¼ per cent annual rate over the march - april period .
b PAR 5 short - term rates under alternative b would be expected to change little between now and the next committee meeting , although they could rise a bit toward the end of the period , reflecting mid - april tax date pressures .
b PAR 9 the staff continues to believe that interest rates will have to rise later in the year -- perhaps beginning in late spring -- if a 6 per cent rate of growth in m1 from qiv ' 75 to qiv ' 76 is to be achieved .
b PAR 9 under alternative b , we have assumed that the federal funds rate will average about 6½ per cent in the fourth quarter of 1976 .1/
b PAR 9 this represents somewhat less upward rate pressure than assumed in the previous blue book , and reflects the need for a little more expansion in m1 over the last three quarters of the year to make up for the fact that growth in the first quarter of 1976 is now expected to be somewhat slower than anticipated a month ago .
b PAR 9 under these assumptions , m2 growth over the period from qiv
b PAR 9 ' 75 to qiv ' 76 would be about 9¾ per cent -- somewhat above the mid - point of the committee 's one - year range .
b SENT -- nevertheless , if the money market remains stable -- as is assumed under alternative b -- long - term interest rates are likely to remain around current levels in view of the strong institutional investor interest in bonds that has developed since the beginning of the year .

c SENT -- on the other hand , the greater near - term restraint of alternative c would mean that more monetary expansion would be required later in 1976 to achieve the committee 's longer - run targets .
c SENT -- a tightening of the money market , as contemplated under alternative c , would probably cause some upward adjustment in long rates .
