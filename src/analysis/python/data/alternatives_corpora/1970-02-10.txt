a PAR 8 if the committee wishes to maintain an unchanged stance with respect to its views as to monetary aggregates and money market conditions , it may wish to consider the following second paragraph for the directive ( alternative a   : to implement this policy , while taking account of the current forthcoming treasury refunding , possible bank regula- tory change , and the committee 's desire to see a modest growth in money and bank credit , system open market opera- tions until the next meeting of the committee shall be con- ducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in the money market ; provided , however , that operations shall be modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating significantly from current projections .
a PAR 17 under such conditions , banks might be in a position to regain a substantial amount of cd 's , instead of an attrition running at about the $ 100-$300 million per month rate likely under alternative a ( depending on the degree of firmness achieved under the specifications of that alternative   , we would expect banks at least to maintain outstanding cd 's at around the current $ 10 billion level .
a PAR 17 and if the bill rate fell to 6 - 3/4 per cent or below , banks would probably have considerable opportunity to add to cd 's .
a PAR 17 indeed , they might well add substantial amounts if loan demand remains strong or if they wish to replenish their liquidity and to start rebuilding investment portfolios at attractive yields .
a PAR 17 another alternative for banks would be to move into cd 's at the expense of non- deposit sources .
a PAR 17 on balance , a reasonable guess would be that cd 's could rise at a rate of $ 500 million per month , or even more .

b PAR 15 should the committee wish to move toward somewhat easier conditions in the money market , concomitant with somewhat stronger growth in the banking and deposit aggregates , it might con- sider the following second paragraph for the directive ( alternative b   : to implement this policy , while taking account of the current forthcoming treasury refunding , possible bank regulatory changes and the committee 's desire to see moderate a - modest growth in money and bank credit , system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining firm moving toward somewhat easier conditions in the money market ; provided , however , that operations shall be modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating significantly from current projections .
