a SENT -- the money market specifications for alternative a represent a continuation of conditions recently prevailing , as would be consistent with a strict interpretation of " even keel " .
a SENT -- the deposit patterns described above for alternative a imply a 7 - 1/2 per cent annual rate of increase in total reserves , seasonally adjusted , from june to september , assuming excess reserves average about $ 225 million .
a PAR 16 the slowing of growth in m1 and accompanying reserve developments under alternative a would not be expected to lead to higher interest rates in either short- or long - term markets , at least in the immediate future .
a PAR 16 for one thing , growth in the demand for money is likely to be abating .
a PAR 16 also the credit demands of corporations and state and local governments in bond markets are expected to continue around the somewhat more moderate dimensions of the past month or two , and thereby take some rate pressure off long - term markets .
a PAR 16 in addition , treasury cash borrowing demands during the third quarter are turning out to be somewhat less than expected in view of the low level at which the treasury is running its cash balance .
a PAR 16 in the fourth quarter , however , treasury cash borrowing is expected to be substantial .
a PAR 19 alternative
a PAR 19 this language is proposed for possible use if the committee decides to call for maintaining about the money market conditions that have recently been attained , subject to a proviso clause .
a PAR 19 " to implement this policy , [ del : the committee seeks to achieve more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead , taking account of developments in capital markets .
a PAR 19 ] system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining prevailing [ del : achieving bank reserve and ] money market conditions ; [ del : consistent with these objectives ] provided that somewhat firmer conditions shall be sought , taking account of the current treasury financing and of developments in capital markets , if it appears that the monetary and credit aggregates are significantly exceeding the growth paths expected .
a PAR 19 if the committee adopts this alternative , it may wish to consider the money market conditions noted for alternative a in paragraph ( 9 ) as a description of " prevailing " conditions , and for purposes of the proviso clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alternative a been as the " expected " paths .
a PAR 19 the proviso clause has / formulated in one - way terms , guarding against excesses but not shortfalls , on the assumption that the committee would not want money market conditions to be eased in the coming period if the aggregates should fall short of the indicated paths .
a PAR 19 the proposed language contemplates that in making operating decisions under the proviso clause the manager would take account of both the current treasury financing and developments in capital markets .

b PAR 1 growth of the narrowly - defined money supply in july appears to be somewhat faster than projected in the last blue book , as best can be judged by information available through the week of the 21st , with data for the latter week partly estimated .
b PAR 1 the broader money supply ( m2 ) appears to be increasing less rapidly than projected , however , as a substantial short- fall below path in time deposits other than cd 's more than offset the over- shoot in private demand deposits .

b PAR 4 during the first three statement weeks of july member bank borrowings averaged about $ 930 million , about $ 415 million above the june average .
b PAR 4 apparently in recent weeks many banks that had borrowed relatively little at the discount window have become more willing borrowers , given the spread of the federal funds rate above the discount rate .
b PAR 4 excess reserves have been volatile over the past three weeks , and net borrowed reserves of member banks have ranged from $ 350 to $ 950 million , with the average level considerably deeper than in june .

b PAR 4 1/ alternative b . 
b PAR 5 although m1 in july has turned out to be somewhat stronger than previously projected , the need for reserves in the first three weeks of the month was considerably less than expected ( as shown by the difference between " path " and " actual " required reserves in the table above ) .
b PAR 5 the lower level of required reserves relative to path was mainly the result of large downward adjustments in preliminary estimates of private demand deposits during the last two weeks of june , and much lower than expected u.s .
b PAR 5 government deposits in early july .
b PAR 5 thus , with the need for reserves reduced , growth of member bank total reserves in july is falling substantially short of what was implied by the alternative b path at the time of the last committee meeting , as shown in the table above , despite the sharp rise in member bank borrowings .
b PAR 5 nonborrowed reserves were even further below path than total reserves -- and showed an actual decline from june to july --as the desk provided fewer reserves given the increased demand for borrowings by banks .
b SENT -- reserve growth would be somewhat less under alternative b , particularly for nonborrowed reserves , with part of the drop - off in nonborrowed offset by increased borrowing .
b PAR 17 the tighter money market conditions assumed under alternative b could lead to a fairly substantial upward interest rate adjustment over the near term .
b PAR 17 the market at present appears to be uncertain as to how far the system intends to go in combatting high monetary growth rates , and in that respect would be very sensitive to upward movements in the federal funds rate .
b PAR 17 with further tightening in the money market , market expectations of another rise in the discount rate -- and possibly the prime rate -- at a time when a treasury refunding is in process could lead to strong protective measures by dealers and other active participants .
b PAR 17 higher short- and long - term interest rates could also begin to impinge more substantially on savings inflows to nonbank thrift institutions .
b PAR 17 at the same time , however , it is not clear that the upward interest rate pressures would be long sustained , particularly in long - term markets , in view of the likelihood that credit demands will be moderate and the possibility that a further move toward achieving lower monetary growth rates would over time have a constructive influence on market psychology .
