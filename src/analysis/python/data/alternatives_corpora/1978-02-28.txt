a PAR 21 such an action would be accompanied by a reversal of the early january rise in short - term interest rates .
a PAR 21 long- term rates , on the other hand , might not retrace all of their recent increases if , as appears likely at the moment , market participants con- cluded that the decline in short - term rates was likely to be temporary .
a PAR 21 meanwhile , the dollar would probably tend to soften in international exchange markets .
a PAR 22 the approach of alternative a appears most consistent with a monetary policy that encourages more rapid growth in the monetary aggregates over the longer - run than under either alternatives b or c.
a PAR 22 nevertheless , given the strength projected for economic activity , the near - term decline in the funds rate under a would probably soon have to be reversed to restrain growth in the aggregates to rates consistent with the mid - points of longer - run ranges for alternative a . the funds rate would have to begin rising again in the second quarter and might reach a high for the year of about 7 - 3/4 per cent by fall .
a PAR 22 directive language 
a PAR 23 given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs of the directive .
a PAR 23 the first formulation places main emphasis on near - term rates of growth in monetary aggregates .
a PAR 23 the second formulation , like the directive adopted at the last meeting , places main emphasis on money market conditions ; it shows -- in strike- through form--
a PAR 23 the specifications adopted at the last meeting .
a PAR 23 as suggested below , the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought ; the three alternatives shown -- calling , respectively , for somewhat easier , prevailing , and somewhat firmer money market condi- tions -- are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section under alternatives a , b , and c. " monetary aggregates " formulation the committee seeks to encourage near - term rates of growth in m-1 and m-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer - run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph .
a PAR 23 specifically , at present , it expects the annual growth rates over the february - march period to be within the ranges of   to   per cent for m-1 and   to   per cent for m-2 .
a PAR 23 in the judgment of the committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly - average federal funds rate of about   per cent .
a PAR 23 if , giving approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the mid - points of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range for   to   per cent .
a PAR 23 in the conduct of day - to - day operations , account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions , including the unsettled conditions in foreign exchange markets .
a PAR 23 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .
a PAR 23 " money market " formulation at this time , the committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions ( or to achieve somewhat easier or somewhat firmer money market conditions ) during the period immediately ahead , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected , which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer - run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph .
a PAR 23 specifically , the committee seeks to maintain the weekly - average federal funds rate at about [ del : the current level ]   per cent , so long as m-1 and m-2 appear to be growing over the [ del : january - february ] february - march period at annual rates within ranges of [ del : 2½ to 7½ ]   to   per cent and
a PAR 23 [ del : 5-to-9 ]   to   per cent , respectively .
a PAR 23 if giving approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the weekly- average federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of [ del : 6½ 10 7 ]   to   per cent .
a PAR 23 in the conduct of day - to - day operations , account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions , including the unsettled conditions in foreign exchange markets .
a PAR 23 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .

b SENT -- 9½ 6½ to 9 6 to 8½ 6½ to 9 m-3 7½ to 10 7 to 9½ 6½ to 9 8 to 10½ bank credit 8 to 11 7½ to 10½ 7 to 10 7 to 10 ( 8) alternative b continues the ranges for m-1 and m-2 that were adopted by the committee in october for the qiii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period .
b PAR 13 the february - march growth rate of m-1 shown under alternative b implies a first quarter expansion of about 4 - 3/4 per cent , annual rate , well within the committee 's 4 to 6 - 1/2 per cent longer - run range .
b PAR 13 however , the staff anticipates that further increases in market interest rates will be required in order to constrain m-1 growth over the one- year qiv ' 77 - qiv ' 78 period to the mid - point of that range .
b PAR 13 even though the staff has reduced its projection of economic growth this year , nominal gnp is still expected to increase at an 11 - 1/4 per cent rate over the qiv ' 77 - qiv ' 78 period , leading to relatively strong money demand .
b PAR 13 in addition , the restraining impact on money demand from the relatively sharp 1 - 3/4 percentage point increase in short - term interest rates that took place between the spring and fall of last year will be exhausted relatively soon ; since october short - rates have risen only about another 1/4 percentage point .
b PAR 13 even assuming some further moderate downward shift in money demand relative to income , the federal funds rate would probably have to begin rising again in april and reach 8 per cent by fall in order to constrain m-1 growth for the qiv ' 77-qiv ' 78 period to the mid - point of the 4 to 6 - 1/2 per cent alternative b range.1/ 
b PAR 14 growth in m-2 over the february - march period is likely to be in a 4 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 per cent annual rate range under alternative b . with market yields above the ceiling rates on savings deposits and all maturities of small denomination time deposits at commercial banks , inflows of such deposits are likely to remain modest in february - march .
b PAR 14 however , growth in large denomination time deposits included in m-2 are expected to continue to offset slow growth of deposits subject to regu- lation q ceiling as banks aggressively seek funds to finance credit demands .
b PAR 16 with the federal funds rate remaining near its present 6 - 3/4 per cent level , as envisioned under alternative b , interest rates generally are likely to fluctuate within a relatively narrow range over the intermeeting period .
b PAR 16 a little upward rate pressure might develop in short - term credit markets ; the treasury is expected to raise $ 10 billion of new money in the bill market prior to the march and april tax dates , and depository institutions are likely to continue liquidating shorter- term treasury issues to meet loan demands .
b PAR 16 however , intermediate- and long - term market rates might decline a bit in the weeks immediately ahead .
b PAR 16 treasury demands in these maturity ranges are not likely to be unusually large .
b PAR 16 in addition , the pace of new offerings by corporations and state and local governments is expected to remain moderate , while the institu- tional demand for bonds is likely to continue to be quite strong .
b PAR 16 both primary and secondary mortgage rates will probably continue to be under upward pressure , given the slowing of deposit growth at the thrift institutions .

c PAR 9 each of the alternatives presupposes an upward adjustment in deposit ceiling rates at banks and thrift institutions of 50 basis points on small - denomination time deposits ; the adjustments in ceiling rates are assumed to occur in april under alternative c , in may under b , and in june under a. without such adjustments , the increase in market rates thought necessary to restrain m-1 growth to the mid - point of the indicated ranges would lead to growth in m-2 and m-3 near the lower ends of the ranges shown.1/
c SENT -- m-1 growth at around the 5 per cent mid - point of the proposed alternative c range would nearly compensate for the slight fourth quarter overshoot but not for the larger third quarter overshoot .
c PAR 18 under alternative c the federal funds rate would rise over the intermeeting period to the mid - point of a 7 to 7 - 1/2 per cent range , and the february - march annual rate of growth of m-1 and m-2 would likely be in 1/2 to 5 - 1/2 and 4 to 8 per cent annual rate ranges , respec- tively .
c PAR 18 the 3-month treasury bill rate would probably rise to about 7 per cent by mid - march , with commensurate adjustments in other short rates .
c PAR 18 member bank borrowings could be expected to rise sharply once again , increasing pressures for a discount rate increase .
c PAR 18 at the same time , the rise in short - term interest rates associated with this alternative would tend to strengthen the dollar on international exchange markets .
c PAR 19 the tightening of money market conditions contemplated under alternative c would further slow the net inflow of deposits sub- ject to rate ceilings in the weeks immediately ahead and thus would increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates .
c PAR 19 lending policies of banks and thrift institutions would become more restrictive .
c PAR 19 there would be increased pressure on government support programs in the mortgage area .
c PAR 19 the home loan bank system would be expected to turn more and more to the market to raise cash to support advances to savings and loan associations , and mortgage bankers would increase takedowns of existing fnma commitments while also aggressively seeking new commit- ments .
c PAR 19 in such an environment , the increase in short - term rates would probably be rather promptly transmitted to the intermediate- and long- term sectors of the market , where government security dealers still have a long position of moderate size in treasury coupon issues .
c PAR 20 the near - term increase in interest rates under alternative c would work toward a reduction in growth of the aggregates over the longer run .
c PAR 20 however , given the projected strength of money demand , a further increase in interest rates would be required in order to limit m-1 expansion to the mid - point of the 4 to 6 per cent alternative c range over the qiv ' 77-qiv ' 78 period .
c PAR 20 the staff would expect the funds rate under this alternative to average 7 - 3/4 per cent in the second quarter and to rise to 8 - 1/4 per cent by fall .
