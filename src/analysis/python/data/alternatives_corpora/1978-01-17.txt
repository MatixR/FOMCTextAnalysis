a PAR 18 an easing in money market conditions over the next few weeks under alternative a , which calls for a federal funds rate of about 6 - 1/4 per cent , would come as a considerable surprise so soon after the board 's recent discount rate action .
a PAR 18 recent interest rate increases would be reversed , although perhaps not entirely in long - term markets if the rate decline was considered to be temporary .
a PAR 18 the decline in short - term rates , however , would tend to soften the dollar in inter- national exchange markets .
a PAR 19 even though this alternative is consistent with a shift to higher long - term growth ranges for the aggregates , the decline in the funds rate would soon have to be reversed in order to keep the aggre- gates within the longer - run ranges of alternative a . the funds rate would probably have to begin rising late in the first quarter and reach a high of 7 - 3/4 per cent by fall .
a PAR 19 the delayed rise in short- term rates would postpone the need for a change in deposit rate ceilings .
a PAR 19 directive language 
a PAR 20 given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs of the directive .
a PAR 20 the first formulation places main emphasis on near - term rates of growth in monetary aggregates .
a PAR 20 the second formulation , like the directive adopted at the last meeting , places main emphasis on money market conditions ; it shows -- in strike- through form--
a PAR 20 the specifications adopted at the last meeting ( except that the specifications for the federal funds rate reflect the modifi- cations agreed upon on january 6 ) .
a PAR 20 as suggested below , the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought ; the three alternatives shown -- calling , respectively , for somewhat easier , prevailing , and somewhat firmer money market conditions -- are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section under alternatives a , b , and c. " monetary aggregates " formulation the committee seeks to encourage near - term rates of growth in m-1 and m-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer - run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceed- ing paragraph .
a PAR 20 specifically , at present , it expects the annual growth rates over the january - february period to be within the ranges of   to   per cent for m-1 and   to   per cent for m-2 .
a PAR 20 in the judgment of the committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly - average federal funds rate of about   per cent .
a PAR 20 if , giving approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of   to   per cent .
a PAR 20 in the conduct of day - to - day opera- tions , account shall be taken of emerging financial market condi- tions , including the unsettled conditions in foreign exchange markets .
a PAR 20 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .
a PAR 20 " money market " formulation at this time , the committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions ( or to achieve somewhat easier or somewhat firmer money market conditions ) during the period immediately ahead , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected , which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer- run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph .
a PAR 20 specifically , the committee seeks to maintain the weekly - average federal funds rate at about [ del : 6 - 3/4-per cent ] , so long as m-1 and m-2 appear to be growing over the [ del : december - january ] january- february period at annual rates within ranges of [ del : 2-l/2-to-8 - 1/2 ]   to   per cent
a PAR 20 and [ del : 6-to 10 ]   to   per cent , respectively .
a PAR 20 if , giving approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the weekly - average federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of [ del : 6-l/2-to-7 ]   to   per cent .
a PAR 20 in the conduct of day- to - day operations , account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions , including the unsettled conditions in foreign exchange markets .
a PAR 20 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .

b SENT -- c m-1 4 to 7 4 to 6 4 to 6 m-2 7 to 9 6 to 9 6 to 8 m-3 8 to 11 8 to 10 7 to 10 bank credit 7 to 10 7 to 10 6 to 9 ( 7 ) alternative b encompasses the ranges for all of the aggregates adopted by the committee in october for the qiii ' 77- qiii ' 78 period .
b PAR 10 a federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing 6¾ per cent , as encompassed under alternative b , is likely to be associated with m-1 growth over january - february in a 2½ to 8½ per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 10 however , the staff expects that further increases in market interest rates will be required relatively soon in order to limit growth in this aggregate over the qiv ' 77 to qiv ' 78 period to the mid - point of the longer - run 4 to 6½ per cent range associated with alternative b . money demand can be expected to be relatively strong over the year .
b PAR 10 nominal gnp is projected to increase at about an 11¾ per cent rate during 1978 , reflecting in part an assumed additional fiscal stimulus from tax cuts .
b PAR 10 and the restraining effect of the previous increases in interest rates will be diminishing with the passage of time .
b PAR 10 moreover , the evidence of the last three quarters suggests that the depressing effect on money demand of regulatory and innovational factors has been wearing off .
b PAR 10 consequently , the staff has assumed only some moderate additional downward shift in the demand for money over 1978 .
b PAR 10 thus , in alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m-1 m-2 alt .
b PAR 10 c growth rates monthly : quarterly average ; semi - annual : annual : alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates ( cont'd ) m-3 bank credit alt .
b PAR 10 c growth rates monthly : quarterly average : semi - annual : annual : order to constrain m-1 growth , the federal funds rate under alternative b begins to rise next month and reaches an average of 8 per cent in the fourth quarter , as shown in appendix i.1/ ( 11 ) under alternative b , growth in m-2 over the january- february period is likely to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 10 with the recent increase in market yields , it appears likely that savings deposits at banks , which were essentially unchanged in the last two months of 1977 , will remain weak in the early months of 1978 .
b PAR 10 moreover , now that yields onmarket instruments are at or above effective ceiling rates on all maturities of small denomination time deposits at banks , growth in such deposits is likely to remain modest at best .
b PAR 10 but relatively strong growth in large denomination time deposits included in m-2 can be expected as banks offer these instruments aggressively to offset slow growth of deposits subject to regulation q ceilings .
b PAR 13 if the federal funds rate remains near its present 6¾ per cent level over the intermeeting period , as envisioned under alternative b , short - term market interest rates will probably remain near current higher levels .
b PAR 13 and given their increases since november , bond yields may be fully adjusted to the current level of short - term rates .
b PAR 13 thus , yields in the corporate and tax - exempt bond markets may remain essentially unchanged , and could even decline somewhat in response to continuing strong institutional investment demands and a recent reduction in new offerings of corporate bonds .
b PAR 13 however , on january 25 , the treasury will announce terms for refunding more than $ 5 billion of publicly - held issues maturing in mid - february ; the treasury may also take the occasion to raise $ 1 to $ 2½ billion of new money .
b PAR 14 beyond the intermeeting period , short - term interest rates are expected to be under renewed upward pressure as efforts are made to limit m-1 expansion to the 5¼ per cent mid - point of the alternative b longer - run range .
b PAR 14 as short - term rates rise , some further induced increase in intermediate - term rates can be expected .
b PAR 14 thus , even with the assumed increase in deposit rate ceilings , inflows to thrifts will probably not be sufficient to enable them to meet their mortgage commitments without further increases in borrowings from the fhlbanks .
b PAR 14 under the circumstances , mortgage rates are likely to come under upward pressure .
b PAR 14 banks would find it necessary to continue to offer large denomination time deposits in volume to supplement their deposit sources , and to reduce further their port- folio liquidity in order to meet loan demands .
b PAR 14 moreover , with treasury , corporate , and municipal bond offerings remaining sizable , long - term yields can also be expected to be under renewed upward pres- sure .
b PAR 14 such increases , however , will be limited by the continued high cash flows of insurance companies and pension funds .

c PAR 15 under this alternative m-1 and m-2 growth over the january - february period may be in 2 to 8 and 4½ to 8½ per cent ranges , respectively .
c PAR 15 if the committee followed this course , the 3-month bill rate would likely increase to about 7 per cent between now and the next meeting , with commensurate adjustments in other short rates .
c PAR 15 member bank borrowing would begin to rise , and pressures for a discount rate increase would develop .
c PAR 15 the increase in short - term interest rates under the alternative would tend to strengthen the dollar on international exchange markets .
