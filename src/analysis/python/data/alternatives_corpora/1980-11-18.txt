b PAR 1 rates of expansion of m-1a and m-1b were relatively rapid in october , though below rates of the previous two months .
b PAR 1 growth in m-2 and m-3 accelerated slightly as inflows of time deposits at banks and thrifts strengthened and withdrawals from money market mutual funds slowed .
b PAR 1 the recent growth of m-1a - which was well above the committee 's target path for the last three months of the year -- puts it within one - half percentage point of the upper end of its long - run range for the year , while growth rates of the other aggregates are now almost one percentage point above longer - run upper limits ( in the case of m-1b and m-2 ) or equal to the upper limit ( in the case of m-3 ) .
b PAR 1 though business lending continued to expand rapidly , growth of bank credit declined somewhat from the september rate and the year - to - date growth in this aggregate remains in the lower half of its longer - run range .

b PAR 1 such growth would imply m - la velocity increases in the two years of 4 and 5 % percent , respectively .
b PAR 1 the board 's quarterly econometric model indicates that historical money demand relationships would require roughly 34 percen- tage points greater growth of m - la in 1981 to achieve the gnp and interest rates in the staff 's judgmental greenbook projection .
b PAR 1 thus , these interest rate projections assume a further so - called downward shift in money demand as judged from the prediction error in the board 's model .

b PAR 6 only minor variations in growth rates would be expected under alternatives a and c. end of their respective longer - run ranges .

b PAR 6 what above the midpoint of its longer - run range .
b PAR 6 however , as may be seen in the charts following this page , the alternatives have different implica- tions for the level of the aggregates relative to growth cones by year - end , particularly for the narrow aggregates .
b PAR 6 moreover , the choice among these policy options could have a significant effect on inflationary expectations and real economic activity over the months ahead , and thus on the pattern of economic and financial developments associated with achieving next year 's monetary targets .
b PAR 9 alternative
b PAR 9 b continues the committee 's current targets for the fourth quarter , as indexed by m-1a and m-1b .
b PAR 9 given what has already occurred in october , to achieve these targets m-1a would have to contract over the remaining weeks of the year .
b PAR 9 the staff still believes that a significant slowing in the growth of transactions balances is likely , partly because of the sharp run - up in interest rates of the last three months and partly on the assumption that the recent very rapid month - to - month growth in economic activity slows significantly .
b PAR 9 however , achieving the negative growth in m-1a over the balance of the year implied by alternative b would probably require further near - term increases in short - term interest rates .
b PAR 10 to achieve the specifications of alternative b , total reserves would have to increase at about a 6 percent annal rate over the october to december period.1/ nonborrowed reserves would have to contract by about a 1 percent annual rate if the level of adjustment borrowing is around 1/ about 4 percentage points of this increase reflect the additional required reserves associated with the substantial reduction of weekend eurodollar arbitrage activities .

b PAR 10 $ 1¾ billion and by more if the level of borrowing rises further .
b PAR 10 however , the exact setting on the nonborrowed reserve operating path will depend in part on bank responses to the new discount rate structure .
b PAR 10 if past experience with the surcharge is any guide , banks are likely to become less willing borrowers , thereby reducing the level of borrowing for any given spread of the funds rate over the basic discount rate .
b PAR 10 however , earlier experience with the surcharge was within the context of a bank credit restraint program , and bank behavior may differ under current circum- stances .
b PAR 10 thus , there is more than usual uncertainty about the demand for borrowing , and therefore about the level of the nonborrowed reserve path consistent with money supply and total reserve targets of alternative b . ( 11 ) under alternative b , a funds rate in the 15 to 16 percent range is likely to emerge over the weeks immediately ahead , and possibly higher before the year is out .
b PAR 10 the 3-month bill rate may move up into a 14 to 15 percent range and the 3-month cd rate about a point higher , reflecting in part continued relatively strong demands on short - term credit markets over the balance of the year .
b PAR 10 the treasury is expected to raise about $ 4½ billion in cash in the bill market and $ 7.5 billion in coupon offerings of 2 , 4 , and 5 years .
b PAR 10 business credit demands may fall most heavily on short - term markets , especially if , as seems likely , long - term rates rise further under this alternative , inducing added restraint on corporate bond offerings .
b PAR 10 finally , continued intervention by the u.s . to slow the appreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar -- which is likely to continue rising under alternative b -- could generate additional pressure on treasury yields as the federal reserve or treasury offers securities to the market to finance foreign currency purchases .
b PAR 13 the further rise in interest rates under alternative b -- the underlying assumption for the greenbook projection - is an element in the staff 's anticipation that real gnp will decline in early 1981 .
b PAR 13 the dampening of the transactions demand for money in lagged response to the run - up in interest rates and to the projected weakening in economic activity suggest that interest rates could temporarily ease in early 1981 , assuming 1981 monetary targets as reported to the congress in july.1 / however , for all of next year , the effects of inflation on the transactions demand for money are expected to require historically high interest rates in order to restrain growth in the monetary aggregates to the preliminary fomc targets .
b SENT -- however , some short - term rates might adjust up slightly 1/ see appendix ii for the projected quarterly pattern of interest rates under alternative b . further due to the strength in short - term credit demands and , in the case of the prime and mortgage rates , to lagged adjustments to the tightening that has already occurred .
b SENT -- with interest rates lower over the balance of the year than under alternative b , money growth and economic activity would be expected to be less weak in early 1981 .

c PAR 15 to achieve the alternative c specifications would probably require a reduction in nonborrowed reserves at about a 5 percent annual rate over the last two months of the year , if a borrowing level of $ 2 billion , or a bit higher , is assumed .
c PAR 15 the funds rate may move up to around the 16 to 17 percent area over the next few weeks , and possibly higher by year - end .
c PAR 15 this alternative increases the risk of a more significant drop - off in money growth and economic activity in early 1981 , and consequently increases the likelihood that interest rates will be lower in the first quarter of the year than under the other two alternatives .
c PAR 15 however , the staff would anticipate that , even under this alternative , interest rates over the next year would still have to be high by historical standards to constrain money growth to the committee 's preliminary targets .
