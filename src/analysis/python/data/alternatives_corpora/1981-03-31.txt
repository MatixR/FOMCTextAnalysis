b PAR 1 abstracting from the effect of nationwide now accounts , the decline of transactions balances that characterized the november to february period appears to have been reversed most recently , with adjusted m-1b estimated to increase at about an 8 - 3/4 percent annual rate in march , as shown in the table below .
b PAR 1 nonetheless , m-1b 's growth over the first three months of the year remains about 2 - 1/4 percentage points below the committee 's target for that period .
b PAR 1 the weakness in m-1b is significantly greater than predicted by the board 's quarterly econometric model as well as other models , given actual interest rates and nominal gnp .
b PAR 1 on a quarterly average basis , adjusted m-1b increasedat only about a 1/2 percent annual rate , and the income velocity of this aggregate rose at an annual rate of almost 14 - 1/2 percent -- a record for the period since the korean war .

b PAR 1 1/ abstracting from the estimated impact of shifts from savings accounts and assets other than demand deposits to now accounts .
b PAR 1 it is possible that the demand for money shifted downwards in response to extraordinarily high levels of interest rates in the fourth quarter and the introduction of nationwide now accounts in the first , both of which could have induced the public to review more intensively its cash management techniques .
