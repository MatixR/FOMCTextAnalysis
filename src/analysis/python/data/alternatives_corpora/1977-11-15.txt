a PAR 16 an easing in the funds rate to the mid - point of a 5¾ to 6¾ per cent range , as envisioned under alternative a , could stimulate sub- stantial downward adjustments in interest rates .
a PAR 16 such rate movements , how- ever , would probably be short - lived , since the added impetus to growth in the monetary aggregates would soon require a sharp reversal in interest rates in order to constrain the aggregates to the committee 's longer - run ranges .
a PAR 16 with m-1 likely to expand at about a 7 per cent average annual rate over the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978 under this alternative , interest rates would have to rise sufficiently to hold m-1 growth in the second and third quarters of 1978 to a 3½ per cent annual rate .
a PAR 16 the projected federal funds pattern for this alternative calls , therefore , for sustained increases to around 8¼ per cent in the third quarter of 1978 .
a PAR 16 under such circumstances , some adjustment in regulation q ceilings may have to be considered by next summer .
a PAR 16 directive language 

b PAR 8 under alternative b , the federal funds rate would be expected to remain near the mid - point of the 6¼ to 6¾ per cent rate range specified by the committee at its last meeting .
b PAR 8 m-1 growth over the november - december period likely to be associated with such a funds rate would be in a 2 - 7 per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 8 while data available so far this month suggest that m-1 will expand only slightly in november , the staff would anticipate an acceleration in december -- perhaps to about an 8 per cent annual rate -- given the projected strengthening of nominal gnp and the associated underlying transactions demands for cash .
b PAR 8 such an expansion would produce a 7½ per cent annual rate of growth of m-1 from the third to the fourth quarter , somewhat below the 9 per cent average annual rate of growth of this aggregate in the second and third quarters of 1977 .

b PAR 10 growth in m-2 over the november - december period is likely to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under alternative b . the time and savings deposit component of m-2 under this alternative is expected to continue to expand at near its recent pace .
b PAR 10 although savings deposits at commercial banks are likely to continue growing relatively slowing over the near - term as interest sensitive depositors shift to higher yielding assets , time deposits at banks , especially those not subject to regulation q ceiling , are expected to grow at a relatively rapid rate .
b PAR 10 in addition , shifting of maturing wildcard accounts from banks to thrifts will no longer be a depressant on commercial bank time deposit growth , as seems to have been the case during the third quarter .
b PAR 12 inflows to thrift institutions moderated somewhat in october .
b PAR 12 such inflows may moderate somewhat further over the next few weeks under alternative b , and can be expected to decelerate markedly in 1978 if the projected rise of interest rates materializes .
b PAR 12 however , the deceleration at thrifts -- and at banks as well -- is not likely to be as marked as might be expected from interest rate considerations alone because of the high level of nominal income growth projected for 1978 and the large volume of longer - term time certificates now outstanding at depository institutions .
b PAR 12 this would tend to moderate the extent to which thrifts will have to increase their borrowing and reduce liquidity in order to meet outstanding mortgage commitments .
b PAR 13 if the federal funds rate remains near its present 6 - 1/2 per cent level over the intermeeting period , as envisioned under alternative b , short - term interest rates will probably show little net change during the next few weeks , even though demands for short - term funds are likely to be rather strong over this period .
b PAR 13 the treasury is expected to sell a large block of cash management bills in early december and the moderate forward calendar of corporate bond offerings suggests that business demands for credit may be relatively strong in the short - term area over the balance of the year .
b PAR 13 under these circumstances , it appears likely that yields on long - term bonds will be relatively stable over the near term and could even edge down a bit .
b SENT -- with additional monetary restraint in place some- what sooner , the staff would expect growth in the monetary aggregates to be somewhat slower over the next few months than under alternative b .
b PAR 17 given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs of the directive .
b PAR 17 the first formulation places main emphasis on near - term rates of growth in monetary aggregates .
b PAR 17 the second formulation , like the directive adopted at the last meeting , places main emphasis on money market conditions ; it shows -- in strike - through form--
b PAR 17 the specifications adopted at the last meeting .
b PAR 17 as suggested below , the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought ; the three alternatives shown -- calling , respec- tively , for somewhat easier , prevailing , and somewhat firmer money market conditions -- are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section under alternatives a , b , and c. " money aggregates " formulation the committee seeks to encourage near - term rates of growth in m-1 and m-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer - run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph .
b PAR 17 specifically , at present , it expects the annual growth rates over the november - december period to be within the ranges of   to   per cent for m-1 and   to   per cent for m-2 .
b PAR 17 in the judgment of the committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly - average federal funds rate of about   per cent .
b PAR 17 if , giving approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of   to   per cent .
b PAR 17 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif- icantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .
b PAR 17 " money market " formulation at this time , the committee seeks to maintain about the prevail- ing money market conditions ( or to achieve somewhat easier or some-
b PAR 17 what firmer money market conditions ) during the period immediately ahead , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected , which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer - run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph .
b PAR 17 specifically , the committee seeks to maintain the weekly - average federal funds rate at about [ del : 6 - 1/2 ]   per cent , so long as m-1 and m-2 appear to be growing over the [ del : october - november ] november - december period at annual rates within ranges of [ del : 3 to 8 ]   to   per cent and
b PAR 17 [ del : 5 - 1/2 to 9 - 1/2 ]   to   per cent , respectively .
b PAR 17 if , giving approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the weekly - average federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of [ del : 6 - 1/2 to 6 - 3/4 ]   to   per cent .
b PAR 17 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif- icantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .

b PAR 17 c on average thus far in the fourth quarter , nonborrowed reserves have expanded at a 3¼ per cent annual rate , total reserves at a 5 per cent rate , and the monetary base at an 8¼ per cent rate .
b PAR 17 these rates are above the growth rates for the 1977 qiii to 1978 qi period shown in the table above that are thought to be consistent with the alternatives presented to the committee .
b PAR 17 thus , a slowing in the growth of reserves , and a considerable slowing in nonborrowed reserves , will be needed over the months ahead .
b PAR 17 ( the estimates for nonborrowed reserves shown in the table assume no change in the discount rate from its current level of 6 per cent .
b PAR 17 increases in the discount rate would , of course , shift the composition of total reserves more toward nonborrowed than borrowed reserves ) .
