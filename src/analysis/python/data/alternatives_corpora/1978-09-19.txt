a PAR 6 two alternative specifications for the federal funds rate and the monetary aggregates for the september - october period .

a PAR 6 growth in m-1 over the september - october period is expected to be in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range , largely in reflection of the stronger growth of this aggregate that appears in train for september .
a PAR 6 if m-1 expands at the mid - point of the expected range , its october level will be above that implied by the upper end of the fomc 's current longer - run range , as indicated in the upper panel of chart 1 on the following page .
a PAR 9 for the third quarter , the annual rate of m-1 growth is expected to be around 7 - 1/4 per cent .
a PAR 9 this represents a considerable slowing from the rate of the second quarter , and reflects the decelera- tion of economic activity from the extraordinary spring pace and the lagged response to rising short - term interest rates .

a PAR 9 the interest - bearing component of m-2 is expected to slow markedly from its recent pace as the year progresses .
a PAR 9 however , given the strength of time and savings deposits thus far in september , growth over the september- october period in the time deposit component of m-2 may be at around an 11 per cent annual rate -- considerably above the average pace of the first half of the year .
a PAR 9 savings deposit growth is not likely to be sus- tained at the august pace , but issuance of 6-month certificates should support growth of small time deposits and banks are expected to con- tinue to sell sizable amounts of large - denomination time deposits to meet loan demands .
a PAR 12 if the federal funds rate remains around 8 - 3/8 per cent over the intermeeting period , as envisioned under alternative a , short- term market interest rates would be expected to remain near current levels .
a PAR 12 the recent increases in short - term rates appear to have kept them in alignment with the funds rate .
a PAR 12 although short - term credit demands of both financial and nonfinancial businesses may pick up in september and october , following a weakening in august , they are likely to remain more moderate than over the first half of the year .
a PAR 12 demands for short - term funds from sponsored agencies should moderate somewhat in the weeks ahead from their strong summer pace , in view of the recent strength in thrift deposit flows , and the treasury will probably not tap the bill market for new money until the latter part of the fourth quarter .

a PAR 13 longer - term yields also may change little under alternative a , and could even edge down a little further , unless incoming data come to suggest a more rapid rate of inflation or stronger expansion in real activity than the market is currently expecting .
a PAR 13 municipal bond issuance has dropped off substantially in september and will likely con- tinue at a reduced pace in october .
a PAR 13 corporate bond offerings are likely to pick up only seasonally from the recent relatively light pace .
a PAR 13 the treasury is expected to rise only about $ 3.0 billion of new money in late september in auctions of 2-year and 5-year notes , and will then not be back in the market until late october .
a PAR 13 moreover , institutional investors apparently still have a considerable volume of liquid funds available for investment , and dealer positions are light .
a PAR 13 the recent rapid growth of thrift deposits suggests that mortgage market rates will likely fluctuate around current levels in coming weeks .
a PAR 16 under either alternative a or b , short - term interest rates are expected to come under further upward pressure before year- end .
a PAR 16 with nominal gnp projected to rise at an annual rate of more than 11 per cent over the balance of the longer - run policy period , the federal funds rate might have to rise to 9 to 9 - 1/4 per cent during the fourth quarter if growth in m-1 is to be constrained to around the upper limit
a PAR 16 1/2/of its range over the current longer - run policy period .
a PAR 16 the rise in market interest rates and the anticipated completion of the stock adjust- ment to the new 6-month certificates is expected to slow the pace of inflows into interest - bearing deposits subject to regulatory ceilings , and growth in both m-2 and m-3 over the qii ' 78 to qii ' 79 policy period is projected to be in the upper half of their longer - run ranges .
a PAR 16 1/ the staff 's projections for the federal funds rate through mid-1979 are shown in appendix i and for velocity growth rates in appendix ii .
a PAR 16 2/ growth in measured m-1 is expected to slow in the fourth and subsequent quarters if the board regulation with regard to automatic transfers from savings to demand deposits becomes effective november 1 .
a PAR 16 no allowance has been made for such a slowing in the estimates presented in this blue book .
a PAR 16 banks are just beginning to publish their pricing schedules for the automa- tic transfer service .
a PAR 16 even after most are published , competitive pressures will undoubtedly tend to change them and in any event it will be very difficult to project the probable public response and the extent to which m-1 will become distorted .
a PAR 16 these uncertainties about the size of the resulting dis- tortion in m-1 suggest the desirability of supplementing m-1 and m-2 with another measure that would be less affected than m-1 and would still be a reasonable indicator of transactions demands for money .
a PAR 16 such a measure-- termed m-1 + and defined as m-1 plus savings deposits at commercial banks and transactions balances at thrift institutions -- is presented in appendix v. directive language 

b PAR 14 m-1 growth would likely be in a 6 to 10 per cent annual rate range over september - october and m-2 growth in a 7 - 1/2 to 11 - 1/2 per cent range .
b PAR 14 the further increase in short - term rates would be expected to slow the inflows of interest - bearing deposits subject to regulatory ceilings at banks and thrifts , but recent evidence suggests that the new 6-month certificates will probably blunt some of the impact of rising rates on deposit growth , especially at thrifts .
b PAR 14 ( 14 ) ( 15 ) ( 16 ) note : weekly data for columns 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 7 are statement week averages of daily data .
b PAR 14 weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auctions of 6- month bills that will be issued on the thursday following the end of the statement week .
b PAR 14 data in column 5 are 1-day wednesday quotes .
b PAR 14 for columns 8 through 11 , the weekly date is the mid - point of the calendar week over which data are averaged .
b PAR 14 columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for friday and thursday , respectively , following the end of the statement week .
b PAR 14 column 14 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan - to - value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the friday following the end of the statement week .
b PAR 14 column 15 gives fnma auction data for monday preceding the end of the statement week .
b PAR 14 column 16 is a 1-day quote for monday preceding the end of the statement week .
b PAR 14 the fnma auction yield is the average yield in bi - weekly auction for short - term forward commitments for government underwritten mortgages .
b PAR 14 gnma yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage - backed securities for immediate delivery , assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year fha / va mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current fha / va ceiling .
b PAR 15 the modest increase in the funds rate contemplated under alternative b is , of course , likely to have some upward impact on short - term market rates of interest .
b PAR 15 however , such rates may rise by less than the funds rate -- and long - term rates by quite small amounts-- if market participants act on the assumption that the peak in interest rates is even closer at hand .
b PAR 15 a further increase in the funds rate would reinforce market expectations of another adjustment in the dis- count rate .
b PAR 15 barring such an adjustment , member bank borrowing would be likely to increase noticeably .
