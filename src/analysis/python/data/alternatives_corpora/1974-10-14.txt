b PAR 7 of the three alternatives shown , alternative b includes the 5¾ per cent longer - run target path for m1 adopted at the last committee meeting .
b PAR 7 a further decline in the federal funds rate over the next few weeks is indicated for that alternative , at least to the mid - point of the 8¾-10¾ per cent range .

b PAR 7 | 53 4 % growth rate has fallen short of expectations , and thus a more active provision of reserves is required in future to move back to path ; and ( b ) demand for money is expected to be lower , particularly by the first quarter , in view of the slower growth now projected by the staff for nominal gnp .
b PAR 8 based on partial data for the early days of the month , m1 growth in october is expected to be quite slow .
b PAR 8 growth is , expected to pick up considerably later in the fall and early winter , partly in consequence of the lagged impact on money demand of recent and projected interest rate declines .
b PAR 8 over the october - november period , m1 growth is indicated to be in a 4¾-6¾ per cent annual rate range under alternative b . given the small rise in september , the 5¾ per cent growth rate from august to march implies a 6½ per cent rate from september to march -- i.e . over the fourth and first quarters .

b PAR 10 the additional declines in interest rates expected under alternative b may involve a further easing in the 3-month commercial paper rate to the 9 - 9½ per cent range , compared with around 9¾ per cent currently , the 3-month treasury bill should continue to fluctuate very widely -- say , in a 6 - 8 per cent range -- and may average a bit below 7 per cent , although very large additions to the supply of bills in the days immediately ahead would likely exert upward pressure on the rate .
b PAR 10 as short - term market rates ease off , some pick - up in net inflows of time deposits other than money market cd 's at banks are to be expected , and the position of thrift institu- tions may show some improvement .
b PAR 10 growth rates of 7½ and 6¼ per cent , respectively , are expected for m2 and m3 over the fourth and first quarters , up from the relatively low third quarter growth rates of 4 - 5 per cent .
