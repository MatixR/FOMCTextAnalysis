a PAR 6 under alternative a -- which encompasses a range for the federal funds rate centered on its recently prevailing level of around 7 - 3/8 per cent -- m-1 is expected to expand in a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate range over the may - june period .
a PAR 6 given this projection , the level of m-1 in each month of the second quarter would be above levels implied by the fomc 's longer - run range , as shown in chart 1 on the following page .
a PAR 6 growth in m-1 in the second quarter would be at a 9¼ per cent annual rate , reflecting for the most part the sharp rebound in economic activity this quarter , when nominal gnp is now anticipated to expand at a 17½ per cent annual rate .

a PAR 6 the recent and expected near - term increases in market rates of interest will probably be associated with continued slow growth in savings deposits .
a PAR 6 banks are expected to benefit only modestly from the june
a PAR 6 1 introduction of the new 6-month and 8-year certificates , because these instruments are likely to be particularly attractive to the most interest - sensitive depositors who will probably take advantage of the higher rates offered by thrift institutions.2/ however , with loan demands expected to remain large , and demand deposits decelerating from their rapid growth in april , banks are projected to step up significantly their issuance of large - denomination time deposits .
a PAR 6 since a major portion of such instruments are included in m-2 , the interest - bearing component of this aggregate is expected to pick up somewhat from its reduced march - april pace .

a PAR 12 long - term rates are expected to show relatively little change under the conditions of alternative a . public offerings of corporate bonds are projected to remain moderate over the coming weeks , and state and local bond issuance should drop off markedly in late may after the effective date of the new irs ruling with regard to sinking fund provisions of tax - exempt bond offerings .
a PAR 12 on the other hand , the treasury -- after retiring about $ 2 billion of coupon securities in the latest refunding -- will probably raise about $ 2 to $ 2 billion of new cash when it sells the regular four - year cycle note in early june .
a PAR 12 in addition , the fhlb system will announce terms for its mid - quarter refunding early next week , and is expected to raise about $ 1 billion in this operation .
a PAR 12 receptions for these offerings could be quite good , however , since dealers have distri- buted the bulk of their awards of the treasury refunding issues and have reestablished a short position in coupon issues .
a PAR 15 the federal funds rate level that the staff believes will be needed to induce such velocity increases are shown in appendix i. under alternative a the federal funds rate might need to rise by fall into a range of 9 to 10 per cent -- about one percentage point higher than projected last month.1/ these projections assume some further downward shift in the demand for money -- as a result , for example , of more intensive marketing of previously introduced innovations and cash management services as interest rates rise.- it should be noted , though , that the relationship between money demand , income , and interest rates in the board 's econometric model has not generated any evidence of a further downward shift over the past five quarters .

b PAR 13 m-1 growth would likely be in a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate range over may and june and m-2 growth in a 4 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 per cent range .
b PAR 13 under this alternative , short - term rates generally might rise 1/2 percentage point or a little more .
b PAR 13 with loan demands expected to remain sizable , relatively prompt upward adjustments in the prime loan rate may be anticipated .
b PAR 13 moreover , a rise in member bank borrowings would also increase pressure for another discount rate adjustment .
b PAR 13 bond yields too could be expected to rise , though increases may be limited since current market yields have probably anticipated some further monetary tightness .
b PAR 13 the widening spread between interest rates in the united states and the rest of the world would tend to provide support for the exchange value of the dollar .
