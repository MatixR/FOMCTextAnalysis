a SENT -- the projected funds rate pattern for alternative a , as well as the other alternatives , is presented in appendix i. 

b PAR 7 assuming a federal funds rate centered in the 5¾-6½ per cent range specified for alternative b , m-1 over the september - october period is expected to expand in a 5 - 9 per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 7 incoming data suggest that m-1 will grow at about a 6½ per cent annual rate in september , and the staff would anticipate a slight acceleration to about a 7½ per cent annual rate in october .
b PAR 7 strength in the demand for m-1 is likely to be sustained in the fall , given the pick - up in growth of nominal gnp that is projected and recent indications that the public may be reducing the extent to which it is shifting out of m-1 into other liquid assets .
b PAR 9 under alternative b , in the september - october period m-2 is expected to expand in a 5½-9½ per cent annual rate range , assuming that short - term market interest rates show little change from currently prevailing levels in the period between now and the next meeting .
b PAR 9 net inflows of time and savings deposits other than negotiable cd 's are expected to be relatively low in september , but to pick up to a pace more consonant with existing interest rate relationships later in the fall .
b PAR 9 some of the recent weakness in the time deposit component of m-2 appears to have reflected shifts of funds from maturing " wild card " certi- ficates at banks to higher rate certificates at thrift institutions .
b PAR 9 indeed , at nonbank thrift institutions deposit inflows expanded sharply over the summer , as these institutions became more aggressive in seeking deposit funds in view of their large mortgage commitments and in light of uncertainties about their own substantial " wild card " maturities .
