a PAR 12 continuation of the short - run policy toward m1 adopted at the last meeting is shown as alternative a in the table below .
a PAR 12 this option would bring m1 into the upper half of the 2½ to 5½ percent longer- run range by march , assuming this long - run range is based , as has been the case in the past , on the actual average level of m1 in the fourth quarter of the previous year.1/ the risk of sharp interest rate fluctua- tions that might be associated with alternative a , accompanied by potentially adverse implications for economic activity and financial markets , might be reduced by extending beyond the first quarter the horizon over which the committee targets the return of m1 to within the tentative 2½ to 5½ percent longer - run range -- as is contemplated by the three other alternatives in the table .

a PAR 12 m1 would have to contract at about a 5½ percent annual rate over the remaining months of the quarter .

a PAR 12 after adjustment for the impact of shifts of assets from domestic offices to ibfs .
a PAR 12 the need for such an ibf adjustment could be avoided by basing the annual range for bank credit on the actual december - january average ; such a base would yield virtually the same 1982 growth rates .

a SENT -- this approach , like alternative a , would be consistent with growth for 1982 at around the midpoint of the longer - run range .

b PAR 16 the staff believes that such a slowing in narrow money growth is consistent with only rather modest further upward pressure on interest rates , if any .
b PAR 16 given the staff 's projection of nominal gnp growth during the current quarter at only about a 2½ percent annual rate , the rapid increase in money that has already occurred would appear quite sufficient to finance transactions needs over the quarter , even assuming that a substantial part of the increase represented precautionary balances .
b PAR 16 indeed , even with virtually no money growth over the balance of the quarter , the velocity of m1 would decline in the quarter at a postwar record annual rate of about 9 percent .
b PAR 17 the alternative b specifications would entail little change in total reserves over the period from january to march . assuming adjustment borrowing of around $ 1 billion , nonborrowed reserves would decline at a 3 percent rate and , at the present discount rate , the federal funds rate in the intermeeting period would likely fluctuate in a 13½ to 14½ percent range.1/ demands for short - term credit are likely to remain quite strong over the balance of the quarter , with businesses continuing to avoid the bond market at the relatively high rate levels likely to prevail over the near - term under this alternative .

c PAR 14 alternative d specifies a 4 percent annual rate of growth for february and march .
c PAR 14 continuation of that growth rate over the balance of the year would result in growth of m1 from qiv ' 81 to qiv ' 82 at about 6¾ percent , above the 5½ percent upper limit of the 1982 range based on the actual qiv ' 81 average level .
c PAR 14 such a trajectory would be consistent with a committee decision to raise the upper limit of the tentative 1982 range or a decision to base the 2½ to 5½ percent range , not on the actual qiv ' 81 level , but on , say , the lower limit of last year 's longer - run target range.1/ when the committee established its tentative range for 1982 last july , it had anticipated that m1 would reach the lower limit of the long - run range for 1981 by the fourth quarter ; an upward shift in 1/ to derive a base consistent with the current m1 , which is not shift- adjusted , the level in qiv ' 81 implied by the 3½ percent lower limit of the target range for m1-b shift - adjusted has to be raised by the $ 11.3 billion of estimated shifts into now accounts from non - demand deposit sources in 1981 .
c PAR 14 this derived level would be $ 5.1 billion , or 1.2 percent , higher than the actual ( not shift - adjusted ) level of m1-b in the fourth quarter of 1981 .
c PAR 14 the base for the 1982 range would in that context indicate the committee was not willing to accept last year 's undershoot and viewed the recent increase in m1 as at least in part a desirable offset to the earlier short- fall .
c PAR 14 with such a rebasing of the 2½ to 5½ percent longer - run range for 1982 , the specifications of alternative d if extended for the year would bring m1 into the upper half of the rebased range by the fourth quarter of this year .
c PAR 14 if alternative c were adopted in conjunction with a rebasing of the long - run range , growth by the fourth quarter would be around the midpoint of the range .

c PAR 19 assuming a decline in adjustment borrowing from recent levels to about $ 1 billion , nonborrowed reserves would rise at 2 percent rate .
c PAR 19 a federal funds rate of about 13 percent would be implied .
c PAR 19 the 3-month bill rate would likely decline from present levels to around 12 percent or a bit lower as expectations of further monetary ease tend to develop .
c PAR 19 bond yields may edge down from current levels , inducing a pick - up in bond issuance from recent depressed levels .
