a PAR 23 the staff 's m2 forecast is in the lower half of the alternative a range .
a PAR 23 this range allows for a greater move toward more normal velocity behavior than the staff has assumed , should , for example , public appetites for mutual funds fall off more rapidly than expected .
a PAR 23 even absent such a shift , the alternative a ranges would not necessarily present problems should the committee substantially firm reserve conditions .
a PAR 23 the responsiveness of m2 to movements in short - term rates has been muted in recent years , and growth of this aggregate could still exceed 1 percent if short - term rates rose sig- nificantly .
a PAR 23 in part this is because rising short - term rates are like-
a PAR 23 ly to be accompanied by some declines in bond and possibly stock prices , damping shifts to mutual funds from m2 and supporting the aggregate 's growth .
a PAR 23 moreover , the m2 ranges in alternative a would be consistent with the attainment of price stability in the context of a return over time to a flat trend in m2 velocity , as the staff assumed in constructing the money growth rates for the long - run strategies .
a PAR 23 with flat velocity , m2 growth of about 3 percent -- the midpoint of alternative a -- would accompany nominal income growth of the same magnitude consistent with the staff 's estimate of growth in potential output , given the upward bias in measured inflation rates .
a PAR 23 short - run policy alternatives 
a PAR 27 the easing of policy under alternative a would come as more of a surprise to market participants .
a PAR 27 some could interpret the action as a response by federal reserve policymakers to weaker inter-
a PAR 27 nal economic forecasts than the market consensus , perhaps owing to concerns about upcoming fiscal drag .
a PAR 27 but others would be led to question the federal reserve 's anti - inflationary resolve .
a PAR 27 in those circumstances , an adverse impact on inflation expectations could well result , preventing much of a decline in bond yields .
a PAR 27 even the fall in short - term rates could be muted by the view that the policy ease would soon have to be reversed to forestall excessive price pressures .
a PAR 27 the dollar 's exchange value could be lowered by both the
a PAR 27 reduced u.s . short - term rates and heightened concerns about u.s . inflation .

b PAR 22 in addition to being about centered on the staff 's projections for money and credit , alternative b might be selected as a means of underscoring the committee 's commitment to containing and reducing inflation .
b PAR 22 if , for example , a pickup in money growth were to accompany a continued strong and potentially overheating economy , the committee might be better positioned to take and explain prompt ac- tions under this alternative than under the higher provisional ranges .
b PAR 22 moreover , if the committee tightened reserve conditions to forestall a potential strengthening of inflation pressures or to bring inflation down more rapidly -- as in the tighter scenario above -- the alternative b ranges would allow more scope for the lower money growth that might accompany moderate nominal gdp expansion with higher interest rates than in the staff forecast .
b PAR 22 this alternative might also be favored if it were thought that further large downward shifts in m2 demand are still in prospect , posing a significant risk that m2 in 1994 could come in below the lower end of its provisional range , even under the staff economic forecast .
b PAR 25 market participants now anticipate continuation of the money market conditions implied by alternative b over the near term , and fomc choice of this alternative would not engender any immediate reaction in security markets .
b PAR 25 investors generally expect the federal reserve to put off any policy tightening for a time , given uncertainties about the extent of moderation in economic activity and about developing price trends in early 1994 - -uncertainties that have been heightened by the earthquake and severe weather .
b PAR 25 nevertheless , most anticipate a tightening within a few months as incoming data suggest only a limited slowing in economic growth and a cessation of disinflation .
b PAR 25 as the intermeeting period progresses , economic data along the lines of the staff forecast might put modest upward pressure on short - term interest rates as the time of expected tightening approaches , but would induce little systematic movement in longer - term rates .
b PAR 25 the exchange value of the dollar also is likely to trade in a relatively narrow range around current levels .
b PAR 29 m2 growth likely will be held down under alternative b by a reversal of the previous bulge attributable to mortgage refinanc-
b PAR 29 ing activity , which had boosted average m2 growth by an estimated 1 percentage point during the october through december months , before becoming a minor drag in january .
b PAR 29 over the february - to - june period , falling prepayments of mortgage - backed securities are projected to deduct 1 to 2 percentage points from m2 growth.13 nevertheless , the underlying trend of m2 is anticipated to strengthen enough to leave actual m2 growth at a 2 percent rate from january to june .
b PAR 29 inflows to bond and stock mutual funds through june should be somewhat weaker than the pace of last year , as a result of the flatter yield curve and likely smaller capital gains .
b PAR 29 14   in addition , previous declines in offering rates on liquid deposits evidently have brought them into full alignment with money market rates , so this drag on m2 expansion 13 .
b PAR 29 with demand deposits most affected by mortgage refinancing activity ,
b PAR 29 m1 growth from january to june will be depressed by around 4 percentage points by this special factor under alternative b . growth of m1 is projected at 6 - 3/4 percent over this period , implying growth of total reserves and the monetary base of 4 - 3/4 and 9 - 1/2 percent , respectively .
b PAR 29 the staff projects that m2 plus bond and stock mutual funds will grow at about a 4 percent rate from january to june .

c PAR 26 the firming in the stance of policy under alternative c would come sooner than now built into market quotes and would be re- flected in increases in short - term rates nearly equal to the 50 basis 12 .

c PAR 26 the action might help to resolve any questions about whether the federal reserve would take steps to contain price pressures in advance of actual increases in inflation .
