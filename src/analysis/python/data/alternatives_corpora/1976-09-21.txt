a PAR 11 such an easing would probably be accompanied by a decline in the treasury bill rate to the 4¾ per cent area also and by a drop in the 3-month commercial paper rate to around 5 per cent .
a PAR 11 in response to these market rate declines , the bank prime loan rate would probably adjust downward .
a PAR 11 longer - term market rates probably also would move down somewhat further , but the declines could be limited as borrowers accelerate offerings in anticipation of a later reversal in yields .
a PAR 11 primary mortgage market rates -- which have changed little in recent weeks despite declines in corporate bond yields-- would probably begin to drop noticeably .

a PAR 12 the easing in short - term rates under alternative a would likely be accompanied by a slightly stronger expansion in m1 over the short - run -- with the m1 growth range estimated to be 4 -8 per cent for the september - october period .
a PAR 12 there would be some strengthening in inflows of time and savings deposits other than large cd 's , particularly savings deposits .
a PAR 12 however , if credit demands on banks remain relatively weak over the next few weeks , banks are likely to become less active in soliciting consumer - type time deposit funds .
a PAR 12 banks would probably continue to run - off large money market cd 's , while at the same time taking advantage of the lower level of market rates to lengthen maturities on those new cd 's that they do issue .
a SENT -- alternative " money market " proposals alternative a to implement this policy , while taking account of develop- ments in domestic and international financial markets , the com- mittee seeks to [ del : maintain prevailing ] achieve somewhat easier bank reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately ahead , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected .

b PAR 7 with economic activity projected to expand at a moderate rate over the next few months , m1 is also expected to continue rising over the september - october period at a rate little different from that of recent months .
b PAR 7 under alternative b , given prevailing money market conditions -- as indexed by a federal funds rate around 5¼ per cent-- m1 will probably grow in a 4 - 8 per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 8 m2 may rise in a 9 - 13 per cent annual rate range under alternative b over the september - october period .
b PAR 8 in recent weeks , expansion of time and savings deposits other than large money market cd 's has been substantially more rapid than expected .
b PAR 8 although we have assumed that the rate of expansion will slow somewhat over the course of the inter- meeting period , we still expect such deposits to rise at about a 15 per cent annual rate on balance from august to october .
b PAR 8 much of this reflects our assumption that the rate of increase in savings deposits at banks and-- -5a- alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m1 m2 alt .

c PAR 13 the tightening of money market conditions contemplated under alternative c -- with the funds rate range centered on 5¾ per cent-- might well lead to fairly sharp upward adjustments in market rates over the next few weeks .
c PAR 13 dealer bill positions are currently very large , and the 3-month bill rate could move up to the 5 -6 per cent area .
c PAR 13 holdings of coupon issues are also fairly sizable , and strong efforts to secure the paper profits on such positions could lead to an appreciable rise in longer - term treasury yields , with spill - over effects on other longer - term markets .
c PAR 14 a little slower growth in the monetary aggregates would , of course , be likely to develop over the september - october period under alternative c than under either of the other two alternatives .
c PAR 14 in particular , growth in savings deposits may well come to a halt , at least temporarily , as depositors shift to higher - yielding market instruments .
c PAR 14 banks may seek to compensate for this to some extent by more aggressive offerings of time deposits , including large cd 's . on balance , under this alternative we would expect m1 over the forthcoming two - month period to expand in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range and m2 in an 8 - 12 per cent range .
