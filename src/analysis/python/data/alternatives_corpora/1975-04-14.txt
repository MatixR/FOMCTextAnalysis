a PAR 12 growth is expected to be especially large in may when the largest part of the tax rebates are paid out .
a PAR 12 this alternative contemplates about a 7¾ per cent annual rate of growth in m1 , and 11 per cent in m 2 , over the second and third quarters .
a SENT -- with some diminution in the expansion of interest - bearing deposits , growth in broader measures of money would be moderated , relative to alternative a . bank credit expansion would be reduced somewhat , but with business and consumer loan demands expected to be weak at least over the next month or two , banks would still be in a position to participate heavily in treasury financings .

b PAR 9 m 2 for this alternative shows about the same rate of growth as at the last meeting , but m3 is somewhat more rapid , reflecting the greatly enlarged public preference for deposits at thrift institutions which appears to have emerged .

b PAR 14 a rise in the federal funds rate to around the 6 per cent level -- as shown for alternative b short - run specifications in paragraph ( 10 --would probably lead to a sharp market reaction .
b PAR 14 the 3-month bill rate could move up into the 6¼-6¾ per cent area .
b PAR 14 treasury coupon issues , particularly short - term coupons , might rise another 50 basis points , or possibly more in the short - run as markets over - anticipate the extent of monetary tightening in process .
b PAR 14 such a rise would lead to yields in the 7¾-8 per cent area on 2-year treasury notes -- a yield level which , if sustained , would begin to attract funds that might otherwise go into banks and thrift instituions .
b PAR 14 we have assumed some moderation in such flows under this alternative , but they are expected to remain relatively large over the next few months .
b PAR 14 the availability of mortgage market funds may not , therefore , be significantly limited in this period .
