a PAR 11 given the high rates of growth in the monetary aggregates in november , such an easing in the money market would be contrary to current market expectations and might be accompanied by a sizable near - term decline in short - term rates .
a PAR 11 on the other hand , many market participants may take the view that such an easing is only temporary and , to that extent , declines in market rates would be limited .
a PAR 11 under this alternative , the staff expects that the funds rate would have to begin rising later in the winter in order to attain the fomc 's current longer - run monetary objectives and that the rate would be in the 7½-8 per cent area by summer .
a PAR 11 this alternative , therefore , would ultimately tend to exert considerable pressure on savings inflows at thrift institutions and banks .

b PAR 5 the staff believes that in these circumstances m1 would grow in about a 4 - 6 per cent , annual rate , range and m2 in a 7 - 9 per cent range .
b PAR 5 growth of m 1 in the december - january period is expected to be constrained by continuing shifts of corporate funds from demand deposits to savings accounts .
b PAR 5 the expected range of m1 growth reflects our assumption that such shifts may reduce m growth by 1 to 1 percentage points .
b PAR 5 this assumption is based on an evaluation of early data on the increase in corporate savings accounts and our expectation that the pace at which funds are transferred out of demand accounts will slow .
b PAR 9 the basic outlook over the longer run for monetary aggregates and interest rates appears little changed from the previous blue book .
b PAR 9 under alternative b , the federal funds rate would be expected to begin rising by around mid - winter and may reach the 7 - 7½ per cent range by summer , which would be a shade less than projected last time .
b PAR 9 growth in time deposits other than large cd 's is expected to moderate progressively over the first half of next year .
