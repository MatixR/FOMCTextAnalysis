a PAR 14 under alternative a -- which contemplates m1 growth at a 7 per cent annual rate over the second half of the year -- the federal funds rate would be expected to decline to around 11 per cent between now and the next committee meeting , probably stimulating a fairly marked decline of interest rates over a broad maturity spectrum .
a PAR 14 interest rate declines would be intensified in the short run as market attitudes with respect to monetary policy shift and as government security dealers begin to cover short positions .
a PAR 14 however , given the size of prospective borrowing demands and the concern over inflation , rate declines would not be likely to cumulate .
a PAR 14 for example , recently postponed municipal and corporate offerings would probably be re - offered shortly under the circum- stances , and this would tend to moderate downward rate pressures .
a PAR 14 the position of banks and thrift institutions would ease under this alternative , though remaining on the tight side as compared with historical experience , since an 11 per cent federal funds rate implies a structure of market rates still quite attractive relative to present regulation q ceilings .
a SENT -- for all three alternatives , it is proposed to include a reference to treasury financing because the regular august refunding will be announced on july 31 . alternative a to implement this policy , while taking account of the forthcoming treasury refunding and of developments in domestic and international financial markets , the committee seeks to [ del : maintain about the prevailing restrictive ] achieve bank reserve and money market conditions

b PAR 7 in that alternative , the annual growth rate for the second half of 1974 is 5½ per cent .
b PAR 7 this is slightly above the 5¼ per cent rate adopted at the last meeting simply because the june level for m1 turned out to be slightly lower than estimated at that time ; the level set for december is unchanged from the previous meeting .
b PAR 10 the specifications of alternative b would contemplate a federal funds rate in an 11 - 13 per cent range between now and the next committee meeting , and m1 growth for july - august in a 4 - 6 per cent annual money supply and longer run target path ratio scale , billions of dollars rate of growth june ' 73 to june ' 74 5.8 % .

b PAR 10 such a funds rate would probably lead to some relaxation in pressures on short- and long - term markets , partly because investors and borrowers would come to believe that monetary policy was a little less restrictive than had appeared to be the case in the most recent weeks .
b PAR 10 any drop in market rates is likely to be modest in size and short - lived , however , given the inflationary environment , continued strong credit demands , and the forthcoming treasury , federal financing bank , and agency financings ( both to raise cash and to refund maturing issues ) .

b PAR 12 the ability of banks to finance additional loan demands is expected to be relatively limited , though .
b PAR 12 with growth in demand deposits and consumer - type time deposits constrained , banks will be under pressure to issue new cd 's . however , except for the prime names , market receptivity to cd 's is in some question .
b PAR 12 in general , the recent concern with liquidity exposure , on the part of both banks and investors , will probably reduce the pace at which new cd 's will be offered . as a result , bank credit growth under alternative b is projected at around an 8½ per cent annual rate over the third quarter , substantially less than in the first half of the year .
b PAR 12 this rate of expansion would probably mean that banks will have to cut back sharply on acquisitions of securities , particularly municipal and federal agency issues .
b PAR 12 thus , interest rates in intermediate and longer - term markets would likely come under renewed upward pressure as time goes on .
b PAR 12 the bank prime loan rate would probably also rise somewhat further .
b SENT -- ( 13 ) under alternative b pressures on thrift institutions would be expected to be somewhat greater than during the second quarter .
b SENT -- under this alternative , interest rates would likely rise further in the weeks immediately ahead , and would rise by more than under alternative b over the longer run .
b SENT -- [ del : appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance]. alternative b to implement this policy , while taking account of the forthcoming treasury refunding and of developments in domestic and international financial markets , the committee seeks to [ del : maintain the prevailing restrictive ] achieve bank reserve and money market conditions [ del : provided that the ] that would moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead [ del : appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance].

c PAR 15 the possibility of a credit crunch in financial markets can not be ignored , especially under alternative c . such a development could be triggered by a series of failures of financial or industrial concerns , here or abroad .
c PAR 15 this could lead to sharply higher rates and a drying up of credit flows in markets where there is perceived to be heightened credit risk and to lower rates in safe markets , such as the treasury securities market .
c PAR 15 many borrowers would not be able to obtain credit , and some bank and other institutional lenders would not be able to tap their usual sources of funds .
c PAR 15 under the circumstances , remedial action by the system would be expected , either through the market or through the discount window .
c PAR 15 as a result , whatever specifications are adopted by the committee would very likely have to be superseded , at least temporarily , by other operating criteria .
c PAR 15 it should be recognized in any event that the various specifications presented are more uncertain than usual since the situation in financial markets and the economy is unprecedented in the postwar period .
c PAR 15 proposed directive language 
c PAR 17 in the event that the committee again wishes to couch the operational paragraph of the directive in terms of prevailing money market conditions , the specifications of alternative c might be associated with the language used in the directive adopted at the last meeting-- namely , that " . . .the committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing restrictive money market conditions , provided that the monetary aggregates appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance .
