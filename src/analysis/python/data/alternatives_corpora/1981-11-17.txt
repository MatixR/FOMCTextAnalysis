a PAR 9 such shifts are expected to be small , however ; they may have some impact on annual growth rates for the month of december , but would probably have no significant effect on growth for the year .
a PAR 9 the great bulk of the money shifted into ibfs will be from large time deposits or other interest - bearing liabilities , so that the principal impact potentially would be on m3 .
a PAR 9 year -- would entail growth in total reserves at a 7Â½ percent annual rate over the last two months of the year- and may involve a drop in the funds rate over the next few weeks to the 9 to 10 percent area .
a PAR 9 under such conditions other short - term interest rates would of course also decline substantially , with the 3-month bill rate perhaps falling to around the 9 percent area .
a PAR 9 such declines would occur against a back - drop of continued sizable treasury cash borrowings over the balance of the year ( $ 13 billion in the bill market and $ 6 billion in the coupon market ) but reduced short- term credit demands by businesses , as their financing gap narrows , largely in reflection of reduced inventory accumulation , and as credit demands are shifted to longer - term markets .

b SENT -- the staff believes short - term rate declines under alternative b could carry the funds rate into the 10 to 12 percent range .

c SENT -- under alternative c , that might also develop , but it would be less certain as the weight of treasury financings and possible market disappointment about the likely course of the funds rate ( and hence of dealer financing costs ) would work to hold bill and other short - term rates up .
c SENT -- the nonborrowed reserve path for alternative c , the alternative involving the least expansion in reserves , might be initially constructed on the basis of $ 400 million in borrowing .
