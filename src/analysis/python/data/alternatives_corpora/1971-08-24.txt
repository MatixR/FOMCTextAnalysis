a SENT -- ( 10 ) the text table that follows specifies : ( 1 ) the growth path for m1 thought to be consistent with the unchanged federal funds rate assumption of alternative a ; and ( 2 ) the funds rate thought to be needed to achieve the 6 per cent annual growth rate in m1 ( for the third and fourth quarters combined ) that was associated with the directive adopted at the last meeting 1/ the table on the next page shows the paths for all of the monetary aggregates under the two alternatives .
a SENT -- 3rd quarter 4th quarter second half alternative a 5 - 3/8 - -5 - 3/4 % $ 700-$900 million 4 - 3/4 - -5 - 1/2 %
a SENT -- ( 14 ) under alternative a , rates of growth in the other monetary aggregates are projected to slow significantly after august .
a SENT -- if the committee adopts this alternative , it may wish to consider the money market conditions notedfor alternative a in paragraph ( 10 ) as a description of " prevailing " conditions , and for purposes of the proviso clause to adopt the growth paths for the monetary and credit aggregates discussed earlier in connection with alternative a as the " expected " paths .

b SENT -- 7 - 1/2 % 5 - 1/2 % alternative b 4 - 1/2 - -5 % $ 450-$650 million 4 - -4 - 3/4 % 7 - 1/2 % 8 - 1/2 % 
b PAR 16 while the market probably has already discounted some re- duction in the federal funds rate , sizable downward movement -- say , to the lower end of the range specified in alternative b -- would undoubtedly be interpreted by the market as a significant policy move .
b PAR 16 this would encourage further yield declines in both short- and long - term markets .
b PAR 16 it is possible that such a move could carry rates to unsustainably low levels , but , on the other hand , it is still unclear whether the decline in market yields to date has fully discounted the changed outlook on inflation .
b SENT -- this alternative is provided in the event the fomc may wish to move in the direction recommended by the committee on the directive . if the public appetite for demand as against time deposits proves different from that assumed in the alternative b specifications , for example , the committee might nevertheless wish to provide only the quantity of reserves consistent with those projections .
b PAR 20 total reserves for both august and september would be expected to increase at around a 17.0 per cent annual rate of growth .
b PAR 20 in the fourth quarter the rate of increase would be reduced to about half the august- september rate .
b PAR 20 nonborrowed reserves after declining sharply in july -- re- flecting the over $ 300 million increase in member bank borrowings -- are expected to track very closely to total reserves on the assumption that borrowings will show no appreciable further increase on average in august .
b PAR 20 in september , however , borrowings are projected to average sharply lower than in august , so that nonborrowed reserves would have to increase at a very rapid pace if targeted rates of growth in m1 and m2 are to be achieved .
b PAR 20 if the decline in borrowings needed to achieve the alternative b paths is some-
b PAR 20 what overstated , the growth in nonborrowed reserve could be commensurately smaller .
b PAR 20 possible directive language 
b PAR 24 alternative
b PAR 24 this language is proposed for possible use if the committee decides to seek the objectives discussed above in connec- tion with alternative b , but would prefer to have the desk shift emphasis from money market conditions to bank reserves in implementing policy .
b PAR 24 " to implement this policy , [ del : taking account of the current treasury financing and of developments in capital markets , ] the committee seeks to promote [ del : achieve more ] moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead .
b PAR 24 system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve
b PAR 24 [ del : and money market ] conditions consistent with that [ del : these ] objectives ; provided , however , that operations shall be modified if necessary to avoid excessive fluctuations in money market conditions .
b PAR 24 a proviso clause designed to guard against excessive fluctuation in money market conditions is suggested in this alternative for reasons discussed in paragraph ( 17 ) .
b PAR 24 as will be noted , the primary instructions of this alternative differs from the language of alternative b only in the deletion of the words " and money market " from the phrase " with a view to achieving bank reserve and money market conditions .

c PAR 9 two broad policy approaches are described below which pro- bably define the limits within which most would consider a neutralist policy to fall .
c PAR 9 both , as it happens , might be characterized -- in their own contexts-- as policies calling for minimum change .
c PAR 9 the first specifies the maintenance of current money market conditions , a course which the staff believes would imply some weakening after august in the growth rates of the aggregates from those associated with the policy accepted at the last meeting .
c PAR 9 the second would specify maintenance ̂of^ growth in m at the rate consistent with the directive adopted at the last meeting , a course which in our view would require an easing of money market conditions .
c PAR 9 the specifications given for the second alternative ( b ) might also be employed with directive language presented in a later section under the label of alternative c . as noted in that section , c differs from b with respect to operating techniques rather than objectives .
c PAR 9 specifically , under c the desk would place main emphasis on bank reserves rather than on money market conditions in making operating decisions .
c PAR 18 if the committee adopts alternative c it may want to instruct the manager to make his operating decisions on the basis of available evidence regarding the relationship between the actual supply of reserves and the supply considered to be best calculated to promote growth in the monetary and credit aggregates at the desired rates .
c PAR 18 in addition , the manager might be given leeway to adjust the target paths for total and non- borrowed reserves to take account of deviations in u.s .
c PAR 18 government deposits and ̂in deposit^ distribution between reserve city and country banks from original pro- jections .
c PAR 18 the manager might also be advised that in making day - to - day operating decisions he should refer particularly to information on non- borrowed reserves , but should also take into account data on member bank borrowings for what they indicate about both the behavior of total reserves and the degree of tension in the banking system .
c PAR 18 similarly , he might be instructed to use information on the cost of reserves -- as reflected primarily in the federal funds rate -- as a supplementary and early indicator of the effective supply of reserves in the market .
c PAR 19 shown in the table below are
c PAR 19 monthly and weekly aggregates reserve paths consistent with alternative c .
c PAR 19 the indicated percentage growth rates for reserves are far above those projected for m1 and m2 chiefly because of the use of reserves to support sharply increased levels of certain types of deposits ( mainly government deposits ) not included in m1 and m2 .
