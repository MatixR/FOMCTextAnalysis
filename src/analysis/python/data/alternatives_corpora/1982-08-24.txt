a PAR 10 to attain the 5 percent target , m1 would have to accelerate to a 7 - 3/4 percent annual rate of growth on average in august and september .
a PAR 10 this is likely to be consistent with short - term rates over the intermeeting period at around recent levels , or perhaps a little higher -- with the funds rate in the 9 to 9 1/2 percent area .

a PAR 10 as compared with the 7 - 1/2 percent annual rate of expansion in nominal gnp projected for this quarter by the staff .
a PAR 11 total reserves under alternative a would expand at about a 4 - 3/4 percent annual rate over the balance of the quarter .
a PAR 11 this probably would be associated with somewhat more rapid growth in nonborrowed than in total reserves , assuming borrowing drops to around $ 250 million , a nearly frictional level after taking account of seasonal borrowing .
a PAR 11 for this level of borrowing to be consistent with no more than a modest back - up in short - term rates may , however , require a drop in the discount rate from the current 10 - 1/2 percent level .
a PAR 15 the firming of the funds rate from very recent levels contemplated in this alternative would seem to run counter to the expec- tations of a good many market participants .
a PAR 15 as a result , it is quite likely that short - term rates would back up , with the 3-month bill rate moving back toward 9 percent .
a PAR 15 bond yields would retrace some of their recent declines , though any reaction in credit markets could be mild in the context of m1 remaining below the 5 - 1/2 percent upper bound of the committee 's 1982 target range ( which is assumed in the path ) and if incoming economic data continue weak .
a PAR 15 because money market fund yields would more quickly come into alignment with market rates , m2 and especially m3 growth would probably be a bit slower than under alternative a . the very recent downward pressures on the dollar in exchange markets probably would abate , and may be reversed .
a SENT -- ( 17 ) in the fourth quarter of the year , interest rates may be under upward pressure as compared with levels anticipated between now and september in either alternative a or b. nominal gnp growth is expected to be maintained at close to the third - quarter rate in part because of lagged effects of the recent tax cut .

b PAR 14 m1 would be expected to grow at about a 6 - 1/4 percent annual rate on average in august and september , with total reserves expanding at a 3 - 3/4 percent annual rate over the balance of the quarter .
b PAR 14 borrowing at the discount window may be in the $ 350 to $ 400 million area .
