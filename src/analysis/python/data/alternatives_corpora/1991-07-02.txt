a PAR 22 if the risks to the outlook were viewed as weighted on the side of weaker - than - expected production , employment and inflation pres- sures , or if the staff 's greenbook forecast were judged to embody an insufficient economic recovery , the higher growth rates of alternative a could be selected .
a PAR 22 thus , this alternative would line up roughly with the easier strategy discussed above , with its emphasis on assuring expansion sufficient to reduce the margin of unutilized resources .
a PAR 22 alternative
a PAR 22 i also could be preferred if , given an acceptable economic forecast , the bluebook projection for m2 growth were viewed as too low .
a PAR 22 this view could be buttressed by the notion that an economic recovery should improve the quality of bank assets , leading to a faster unwinding of restraint on bank lending and of the associated reluctance of banks to attract retail deposits .
a PAR 22 accordingly , the previous shortfall of m2 growth relative to typical experience could be seen as more likely to reverse than to continue .
a SENT -- under alternative a , the federal funds rate would decline to around 5 - 1/4 percent .
a PAR 27 the staff pro- jects that m2 growth would be at a 6 - 1/2 percent rate from june to septem- ber under alternative a . by september
a PAR 27 , m2 would be a little above the midpoint of its annual range .
a PAR 27 the further easing of monetary policy contemplated under alternative a would catch market participants by surprise , and short - term market interest rates would drop considerably .
a PAR 27 bond yields are unlikely to fall much , absent favorable inflation news .
a PAR 27 the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets likely would decline substantially .

b PAR 21 alternative
b PAR 21 ii is broadly consistent with staff forecasts for money , economic activity , and prices , and therefore with the baseline strategy of gradual reductions in inflation .
b PAR 21 m3 and debt are projected at the midpoint of their alternative b ranges , but m2 is projected to be well up in its range .
b PAR 21 in the case of m2 , this range might imply that the committee was less willing to tolerate surprisingly strong than surpris- ingly weak nominal income growth .
b PAR 21 this feature may be viewed as espe- cially appropriate after the initial stages of economic expansion , when with higher levels of resource utilization , unanticipated strength in demand could undermine the disinflationary process .
b PAR 21 on the other hand , if economic activity proves weaker than the staff forecast , prompting a monetary policy easing , alternative b could constrain further easing somewhat ; the resulting stimulus of lower opportunity costs could bring growth of m2 near the upper bound of its range rather quickly .
b SENT -- the tighter long - term strategy discussed above is readily encompassed within the current alternative b range .
b SENT -- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 5 - 3/4 percent .
b PAR 25 under alternative b , market interest rates would probably remain near their current levels .
b PAR 25 market rates appear generally to incor- porate a consensus view of no change in the stance of monetary policy over the rest of the summer .
b PAR 25 market participants , however , seem to expect the economic rebound over the next few months to be weaker than presented in the greenbook .
b PAR 25 if economic data turn out to be consistent with the green- book , some upward pressure on interest rates could occur , though that 8 .
b PAR 25 although seasonal borrowing has been somewhat lower than usual this year , such borrowing is expected to rise over the summer , and additional upward adjustments to the borrowing allowance probably will be required in the next few months .
b PAR 25 9 . as discussed in recent bluebooks , the first approach has the disadvantage of limiting the ability of the discount window to absorb fluctuations in reserve supply and demand , thereby causing the funds rate to become a little more volatile .
b PAR 25 c growth from june to september m2 6 - 1/2 5 - 1/2 4 - 1/2 m3 3 - 1/2 3 2 - 1/2 m1 7 - 1/2 6 4 - 1/2 growth from q4'90 to september m2 4 - 3/4 4 - 1/2 4 - 1/4 m3 3 2 - 3/4 2 - 1/2 m1 7 - 1/2 7 6 - 1/2 pressure would be offset if data also continue to indicate good inflation performance .
b PAR 25 the foreign exchange value of the dollar also is not expected to show much change from its current level under this alternative .
b PAR 26 with the pickup in gnp , m2 would accelerate to a 5 - 1/2 percent annual rate from june to september , bringing this aggregate up to the middle of its long - run range in september .
b PAR 26 on a quarterly average basis , m2 would expand at a 4 - 1/2 percent rate during the third quarter which , given the staff projection of an 8 percent increase in nominal gnp , implies that velocity would rise at a 3 - 1/2 percent rate .
b PAR 26 this increase reflects , in part , the rise in opportunity costs as deposit rates decline , as well as lags in the adjustment of money holdings to a marked change in income growth .
b PAR 26 m3 is expected to increase at a 3 percent rate from june to september under alternative b , keeping this aggregate a alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m2 m3 m1 alt .
b PAR 26 c levels in billions
b PAR 26 monthly growth rates quarterly ave .
b PAR 26 growth rates 2.5 to 6.5 1.0 to 5.01991 target ranges :
b PAR 26 chart 3 actual and targeted m2 billions of dollars --- actual level
b PAR 26 sshort - run alternatives 6.5 % -i 3300

b PAR 26 10200 little below the midpoint of its annual range .
b PAR 26 the pickup in m3 relative to the last three months reflects a rise in overall borrowing , including from banks , as the economy recovers .
b PAR 26 total nonfinancial debt is projected to increase at a 6 - 3/4 percent annual rate over june to september , raising this aggregate well into the lower bound of its monitoring range by sep- tember .

c SENT -- but alternative c would seem more consistent with the spirit and intent of that strategy , since reducing the ranges another 1/2 percentage point would underscore the committee 's com- mitment to the attainment of price stability .
