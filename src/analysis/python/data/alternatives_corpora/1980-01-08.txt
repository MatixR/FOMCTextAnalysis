a PAR 8 this section of the bluebook presents material to provide a basis for preliminary committee discussion of longer - run target ranges for the aggregates for 1980 , and perhaps beyond--
a PAR 8 preparatory to making a decision on these matters at the february meeting .
a PAR 8 the table below shows two alternative sets of ranges for 1980 ( qiv ' 79 to qiv ' 80 ) as a starting point for discussion .
a PAR 8 the ranges shown in the upper panel are in terms of monetary aggregates as currently defined , while preliminary estimates of consistent target ranges based on new definitions of the aggregates are presented in the lower panel .
a PAR 8 these new definitions will be ready for publication in february , and the committee would presumably make its decision at the february meeting in terms of the newly defined measures .

a PAR 8 4½ to 7½ 3 to 6 --
a PAR 8 5.0 m-1b 5 to 8 3½
a PAR 8 to 6½ -- 7.3 m-2 7 to 10 6½ to 9½ -- 8.2 m-3 7 to 10 6½ to 9½ -- 8.9 ( 9 ) alternative a represents a continuation of current policy with respect to growth of m-1 after adjustment is made for shifts out of existing demand deposits into ats accounts .
a PAR 8 in recent months , it has been assumed that such shifts would reduce m-1 growth for 1979 as a whole by about 1 - 1/2 percentage points , with the bulk of the shift having occurred in the first half of the year .
a PAR 8 the staff 's judgment at present is that the initial stock adjustment to the introduction of the new pay- ments service has been virtually completed and therefore that growth in ats accounts in the future will not reflect significant shifts out of existing demand deposit accounts .
a PAR 8 thus , the 4 - 1/2 to 7 - 1/2 percent m-1 growth under alternative a for 1980 would be equivalent -- after allowance for estimated ats effects -- to the 3 to 6 percent target for 1979 .
a PAR 8 the consistent m-2 range for 1980 , given the staff 's projection of the time and savings deposit components of m-2 , would be 6 to 9 per- cent .
a PAR 8 if the present 5 to 8 percent range for m-2 were retained , growth would probably again be near the upper end of the range .
a SENT -- ( 11 ) the implications for the economy of alternative a , which assumes a 6 percent m-1 growth over the projection period , are laid out in detail in the greenbook .
a PAR 15 shown below for committee consideration are three alternative growth rates for the monetary aggregates covering the first three months of 1980 and associated federal funds rate ranges for the period between now and the february meeting .
a PAR 15 aggregates in the upper panel are based on the current definitions , which would provide the basis for operations until the next meeting .
a PAR 15 preliminary estimates of consistent rates of growth on the new definitions are shown in the second panel to help prepare the transition to such measures at the february meeting .
a PAR 15 more detailed data for current definitions , including growth rates on a quarterly average basis related to alternative longer - run paths , are shown in the tables on pp .

a PAR 15 ( the relation of the proposed shorter- run targets to the midpoints of longer - run alternatives
a PAR 15 i and ii is displayed in chart 3 , following page 16 ) .
a PAR 15 growth through the year can be targeted at a pace roughly equal to the longer - run objective , or growth can be higher ( lower ) early in the year and offsettingly lower ( higher ) later in the year .
a PAR 15 given the projected pattern of money demand , various target paths during the year selected by the committee would have differing effects on interest rates , on exchange markets , and on the probability of success in attaining particular long - run targets .

a PAR 15 4'4';- 4 ' : / 4'i
a PAR 15 4'4 4'4 half of the year , when economic activity and nominal gnp growth are projected to be weakest , and then to strengthen , along with nominal gnp , in the second half .
a PAR 17 the recent relatively slow growth of m-1 raises the possi- bility that the record level of interest rates following the october 6 program may have induced another round of one - time shifts out of existing money balances .
a PAR 17 even if any such shift has about run its course , demands for cash in the first quarter of 1980
a PAR 17 may still be fairly weak , given the less than 5 percent annual rate of increase in nominal gnp that is projected for that period .
a PAR 17 thus , achievement of the 6 percent annual growth rate for m-1 over the first quarter in alternative a -- which appears to involve increases of about 8 and 3 percent in the monetary base and total reserves , respectively -- may be accompanied by relatively substantial declines of interest rates from current levels .
a PAR 18 the federal funds rate may drop to , or conceivably below , the bottom of the 10½ to 15½ percent range specified for alternative a over the next few weeks , and the 3-month bill rate could be in a 9 to 10 percent area .
a PAR 18 if the discount rate were not changed from the present 12 percent level , borrowings would decline to minimal levels of about $ 200 to $ 300 million , and nonborrowed reserves would expand by about 15 percent over the quarter .
a PAR 18 of course , if the discount rate were reduced significantly under the circumstances , member bank borrowing would be somewhat higher .
a PAR 20 the substantial decline in short rates that appear to be implied by alternative a probably would be accompanied by significant downward pressures on the international value of the dollar , especially if the dollar also remains under pressure because of the crises in the mid - east .
a PAR 20 downward pressures would be strongest if market participants come to expect a further decline in u.s . interest rates and interpret the decline of interest rates as a sign that the fed 's resolve to combat inflation has weakened .
a SENT -- net inflows of funds to thrift institutions are likely to pick up only modestly from their second half of 1979 pace , and costs of such funds would not decline as much as under alternative a .

b SENT -- the second row of each panel shows the projected effects of holding m-1 growth to 4½ percent -- the mid- point of the alternative b range -- over each of the next three years .
b PAR 22 in order to achieve the 5 percent rate of growth of m-1 in the first quarter specified under alternative b , a decline in interest rates from current levels would also be likely .
b PAR 22 the funds rate , for example , would probably drop over the next few weeks into the lower half of the 11½ to 15½ percent rate range shown for this alternative , with the 3-month bill rate declining to the 10 to 11 percent area .
b PAR 22 over the first quarter the monetary base and total reserves might have to increase at about 7½ and 2½ percent rates , respectively , and with member bank borrowings falling to around $ 800 to $ 900 million , nonborrowed reserves would expand by about 8 percent over the 3-month period .
b PAR 27 given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at the october and november meetings .
b PAR 27 it calls for expansion of reserve aggregates at a pace consistent with the desired rates of growth in m-1 and m-2 over the first quarter of 1980 , provided that the federal funds rate on a weekly average basis remains within a specified range .
b PAR 27 the range for the funds rate adopted on november 20 is shown in strike- through form .
b PAR 27 in the short run , the committee seeks [ del : to restrain expansion of reserve aggregates [ del : to a pace ] consistent with [ del : deceleration in ] growth of m-1 , and m-2 [ del : , and m-3 in ] over the [ del : fourth ] first quarter of [ del : 1979 to ] 1980 at annual rates of about   and   percent respectively
b PAR 27 [ del : that would hold growth of these monetary aggrgegates over the whole period from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within the - committee 's longer - run ranges ] , provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of [ del : 11½ to 15½ ]   to   percent . if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves , the manager for domestic operations is promptly to notify the chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the committee .
b PAR 27 appendix a benchmark revisions to the monetary aggregates money stock measures and related data have been benchmarked to the final december 1978 and preliminary march 1979 call reports .
b PAR 27 the december 1978 m-1 benchmark was minor , raising the level of the series about $ 300 million in that month .
b PAR 27 the march adjustment was somewhat larger and raised the level of m-1 an additional $ 700 million .
b PAR 27 by the end of 1979 the benchmarked m-1 is about $ 1.5 billion higher than the old series .
b PAR 27 the december 1978 benchmark adjustment raised the level of m-2 about $ 3.2 billion .
b PAR 27 most of this adjustment reflected strong growth in time deposits at foreign related institutions in late 1978 .
b PAR 27 the march benchmark raised the m-2 series an additional $ 1.2 billion and by the end of 1979 the level of the revised series was about $ 4 billion higher than the old series .
b PAR 27 the attached table shows the impact of the benchmark revisions on annual , quarterly and monthly m-1 and m-2 growth rates .
b PAR 27 m-1 growth was unchanged for the year 1978 , but m-2 growth was raised about a quarter of a percentage point from 8.4 to 8.7 percent .
b PAR 27 in 1979 the growth rates of both measures were raised slightly -- m-1 from 5.1 to 5.4 percent and m-2 from 8.0 to 8.3 percent .
