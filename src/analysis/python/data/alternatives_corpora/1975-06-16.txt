a SENT -- we have , therefore , assumed that maintenance of pre- vailing money market conditions over the short - run would be more con- sistent with adoption by the committee of higher longer - run growth objectives for the monetary aggregates , as shown under alternative a .

b PAR 6 prospective developments ( 7 ) alternative longer - run growth rates for the monetary aggregates covering the 12-month period from june 1975 to june 1976 are summarized in the table below for committee consideration .
b PAR 6 the m1 growth range -- at 5 to 7½ per cent -- is exactly the same , but minor downward adjustments have been made to growth ranges for other monetary and credit aggregates .
b PAR 6 these adjustments take account of changing relationships among the aggregates based on the up - dated longer - run time period and re - assessment of the economic and financial outlook .

b PAR 6 5½-8½ 4½-7 ( 8) the longer - run path for m1 in alternative b does imply a somewhat more rapid rate of growth from march ' 75 to march ' 76 than contemplated by the mid - point of the 5 - 7½ per cent range adopted by the committee at its previous meetings .
b PAR 6 this is because m1 growth in the second quarter seems likely to be at about a 9 per cent annual rate , as compared with the around 7 per cent rate earlier contemplated .
b PAR 6 the growth rate from march ' 75 to march '
b PAR 6 76 implicit in the currently pro- posed alternative b is around 7 per cent ( based on mid - points ) .
b PAR 6 this is , of course , within the adopted range , though toward the upper end .

b PAR 12 given prevailing money market conditions ,
b PAR 12 m1 growth over the june - july period is expected to be in an 8 - 10 per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 12 growth is expected to slow from the very rapid pace of may and the first part of june as the effect of treasury disbursement of tax rebates wears off .
b PAR 12 however , disbursement of the $ 1.7 billion of one- time payments to social security recipients in the second half of june , as noted earlier , will tend to sustain private deposits .
b PAR 12 thus , any significant slowdown in m1 growth probably will be delayed until july .
b PAR 12 tightening of the money market over the intermeeting period , as con- templated under alternative b , would work to lower these growth rates slightly , but most of the effect of higher interest rates on the monetary aggregates would develop later on .
b PAR 15 a significant rise in the federal funds rate -- for example , to the 6 per cent mid - point of the alternative b range -- would , however , alter market expectations and lead to upward adjustments in interest rates .
b PAR 15 the adjustments would probably be most marked in short - term rates , with the 3-month bill rate rising to perhaps 5¾-6 per cent by mid - july .
b PAR 15 adjustments in longer - term rates might be moderated by market expectations of a continued slowing in the rate of inflation , a gradual reduction in the prospective volume of new offerings , and by the relatively substantial upward slope to the yield curve that now exists .

c PAR 17 near - term tightening in the money market of the magnitude suggested for alternative c would almost certainly lead to a fairly sharp reaction in other short - term markets and to an upward adjustment in long - term rates .
c PAR 17 it could even engender expectations of a rise in the discount rate from its current 6 per cent level .
c PAR 17 some adverse impact on savings flows to banks and intermediaries could be expected , but short- term rates -- typified perhaps by a 3-month bill rate around 6 3/2 per cent-- would not be likely to rise so high as to sharply curtail such inflows .
