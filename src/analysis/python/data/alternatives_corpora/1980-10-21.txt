a PAR 1 the growth of m-1a and m-1b continued rapid in september , and was substantially above the pace targeted by the committee for the august to december period ( as shown in the table below   .
a PAR 1 in terms of their september levels , m-1a was just above the midpoint and
a PAR 1 m-1b above the upper end of their respective longer - run ranges .
a PAR 1 despite the rapid expansion of m-1b , a much slower growth for nontransactions accounts limited the september rise in m-2 growth to an 8¼ percent annual rate , just below the target pace for the last four months of the year .
a PAR 1 nonetheless , the level of m-2 in september remained above the upper end of its longer - run range , reflecting the sharp growth in this aggregate over the late spring and summer .
a PAR 1 with loan growth strong , both banks and thrifts stepped up their issuance of managed liabilities , and m-3 grew more rapidly than m-2 in september for the first time since the spring .

a PAR 1 borrowings.1 / although nonborrowed reserves ( defined to include special borrowing ) declined slightly on average last month , total reserves increased at the most rapid rate in ten years as banks borrowed to obtain the reserves required by the surge of deposits .
a PAR 1 the increased demand for reserves was associated with further upward pressure on the federal funds rate , which was intensified by the increase in the discount rate from 10 to 11 percent announced on september 25 .
a PAR 1 federal funds , which were generally trading in the 10½ to 11 percent area at the time of the september committee meeting , most recently have been trading in the 12½ to 13 percent zone .

a PAR 1 such growth would imply m-1a velocity increases in the two years of 3 - 1/2 and 5 - 1/2 percent , respectively .
a PAR 1 the board 's quarterly econometric model indicates that historical money demand relationships would require almost 3 - 1/2 percentage points greater growth of m-1a in 1981 to achieve the gnp and interest rates in the staff 's judgmental greenbook projection .
a PAR 1 thus , these interest rate projections assume a further so - called downward shift in money demand as judged from the prediction error in the board 's model .

a SENT -- under alternative a , m-1a growth would be somewhat below the mid- point of its longer - run range , but the staff believes that in the fourth quarter m-1b would be at , and m-2 slightly above , their respective longer- run upper bounds .
a PAR 11 the growth of m-1a for september to december under alternative a is so low , however , that it may be expected to be associated with further , relatively moderate , upward interest rate pressures in the chart 1 actual and targeted m-1a and m-1b :

a PAR 11 billions of dollar - 9%.% .*'t 1940 note : a , and 8 altematives are indstlngumhableion this scale fourth quarter.1/ to achieve the specifications for the aggregates of alternative a , total reserves would probably have to remain about unchanged from september to december and , given the near - term pattern of growth , expand at only about a 1 percent rate from september to november.2/ assuming adjustment borrowing of about $ 1½ billion , nonborrowed reserves would be expected to decline at about a 3 percent annual rate from september to november .
a PAR 11 such borrowing is likely to be reflected in a federal funds rate in the 13 to 14 percent area , given the present 11 percent discount rate .
a PAR 12 the higher federal funds rate and increased member bank borrowing likely to be associated with alternative a would probably be accompanied by an upward adjustment in both short- and long - term market interest rates .
a PAR 12 upward rate pressures would be intensified by the need to finance a substantial treasury deficit in prospect for the fourth quarter .
a PAR 12 however , the pressures on rates could abate as the quarter progresses .
a PAR 12 a rising level of long - term yields is likely to inhibit further the pace of new corporate and municipal bond offerings .
a PAR 12 and if signs of a weakening in economic activity emerge , as would be consistent with the staff 's gnp projections , expectations of future rate declines would become more prevalent and influence the actual market rate structure .

b SENT -- only minor variations in growth rates would be expected under alternative b .
b PAR 13 under alternative b there is less chance that interest rates will rise in the near term .
b PAR 13 to achieve the aggregates specified 1/ appendix ii displays the quarterly interest rate and monetary aggregates pattern underlying alternative
b PAR 13 and the staff 's gnp projection for 1981 , contained in the current greenbook .
b PAR 13 2/ effective with the statement week beginning november 13 - -the last week of the forthcoming intermeeting period -- the phase - down of required reserves will begin for member banks , as will the phase - in for nonmember depository institutions .
b PAR 13 the targeted reserve growth rates in the text are cal- culated so as to eliminate the discontinuity from the change in reserve requirements .
b PAR 13 for this alternative , total reserves would have to expand at a 2¼ percent annual rate from september to november . assuming adjustment borrowing of $ 1¼ billion , about the same as the september average , nonborrowed reserves would expand at only about a 1¾ percent rate .
b PAR 13 the federal funds rate is likely to remain within its recent 12½ to 13 percent zone .
b PAR 13 under such circumstances , other market rates would likely fluctuate around current levels .
