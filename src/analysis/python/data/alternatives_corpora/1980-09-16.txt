a SENT -- 12 - 1/2 qiv 9 - 3/4 9 9 - 1/2 9 note : the following annual rates of growth in bank credit for the year and for the quarters are expected under alternative a : year 1980 , 5 - 3/4 ; qi , 9 - 1/2 ; qii , -1/2 ; qiii , 5 - 3/4 ;
a SENT -- under alternative a , the expansion in m - a over the balance of the year at a 5 - 1/4 percent annual rate would produce growth over the one - year qiv ' 79 to qiv ' 80 policy period of 4 - 1/2 percent , just below the midpoint of the committee 's 3 - 1/2 to 6 percent range .
a PAR 11 growth in m-2 under alternative a is projected to slow to a 9 percent annual rate over the balance of the year , a rate that would keep growth for the year above the upper end of the committee 's longer - run range .
a PAR 11 the expected slowing over the next few months mainly reflects reduced growth in the narrow money aggregates , but the increase in the nontransactions component of m-2 also is expected to be less rapid than in the summer .
a PAR 11 growth in savings deposits has already slowed , and money market funds have actually been declining .
a PAR 11 the latter are expected to resume growing over the months ahead , as recent increases in market interest rates augment the average yield on their portfolio , but not at the very rapid pace of late spring and early summer .

a PAR 11 strictly confidential .
a PAR 11 monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week flgures .
a PAR 12 to achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under alternative a , total reserves would have to expand at about a 6 percent annual rate from august to december , and , given the near - term pattern of growth , by about a 7 percent annual rate from august to october . assuming adjustment borrowing of around $ 600 million -- close to the average of recent weeks but below the level expected for the current statement week -- the nonborrowed reserve path would call for growth at little over a 4 percent annual rate from august to october , with the federal funds rate probably around 10 - 1/2 - -10 - 3/4 percent .
a PAR 13 short - term interest rates are not expected to rise significantly further over the next few weeks under alternative a . indeed , some temporary drop in short rates could occur as bank reserve positions under this alternative may be less taut than market participants currently expect .
a PAR 13 but business borrowing demand is expected to remain relatively large as the economy strengthens .
a PAR 13 the recent tilt in the distribution of borrowing toward short- from long - term markets could persist but the continuing need to restructure balance sheets is expected to keep long - term borrowing sizable over the months ahead .
a PAR 13 with short- rates remaining relatively high and the economy apparently strengthening , there appears to be little scope for declines in bond or mortgage rates .
a PAR 13 indeed , mortgage rates could drift up a bit more under alternative a , in part reflecting the recent run - up in the cost of deposits .

b SENT -- only minor variations in growth rates would be expected under alternative b . chart
b PAR 15 the specifications for alternative b would require total reserve growth from august to october at a little more than a 6 percent annual rate . assuming adjustment borrowings of about $ 800 million , nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 1/2 percent annual rate .
b PAR 15 given this reserve path , the funds rate would probably be 11 percent or a little higher , and other short - term rates might edge up from current levels .
b PAR 15 mortgage rates would probably rise noticeably further , as thrift institutions become increasingly concerned about the cost and availability of deposits .
b PAR 15 the dollar might take on a stronger tone in foreign exchange markets .
