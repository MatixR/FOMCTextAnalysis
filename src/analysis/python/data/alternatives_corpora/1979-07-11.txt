b PAR 10 the ranges for the money supply aggregates under alternative b are the same as those adopted by the committee in february , except that the m-1 range has been revised upward to reflect a changed projection of ats account growth ( including new york state now accounts ) .
b PAR 10 at the time of the february meeting , shifts from demand deposits to ats accounts were expected to reduce measured m-1 growth by about 3 percentage points over the year .
b PAR 10 thus , the 3 percent midpoint of the fomc 's current 1 to 4 percent longer - run range for m-1 was consistent with a 6 percent rate of growth in m-1 adjusted for ats effects .
b PAR 10 the retardation in measured m-1 growth caused by ats is now expected to be about half as large as estimated in february .
b PAR 10 the midpoint of the 3 to 6 percent proposed alternative b range plus the revised , lower ats effect also is equal to an m-1 growth adjusted for ats effects of about 6 percent .
b PAR 10 all of the proposed ranges are 3 percentage points in width -- the same as the ranges adopted in february .
b PAR 10 an argument can be made , however , that the ranges should be narrowed since the policy period now contains two quarters of known results and , therefore , the committee should be more certain of the rate of growth in the aggregates over the entire period .
b PAR 10 on the other hand , it can be argued that the considerable uncertainties about the current money - income relationship suggest the desirability of maintaining the existing width of the ranges .
b PAR 13 the table below presents three alternative longer - run ranges for next year ( the policy period from qiv ' 79 to qiv ' 80   .
b PAR 13 these ranges represent a continuation into 1980 of the policies toward the alt .
b PAR 13 c ' m-1 4½ to 7½ 3½ to 6½ 2½ to 5½ m-2 6½ to 9½ 5½ to 8½ 4½ to 7½ m-3 7½ to 10½ 6 to 9 4½ to 7½ bank credit 7½ to
b PAR 13 10½ 6½ to 9½ 5½ to 8½ aggregates as indexed by m-1 , represented by the proposed paths for 1979 , after adjustment for ats effects .
b PAR 13 thus , alternative b ' essentially repre- sents continuation of growth in m-1 at about 6 percent : the midpoint of the alternative b ' range is 5 per cent , and we have assumed that ats effects retard m-1 growth by only about 1 percent .
b PAR 13 of course , the projection of ats effects into next year is highly uncertain , depending as it does on as yet unknown congressional or further judicial responses to the recent court decision terminating ats and similar accounts beginning january 1 of next year .
b PAR 13 alternatives a ' and c ' are indexed by measured m-1 growth of 6 percent and 4 percent , respectively , or 7 and 5 percent after adjusting for assumed ats effects .
b PAR 13 these growth rates for 1980 basically extend the a and c paths for 1979 , as explained in the preceding paragraph .
b PAR 14 the federal funds rate patterns through 1980 associated with the proposed longer - run monetary ranges , given the related gnp pro- jections , are shown in appendix i. for simplicity , these patterns assume that the growth path for the aggregates adopted for 1979 will continue into 1980 .
b PAR 14 thus , they assume that alternative b for 1979 is followed by 1/ if the court decision does become effective , measured m-1 growth in the qiv ' 79 to qiv ' 80 period could be increased by 1 to 2 percentage points , depending on how much of the funds shifted from demand deposits to ats accounts returned to demand deposits .
b PAR 14 on the other hand , if the congress authorizes nationwide now accounts , the staff estimates that measured m-1 growth in the qiv ' 79 to qiv ' 80 period could be retarded by as much as 3 to 4 percentage points rather than the 1 percentage point if ats accounts are extended .
b PAR 14 as growth in nominal gnp accelerates in 1980 , this decline is projected to be reversed in order to constrain growth in the aggregates to around the midpoints of the b ' range .
b PAR 14 it should be noted that the upward pressure on interest rates re - emerges even though we have assumed a rather substantial downward shift in money demand relative to income in 1980 .
b PAR 14 prospective developments : short - run 
b PAR 17 as illustrated by the top panel of the chart on page 14 , growth in measured m-1 at the 4 - 1/2 percent midpoint of its projected july - august alternative b range would leave m-1 in the upper half of its current longer - run range .
b PAR 17 the lower panel of the chart compares the projected july - august expansion with the proposed alternative b longer - run range .
b PAR 17 in that comparison , by august m-1 would be in the lower half of the longer - run range .
b PAR 17 the dotted line in the chart also shows annual growth rates needed from the actual june level to reach targeted midpoint levels by the fourth quarter of 1979 under the current longer - run range and proposed alternative b ; these growth rates are 2 percent and 5 - 1/2 percent , respectively .

b PAR 18 the staff expects m-2 to expand in a 6 - 1/2 to 10 - 1/2 per- cent annual rate range in july - august under alternative b .
b PAR 18 as shown in the upper panel of the chart on page 16 , m-2 in june was at a level slightly below the midpoint of its longer - run range .
b PAR 18 growth at the midpoint of the alternative b range would bring m-2 to about the mid- point of its current ( and also proposed alternative b ) longer - run growth range by august .
b PAR 19 virtually all of the expected slowing in m-2 in july- august , relative to may - june , reflects the more modest growth of m-1 .
b PAR 19 growth of the interest - bearing component of m-2 is expected to remain strong , accounted for mainly by continued sizable bank issuance of mmcs .
b PAR 19 inflows of funds to banks through mmcs are expected to remain large , since the staff is projecting that the 6-month bill rate under alternative b will remain near or above 9 percent and thus that no significant differential will emerge in ceiling rates on these instru- ments favoring thrift institutions .
b PAR 19 as in other recent months , large- denomination time deposits are not expected to contribute to growth in m-2 as banks continue to supplement their demand and small denomination time deposits growth with eurodollars and rps .

b PAR 21 if the funds rate remains around 10¼ percent as contemplated under alternative b , short - term rates might back up somewhat as fewer market participants come to expect that interest rates will soon decline .
b PAR 21 if short - term rates rise , this may work to strengthen the dollar on foreign exchange markets since it will tend to improve interest rate spreads between u.s . and foreign markets .
b PAR 21 yields in bond markets might also rise , especially in the municipal market where a relatively large slate of offerings is in prospect .
b PAR 21 in corporate bond markets , on the other hand , issuance is expected to be relatively light and the treasury is likely to raise only $ 2 to $ 3 billion of new money in a routine mid - quarter financing .
b SENT -- the value of the dollar would strengthen in foreign exchange markets more certainly than under alternative b , and domestic short - term interest rates would rise considerably .
b SENT -- it would not necessarily be inconsistent with longer - run alternative b , under which interest rates are expected to begin declining later in the summer or in early fall .
