a PAR 13 under this assumption , m1 and m 2 over the january - february period would be expected to grow at annual rates of 4 - 8 and 8 - 12 per cent respectively .
a PAR 13 interest rates would be expected to decline over the next few weeks , but reductions maybe limited , particularly in long - term markets .
a PAR 13 expectations that interest rates would soon rise might develop as the market observes faster growth in the aggregates and as the pace of economic expansion picks up .
a PAR 14 over the longer - run , under alternative a , we would not expect a very substantial rise in interest rates to develop , however , since the higher longer - run growth in the monetary aggregates embodied in that alternative would be more accommodative of money and credit demands .
a PAR 14 the funds rate would probably have to rise under this alternative , given the projected strength of the economy , but perhaps to no more than an average level of around 5¼ per cent by the fourth quarter of the year .

b PAR 7 ' 76-qiv ' 77 qiii ' 76-qiii ' 77 qiv ' 76-qiv ' 77 ( 8) under alternative b , with a federal funds rate centered within a 4¼-5 per cent range , we would expect m1 to grow in a 3 -7 per cent annual rate range over the january - february period .
b PAR 7 this represents a slightly higher 2-month range than has been presented in recent blue books , and reflects the pick - up in m1 growth that has occurred during the past few weeks as well as the stronger demand for money expected to be associated with the projected acceleration in growth of nominal gnp in the first quarter .
b PAR 9 growth in m2 over the january - february period may be in a 7 -11 per cent annual rate range under alternative b . the time and savings deposit component of m2 is expected to grow less than in the fourth quarter , largely because banks have become less aggressive in seeking out time deposit funds .
b PAR 9 offering rates reportedly have been cut , and longer - term certificates are apparently not being offered by some banks .
b PAR 11 to maintain growth in monetary aggregates over the qiv ' 76-qiv ' 77 period within the longer - run ranges proposed under alternative b , the staff expects that the federal funds rate would have to begin rising by early spring , and would reach a 1977 peak of around 6½ per cent in the fourth quarter of the year .
b PAR 11 the rise in short - term rates more generally that would be associated with such an increase in the funds rate would tend to curb the growth in time and savings deposits at banks and thrift institutions .
b PAR 11 as a result growth in m2 and m3 is expected to slow progressively as the year goes on .
b PAR 11 at the same time banks would probably begin to offer cd 's more aggressively to accommodate credit demands generated by the projected substantial expansion in gnp .
b PAR 11 bank credit expansion in 1977 is likely to be considerably more rapid than in 1976 , when banks permitted outstanding cd 's to drop sharply .
b SENT -- [ del : immediately ] ahead [ del : , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected]. alternative b to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets , the committee seeks to [ del : maintain prevailing ] achieve bank reserve and money market
b SENT -- the above tabulation indicates that the proposed alternative b implies levels of m1 in the latter half of 1977 little different from those implicit in the current longer - run range based on the third quarter of 1976 .
b SENT -- because of the more rapid growth in m1 now expected in the first half of 1977 , the third quarter 1977 level under alternative b is slightly higher (

c PAR 15 alternative
c PAR 15 c involves a tightening of the federal funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid - point of a 4 ¾-5½ per cent range .
c PAR 15 over the january - february period m1 growth may be in a 3 - 7 per cent range -- a step toward attaining the lower longer - run ranges for the monetary aggregates proposed for this alternative .
c PAR 15 the staff would expect that further pressures would have to be applied to the money market as the year progresses if growth in m1 over the qiv ' 76-qiv ' 77 period is to be constrained to around the mid - point of the 3½-5½ per cent alternative c range .
c PAR 15 the funds rate might reach about 7¼ per cent by the fourth quarter .
c SENT -- [ del : immediately ] ahead [ del : , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected]. alternative c to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets , the committee seeks to [ del : maintain prevailing ] achieve bank reserve and money market
