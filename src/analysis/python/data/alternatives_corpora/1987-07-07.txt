a SENT -- thus , reaffirming the alternative a range would seem most consistent with an outlook for the economy in which interest rates were expected to remain at or move below current levels .
a PAR 14 the table below gives three alternative specifications for growth in money and credit in 1988 .
a PAR 14 alternative 1988 ranges alt .
a PAR 14 iii m2 5 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 4 - 1/2 to 7 - 1/2 3 - 1/2 to 7 m3 5 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 5 to 8 4 - 1/2 to 7 - 1/2 debt 8 to 11 7 - 1/2 to 10 - 1/2 7 to 10 
a PAR 18 alternative
a PAR 18 i encompasses money growth rates that would be more consistent with little further change in interest rates or even sane decline , perhaps accompanying weaker than expected economic growth or very substantial progress in reducing the structural federal deficit and limited underlying price pressures .
a PAR 18 this alternative , then , would be more appro- priate if the risks were thought to lie in the direction of a shortfall in aggregate demand , rather than a resurgence of inflation .
a PAR 18 considerable weakness in domestic demand would tend to constrain inflationary pressures even if the dollar were to drop appreciably further .
a PAR 18 under these condi- tions , nominal interest rates near or below current levels might be needed to support economic growth .
a PAR 18 in this context , income velocity of m2 also would be expected to change little on balance next year or begin to decline again , implying expansion of m2 around or a bit below the middle of the alternative a range if growth in nominal gnp were sustained at 6 percent , and this alternative would allow some latitude for some further monetary growth should that be appropriate to foster economic expansion .
a PAR 18 short - run policy alternatives 
a PAR 25 other money market rates also would fall by comparable amounts , as there is very little expectation of a near - term easing in monetary policy built into market rates .
a PAR 25 with an unwinding of some of the rise over recent months in opportunity costs , m2 would move closer to the lower end of its current longer - run range by september and , given the lagged effect of the lower market rates and faster income growth , would be likely to rise to just within this range in the fourth quarter .
a PAR 25 the boost to m3 growth stemming from a small pickup in depository credit expansion would lift this aggregate well into its current annual range .
a PAR 26 the decline in short - term rates under alternative a would contribute to a resumption of downward pressure on the dollar , potentially to a significant degree if this were seen as adding to inflationary pres- sures .
a PAR 26 under these circumstances , any tendency for long - term rates to decline would be limited and possibly more than offset by the market re- action to the weaker dollar and inflation anxieties .

b PAR 9 the table below presents two alternative sets of specifi- cations for growth in the monetary aggregates and debt for 1987 .
b PAR 9 i comprises the ranges adopted in february .
b PAR 9 although the staff expects m3 and debt to remain within their existing ranges over the second half of the year , there is a distinct possibility that restraint on infla- tion in the context of continuing moderate economic growth would entail m2 expansion over the balance of the year that was not sufficient to return this aggregate to within its current annual range .
b PAR 9 ranges alt .
b PAR 9 ii ( current ranges ) m2 5 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 4 - 1/2 to 7 - 1/2 m3 5 - 1/2
b PAR 9 to 8 - 1/2 5 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 debt 8 to 11 8 to 11 
b SENT -- m2 expansion thought consistent with the staff forecast would be in the lower part of its alternative b range and m3 near the middle .

b PAR 20 actual level tli/- - 8x - positions , federal funds would be expected to trade in a 6 - 1/2 to 6 - 3/4 percent range , perhaps more toward the lower end of the range , given the current absence of market expectations of a near - term tightening of policy .
b PAR 20 in these circumstances other short - term rates would be about unchanged over the near term , although the three - month treasury bill rate could drift higher as the paydown of bills abates .
b PAR 20 the dollar might remain around current levels for a time , but at some point considerable downward pressure could well reemerge under the weight of continued out- sized external deficits .
b PAR 20 in this event , longer - term rates would tend to rise in reflection of heightened inflationary concerns and short - term rates could also begin to firm in anticipation of some additional tighten- ing of monetary policy .
b PAR 22 m3 , under alternative b , would probably expand at a 7 - 1/2 percent annual rate , up about 2 percentage points from the march - to - june period .
b PAR 22 while asset growth at banks and thrifts is expected to continue around its average pace of recent months , a runoff of treasury deposits will lead to more issuance of managed liabilities in m3 .
b PAR 22 with faster expansion of m3 in the third quarter , its velocity would resume contract- ing at about a 1 - 1/2 percent rate , broadly in line with its longer - run trend .
b PAR 23 m1 would be expected to grow at a 4 percent annual rate over the june - to - september period under alternative b , implying quarterly average growth at only a 1 percent rate and the first m1 velocity in- crease - at a 5 percent rate -- in nearly three years .
b PAR 23 as adjustments to the earlier rise in opportunity costs of holding both demand deposits and ocds taper off , these components would resume expanding , but the extent of any pickup would be limited by the persistence of significantly higher opportunity costs relative both to market instruments and time deposits .

c PAR 27 the federal funds rate would climb to the 7 to 7 - 1/4 percent area and the bill rate would post a similar increase .
c PAR 27 firmer conditions in the money market would act to postpone the reemergence of downward pressure on the dollar in exchange markets and the possible reduction of inflationary concerns would temper any tendency for treasury bond yields to rise .
c PAR 27 there could be some widen-
c PAR 27 ing in quality spreads , though , if the effects of this policy action were seen as aggravating debt servicing difficulties , including through weaker income growth , both at home and abroad .
c PAR 28 any pickup in m2 is likely to be quite modest under alternative c . over the june - to - september period , m2 would be expected to strengthen only marginally , to a 3 - 1/2 percent rate , damping growth from the fourth quarter to 4 percent by september .
c PAR 28 transactions deposits would be most affected , with m1 expected to grow at only a 2 percent pace over this period .
c PAR 28 m3 probably would expand at around a 7 percent pace , owing to continued solid bank credit growth and more issuance of managed liabilities in m3 ; and growth in this aggregate from the fourth quarter would still strengthen -- to 6 percent by september .
