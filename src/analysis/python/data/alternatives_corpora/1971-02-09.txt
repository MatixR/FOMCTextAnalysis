a SENT -- the first column -- called alternative a -- makes up the shortfall by march and continues with a 6 per cent rate of growth in the second quarter .
a SENT -- the particular path would reach the same average level in june for m1 as indicated for alternative a . and the growth rate over the 9 months from september 1970 to june 1971 would be just under 6 per cent .
a PAR 9 to achieve either alternative a or b , an easing of the money market appears to be required between now and the next meeting of the committee , for reasons indicated in paragraph ( 6   .

a PAR 9 --may entail a much lower federal funds rate , perhaps ranging around 2 - 1/2 per cent , with the 3-month bill rate dropping to around 3 per cent .
a PAR 9 and the net free reserve position of member banks is likely to average $ 150 million or a little more , as excess reserves build up , given the low interest rates .
a PAR 9 it would be anticipated , however , that by early spring , the federal funds rate would have to rise rather sharply -- to around 4 - 1/2 --5 per cent , with a concurrent snapback in bill rates -- as reserves are provided less generously in order to move down to the assumed longer - run growth rate , typified in alternative a by a 6 per cent growth in m1 for the second quarter .
a SENT -- this tendency is likely to become more widespread , especially under alternative a , and may serve , along with an increase of consumer spending as projected in the green book , to moderate savings inflows .
a PAR 18 to implement this policy , the committee seeks to promote accommodative ccnditions in credit markets ; greater growth in the narrowly defined money stock , making up the shortfall from the desired growth path that has developed : and [ del : moderate ] continued substantial expansion in other monetary and credit aggregates .
a PAR 18 system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with those objectives
a PAR 18 [ del : taking account of the forthcoming treasury financing]. " the indicated language with respect to the aggregates ( i.e. , the reference to the " narrowly defined money stock , ' followed by a separate reference to " the other monetary and credit aggregates " ) is suggested to make clear ( 1 ) that it is with respect to m1 that a shortfall is to be made up , and ( 2 ) that the committee is also taking account of the behavior of key monetary aggregates other than m1 .

b PAR 2 the sluggish january growth in the money supply occurred despite efforts of the trading desk to achieve a faster rate of growth by fostering easier money market conditions .
b PAR 2 for most of the period since the last fomc meeting , the daily effective federal funds rate was in a 3 - 7/8 - -4 - 1/4 per cent range , with heavy u.s .
b PAR 2 government security dealer positions built up in consequence of the refunding exerting some upward pressure on the funds market .
b PAR 2 in the weeks immediately following the last committee meeting the desk was aiming at a federal funds rate around 4 - 1/4 per cent , somewhat below the most typical rate prevailing recent paths of key monetary aggregates ( seasonally adjusted , billions of dollars ) narrowly defined money supply ( m1 ) indicated at last meeting 2/ month december 1970 january 1971 week ending fourth quarter , january over actual results % annual rates of change 3 /3.4 3/3.6 broader based money supply((m2 ) indicated at last meeting2/ actual results % annual rates of change adjusted credit proxy indicated at last meeting2/ actual results % annual rates of change 1 mi plus bank time

b PAR 2 before the meeting .
b PAR 2 when the large shortfall of m1 below path for the week of january 20 was finally confirmed ( around january 28 ) , the federal funds target was lowered to 4 per cent or a shade lower , and most recently , with m1 data for the final week of january also coming in low , the target was lowered to 3 - 3/4 per cent .
b PAR 2 in the latest two statement weeks , net borrowed reserves averaged around $ 30 million and borrowing at the federal reserve $ 320 million .
b PAR 2 this compares with $ 310 and $ 375 million , respectively , for the preceding two statement weeks .

c PAR 15 with a policy of keeping to prevailing money market conditions , termed alternative c , m1 growth in the first quarter would be at a 6 per cent annual rate and no pick - up from this rate would be anticipated in the second quarter .
c PAR 15 thus , if the staff is correct in this projection , the shortfalls in m1 growth for the fourth quarter and january would not be recovered .

c PAR 20 it is suggested for possible use if the committee decides not to seek to make up past shortfalls in m1 even over the more extended time period , if doing so would require the degree of easing in money market conditions suggested by the analysis in paragraphs ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) above .

c PAR 20 the committee may wish to have the proviso clause interpreted in terms of the projections of m1 ( or of m1 , m2 , and the bank credit proxy ) shown in the table on p. 13 , based on the assumption of a continuation of prevailing money market conditions .
c PAR 20 the proviso clause -- like that in the december directive -- is formulated in a manner that would permit growth in the aggregates at rates higher than projected , but would call for easing of money market conditions to make up any shortfalls from projections associated with this alternative .
