b SENT -- these tables show base periods for each quarter from qiv ' 74 to qii ' 77 and terminal periods from qi ' 75 to qiii ' 77 . m-1 of around 5Â¼ per cent in the qiii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period , as called for under alternative b , would be associated with expansion over the 15-month qii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period at an annual rate of close to 6 per cent , in the upper part of the fomc 's current longer - run range .
b PAR 11 the staff expects , however , that even further increases in interest rates would be required as time goes on if growth in m-1 over the qiii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period is to be held to the mid - point of the longer - run 4 - 6 per cent range associated with alternative b . this would entail m-1 growth in the area of 4 -5 per cent , annual rate , during the first three quarters of 1978 .
b PAR 11 given staff gnp projections and our assess- ment of the likely strength of money demand , the federal funds rate may peak out at about 7 per cent in the second quarter of 1978 , as shown in appendix i.
b PAR 11 ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ( 13 ) ( 14 )
b PAR 13 growth in m-2 over the october - november period is likely to be in a 5 -9 per cent annual rate range under alternative b . the time and savings deposit component of m-2 is expected to expand by only slightly more than its reduced august - september pace .
b PAR 13 we continue to anticipate little , if any , growth in outstanding large cd 's at banks-- including the large - denomination time deposits that are included in m-2 - - as short - term credit demands on banks remain moderate .
b PAR 13 in addition , market rates are above bank ceiling rates on time deposits under $ 100,000 and maturing in less than four years , and this may be tending to con- strain inflows of such deposits .


d SENT -- growth would be somewhat higher if measured from qi ' 77 since there was also an overshoot in the second quarter for which alternative d does not compensate .
