b PAR 7 the implications of mid - points in the proposed growth ranges for m-1 and m-2 for growth rates in these aggregates over 15-month and 18-month periods beginning in qii ' 77 and qi ' 77 , respectively , and ending in qiii ' 78 are shown in the table below.1/ growth rates in monetary aggregates assuming growth over qiii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period at near mid - points of alternative ranges ( annual rates , compounded quarterly   period a b c d m-1 memo : m-2 memo : ( 8  it may be seen that under alternative d growth in m-1 at around a 4¼ per cent rate over the qiii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period would lead to expansion in the qii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period at a 5¼ per cent annual rate --the mid - point of the current longer - run range .
b PAR 7 growth would be somewhat higher if measured from qi ' 77 since there was also an overshoot in the second quarter for which alternative d does not compensate .
b PAR 7 growth of 1/ implications for growth over longer time periods are shown in appendix iv for alternatives b and d. to permit the committee to evaluate proposed ranges in relation to growth in the aggregates over a variety of past periods , appendix v contains growth triangles for m-1 , m-2 and m-3 .
b PAR 7 these tables show base periods for each quarter from qiv ' 74 to qii ' 77 and terminal periods from qi ' 75 to qiii ' 77 . m-1 of around 5¼ per cent in the qiii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period , as called for under alternative b , would be associated with expansion over the 15-month qii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period at an annual rate of close to 6 per cent , in the upper part of the fomc 's current longer - run range .
b PAR 7 under all of the alternatives , however , growth rates in m-2 over the more extended 15- and 18-month periods would generally be near the mid - point , or in the lower half , of its current 7 - 9½ per cent range .
b PAR 11 the staff expects , however , that even further increases in interest rates would be required as time goes on if growth in m-1 over the qiii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period is to be held to the mid - point of the longer - run 4 - 6 per cent range associated with alternative b . this would entail m-1 growth in the area of 4 -5 per cent , annual rate , during the first three quarters of 1978 .
b PAR 11 given staff gnp projections and our assess- ment of the likely strength of money demand , the federal funds rate may peak out at about 7 per cent in the second quarter of 1978 , as shown in appendix i.
b PAR 11 ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ( 13 ) ( 14 )
b PAR 13 growth in m-2 over the october - november period is likely to be in a 5 -9 per cent annual rate range under alternative b . the time and savings deposit component of m-2 is expected to expand by only slightly more than its reduced august - september pace .
b PAR 13 we continue to anticipate little , if any , growth in outstanding large cd 's at banks-- including the large - denomination time deposits that are included in m-2 - - as short - term credit demands on banks remain moderate .
b PAR 13 in addition , market rates are above bank ceiling rates on time deposits under $ 100,000 and maturing in less than four years , and this may be tending to con- strain inflows of such deposits .
b PAR 15 a tightening of the funds market to the mid - point of a 6¾-7¼ per cent range over the next few weeks is contemplated under alternatives c or d -- alternatives that over the longer - run involve lower growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative b . such a rise in the funds rate in the weeks immediately ahead would probably be associated with a 2½-7½ per cent annual rate range for m-1 and a 5 - 9 per cent range for m-2 .

c PAR 16 under both alternatives c and d , interest rates would probably have to rise further in late 1977 and in 1978 to achieve the mid - points of their respective longer - run ranges for the monetary aggre- gates .
c PAR 16 rate increases would , of course , be larger under alternative d , which involves m-1 growth over the qiii ' 77-qiii ' 78 period at a mid- point rate of 4¼ per cent .
c PAR 16 the funds rate under this alternative would be expected to reach around 8¼ per cent by the third quarter of 1978 , as compared with a level of 7 - 5/8 per cent under alternative c . under alternative d , we have assumed an upward adjustment in regulation
c PAR 16 q ceilings on time deposits of ¼ percentage point across the board in the second quarter of next year .
