a SENT -- under alternative a , we would expect the funds rate to drop between now and the next meeting , though perhaps not to the bottom of the indicated range .

b PAR 12 the recent sharp rise in short - term interest rates will be limiting money demand in the months ahead .
b PAR 12 as a result , even though growth in nominal gnp is expected to remain substantial , m1 may expand at a rela- tively slow pace between now and year - end , given prevailing money market conditions .
b PAR 12 for alternative b , a 9 - 1/2 - -11 - 1/2 per cent federal funds rate range is shown .
b PAR 12 this range is symmetrical around current money market con- ditions .
b PAR 12 staff judgment and model forecasts suggest that the odds are better than even that some decline in the funds rate will develop if the alternative b targets for the aggregates are pursued , given the degree of restraint already built into the system .
b PAR 13 in the august - september period
b PAR 13 m1 growth under alternative b is indicated to be in a 2 - -4 per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 13 a particularly low growth rate is shown for august , reflecting in part drawdowns in cash balances for investment in higher yielding time deposits , especially the newly avail- able , widely advertised long - term savings certificates .
b PAR 13 however , such a one- time stock adjustment is likely to be short - lived in its effects on cash balances mainly held for transactions purposes or for normal financial market operations .
b PAR 14 under alternative b , over the next two months , m2 expansion in a 7 - 3/4 - -9 - 3/4 per cent annual rate range is indicated .
b PAR 14 the faster in- crease in m2 relative to m1 results mainly from the initial sizable movement into consumer - type time and savings deposits at banks in the wake of the regulatory changes .
b PAR 14 the initial inflow probably reflected not only some movement out of demand deposits but , more importantly , shifts of funds from nonbank thrift institutions .
b PAR 14 we have assumed a gradual phasing out of transfers from thrift institutions to banks , though we do not expect it to subside as promptly as transfers out of demand deposits because of the maturity distribution of thrift institution deposits and a certain inertia in shifting deposits from one institution to another .
b PAR 14 on balance , a con- siderably more moderate rise in consumer type time deposits is expected in september than in august , and a further tapering appears in prospect for the fourth quarter .
b PAR 16 looking to all three money concepts , by the fourth quarter m1 is indicated to be expanding at a 3 - 1/2 per cent annual rate under alternative b , while m2 and m3 growth is expected to be around 5 - 1/2 and 6 per cent , respectively . for m2 and m3 , these would be lowest quarterly growth rates since early 1970 .

c PAR 18 other key assumptions in the monetary relationships pre- sented are : ( a   continued strength in business loan demand on banks ; ( b   some reduction in demand for consumer and mortgage credit ; ( c   con- tinued active demand by banks for large cd funds , though perhaps less aggressive demand than in the past four months taken as a whole ; ( d   greater bank reluctance to participate in the securities market , par- ticularly under alternative c , in view of the wide spread of their bor- rowing costs over their return on portfolio .
c PAR 18 on balance , bank credit -- as measured by the proxy -- is expected to rise by around a 15 - -16 per cent annual rate in the august - september period , buoyed in part by a projected rise in u.s . treasury deposits at commercial banks .
c PAR 18 growth is likely to be considerably less rapid in the fourth quarter as credit demands fade some-
c PAR 18 what , inflows of consumer - type time deposits abate , and treasury deposits at banks decline .
