a PAR 18 interest rates may tend to decline rather substantially as the funds rate begins to drop , particularly in the intermediate - term treasury area where dealers have a net short position .
a PAR 18 but assuming that incoming economic news does not cast doubt on the fundamental strength of the economy , interest rate declines may be limited over the next month or so as corporations and state and local governments increase market borrowing in anticipation of higher interest rates later on and as the market focuses on the treasury 's large fall cash need .
a SENT -- ( 19 ) we would expect the funds rate to begin rising in the fall under alternative a if growth in the aggregates is to remain around the midpoints of the longer - run ranges for this alternative .

b SENT -- ( 9 )  under alternative b , the one year growth ranges for m-1 and m-2 are the same as those adopted by the committee in april .
b PAR 11 under alternative b , the proposed federal funds rate range is the same as that adopted by the committee at its previous meeting .
b PAR 11 if the funds rate remains near the recently prevailing 5 - 3/8 per cent level , the staff would expect m-1 growth for the july - august period to be at about a 6 per cent annual rate .
b PAR 11 with the public 's adjustment to the april bulge in m-1 now completed , the transactions demand for money is expected to rise more in line with the continued growth in nominal gnp .
b PAR 11 growth in m-2 is expected to be in a 7 - 11 per cent annual rate range during the july - august period , as the time and savings deposit component of that aggregate continues to expand at near its recent pace .
b PAR 13 further increases in interest rates are likely to develop late this year and in the first half of next year if the midpoints of the longer - run growth ranges contemplated under alternative b are to be achieved .
b PAR 13 the funds rate might need to rise to about 6 per cent by year- end and to about 6¼ per cent by the second quarter of 1978 .
b PAR 13 this would be an appreciably smaller rise in interest rates than the staff thought likely last month .
b PAR 13 it allows for the higher average level of the money stock over the next year that results from applying an unchanged growth rate to a new base period in which there has been a substantial overshoot .
b PAR 13 ( the federal funds rate projections four quarters ahead are shown in appendix ii ) .
b PAR 14 as noted earlier , both alternatives c and d contemplate lower longer - run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative b . while the reduction is substantially larger in the case of alternative d , in either case the committee may wish to consider a rise in the funds rate between now and the next meeting to around 5 - 7/8 per cent , the midpoint of a 5½-6¼ per cent range .
b PAR 14 such a funds rate increase is likely to be accompanied by an increase in short - term rates of interest generally of about ½ percentage point .
b PAR 14 member bank borrowings from the discount window may rise $ 50 - 100 million further , and markets may come to anticipate a rise in the discount rate from its current 5¼ per cent level .

b SENT -- given the degree of near - term ease assumed , the funds rate by spring may have to be at or slightly above the level assumed at that time under alternative b in order to constrain monetary growth in the first half of next year to the indicated rate .
b SENT -- meanwhile , however , for most of the one - year period ahead , short- term rates would have been lower than under alternative b , with consequent relatively easier credit and liquidity conditions at banks and other institutions .
b PAR 20 given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs of the directive .
b PAR 20 the first formulation places main emphasis on near - term rates of growth in monetary aggregates .
b PAR 20 the second formulation , like the directive adopted at the last meeting , places main emphasis on money market conditions ; it shows -- in strike - through form--
b PAR 20 the specifications adopted at the last meeting .
b PAR 20 as suggested below , the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought ; the three alternatives shown -- calling , respectively , for somewhat easier , prevailing , and somewhat firmer money market
b PAR 20 conditions-- are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the pre- ceding section under alternatives
b PAR 20 a , b , and c. " monetary aggregates " formulation the committee seeks to encourage near - term rates of growth in m-1 and m-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer - run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph .
b PAR 20 specifically , at present , it expects the annual growth rates over the july - august period to be within the ranges of   to   per cent for m-1 and   to   per cent for m-2 .
b PAR 20 in the judgment of the committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly - average federal funds rate of about   per cent .
b PAR 20 if , giving approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of   to   per cent .
b PAR 20 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif- icantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chair- man who will then decide whether the situation calls for supple- mentary instructions from the committee .
b PAR 20 " money market " formulation at this time , the committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions ( or to achieve somewhat easier or somewhat firmer money market conditions ) during the period immediately ahead , provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected , which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer- run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph .
b PAR 20 specifically , the committee seeks to maintain the weekly - average federal funds rate at about [ del : 5 - 3/8 ]   per cent , so long as m-1 and m-2 appear to be growing over the [ del : june - july ] july - august period at annual rates with ranges of [ del : 2 - 1/2 to 6 - 1/2 ]   to   per cent and [ del : 6-to-10 ]   to   per cent , respectively .
b PAR 20 if , giving approximately equal weight to m-1 and m-2 , it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges , the operational objective for the weekly - average federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of [ del : 5 - 1/4 to 5 - 3/4 ]   to   per cent .
b PAR 20 if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif- icantly inconsistent , the manager is promptly to notify the chair- man who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplemen- tary instructions from the committee .

b PAR 20 : the last four columns assume growth around the midpoints of the proposed ranges is achieved and are the same numbers as shown in the table on p.
b PAR 20 the table above facilitates comparison of longer - run paths proposed in the current blue book with the committee 's current ( qi ' 77 to qi ' 78 ) and immediately previous ( qiv ' 76 to qiv ' 77 ) longer - run paths .
b PAR 20 the first column of the table shows the level of m1 and m2 implied by the midpoint growth rate of the committee 's qiv ' 76 to qiv ' 77 longer - run range extended to the first and second quarters of 1978 .
b PAR 20 the second column shows the levels of m1 and m2 in the first and second quarters of 1978 implied by midpoint i - 2 growth rates of current longer - run paths ( which take qi ' 77 as the base ) .
b PAR 20 the last four columns show levels of m1 and m2 for the first and second quarters of 1978 implied by the alternatives presented in this blue book ( which take qii ' 77 as the base ) .
b PAR 20 as may be seen , alternatives a through c imply higher midpoint levels for both m and m2 in qi ' 78 and qii ' 78 than would be implicit in extension of committee
b PAR 20 ranges based on qi ' 77 or qiv ' 76 .
b PAR 20 for example , under alternative b , m1 in qii ' 78 would be $ 2.5 billion ( or .7 of a per cent ) above the implied level for that quarter derived by extending the midpoint of the current m1 growth range to the second quarter of 1978 ( shown in the second column ) .
b PAR 20 m2 in qii ' 78 under alternative b
b PAR 20 would be .3 of a per cent above such an implied level .
b PAR 20 alternative d would achieve the implied qii ' 78 level based on 5 per cent growth from qi ' 77 , but it would fall slightly short of achieving the qii ' 78 level that would be implied if the base were carried back to qiv ' 76 .
b PAR 20 alternative d would also fall short of achieving the implied qii ' 78 levels for m2 based on the earlier paths .

b PAR 20 the bank credit proxy -- total member bank deposits plus euro - dollar borrowings and loans sold to affiliates -- has become much less useful than it had been as an indicator of the change in bank credit at all commercial banks .
b PAR 20 in the mid-1960 's , when the credit proxy was developed , this measure was equal to approximately 80 per cent of the outstanding credit at all commercial banks .
b PAR 20 by the end of 1976 the ratio had declined to 67 per cent .
b PAR 20 the deterioration of the proxy has reflected the increasing proportion of total credit extended by nonmember banks and the increasing use by banks of nondeposit sources of funds not included in the proxy , such as borrowings from nonbanks through rp 's and federal
b PAR 20 the advantages of the credit proxy -- its timeliness and its availability on a daily average basis rather than as of a single day -- have increasingly been overshadowed by these problems .
b PAR 20 because of shifts in sources of credit expansion at all commercial banks , the actual performance of the bank credit proxy has , with one exception , fallen well short of the fomc 's longer - run ranges for bank credit .
b PAR 20 the growth in total loans and investments of all commercial banks has actually been much more consistent , on average , with the fomc 's credit ranges , as may be seen from the table , which compares the committee 's growth ranges for bank credit to the actual growth in the member bank credit proxy and two measures of all commercial bank credit .
b PAR 20 the first 1/ it is estimated that in 1976 such borrowings increased nearly $ 23 billion --accounting for 3 percentage points of the rise in bank credit last year -- and the total outstanding amount of such borrowed funds equalled roughly 8 per cent of total member bank deposits at the end of 1976 .
b PAR 20 iii - 2 of these measures is the board 's single - day last - wednesday - of - the - month all commercial bank credit series , and the second is a new " monthly average " bank credit series that is derived by averaging wednesday data.1/
b PAR 20 the staff would recommend that the committee no longer employ the bank credit proxy in view of its deterioration as an indicator of credit and since direct measures of commercial bank total loans and investments will readily serve as a measure for purposes of establishing longer - run ranges .
b PAR 20 1/ both measures of all commercial bank credit are based on reported data from all member banks and estimated data for nonmember banks .
b PAR 20 large member banks report detailed bank credit data for each wednesday .
b PAR 20 an abbreviated report showing three credit items ( total loans , u.s . government securities , and other securities ) is also filed by small member banks each wednesday .
b PAR 20 small member
b PAR 20 nonmember bank ratios are derived from call report data for the three reported credit items .
b PAR 20 the credit data reported by small member banks for wednesdays are multiplied by these call report ratios to derive estimates of nonmember bank credit .
b PAR 20 the various credit components for large and small member banks and nonmember banks are aggregated to a gross loans and investments total .
b PAR 20 bank loans are estimated , based on reported member bank data and nonmember bank call report data , and subtracted from gross loans and investments to obtain a net total loans and investments measure .
b PAR 20 data on loans sold to affiliates are reported for each wednesday by large banks and are added to the net loans and investments series to complete the bank credit measure .
b PAR 20 the monthly average series averages the estimated wednesday data for all banks .
b PAR 20 at this point in time the components of bank credit are estimated only monthly , but the staff could develop a monthly average series for the components also .

c PAR 15 with the funds rate rising over the next few weeks as specified above , we would expect m-1 in the july - august period to expand in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range and m-2 in a 6½-10½ per cent range .
c PAR 15 net inflows of shorter - term small denomination time deposits to banks and thrift institutions may slow at the higher interest levels , and there may also be a further outflow of interest - sensitive savings deposits of individuals , businesses , and state and local governments .
c PAR 15 banks may be expected to adapt to such developments by more aggressively offering large denomination time deposits ; except for negotiable deposits offered by large banks , these deposits are included in m-2 .
c PAR 15 even under the short - run specifications of alternative c , there would appear to be sufficient leeway between ceiling rates in time certificates maturing in four years or more and yields on market instruments to enable banks to retain the funds involved in maturing " wild card " certificates .
c PAR 15 they could , however , lose some funds to thrift institutions , which can offer somewhat higher rates .
c PAR 16 the rise in market rates of interest over the next few weeks accompanying short - run alternative c ( or d   would probably carry the 3-month treasury bill rate above the 5¼ per cent ceiling rate on thrift institution savings deposits .
c PAR 16 this may trigger an increased diversion of these deposits to market instruments .
c PAR 16 under alternative c we would expect that thrifts would become less willing to commit funds to the mortgage market at near the recent pace .
c PAR 16 in addition , given the substantial mortgage takedowns in train , these institutions would have to draw down their liquid assets and borrow more heavily from the fhl banks ; the need for secondary mortgage market support by fnma would also increase .
c PAR 16 but the rise in mortgage rates may be limited if insurance companies , for example , become more active in the mortgage market as a result of the continuing favorable spread of mortgage rates over corporate bond yields .
c PAR 16 in any event , upward pressures on corporate and tax exempt bond yields are likely to be relatively modest , given the substantial supply of investible funds at insurance companies and other institutional investors .
c PAR 17 if the committee wishes to achieve the midpoints of the longer - run growth ranges for alternative c -- indexed by an m-1 range of 4 - 6 per cent -- the staff expects that the funds rate would need to rise only a little further and would top out at around 6¼ per cent in the first quarter of 1978 .
c PAR 17 the greater restraint on growth of the monetary aggregates over the longer - run under alternative d would require a larger rise of interest rates to levels closer to those projected at the previous fomc meeting .
c PAR 17 the funds rate may rise to around 6½ per cent in the first quarter of next year and probably further to a level of 6¾ per cent by the second quarter .
