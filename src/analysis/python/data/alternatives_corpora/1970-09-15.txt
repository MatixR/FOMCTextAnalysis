a PAR 2 the rapid august growth rate for the published money stock also reflected a marked reduction in the importance of several types of international transfers at major banks ; these transfers had the effect on the published figures of understating the growth rate of the money supply earlier in 1970 .
a PAR 2 because the sources of bias became less important in august than in earlier months , once the published data are roughly ad- justed to eliminate the effect of these biases ( as explained in the appendix ) , the august change in the money stock adjusts downward to an annual rate of around 9 per cent .
a PAR 2 since only one of the sources of bias in the money supply data affects the bank credit proxy , adjustments to eliminate bias produce only very minor changes in the proxy series .

a PAR 8 if the committee wishes to continue with a policy that encompasses financial flows and credit conditions consistent with a 5 per cent rate of growth for the money supply , the following language for the second paragraph of the directive might be considered ( alternative a   : to implement this policy , the committee seeks to promote [ del : some easing of conditions in credit markets and somewhat greater moderate growth in money over the months ahead than occurred in the second quarter , while taking account of possible liquidity problems and allowing bank credit growth to reflect bank efforts to rebuild liquidity and any continued shift of credit flows from market to banking channels .
a PAR 8 system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to main- taining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with that objective , taking account of the effects of other monetary policy actions . ]
a PAR 17 attainment of the more rapid growth in the money supply indicated in the above tables would require a more pronounced easing of money market conditions than under alternative a . these easier conditions might include a federal funds rate fluctuating in a 5 - 3/4 - -6 - 1/4 per cent range , member bank borrowings around $ 300-$400 million and net borrowed reserves in a $ 100-$250 million range .
a PAR 17 such conditions could well trigger an immediate cut in the prime rate and reduce the 3-month treasury bill rate to 6 per cent or below .
a PAR 17 such a development might also create expectations of a reduction in the federal reserve discount rate , contributing to general downward pressures on interest rates , in both short- and long - term markets .
a PAR 17 on the other hand , some partly offsetting upward interest rate pressure , chiefly in longer maturity ranges , might develop if there were a heightening of expectations that signifi- cantly easier credit availability would lead to intensification of inflationary conditions later on .
a PAR 18 the adjusted credit proxy is expected to grow some-
a PAR 18 what more rapidly , along with the more rapid growth in money supply , as compared with alternative a . money supply growth is not expected to become more rapid until october , although the exact lags over the near- term in public and bank responses to monetary policy changes are con- jectural .
a PAR 18 net inflows of time deposits to banks are likely to become larger as market interest rates decline -- making cd 's viable throughout the maturity range .
a PAR 18 however , since business loan demands are expected to be moderate , we would expect banks to drop their cd offering rates in line with declines in other market interest rates .
a PAR 18 as cd 's become a more certain source of funds , banks may become more willing to let commercial paper run off and to reduce euro - dollar borrowings .
a PAR 18 thus , the upward effect on the adjusted bank credit proxy of the rather marked lowering of market interest rates expected under this alterna-
a PAR 18 tive might not be extremely sharp , and will likely depend in part on the extent to which businesses switch from open market to bank borrowing and on the extent to which banks and dealers take speculative positions in securities .

a PAR 19 # .r ~ i ~ ea ~ ea appendix preliminary corrections for money supply bias in 1970 for some time
a PAR 19 it has been apparent that current measure of monetary growth were being distorted , as bank float increased more than , deposits at large banks.l/ in 1969 , the money supply s - rles was ,
a PAR 19 re- vised upward to take account of bills payable and london checks , but this revision only partially corrected the series for the downward bias arising from international transfers .
a PAR 19 to attempt to measure the remain- ing bias , the staff has obtained additional information from several sources in preparation for a revision of the money supply series this fall .
a PAR 19 while this information is not yet complete , some rough estimates have been made of monthly average corrections that may be appropriate for 1970 .
a PAR 19 effects on growth rates as currently measured table 1 compares growth rates in m as current measured and as corrected for the estimated bias .
a PAR 19 the corrected growth rate .
a PAR 19 indicate expansion over the first half of 1970 at a 5 - 1/2 per cent annual rate , compared to 4 per cent for the published series , and for the first eight months of the year at 5.9 per cent , as compared with 5 per cent for the published series .
a PAR 19 as had been anticipated , the largest adjustment is for the second quarter .
a PAR 19 however , the second quarter adjustment will be larger than the 1 percentage point previously indicated in the blue book of june 19 .
a PAR 19 in the third quarter the growth rate will probably be lower by about 1 percentage point after correction for bias .
a PAR 19 this level of the money supply in the third quarter will be higher than published aft - bias correction .
a PAR 19 but the effect of tne sources of bias on the rate of growth depends on how the amount of bias is changing relative to the change in private demand deposits ; for the rate f ~l .
a PAR 19 :o ' e biased downward , the amount of bias would have to be e pu :
a PAR 19 a- a faster rate than private demand deposits .
a PAR 19 in fact , during the third quarter the amount of bias in the published figures is expected to decline , thus leading to a fairly significant overstatement in the actual rate of growth when measured by the figures as presently published .
a PAR 19 the expected decline in bias in the published figures is in large part attributable to termina- tion of use of " guerilla " drafts at three major new york city banks , as explained below .
a PAR 19 1/ bank float , or cash items in process of collection , traditionally have been deducted iron the money supply to avei
a PAR 19 outtir.g of deposits that occurs in tne check clearing process .
a PAR 19 however , avail- able statistics do not provide breakdowns of cash items associated with the deposit component of the money supply .
a PAR 19 appendix estimates of bias table 2 provides monthly average estimates of four sources of bias .
a PAR 19 edge act corporations and agencies of foreign banks are not repre- sented in commercial banking statistics from which the money supply series is constituted , so their demand deposits are not included at present .
a PAR 19 yet these institutions are responsible for a very large daily volume of euro- dollar and foreign exchange transactions which clear through their major new york city correspondents .
a PAR 19 new york banks account for these trans- actions by crediting cash items in process of collection and debiting due to banks .
a PAR 19 deduction of these cash items from the money supply is in- appropriate so long as the demand deposits of edge corporations ( which to a great extent represent official checks written in repayment of euro- dollar borrowings by their parent ) and agencies are excluded .
a PAR 19 edge corporations submit daily deposit reports to the new york frb in the same form as those provided by member banks .
a PAR 19 hence , their demand deposits other than interbank can be added to the money supply as an offset to the cash items generated by these institutions .
a PAR 19 such deposits consist mainly of checks written but not yet cleared , judging from their parallel movement with new york city bank cash items over european holiday periods .
a PAR 19 transactions of edge corporations are responsible for the largest portion of the estimated current bias in money supply statistics .
a PAR 19 this source of bias increased in the first half of 1970 , but it has declined slightly since mid - year .
a PAR 19 the basis for correcting bias associated with the foreign agencies is much less satisfactory , although it is known that the effect of agency transactions is similar to that for edge corporations .
a PAR 19 the only information available from agencies currently is in month - end condition reports to the new york state banking commisioner .
a PAR 19 these single - date reports lack standardized depcsit figures , making it difficult to estimate their contribution to money supply bias directly from the deposits that give rise to it .
a PAR 19 however , our investigation suggests that figures on " due from u.s .
a PAR 19 banks and trust companies " , as reported by the agencies , is a suitable proxy for the agency cash items submitted to new york city banks for collection .
a PAR 19 table 1 reflects totals for 25 foreign agencies operating in new york .
a PAR 19 this single - date , indirect measure of agency activity leaves considerable room for error in the bias correction , but
a PAR 19 it . appears to he the best retrospective information available .
a PAR 19 it is estimated that agency transactions declined in importance in the first quarter , but rose above year - end levels by mid - year .
a PAR 19 as explained below , it is planned to obtain more representative data directly from the agencies to carry the money supply series forward after revision .
a PAR 19 the other major component of bias included in these estimates is the so - called " guerilla draft " .
a PAR 19 this accounting device was utilized by a few large banks from late 1969 until recently to obtain reserve bene- fits under both regulations
a PAR 19 such transfers involved " guerilla " or clearing house checks drawn by foreign agencies at the request of a u.s . bank but which do not appear on the books of a foreign agency .
a PAR 19 they had the effect of generating cash items at new york banks which collected the drafts without any corresponding debits to demand deposits included in the money supply .
a PAR 19 this practice resulted in downward bias in both levels and rates of growth of the money supply throughout the first half of 1970 , but its termination recently will reduce the amount of bias in third quarter estimates significantly .
a PAR 19 the smallest component of measurable bias , as indicated by figures on table 2 , is the net effect of transactions through the relatively new clearing house international payments system ( chips ) .
a PAR 19 a large volume of international transactions are now cleared by major new york banks through chips by means of electronic equipment tied into a clearing house computer .
a PAR 19 until recently it was by no means certain that these clearings were introducing only small errors into money supply measurement .
a PAR 19 the problem for money supply statistics evolved from changes in statistical reporting with the advent of this computer clearing system .
a PAR 19 some banks , but not all , began reporting payments and receipts through chips as due to and due from banks , respectively , where formerly they reported officers checks and cash items .
a PAR 19 other banks main tained their former reporting practice .
a PAR 19 depending on the pairing of banks with mixed reporting methods , money supply data could be overstated or understated by such transactions .
a PAR 19 chips began operation in april , with the volume of payments increasing to several billion dollars currently .
a PAR 19 the clearing house has provided daily data on these trans- actions which indicate very little net effect up to now .
a PAR 19 the staff is currently negotiating with other regulatory agencies to achieve standard- ized reporting .
a PAR 19 this will eliminate distortions from this source .
a PAR 19 on balance , the total measurable downward bias in the level of the money supply is estimated to have increased from about $ 3 billion at the end of 1969 to about $ 4 - 1/2 billion at mid - year .
a PAR 19 since june , the total bias has been reduced about $ 500 million , reflecting mainly termina- tion of the use of guerilla drafts in response to mr .
a PAR 19 hayes ' august 13 letter to new york city banks .
a PAR 19 no information is yet available for banks outside new york on the possible use -- if any -- of this or similar devices that might affect the money supply .
a PAR 19 plans for money supply revision the bias corrections discussed above are still too rough to publish .
a PAR 19 moreover , it would be desirable to extend these corrections back as far as the adjustments appear significant to avoid a break in series .
a PAR 19 it would also be desirable to obtain better information on foreign agency transactions for purposes of carrying the corrected series forward .
a PAR 19 these tasks , as well as the annual benchmark and season- al factor revision , have been given a high priority by the staff , and a major revision incorporating all of these elements will be published this fall , probably around the end of october .
a PAR 19 appendix -4- it should be noted that the proposed corrections for trans- actions of edge act corporations and foreign agencies will require con- tinued attention as the money supply series is carried forward .
a PAR 19 this situation will change when euro - dollar and foreign exchange transactions are converted from clearing house to federal funds settlement .
a PAR 19 such federal funds settlement will eliminate the cash items bias discussed above .
a PAR 19 however , implementation of such a system will require close cooperation between the federal reserve , commercial banks , and other institutions involved in international transactions .
