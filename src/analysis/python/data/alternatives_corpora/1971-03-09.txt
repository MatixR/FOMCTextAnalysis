a PAR 11 under all of the alternatives growth in money supply -- whether m1 or m2 - -would be expected to slow over coming months from the unusually rapid february rates of increase .
a PAR 11 however , as indicated in the preceding paragraph , under alternative a , m1 would be expected to grow more rapidly in the second quarter than in the first .

a PAR 11 q. 1971 increase , given transactions needs associated with staff gnp projections , an opportunity cost of holding money lower on average in the second quarter than in the first , and the probablity that expectations of rising interest rates ( and falling capital values ) would become more pervasive in an expanding economic situation .
a PAR 11 growth in m2 would be expected to moderate from the first quarter pace , even under alternative a , however , as the initial asset ad- justment by the public to the sharp drop of late 1970 and early 1971 in market rates relative to time deposit offering rates runs it course .
a PAR 13 an effort to move onto growth paths for aggregates in the second quarter slower than shown for alternative a -- given staff assumptions as to the strength of economic recovery and attendent credit demands -- seems likely to require a rise in the federal funds rate from current levels during the next four weeks .
a PAR 13 the money market conditions now estimated to be con- sistent with alternative a through c are shown in the table below , using the second quarter annual rate of growth in m1 as a convenient index of the col- lection of monetary aggregates .
a PAR 13 difference in money market conditions of these dimensions would be expected to have only relatively minor effects on growth rates for the aggregates in march .

a PAR 21 this language is proposed for possible use if the committee decides to retain the structure of the present directive -- involving a primary instruction concerned with money market conditions and long - term rates , and a proviso clause relating to the aggregates .
a PAR 21 to implement this policy , system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining prevailing money market conditions while accommodating any [ del : additional ] downward movements in long- term rates ; provided that money market conditions shall [ del : promptly ] be modified [ del : eased somewhat further ] if it appears that the monetary and credit aggregates are deviating significantly from [ del : falling short of ] the growth paths [ del : desired ] expected .
a PAR 21 " as will be noted , the primary instruction in alternative a is identical to that of the present directive , except that it is proposed -- in view of the recent increases in long - term rates -- to call for accommodating " any " rather than " additional " downward movements in such rates .
a PAR 21 certain changes are proposed in the proviso clause .
a PAR 21 these include : ( a ) making it a two - way clause , on the assumption that , in light of the recent stronger performance of the aggregates , the committee would wish the desk to react to sizable deviations in either direction ; and ( b ) referring to " credit " as well as " monetary " aggregates , in order to explicitly include the bank credit proxy among the aggregates to be considered by the manager .
a PAR 21 if the committee adopts this alternative , it may wish to consider the money market conditions set forth in the first line of the table in paragraph ( 13 ) above as a description of " prevailing " conditions , and for purposes of the proviso clause , to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alternative a as the " expected " paths .

b PAR 17 if short - term rates do not rise over the next few weeks , the staff would expect long - term market yields to work down , given the present wide spread of long over short rates , once headway is made in absorbing the exceptionally large volume of corporate bonds in the immediate offing .
b PAR 17 in the corporate and municipal bond market the recent rise in yields has probably reflected some discounting of potential future rate increases .
b PAR 17 thus , a rise in short - rates of about the magnitude indicated for alternative b might not be accompanied by any appreciable rise in long rates over the second quarter as a whole , although an initial market reaction would be likely ; money market tightening of the degree contemplated under alternative
b PAR 17 c might well bring a more lasting long - term rate advance .
b PAR 22 this language is proposed for possible use if the committee decides ( a ) to formulate its primary instruction in terms of desired growth rates for the aggregates , and ( b ) to adopt as targets the growth rates ( including a 7 per cent second - quarter rise in m1 ) dis- cussed earlier in connection with alternative b . " to implement this policy , the committee seeks to promote sustained growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead .
b PAR 22 system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining [ del : prevailing ] bank reserves and money market condi- tions consistent with that objective [ del : while accommodating additional downward movements in long - term rates , provided that money market conditions shall promptly be eased somewhat further if it appears that the monetary aggregates are falling short of the growth path desired]. " the phrase " sustained growth " is suggested as a description of the committee 's objective for the aggregates because the second - quarter growth rate for m1 shown for this alternative is the same as the rate now expected for the first quarter .
