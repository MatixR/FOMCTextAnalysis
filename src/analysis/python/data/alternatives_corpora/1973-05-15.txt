b PAR 6 8) alternative b is consistent with the long run path for the aggregates ( as indexed by m1 growth of 5 - -5 - 1/2 per cent ) adopted by the committee at recent meetings .
b PAR 6 attainment of these longer - run objectives might well involve some further tightening of the money market , with -5a- alternative longer - run targets for key monetary aggregates sept .

b PAR 6 this represents somewhat tighter money market conditions than were specified at the time of the last meeting as consistent with the given longer - run objectives for the aggregates .
b PAR 6 this specification of tighter money market conditions re- flects the greater strength of money supply in recent weeks and the sizable upward revision in the projection of nominal gnp for the second quarter .

b PAR 10 between now and the next committee meeting the 3-month treasury bill rate is likely to move back up into a 6 - 1/4 - -6 - 5/8 per cent range under alternative b . the recent rise in the discount rate and the somewhat tauter money market conditions anticipated will put pressure on dealer financing costs and will also give banks a further incentive to sell or liquidate bills as compared with other forms of adjustment .
b PAR 10 in addition , a $ 1 - -$2 billion drop in the treasury balance at the fed is anticipated prior to mid - june tax receipts and this will cause the system to sell more bills than otherwise into the market .
b PAR 10 the bill rate is still expected to remain unusually low relative to the funds rate , however .
b PAR 10 the treasury 's favorable cash position has enabled it to pay down maturing coupon issues and bills , and the treasury has also stressed debt lengthening in its refunding operations .
b PAR 10 in this assessment of the bill market , we have not assumed any substantial reflow of funds from abroad .
b PAR 14 long - term interest rates seem likely to rise somewhat under the conditions of alternative b partly as restraint on bank credit availa- bility leads banks to participate relatively little as suppliers of funds in securities markets .
b PAR 14 reduced flows of funds to nonbank savings institu- tions will also work toward upward pressure on mortgage rates and on debt markets more generally as federal agencies offer sizable amounts of securities to help support the mortgage market .
b PAR 14 demands on long - term bond markets , however , still appear quite moderate , and this may permit a rise in short rates to develop without significant impacts on long rates .
b PAR 14 but expectations are very important in the determination of long rates , and should monetary actions be interpreted as implying that credit will tighten substantially further , or remain tight for a more extended period than expected , long rates could well come under more upward pressure .

c PAR 16 under alternative c , which moves toward a lower long - run growth rate for the aggregates , it would appear that the federal funds rate would probably have to rise above 8 per cent over the period imme- diately ahead .
c PAR 16 because of lags the main impact on m1 growth would not occur until the third quarter , when -- to achieve the 4 - -4 - 1/2 per cent long - run objective -- m1 growth would have to fall to a 3 per cent annual rate .
c PAR 16 m2 growth also would slow sharply , given the significantly higher short - term rates and assuming no increase in regulation q ceilings for consumer - type time deposits .
c PAR 16 given the low growth rates for the aggre- gates expected for the third quarter under this alternative , the committee may find it necessary to ease money market conditions in the course of summer if it desires to stay on the longer - run growth paths of alternative c thereafter .
c PAR 16 proposed directive 
c SENT -- as will be noted , an instruction to take account of credit market developments is included in alternative c since the relatively sharp tightening of money market conditions contemplated could lead to undesirably rapid adjustments in credit markets generally .
