a SENT -- even under alternative a , some further increase in the funds rate might well be required .
a PAR 16 expansion in m-2 under alternative a is likely to be in a 6 to 10 per cent annual rate range over the october - november period .
a PAR 16 the interest - bearing component of m-2 will , of course , be buoyed by shifts from demand to automatic transfer savings accounts , and growth of the remaining savings and time deposits included in this aggregate is expected to slow only somewhat from its recent strong pace .
a PAR 16 although inflows to nontransferable savings accounts are expected to slow sharply from the recent surprisingly rapid pace , sales of 6-month certificates and large denomination time deposits are likely to continue to support time deposit growth at a rate close to recent levels .
a PAR 19 under alternative a , yields on longer - term securities also are likely to show little further change in the near - term , abstracting from possible expectational effects of any new administration wage - price program .
a PAR 19 oncoming supplies of new corporate and municipal securities are expected to remain relatively moderate , and given recent foreign central bank acquisitions of nonmarketable treasury securities , the treasury 's need to raise new cash in the market over the fourth quarter has been reduced somewhat further .
a PAR 19 in its mid - november refunding -- to be announced october 25 - -the treasury is expected to roll over $ 4.6 billion of maturing debt and to raise around $ 1½ to 2 billion of new money .
a PAR 19 following thisoperation , the treasury probably will need to raise only about $ 7 billion of new money in the coupon market over the remainder of the fourth quarter .

b PAR 14 two alternative short - run specifications for the monetary aggregates and the federal funds rate believed to be generally consistent with the longer - run proposals for the aggregates are presented below for committee consideration .
b PAR 14 alternative
b PAR 14 i contemplates a federal funds rate range centered on the current 8¾ per cent level , while alternative b calls for a rise in the funds rate to 9¼ per cent .
b PAR 14 no easing alternative for the short - run is presented because all proposed longer - run ranges involve either stable or rising interest rates over the next several months .
b PAR 14 ( more detailed and longer - run data are shown in tables on pages 10 and 11 ; the numbers in parentheses in those tables show estimates abstracting from the effect of ats ) .

b SENT -- the tightening of the funds market over the weeks ahead envisaged by alternative b would -- by introducing restraint earlier-- increase the likelihood that the funds rate would not have to rise into the upper part of the 9 to 10¼ per cent range projected for next year under alternative b . 
b PAR 21 under alternative b , m-1 growth , including the effect of automatic transfers , would likely be in a ½ to 6½ per cent annual rate range over the october - november period , m-2 in a 5½ to 9½ per cent range , and m-1 + in a 2½ to 6½ per cent range .
b PAR 21 the additional interest rate pressure would slow the growth of non - transferable savings deposits and time deposits subject to fixed rate - ceilings , but the effects of this slowing on the total interest - bearing components of m-2 and m-3 may be dampened by issuance of 6-month certificates and , at banks , large denomination time deposits .
b PAR 22 the percentage point increase in the funds rate contemplated under alternative b would place further upward pressure on other short- and long - term interest rates .
b PAR 22 the bond markets appear to be in a strong technical position , with dealer inventories light and the forward calendar of new offerings moderate , but such a rise in the funds rate , coupled with the recent discount rate action , is likely to carry long rates back above the early july peaks .
b PAR 22 mortgage market conditions are likely to tighten further as the effective cost of the 6-month money market certificate moves up to close to 9½ per cent , and thrifts become somewhat more cautious in their lending attitudes .
b PAR 22 directive language 

c PAR 13 the longer - run alternative c ranges encompass growth rates for m-2 and m-3 nearer to those currently in place .
c PAR 13 in addition , alternative c calls for a slower longer - run growth in m-1 - -in a 3 to 5 per cent range , abstracting from ats .
c PAR 13 growth around the upper end of that range would tend to compensate for the " overshoot " in m-1 expansion over the first three quarters of this year and would lead to about a 6 per cent annual rate of growth from the end of 1977 through the third quarter of 1979 , as may be seen in the bottom line of appendix iii-1 .
