a PAR 6 b ranges for june - july m-1 7 to 11 6½ to 10½ m-2 7 to 11 6 to 10 federal funds rate ( intermeeting period )
a PAR 6 7¼ to 7¾ 7 to 8 ( 8) growth in m-1 is expected to accelerate over the june - july period in reflection of the relatively strong under- lying demand for money associated with the prospective increase in nominal economic activity .
a PAR 6 the staff projection implies that growth in m-1 over the second quarter will be at a 9½ per cent annual rate , and that in july this aggregate 1/ the ranges are based on the newly benchmarked series for the monetary aggregates .

a PAR 6 b growth rates monthly : quarterly average : semi - annual : annual : will remain well above the level implied by the upper end of the fomc 's longer - run range , as shown in chart 1 on the following page.1/ ( 9 ) expansion in m-2 under alternative a is also likely to be in a 7 to 11 per cent annual rate range over the june - july period .
a PAR 6 growth at the mid - point of this range would maintain m-2 near the upper end of the longer - run range adopted by the committee for this aggregate , as shown in chart 2 .
a PAR 10 the increase in m-2 growth in june - july reflects not only the strengthening of m-1 expansion , but also some pick - up in expansion of the interest - bearing component , due entirely to the growth of large denomination time deposits .
a PAR 10 such deposits , as well as negotiable cd 's not included in m-2 , are expected to be issued aggressively so that banks may accommodate continued substantial growth in credit demands .
a PAR 10 both the expected level of market rates of interest and shifts from savings accounts to the newly authorized 6-month money market certificate are likely to contribute to a contraction in savings accounts at both banks and thrift institutions .
a PAR 10 commercial banks are expected to garner less new money from the new instrument than thrifts , and bank inflows of time deposits subject to rate ceilings are projected to moderate from their surprisingly well maintained pace of the last two or three months .
a PAR 10 1/ the qi ' 78 base level for the fomc 's current longer - run ranges , shown in the chart , has been raised to reflect the benchmark revision in the series .
a PAR 10 thus , the longer - run ranges now imply higher levels for the aggregates over the qi ' 78 to qi ' 79 period .
a PAR 10 to attain the qi ' 79 level of m-1 implicit in the mid - point of the long - run growth range set prior to benchmark revision would require that growth in m-1 from the revised qi ' 78 base be about 5 per cent rather than 5¼ per cent .

a PAR 10 755 - q377-q3800 ( 11 ) reflecting the 25 basis point ceiling rate advantage enjoyed by them on the 6-month money market certificate , thrifts are expected to be able to use this instrument more effectively than banks .
a PAR 10 both press and redbook reports suggest that thrifts have aggressively promoted the new 6-month money market certificate , and sample data for early june indicate a moderate acceleration in aggregate deposit growth at such institutions from the pace of recent months .
a PAR 10 on balance , the staff is projecting that -- under alternative a -- the recent regulatory changes will permit thrifts to maintain deposit flows this summer at near recent rates .
a PAR 12 if the federal funds rate were maintained around the currently prevailing levels of 7½ per cent , as envisioned under alternative a , most other short - term rates would likely also show little net change over the very near term .
a PAR 12 following their most recent increases , both commercial paper and cd rates now are aligned with the federal funds rate in roughly the same relationship that has prevailed throughout the current expansion .
a PAR 12 although the 3-month treasury bill rate has risen in recent weeks , it still remains low relative to other short - term rates .
a PAR 12 however , its spread of 75 to 100 basis points below other rates is not likely to be closed signifi- cantly in the next few weeks .
a PAR 12 available supplies will be depleted by treasury redemptions of cash - management bills and by system purchases to offset the effects of the build - up in treasury cash balances following the june tax date .
a PAR 12 with staff projections suggesting continued strength in the money stock , short - term rates could , nevertheless , begin to move higher during the intermeeting period if and as market participants come to anticipate further tightening of monetary policy .
a SENT -- ( 17 ) projections of the federal funds rate over the four- quarter policy period are shown in appendix i. under alternative a , the federal funds rate might need to rise to 9 to 10 per cent by fall to restrain growth in the aggregates to within the longer - run ranges .

b PAR 14 m-1 growth would likely be in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range over june and july and m-2 growth in a 6½ to 10½ per cent range .
b PAR 14 the additional firming of ¼ percentage point in the funds rate under this alternative would likely be associated with upward adjustments in short - term market rates of the same magnitude , or perhaps a bit more since business short- and intermediate - term credit demands are expected to remain sizable .
b PAR 14 in addition to a probable further increase in the prime rate from the recently established 8¾ per cent level , banks and other lenders can be expected to continue to firm up non - rate loan terms and conditions .
b PAR 14 borrowing from the federal reserve discount window would become even more attractive to member banks , and the resultant rise in such borrowings would increase pressure for another adjustment in the discount rate .
