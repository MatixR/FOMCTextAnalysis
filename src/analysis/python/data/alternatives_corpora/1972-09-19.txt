a SENT -- at one limit , ( alternative a ) , we have shown an expansion in monetary aggregates that involves essentially no change between now and the first quarter of 1973 in money market conditions from those recently prevailing .
a PAR 11 paths for the monetary aggregates consistent with the initial rpd and money market conditions shown in paragraph ( 8  are indexed below by rates of change ( saar   for m1 .
a PAR 11 detailed figures for all the usual monetary aggregates , including various measures of reserves , are shown in the tables on pages 8 and 9 .
a PAR 11 1/ the disappearance of cash items on banks ' books ( and also of float on fed books ) as a result of new regulation
a PAR 11 j will also result in an upward level adjustment in measured money supply .
a PAR 11 this adjustment will be made at the time of our annual revision .
a PAR 11 the adjustment will not affect growth rates .

a PAR 11 a , the committee would be aiming at a constellation of reserve and money market conditions -- essentially involving no change through the first quarter of ' 73 in money market conditions from those prevailing on average in the past few weeks -- that would reduce m1 growth only modestly from the rapid 10 - 1/2 per cent rate expected in the third quarter .
a PAR 11 some slowing in m1 demand in the fourth and first quarters would be in prospect from the lagged effects of the recent rise in short- term rates .
a PAR 11 but by the end of the first quarter , operations under alternative a would probably have set in train forces leading to quite rapid m1 growth as 1973 progresses , assuming the rate of expansion in nominal gnp remains strong .
a SENT -- ( 18 )  presented below are four alternative formulations for the operational paragraph of the directive , which might be taken to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding section : alternative a " to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in [ del : capital ] credit markets , [ del : and ] international developments , and the effects of bank regulatory changes , the committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support [ del : moderate ] some moderation of growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead .

b PAR 5 expansion of m1 and m2 in august exceeded growth rates thought to be consistent with policy alternative b in the last blue book by 1/2 to 1 - 1/2 percentage points ( after adjusting for a decrease in the july base   .
b PAR 5 in the case of m 1 the annual growth rate for august was 6 per cent , as shown in attached table 2 . however , data for early september suggest that growth of m1 will be rapid from august to september , and is thus likely to be stronger in the third quarter than thought at the last fomc meeting .
b PAR 8 for each of the four alternatives noted above , the following table shows rpd growth rates and associated money market conditions that might be used as operating targets between now and the next meeting of the committee .
b PAR 8 ( the tables in paragraph ( 11 ) and on pp.8 - 9 give longer - run paths for monetary aggregates . )
b PAR 8 a single maximum likelihood estimate is shown for the federal funds rate .
b PAR 8 at any given rpd target , the strength of demand for reserves , as well as technical market factors , will of course generate fluctuation around the funds rate shown .

b PAR 9 the changes in regulations d and j , effective september 21 , affect the multiplier relationship between reserves and deposits , and in the transition period immediately ahead makes that relationship more uncertain than usual .
b PAR 9 for one thing , the ability of banks to waive penalties on reserve deficiencies ( up to $ 433 million initially ) will affect excess reserves to an unknown degree .
b PAR 9 to the extent that these potential waivers are not used ( either to run deficiencies or to reduce normal excess reserves ) , excess reserves will rise .
b PAR 9 1/ we have assumed that 50 per cent is used in the first week and that use increases to 80 per cent by the end of four weeks .
b PAR 9 for another thing , the effect on required reserves resulting from regulations d
b PAR 9 and j is particularly complicated .
b PAR 9 though regulations d and j together will lower required reserves for a given level of gross deposits , banks as a 1/ in our figures excess reserves , rpd , total reserves , and nonborrowed reserves have been adjusted to include the $ 433 million of potential waivers , since these are in effect reserves that can be utilized by the banking system .
b PAR 9 whole will have greater required reserves from the effect of regulation j alone , because faster reserve crediting will reduce cash items and hence increase required reserves .
b PAR 9 1 / but we can not be very certain at this point as to the distribution by individual banks of the regulation j effect on reserves and , therefore , of the effect on the reserve - deposit multiplier-- particularly given a totally new reserve requirement structure to evaluate .
