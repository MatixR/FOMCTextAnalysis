a SENT -- as shown in the chart on the following page , the 6 - 1/2 per cent growth rate of alternative a returns m1 by march of next year to a long - run 5 - 1/4 per cent growth path ( illustrated by the dashed line ) .

b PAR 12 although the interest rate declines anticipated under the easing alternatives might be fairly sharp
b PAR 12 , it is quite likely that rates will turn around , particularly under alternative b .
b PAR 12 this assumes that the economy expands as projected in the greenbook and therefore that the underlying transactions demand for money will be relatively well maintained and credit demands will be fairly strong .
b PAR 12 thus , under alternative b , bill rates might be back in the neighborhood of current levels , or perhaps above them , by around year - end .
b PAR 12 the degree of any reversal would be tempered , however , if it proves necessary to reduce the funds rate somewhat below the bottom of the alternative b range later this year in order to achieve the desired monetary growth path .

c SENT -- a sharper decline in the funds rate would be likely under a. under alternative c , money market conditions seem most likely to remain around those prevailing recently , given the more restrained growth in reserves and the aggregates posited .
c PAR 10 rpd growth for october - november of course becomes larger the easier are the policy alternatives .
c PAR 10 while the differences in rpd growth in the short - run are modest , the differences in growth of non- borrowed reserves are larger in order to compensate , under the easier alternatives , for the further drop in member bank borrowings that would be envisaged .
c PAR 10 the unchanged money market conditions of alternative c encompass a federal funds rate centered in a 9 - 1/2 - -10 - 1/2 per cent range and member bank borrowings that fluctuate around $ 1.5 billion .
c PAR 10 to attain the aggregates specified under b , the federal funds rate would be expected to decline toward the lower part of the 8 - 3/4 - -1-l/4 per cent range indicated , and average member bank borrowings may decline to around $ 1.3 billion .
c PAR 10 under a , the funds rate could drop considerably further to around 8 per cent and member bank borrowings to around $ 1 billion .
c PAR 10 however , it has become very difficult in recent weeks to anticipate shifts in member bank demands for borrowing as market conditions change , and these estimates of borrowing could even be a bit on the high side .
