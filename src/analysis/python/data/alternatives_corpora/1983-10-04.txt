a PAR 15 these specifications include a 9 percent m1 and 9 - 1/2 percent m2 growth from september to december ; such growth rates would leave mi in the upper part of its long - run range in the fourth quarter on average , and m2 close to its midpoint .
a PAR 15 m3 would approach its upper limit .
a PAR 16 a substantial rally in financial markets would probably accompany an easing in bank reserve positions of the dimensions suggested in alternative a , with the 3-month bill rate falling to the neighborhood of 8 - 1/4 percent .
a PAR 16 a further decline in cd rates would put downward pressure on the prime rate , which might be reduced 1/2 percentage point , or perhaps somewhat more , given the relatively wide spread that already has developed between the prime and short - term market rates .
a PAR 16 the easing in market conditions would probably lead to resumption of balance sheet restructuring by businesses through increased issuance of bonds -- and also of stocks as equity prices tended to improve along with the drop in bond yields .
a PAR 16 the downward pressure on mortgage rates that would be generated under this alternative would tend to limit the drop in housing starts that currently seems in store .
a PAR 16 the foreign exchange value of the dollar would decline further .
a PAR 17 whether the rate declines contemplated under alternative a , with money market rates hovering around the current discount rate , would be sustained into next year is , at this point , questionable . assuming moderate continuing strength in the economy , interest rates might have to rise later this year or early next to begin restraining mi and m2 growth to rates within the committee 's reduced longer - run ranges for 1984 tentatively set at 4 to 8 percent and 6 - 1/2 to 9 - 1/2 percent , respectively .

b PAR 10 the table below shows alternative specifications for the monetary aggregates over the september - to - december period , together with associated federal funds rate ranges for the upcoming intermeeting period .
b PAR 10 all the alternatives keep the monetary aggregates within their long - run target ranges through the fourth quarter , though differing money market conditions are implied .
b PAR 10 the lower panels give the implied growth rates for each aggregate from the base period established by the committee for its longer - term ranges to the fourth quarter .

b PAR 10 ( ii ) money growth rates between now and year - end under alternative b would be expected to accelerate from the relatively slow pace of recent months , but even so m1 and m2 in the fourth quarter on average would be , respectively , just above and just below the midpoints of their longer - run chart

b PAR 10 for m1 , some rebound in growth over the next three months might be expected as the restraining effect of the higher interest rates that emerged in the spring and early summer dissipates .
b PAR 10 moreover , underlying transactions needs and income growth are likely to be fairly sizable , as indicated by the staff projection of about a 9 percent growth in nominal gnp in the fourth quarter .
b PAR 10 even with the acceleration in monthly growth rates under alternative b , on a quarterly average basis m1 is projected to increase at only a 5 - 1/2 per- cent annual rate in the fourth quarter .
b PAR 10 the implied increase in velocity would not be especially large when compared to other expansion periods , but it would represent a further quickening of m1 velocity growth rates following the turn - around to small increases in the second and third quarters .
b PAR 12 m2 growth is also expected to accelerate under alternative b -- as well as m3 growth to a degree -- as expansion in its nontransactions component picks up from the unusually sluggish pace of recent months .
b PAR 12 the anticipated decline in treasury deposits from their very high end - of- september level should be accompanied by more aggressive efforts by banks to obtain funds from the public generally .
b PAR 12 the staff does not expect the decontrol of most time deposits on october i to affect growth of the aggre- gates very significantly over time , given the earlier availability of ceiling - free mmdas and longer - term time accounts .
b PAR 12 active promotion of the new accounts does not appear to be widespread , according to results of a reserve bank survey , though there are reports of emerging price competition in a few key markets .
b PAR 12 the money paths allow for only small near - term effects -- in the direction of restraining m1 and increasing m2 growth .
b PAR 13 federal funds under alternative b would be expected to trade in the area of 9 - 1/4 to 9 - 1/2 percent , and adjustment plus seasonal borrowing might average between $ 550 and $ 750 million .
b PAR 13 nonborrowed and total reserves would be expected to increase at 9 and 6 percent rates , respectively .
b PAR 13 it is difficult to foresee any significant change in market interest rates more generally under this alternative .
b PAR 13 rates could back up a little in the degree that some market participants are antici- pating more of an easing in monetary policy given the recent weakness in money supply .
b PAR 13 any increase in rates should be quite limited , though , as incoming data are expected to continue to show money growth well with- in the fomc 's ranges and economic activity expanding only moderately .

c PAR 18 this alternative implies m1 growth at 5 percent from september to december , about the same as in the previous three months , while m2 and m3 growth would accelerate only modestly .
c PAR 19 the federal funds rate under alternative c would be expected to rise to around 10 per cent , with discount window borrowing rising to around $ 1 billion , as reserve provision is constrained relative to demand .
c PAR 19 other market interest rates would move up substantially .
c PAR 19 the 3-month bill might increase to around 9 - 1/2 percent , and yields on bonds and mortgages would adjust upward by perhaps 50 to 75 basis points over the near term .
c PAR 19 over a longer horizon , though , with higher interest rates damping money demand and probably slowing the economic expansion relative to staff forecasts , interest rate increases might be expected at least to be reversed and perhaps move to levels somewhat below those currently prevailing to sustain a moderate pace of economic recovery next year .
