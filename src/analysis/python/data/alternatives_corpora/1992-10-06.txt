a SENT -- under the easier policy stance of alternative a , the expected federal funds rate would be cut to 2 - 1/2 percent .
a SENT -- with a 1/2 percentage point drop in the dis- count rate , for example , an initial borrowing assumption of $ 200 million would be retained under alternative a . 
a PAR 14 the immediate 1/2 percentage point drop in the federal funds rate under alternative a would exceed the market 's expected change .
a PAR 14 short - term market interest rates would decline by as much as 1/4 point further , and banks would reduce the prime rate by 1/2 point , maintaining an unusually wide spread over funding costs .
a PAR 14 the dollar probably would depreciate somewhat further ; since the policy easing would occur in a situation of persistent macroeconomic slack and ongo- ing disinflation , the decline in the dollar is most likely to be con- tained .
a PAR 14 in such circumstances , long - term market rates probably would move still lower , pulled down by the weight of a reduced expected path for short - term rates over at least the intermediate term .
a SENT -- ( 15 ) under alternative a , m2 and m3 likely would grow at rates of 2 - 3/4 and 1 - 1/4 percent over the september - to - december interval .

b SENT -- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 3 percent , in association with an initial assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of
b PAR 10 the spate of weak incoming economic information since late last week has reestablished market expectations that another easing of reserve conditions may well be imminent , involving an an- ticipated further decline in the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point .
b PAR 10 under these circumstances , selection of the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative b would initially induce some backup in interest rates across the maturity spectrum and some rise in the ex- change value of the dollar .
b PAR 10 this upward pressure would be muted to the extent that market participants viewed any policy action as merely 5 . to attain the lower bounds of their annual ranges , m2 and m3 would need to grow by 5 and 3 - 1/4 percent , respectively , from septem- ber to december .

b PAR 10 the market 's expectations of an eventual ease would be strengthened should incoming data confirm the tepid expansion and disinflationary trends in the greenbook forecast .
b PAR 10 that forecast en- compasses the possibility of some decline in short - term rates over coming months , but keeping the funds rate at 3 percent over the six weeks of the intermeeting period would not necessarily be inconsistent with that possibility .
b PAR 10 in any event , a decline in long - term rates could eventually develop even at an unchanged funds rate as evidence of disinflation takes firm enough hold to offset skittishness about fiscal policy ; indeed , failing to meet market expectations about policy easing could well strengthen perceptions that the disinflation trend will be sustained .
b PAR 11 under alternative b , m2 is projected to grow at a 2 percent rate from september to december , somewhat slower than in the last two months .
b PAR 11 monetary growth will be boosted for a time by addi- tions to demand deposits associated with prepayments on mortgage- backed securities arising from robust refinancings and to ocds from the reclassification of sweep accounts however , nominal income growth is projected to moderate in the fourth quarter .
b PAR 11 moreover , despite the special factors and lingering effects of pre- vious policy stimulus , projected m2 growth stays below that of nominal gdp because of the probable persistence of the forces that have been boosting m2 velocity for some time .
b PAR 11 in particular , the further de- clines in liquid deposit rates in prospect , in combination with a still steep treasury yield curve , will continue to encourage shifts into bond and stock mutual funds from m2 balances .
b PAR 11 in addition , the 6 . about $ 4 - 1/2 billion of such accounts , which have been clas- sified as large time deposits since their introduction in july 1990 , will be reclassified as transaction deposits at the end of october .
b PAR 11 ml as a whole is expected to record a 12 - 1/2 percent rate of growth from september to december .
b PAR 11 with currency and total reserves growth projected at 9 - 1/2 and 17 - 1/2 percent , respectively , over these three months , the monetary base would expand at an 11 percent rate .
b PAR 11 gap between consumer loan rates and deposit rates will stay wide by historical standards , tending to foster a further rechannelling of funds away from m2 and toward household debt repayment or avoidance .
b PAR 11 the growth in m2 velocity in the fourth quarter of nearly 1 percent would bring its expansion over this year to 2 - 1/2 percent .
b PAR 11 were the federal funds rate to be maintained at 3 percent beyond the committee meeting in november , m2 growth in the first quarter
b PAR 11 probably would be on a trajectory below the committee 's tentative 2 - 1/2 to 6 - 1/2 percent range , with continued sizeable velocity increases .
