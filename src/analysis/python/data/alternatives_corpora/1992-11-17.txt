a PAR 11 two alternatives for money and debt growth ranges are shown below for 1993 , along with the staff projections .
a PAR 11 the alternative a ranges represent the current provisional ranges announced last july ; the lower ends of these ranges are above the staff forecasts for broad money growth .

a PAR 11 ii ranges are 1 percentage point lower for m2 and m3 and encompass the staff forecasts for these aggregates .
a PAR 11 the current provisional debt range , which readily includes the staff forecast , is left unchanged in alternative b.5 alternative ranges for money and debt growth for 1993 ( percent change )

a SENT -- or the committee could put some emphasis on m2 and still select alternative a if the greenbook forecast were viewed as involving unacceptably weak economic activity and unnecessarily rapid disinflation .
a SENT -- the policy ease envisaged under alternative a would trim the expected federal funds rate to 2 - 1/2 percent .
a SENT -- technically , though , the lower federal funds rate of alternative a could be achieved by reducing the borrowing assumption $ 25 million with an unchanged discount rate .
a PAR 20 against a backdrop of public readings that suggested some firming in economic activity , market participants would be sur- prised by the 1/2 point decline in the funds rate under alternative a . most short - term interest rates would match the decrease in the federal funds rate .
a PAR 20 major commercial banks would take that cue , cutting the prime rate 1/2 percentage point ; even with a 5 - 1/2 percent prime rate , banks still would enjoy a swollen margin over funding costs , at least in comparison to the historical record .
a PAR 20 the foreign exchange value of the dollar would decline .
a PAR 20 long - term interest rates are likely to drop , reversing much of the recent runup .
a PAR 20 such a decline would be limited , however , should the easing engender market fears that the lagged effects of the monetary stimulus , reinforcing a boost provided by a prospective fiscal policy package in 1993 , would undercut the downward tilt to in- flation .
a PAR 21 while the impetus to the monetary aggregates imparted by choosing alternative a would be barely discernible in 1992 , the lower market interest rates embodied in that choice would push up both m2 and m3 to the lower end of their current tentative ranges for 1993 by march .
a PAR 21 the anticipated drop in nominal interest rates across the term structure should speed balance - sheet adjustments , lowering debt service burdens for households and corporations , and by reducing real rates as well , provide some spur to spending .
a PAR 21 directive language 

b SENT -- ( 12 )  the lower ranges embodied in alternative b might be chosen on the rationale that since july experience with substantial further increases in velocities and additional analysis have reduced the uncertainty regarding the strength of the forces acting to boost veloci- ties in 1993 .
b SENT -- accordingly , even if the projected relationship among money demand , spending , and interest rates foreseen by the staff proves to be correct , the lower portions of the current ranges still could be seen as representing appropriate intermediate targets for m2 and m3 growth next year , more so than the lower portions of the alternative b ranges .
b SENT -- under alternative b , the trading range for the federal funds rate would remain centered at 3 percent , in conjunction with an initial assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 75 mil-
b PAR 16 the absence of system action over the current intermeet- ing period and the flow of data releases pointing more clearly to sus- tained expansion in economic activity have solidified the notion that monetary policy will remain unchanged for some time .
b PAR 16 thus , market par- ticipants would be unlikely to react to the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative b , especially if incoming data conform to the greenbook assessment of moderately expanding real activity in the fourth quarter .
b PAR 16 treasury bill rates would hold at their current levels , as would the 7 . to attain the lower bounds of their target ranges by december , m2 and m3 would need to grow at average rates of 4 - 1/4 and 4 percent , respectively , in november and december .

b PAR 16 as the december 19 date for implementation of prompt corrective action approaches , pres- sures on quality spreads in the banking sector might be exacerbated by uncertainty about the circle of candidates subject to early closure .
b PAR 16 in capital markets , yields could edge down on balance as the readings that trickle in over the intermeeting period indicate a modest pace to the economic expansion and imply further progress toward price stability .
b PAR 16 at the same time , concerns about the prospects for fiscal stimulus and uncertainties about the economic policies of the new administration more generally , which may not be resolved for some time , will continue to weigh upon market sentiment .
b PAR 17 under alternative b , the growth of m2 is projected to slow somewhat from its pace of the last two months .
b PAR 17 special factors are continuing to boost m2 growth in november but will partly reverse there- after , pulling average growth over the five month forecast horizon back to an underlying rate of about 2 percent .
b PAR 17 on a quarterly average basis , the near - term pickup in m2 puts that aggregate on a growth tra- jectory somewhat below that for nominal gdp in the fourth quarter but 8 .
b PAR 17 additions to demand deposits and mmdas to support mortgage refinancings account for about $ 4 billion of the increase in m2 from october to december , but the anticipated contraction in mortgage refinancing activity subtracts a like amount from the change in that aggregate over the december - to - march period .
b PAR 17 the reclassification of sweep accounts as other checkable rather than large time deposits adds about $ 4 billion to m2 from october to december but has no further effect .
b PAR 17 m1 growth is slowing , but the lagged effects of previous reductions in short - term market interest rates still show clearly in the projected near double - digit expansion of the narrow aggregates . with currency and total reserves projected at 7 - 3/4 and 6 percent , respectively , over these five months , the monetary base would increase at an 8 percent rate .
b PAR 17 about 3 percentage points below it in the first quarter of 1993 .
b PAR 17 this upward tilt to m2 velocity over the two quarters reflects a continuation of those forces that have been boosting velocity for some time -- the ongoing process of balance - sheet restructuring and deleveraging that makes investors less willing to acquire monetary assets and depository institutions less willing to compete aggressively for funds .
