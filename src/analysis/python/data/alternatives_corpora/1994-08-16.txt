b PAR 8 such a view might follow from placing more weight on recent 8 .
b PAR 8 later in the intermeeting period it may prove necessary to reduce the borrowing allowance a little to reflect the onset of the typical unwinding of the summer bulge in seasonal borrowing .
b PAR 8 soft spending indicators , on undesired inventory buildups , or on the effects of previous policy tightenings . waiting for more clarifica- tion of how much slowing in spending growth is already in train would be seen as posing fewer risks than implied in the staff forecast if it were thought that favorable readings on price indexes suggested that some slack remained in the economy .
b PAR 9 market participants now seem to expect at least a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate at the august meeting , with some possibility of a 50 basis point increase ; a 4 - 3/4 percent funds rate is anticipated by late september .
b PAR 9 in these circumstances , the choice of no change in the stance of policy under alternative b would result in some decline in short - term interest rates , and the dollar might tend to weaken on foreign exchange markets .
b PAR 9 long - term rates could move lower , at least initially .
b PAR 9 market participants might view the absence of action as indicating a milder degree of tightening into the future as well -- perhaps because the federal reserve saw less inflation in the outlook than previously thought .
b PAR 9 however , rate de-
b PAR 9 clines would be limited to the extent that market participants ques- tioned the fed 's anti - inflation resolve ; absent subsequent data point- ing to further weakening in aggregate demand or surprisingly modest price pressures , concerns about inflation would mount , pushing up longer - term interest rates .
b SENT -- the path for alternative b is based on the assumption of no change in the federal funds rate for the rest of this year .
b SENT -- moreover , with short - term rates unchanged under alternative b , insti- tution - only money funds should be stable after large runoffs through the spring .

c PAR 11 an increase of this size , by itself , would be unlikely to have a substan- tial effect on spending or prices , but a small tightening could lend assurance that policy had firmed enough to keep the economy around its potential .
c PAR 11 although further tightening could prove to be necessary , the committee might judge that the case for a larger move is not yet estab- lished .
c PAR 11 as noted above , alternative c is about what is built into the structure of market interest rates , and neither interest nor exchange rates are likely to react very strongly to such an action .
c PAR 11 however , this would be the first move since the announcement in may that excess accommodation had been substantially removed and could be seen as mark- ing a return to the usual practice of reacting to incoming data with small changes in reserve conditions .
c PAR 11 markets could become somewhat more unsettled and volatile , especially if the rise in short - term rates were perceived as less than needed and therefore likely to be followed by another increase but of uncertain timing .

d SENT -- ( 12 ) the more forceful move of alternative d might be chosen if the committee viewed the economic situation as highly likely to require substantial additional monetary tightening , for example , of the scope embodied in the steep tilt to the yield curve over the next few years .
d SENT -- although these money growth rates are roughly the same as those projected for alternative d , the higher year - end level of rates assumed in the greenbook implies slower growth of money and income in the first half of 1995 than would alternative d . alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates alt .
