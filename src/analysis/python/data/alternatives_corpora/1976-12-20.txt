a PAR 11 further declines in market rates are likely to be generated , though such declines will be limited if incoming economic evidence continues to suggest a more vigorous economy and therefore leads market participants to believe that interest rates may soon rise .
a PAR 11 banks , in such circumstances , may seek to issue money market cd 's more aggressively -- particularly longer maturities -- in an effort to lock in favorable yields . and corporate and municipal borrowers may continue to accelerate marketings of new bond issues .
a SENT -- alternative " money market " proposals alternative a to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets , the committee seeks to achieve somewhat easier bank reserve and money market conditions

b PAR 6 summarized below are three sets of short - run specifi- cations for the monetary aggregates and the federal funds rate .
b PAR 6 more detailed data , including longer - run growth rates , are shown in the tables on pp .
b PAR 6 5a and 5b .
b PAR 6 c ranges for december - january m1 3 - 7 2½-6½ 2 - 6 m2
b PAR 6 9½-13½ 9 - 13
b PAR 6 8½-12½ federal funds rate 3¾-4½ 4¼-5
b PAR 6 4¾-5½ ( intermeeting period ) ( 7 ) alternative b assumes that prevailing money market conditions -- indexed by a federal funds rate around 4 - 5/8 per cent-- would be maintained between now and the next committee meeting .
b PAR 6 m1 in the december - january period would , in consequence , be expected to expand in a 2½-6½ per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 6 the mid - point of that growth range is close to the average rate of growth in m1 over the past six months -- a period when the rate of expansion in nominal gnp had slowed .
b PAR 6 a faster growth in m1 is expected to develop later in the winter in reflection of the pick - up in economic expansion that is currently projected by the staff .
b PAR 12 an easing of the money market would generate only slightly more growth in m1 and m2 over the december - january period than under alternative b . however , the lower level of market rates will , with a lag , tend to strengthen the demand for money further .
b PAR 12 thus , m1 growth over the longer - run would likely be higher than the mid - point of the committee 's one - year range .
b PAR 12 as a result , to contain growth within desired bounds interest rates under this alternative may have to rise to somewhat higher levels than under alternative b and the rise may begin sooner .

c PAR 13 a substantial upward re - adjustment of market rates would be likely to follow , since most market participants appear to have adjusted their current positions to expectations that the funds rate will either decline or remain about unchanged over the near - term .
c PAR 13 the 3-month bill rate , for example , might move up to the area of 5 - 5¼ per cent .
c PAR 13 after the initial reaction , however , further rate increases might be quite limited .
c PAR 13 some rate increases , particularly in longer- term markets , could be partly reversed as the funds rate tended to level off at the new higher level .
c PAR 13 the staff would expect that little further increase in the funds rate would , in practice , be required to achieve the fomc 's longer - run monetary growth rates .
