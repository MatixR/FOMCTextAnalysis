a PAR 15 the near - term easing of the money market encompassed by alternative a would , of course , lead to declines in interest rates over the next few weeks and higher growth rates in the monetary aggregates .
a PAR 15 most market participants would probably view the drop in the funds rate as temporary , and this would work to limit interest rate declines .
a PAR 15 in bond markets , for example , corporations would be likely to accelerate offerings of new issues .
a PAR 16 with monetary growth rates more rapid over the next few months than under the alternatives discussed above , alternative a would imply more restraint later in the year if growth in the aggregates is to be constrained within current longer - run ranges .
a PAR 16 a funds rate of around 6¾ per cent is expected by the end of 1977 under this alternative .

b PAR 6 ( more detailed short - run and longer - run data are shown in the tables on pp .
b PAR 6 5a and 5b ) .
b PAR 6 each of the alternatives is believed to be consistent with growth ranges for the monetary aggregates over the qiv ' 76-qiv ' 77 period adopted by the committee at its previous meeting .
b PAR 6 the differing patterns of federal funds rates and velocity implied by the three alternatives-- given the projected growth in nominal gnp -- are shown in appendices ii and iii , respectively .

b PAR 6 4¾-5½ ( intermeeting period ) ( 7 ) growth in m1 over the february - march period is expected to be in a 3 - 7 per cent annual rate range , assuming a federal funds rate centered in a 4¼-5 per cent range , as in alternative b . the rate of expansion that is anticipated for m1 reflects in part the retardation in economic activity caused by the recent cold snap and associated fuel shortage .
b PAR 8 m2 expansion under alternative b may be in a 7 - 11 per cent annual rate range over the february - march period .

b PAR 8 1976 qiii qiv to their reduced january pace , as banks remain less aggressive in offering time deposits over the next few weeks in light of moderate bank credit demands from business and other customers .
b PAR 8 also , the rise in yield on intermediate - term treasury obligations since the beginning of the year has made such securities somewhat more attractive to savers as compared with time certificates of deposit .
b PAR 8 ( 8) ( 9 ) ( 10 )
b PAR 9 m1 and m2 under alternative b may be expected to rise at annual rates of about 5½ and 10 per cent , respectively , in the first quarter .
b PAR 9 growth in these aggregates , especially m1 , is likely to strengthen in the second quarter , as a result of the temporary impact of tax rebates .
b PAR 9 m1 growth in the second quarter would be further augmented by increased money demands associated with the rapid expansion in nominal gnp projected for the spring as the fuel shortage subsides .
b PAR 10 a considerably slower growth in monetary aggregates would be required in the second half of 1977 than in the first half if growth over the year is to be around the mid - points of the longer - run ranges adopted at the previous committee meeting .
b PAR 10 growth in the aggregates would probably slow to some extent as a natural reaction to the sharp expansion in money that is likely to accompany rebate payments .
b PAR 10 to achieve the amount of slowing needed , however , it is very likely that short - term interest rates will have to rise as the year progresses , given the projected expansion in nominal gnp over the year .
b PAR 10 under alternative b , the staff would expect the federal funds rate to begin rising in the spring and reach around 6½ per cent by the fourth quarter of this year .
b PAR 11 interest rates are expected to show little net change over the next few weeks , though , given the specifications of alternative b . the treasury will probably raise $ 7 - 9 billion of new money between now and the next meeting through routine offerings of 2- and 4-year notes , additions to the weekly and monthly bill auctions , and cash management bills .
b PAR 11 much of this need has probably already been discounted by the market , but rates on treasury securities could rise a little in the process of distributing the issues .
b PAR 11 the municipal bond volume is expected to remain at around the advanced january pace over the weeks immediately ahead , but new issues of publicly offered corporate bonds seem to be moderating in reaction to the recent rise in bond yields .

b SENT -- thus , monetary policy would have to be more accommodative in the latter part of 1977 , and the federal funds rate would not be likely to rise as high as under alternative b .

c PAR 13 such a rise in the funds rate in the weeks immediately ahead has probably not been discounted by the market , and thus a fairly substantial upward adjustment in interest rates could be expected to ensue .
c PAR 13 the 3-month bill rate would probably rise to levels somewhat above 5 per cent .
c PAR 13 yields on intermediate- and longer - term issues would also increase , though probably by less than the rise in short rates , given increases that have already occurred in longer - term interest rates .
