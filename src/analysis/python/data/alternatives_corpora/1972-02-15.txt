b PAR 15 this language is proposed for possible use if the committee decides that the desk should place primary emphasis on bank reserves as the control variable , subject to a proviso constraining the range of fluctuations in money market conditions .
b PAR 15 under this alternative money market conditions would , of course , be expected to fluctuate more widely than under a , with the extent of fluctuation depending on the speci- fic interpretation the committee attached to the proviso clause .
b PAR 15 " to implement this policy , [ del : while taking account of inter- national developments and the forthcoming treasury financing , ] system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee [ del : seeks to promote the degree of ease in ]
b PAR 15 shall be con- ducted with a view to supplying bank reserves [ del : and money market ( i - greater ) conditions essential to ] at a rate consistent with ( ii - ample )
b PAR 15 ( iii- moderate ) growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead , provided that money market conditions do not fluctuate over an unduly wide range .
b PAR 16 if the committee were to adopt alternative b it could base reserve operating targets on the levels and growth rates for reserves shown earlier to be consistent with either patterns i , ii , or iii .
b PAR 16 the committee may also wish to allow , in operations , for the effects on reserve levels of unanticipated changes in u.s .
b PAR 16 government deposits , net interbank deposits , and perhaps large cd 's .
b PAR 16 the effect of anticipated changes in such deposits was discussed in paragraph ( 11 ) .
b PAR 17 for the proviso clause in alternative b , the committee may wish to consider a range of fluctuation for the federal funds rate as large as 2 percentage points , as recommended by the report of the committee on the directive .
b PAR 17 if the committee were to adopt as targets the aggregates of pattern ii , for example , this would mean widening the funds rate range from 3 - -4 per cent to 2 - 1/2 - -4 - 1/2 per cent .
b PAR 17 the range could , of course , be made more restrictive on either the up or down side , or both , depending on the extent to which the committee may wish to emphasize interest rates relative to aggregate objectives .
