3/23/93,c,"Alternative C, involving a rise in the federal funds rate to 3-1/2 percent, could be implemented through a boost in the initial borrowing allowance to $75 million. Under alternative C, M2 would expand at a 2 percent rate over the February-to- June period, as wider opportunity costs would discourage inflows to more liquid deposits, especially M1 balances.
M2 likely would not move above the level of its fourth-quarter base until June, and with slower spending growth later in the year, this aggregate probably would
increase only marginally over the year as a whole. M3 would expand at only a 3/4 percent rate from February to June. Conversely, the tightening of policy under alternative C, which also would come as a surprise to market participants, would induce a rise in short-term rates comparable to the hike in the federal funds rate. The increase in intermediate- and long-term rates would be lessened to the degree it were seen as a timely measure to hold inflation in check. To the extent that market participants saw dimmer prospects for economic activity, risk premiums incorporated in yields on private obligations would increase."
5/17/94,b,"Under alternative B. federal funds would continue to trade around 3-3/4 percent, in association with the allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing remaining initially at 175 million. The case for standing pat, alternative B, is a more extreme version of the rationale for alternative C: In this case, the market assessment, and even that of the staff, of the strength of aggregate demand would be judged to be seriously off the mark, perhaps because the rise in long-term rates, along with the decline in house- hold wealth, will have a more significant restraining influence on aggregate demand. Choice of alternative B would come as a consider- able surprise--and disappointment--to financial markets; very short- term interest rates would be likely to fall appreciably, but this alternative risks a significant sell-off in the bond market before weakness in aggregate demand becomes apparent."
7/5/94,d,"Alternative D would increase the federal funds rate 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 percent. Concerns that the recent behavior of the dollar and commodity prices might imply rising prices more broadly and might be associated with a ratcheting up of inflation expectations could moti- vate the Committee to select alternative D. The 50-basis-point hike in the funds rate would be seen by market participants as motivated importantly by a desire to bolster the dollar, which might well recover some of its recent losses, especially if the action were implemented through a hike in the discount rate. If the dollar did rebound and the action were seen as lowering the odds on a pickup of inflation, any increases in bond yields could be quite limited. On the other hand, such an action is not currently anticipated in the
market and could prompt increased uncertainty about the future path of interest rates, with adverse effects on bond and possibly stock markets. In any case, banks would be likely to match the increase in the federal funds rate with a similar hike in the prime rate."
11/15/94,d,"The Committee might wish to consider an even more substantial tightening of reserve market conditions--for example, on the order of 75 basis points. This step could be judged as more suited to the strength of the emerging threat that the economy may be overshoot- ing its potential, setting in motion a gradual self-reinforcing pro- cess of increasing inflation. Under these circumstances, a more decisive move toward restraint would be needed to avoid an upward ratcheting of inflation. Market sentiment has deteriorated during the hiatus in policy tightening, judging by the rise in bond yields and weakness in the exchange value of the dollar. By more clearly notch- ing up monetary policy to a firmer posture, a larger step might better assure market participants that the Federal Reserve was acting force- fully enough to head off future inflation and might forestall the perceived need on the part of the market participants for another tightening move this year. If so, the action could spur a near-term rally in bond markets and strengthen the dollar. Some increases in very short-term market interest rates would likely result, of course, from the somewhat larger-than-expected rise in the funds rate, and banks could immediately raise their prime rate by a comparable amount."
5/19/98,c,"The Committee instead may prefer to raise its intended federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the May meeting, as under alternative C. The Committee was concerned about the inflation outlook at its last meeting, and in some respects that outlook may have worsened. In particular, the unemployment rate may be seen as having now fallen so low that, even if it were to edge up a little, as it does with the slowing of real growth in the staff forecast, the risks of burgeoning inflationary pressures have become unacceptably high. Although the first-quarter ECI increase was less than expected, total compensation, its wage component, and average hourly earnings have all been on an accelerating trend for some time. With the unemployment rate likely to remain far below any plausible estimate of its sustainable level, nominal compensation gains may well continue to mount, in contrast to the staff forecast. If so, expansion of labor compensation would increasingly exceed even optimistic views of a step-up in productivity growth. Moreover, the slowdown in output growth in the staff forecast is by no means a foregone conclusion, absent a tighter monetary policy stance. The effects of Asian woes on net exports may not of themselves be a sufficient offset to buoyant domestic final demand at current levels of short-term interest rates. Although real interest rates are high relative to historical norms, medium- and long- term real rates still may not be elevated enough at present to exert adequate restraint on spending for consumer durables, housing, and business fixed investment in light of optimistic ""animal spirits"" and rising equity prices."
12/21/99,c,"As noted, considerations relating to the century date change would seem to militate against tightening at this meeting. Nonetheless, the Committee might wish to contemplate the 25 basis point tightening of policy at this meeting under alternative C-- perhaps as background for selection of an asymmetric directive or even for consideration of an intermeeting move once risks associated with the century date change have faded. In the staff forecast, core inflation picks up--and is poised to move higher beyond the projection horizon--even with 75 basis points of further tightening and the more rapid rates of productivity growth that the staff has built into the forecast over recent months. In effect, faster productivity growth, other things equal, needs to be reflected at some point in higher real interest rates to keep the influences of the associated boost to earnings--working on the demands for capital goods and, through wealth, on consumption--from driving aggregate demand further beyond aggregate supply. Still higher interest rates would be needed to bring the levels of demand and supply into balance so as to forestall rising inflation. Indeed, based on incoming spending data and the continued upward march of equity prices, the Committee may see the risks to aggregate demand as having shifted further to the upside over recent months, possibly requiring more restrictive financial conditions than assumed in the staff forecast just to keep the output gap from widening. A firming action at this meeting or in mid-January would be only a little prompter than in the staff forecast. But it is likely to be associated with a sharper rise in market interest rates as market participants inferred from the timing of the action that the Federal Reserve was much more concerned about near-term inflation risks than they had perceived and was on a steeper tightening path than now incorporated in the yield curve. As noted above, a tightening at this meeting would pose some risk of prompting financial market disruptions."
