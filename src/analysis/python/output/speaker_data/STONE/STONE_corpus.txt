 Regionally, the labor markets in the Third District have continued to tighten The unemployment rate this quarter for the three states represented in the District is estimated to be the lowest it has been in 19 years We'd be happy to borrow some employees from whatever Districts seem to have some available Businesses are reporting a shortage of labor across an increasing number of categories and that includes skilled and unskilled workers And we're starting to hear about shortages in the professional area, including engineers Prices and wages continue to increase at levels above the national average We also see some early signs for our regional outlook of more moderate growth in the near term, but not a level moderate enough to reduce substantially the pressures on both labor markets and prices  On the national scene, we feel the staff estimates are relatively reasonable We probably see more risks on the up side, particularly for inflation That concludes my report   I probably come out where Vice Chairman Corrigan comes out, somewhere between "B" and "C" But I certainly would be able to live with "B" with an asymmetric guideline I am very sensitive to the points that President Melzer brought up about how we're going to get out of this cycle of reacting to each of the numbers that comes out One of the ways to get out of that is to be ahead of that; and that's why I'd probably prefer to be between "B" and "C" But, for all the reasons stated, I think there is some reason to pause at this point and to be a bit more conservative So, I could support "B" with an asymmetric guideline    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Third District's economy is   continuing to grow, with accelerating employment growth and a declining unemployment   rate, which just brings us to about the national average  Recently we completed a series of   meetings with bankers and businesspeople throughout our District, and the message is the   same  They are all complaining about the difficulty of finding qualified workers    Manufacturing activity has continued to expand, based on our May business outlook survey,   which will not be publicly released until this Thursday  Although new orders and shipments   were not as strong as in the previous month, the levels reported in May remain solidly positive   and are not much different than earlier in the year   Retailers in our District reported moderate year-over-year gains in sales in March and   April and slightly lower gains than earlier in the year  Auto dealers continue to report rapid   sales, which they attribute to manufacturers’ incentives and higher consumer incomes    Residential housing activity has continued at quite a brisk pace overall even though some   builders are reporting a modest slowdown from the pace earlier this year  Bankers, however,   are expecting a slowdown in housing activity during the next six months  Nonresidential   construction is not as strong as it was a year ago, although it picked up somewhat in   Pennsylvania and Delaware in the first part of this year  Central Pennsylvania, for instance,   has had a significant increase in construction of materials handling and distribution facilities    Real estate contacts are still quite optimistic that nonresidential construction will remain fairly   strong   Turning to wages and prices in the District, many businesses report paying higher   wages because of the tight labor markets  The frequency of such reports has been rising over   time  Businesses also report paying higher import prices  Retailers are talking more about      50  cost pressures and a desire to raise prices than they were last year  And our business outlook   survey this month is again recording a very high index of prices paid by manufacturers  That   survey’s index of prices received by manufacturers, however, is noticeably lower this month   than it was in April, suggesting that our region’s manufacturers are still having difficulty   charging higher prices to their customers   In general, recent business sentiment is not as optimistic about the outlook as it was   a few months ago  Even though we continue to hear impressive anecdotal stories about   farmers and businesses coming up with innovative ideas to improve productivity, business   people now sound more cautious  They don't expect as much economic growth six months   from now and they are also expressing more concern about rising inflation   Turning to the national scene, aggregate demand is still growing faster than supply   despite impressive year-to-year gains in productivity  Consumer spending in particular has   shown little sign of slowing to a more sustainable pace  Although our staff’s outlook is not as   pessimistic as the Greenbook in terms of its inflation projections, we agree that it is unlikely   that demand will slow sufficiently to forestall further increases in inflationary pressures   without additional Committee action   Now, how much the Committee will ultimately need to move will depend on   whether or not we feel we are behind the curve  In that regard, I take some comfort from the   fact that so far there has been little upward movement in survey measures of long-term   expected inflation  Although expectations of inflation over the next year have generally risen   in recent months, expectations of longer-run inflation have not  For instance, our Reserve   Bank’s most recent survey of professional forecasters, which will be publicly released next   Monday, shows that the median of expected consumer price inflation over the next ten years      51  remained at 2-1/2 percent  That’s the same reading as in the first quarter and in fact about the   same reading as those over the past two years  Similarly, the Michigan survey’s measure of   expected inflation over the next five to ten years remains unchanged this past month at 28   percent  And Michigan's measure of expected long-run inflation has not changed a great deal   during the past year or so  The stability of these measures of long-run expected inflation   suggests that people expect the FOMC to keep inflation under control over the long run,   which leads me to conclude that we still have the opportunity to take action to prevent recent   higher monthly inflation numbers from becoming embedded in expectations  Thank you, Mr   Chairman      Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  I   think a larger action by the Committee today will forestall any rise in longer-term      94  expectations of inflation  And in my view, not moving the funds rate up 50 basis points   probably would lead to long-term expectations of some increase in inflation
