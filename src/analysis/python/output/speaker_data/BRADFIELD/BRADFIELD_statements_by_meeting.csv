1902,1981-08-18, Plus VISA would place the resulting investments back with the originating bank-- 
2113,1982-07-15," Mr Chairman, there has only been one issued and that was to the Wright Patman Credit Union There haven't been any issued in addition to that "
2130,1982-08-24," The arrangement that has now been worked out between the Bank of Mexico and the BIS as far as a direct assignment by debtors, that is to say oil companies, is that Exxon and other oil companies in the G-10 countries [will assign] to the BIS an amount in excess of what would now be $1825 million of the total amount of the credit extended The assignment would be substantially in excess of that amount, somewhere around $25 billion in total   These are future oil deliveries The assignments would be made now and would begin to flow into the BIS sometime, maturing one year from now    8/24/82   No, the arrangements will clearly provide that they would have to assign oil that has not been previously assigned It would be oil revenues under contracts that exist now and that would be free from other encumbrances   The BIS is our agent for the collection of these revenues   I would agree with the Chairman that the latter problem is the more serious one There are problems with the technical aspects of the assignment, but I would like you to understand that the assignment is an assignment of revenues by companies that operate outside of Mexico So, there would be no way that those companies could get out of the assignment, theoretically   But I assume that Mexico has to deliver the oil; they have to sell oil   We are trying Mr Patrikis [of the New York Federal Reserve Bank] is in Mexico City, and one of the things we have asked him to do is to collect all of the appendices and agreements for assignment    8/24/82 "
2218,1982-12-20," Yes,   They   They haven't worked that out exactly   Yes   The Exchange Stabilization Fund could They could   It is the   It's not the assignments of payments that are coming due, so it's not related to the present crisis   And it's oversecured; it's about $2-1/2 billion for a $18 billion credit   This is a question of our having a superior position to the banks?   The only case that I know of at this point was the challenge raised by Citibank to the Export Import Bank's preferential position in connection with the loan to Zaire And that never went to a judgment   That's the same issue that was raised in that case and there has never been a clear adjudication of that We have designed the arrangements to be consistent with the negative pledge clause   Well, no We've designed them so that they are--   They've all been very broadly drawn Some of them say ""any arrangements designed to provide preference,"" and that  -67-    12/20-21/82  is so broadly phrased it is very hard to find complete avoidance techniques with respect to negative pledge clauses But the Mexican arrangement is designed to provide a deposit with the BIS and the right of set-off And the right of set-off has consistently been held not to violate negative pledge clauses Every agreement that we've seen that has a negative pledge clause also has a set-off provision And this set-off provision, for example, under New York law, is very broad, which is what we intended to use So, essentially we're taking advantage of a method that allows for deposits to build up, which is  with the right of set-off in case the debtor doesn't pay his obligations And the right of set-off has been known to be consistent with negative pledge clauses   The agreements by the various countries had their IMF deposits and were not creating any security interest in those IMF obligations or IMF drawings So there's no inconsistency there with existing agreements either The promise of Mexico to pay us out of the first IMF drawings is similarly not a violation of negative pledge clauses   With the BIS, that's right   No This would be the placing of a deposit, and it is within the jurisdiction of the Board to approve the actions by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and [unintelligible] with that similar situation with respect to The New York Bank can enter into an obligation from the BIS That would also be an action that the Federal Reserve--   Yes   That is correct The Board would have to make the agreement now with the BIS to undertake the two obligations to place the deposits with the BIS in the event that it had liquidity problems arising from the fact that Argentina couldn't pay   That's correct   That would [involve] working out the repayment of the deposits If the BIS, after a period of, say, two years, were unable to be repaid by the Argentines, then we would in effect take over the claims against Argentina in repayment of the deposits That would be the backup   What we would be doing is buying a participation in the BIS's claim against Argentina The reason we're doing that is to maintain the BIS's right to set-off against whatever assets they might have with Argentina "
2448,1983-11-14," The staff is still working on it; there hasn't been any definitive clarification In fact, the Comptroller's staff and our staff are meeting today to discuss it further   From the data that are coming in so far, it doesn't look like a serious problem There are individual banks that have problems I don't think it is more widespread than we thought earlier "
3026,1986-08-19," Basically, that's correct We still have the process of getting final comments, but it's basically agreed   I think they still allowed the 3-year transition if they continue to do anything and then a phase out of 5 years instead of the unlimited time for the Baker countries and 10 years for the non-Baker countries They have put it at 5 years for all countries; they have expanded the list of countries eligible for the first grace period, and there is a phase-out period for 15 to 34 countries So there shouldn't be any immediate impact on the willingness to lend overseas in these kinds of arrangements--at least for three years, and perhaps for as much as 5 years   Five years, but it's phased out at 20 percent a year after that, so it's 80 percent after the [fifth] year and so on "
3505,1988-10-17," It should be clear that these are very secure loans from the point of view of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve There's almost no risk The loans would be disbursed only when there are appropriate assurances from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that their disbursements, to which we are bridging, would be forthcoming within the period of maturity of the bridge As    10/17/88  to the part of the loan which is a bridge to Mexican reserves, there would be in effect a tying up of those reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as security for the bridge loan So there would be absolutely no risk with respect to that part, which is bridging to Mexican reserves So this is a very strong bridge and very little in the way of true financing for Mexico The major effect of it is our expression of support that's contained in the statement   In terms of repayment, I think the US altogether has participated in approximately 15 bridge loans and every one of them has been repaid   No, I was just addressing that specific aspect of it I assumed that you were addressing the economic policy "
