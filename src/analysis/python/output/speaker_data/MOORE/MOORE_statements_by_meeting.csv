5289,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At a recent large family dinner, my daughter   made the remark that it was a pleasure to get to sit at the adult table even if it was only one time    Sitting here today, I can relate to her comment!  [Laughter]  The Twelfth District’s already solid   expansion has gained additional momentum recently  Amid signs of increased manufacturing   activity in general, the resurgence in the IT sector is especially good news for our District  Sales of   most technology products are up substantially from last year, and District IT exports have grown   May 4, 2004 49 of 112       quickly of late, with much of the increase going to Asia  According to one California contact, this   development can be summarized in a single word—a word that you’ve heard frequently this   morning already—China  Conditions have even stabilized in the struggling aircraft sector    Although Boeing’s production activity is well below the company’s 1999 peak, the recent pace of   deliveries and existing order backlogs suggest that the company will produce about the same   number of planes this year as last year  Other sectors are showing strength as well  For example,   some District markets for new and used homes saw a flurry of activity recently  Homeowners in   parts of the San Francisco Bay area faced very weak demand for a sustained period following the IT   bust, but now they, too, are seeing double-digit price appreciation and record sales   Households throughout the District have kept their wallets open more generally, with strong   consumer spending reflected in growing sales tax revenues  The vigor of overall activity has   translated into significant job gains in most of the District, though California’s recent labor market   performance has been a disappointment  The state has taken steps to deal with one source of high   labor costs by reforming its workers’ compensation system  California employers face workers’   comp costs that are more than three times the average for the rest of the nation  With the passage of   two major bills since last summer, reform is well under way  The second of these bills, in   particular, should lead to some short-term rate relief and to larger gains over time   Progress has been made on the state budget as well  California is on track to issue about   $12 billion worth of deficit finance bonds  The first issuance, totaling almost $8 billion is scheduled   for this week and will consist mostly of fixed rate bonds  The second issuance is expected to be   $4 billion and is scheduled for late May or early June  To attract an additional set of buyers, it will   focus on bonds with variable rates  Because these bonds are backed by a ¼ cent diversion of the   state sales tax, major rating agencies recently assigned grades to the first issuance that are several   May 4, 2004 50 of 112       levels higher than those currently assigned to the state’s general obligation debt  More generally, a   somewhat improved revenue outlook, combined with an emerging spirit of compromise reflected in   legislative and public attitudes, bodes well for the state’s ability to eliminate its sizable structural   shortfall in future years   Turning quickly to the national economy, our views about the contours of the forecast for   economic activity don’t differ in any major way from the Greenbook  However, we are assuming a   steeper trajectory for the funds rate through the end of next year  Recent employment data certainly   increase the odds that the labor market is turning the corner, which would solidify the robust   expansion in train  Still, it’s our view that the evidence on jobs is a bit too tentative to be   completely convincing quite yet   The inflation data are a little worrisome  It’s hard to tell if the data reflect transitory   movements following unusually low rates last year or a moderately higher underlying inflation   trend  We take some consolation in knowing that at least part of the recent increase in inflation is   due to one-time effects from oil prices and the dollar  And the fact that there appears to be some   slack left in the economy suggests that containment of underlying inflation is the most likely   outcome  That said, uncertainty about skill-matching issues raises some question about the exact   amount of slack in the labor market  Another ongoing concern is that longer-term inflation   expectations remain at relatively high levels  Overall, we’ve raised our forecast for core PCE   inflation to 1½ percent for this year and expect it to edge back down to an underlying rate of about   1¼ percent for 2005  We see the risks to this forecast as fairly evenly balanced  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
