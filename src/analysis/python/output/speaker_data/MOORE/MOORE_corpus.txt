  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At a recent large family dinner, my daughter   made the remark that it was a pleasure to get to sit at the adult table even if it was only one time    Sitting here today, I can relate to her comment!  [Laughter]  The Twelfth District’s already solid   expansion has gained additional momentum recently  Amid signs of increased manufacturing   activity in general, the resurgence in the IT sector is especially good news for our District  Sales of   most technology products are up substantially from last year, and District IT exports have grown   May 4, 2004 49 of 112       quickly of late, with much of the increase going to Asia  According to one California contact, this   development can be summarized in a single word—a word that you’ve heard frequently this   morning already—China  Conditions have even stabilized in the struggling aircraft sector    Although Boeing’s production activity is well below the company’s 1999 peak, the recent pace of   deliveries and existing order backlogs suggest that the company will produce about the same   number of planes this year as last year  Other sectors are showing strength as well  For example,   some District markets for new and used homes saw a flurry of activity recently  Homeowners in   parts of the San Francisco Bay area faced very weak demand for a sustained period following the IT   bust, but now they, too, are seeing double-digit price appreciation and record sales   Households throughout the District have kept their wallets open more generally, with strong   consumer spending reflected in growing sales tax revenues  The vigor of overall activity has   translated into significant job gains in most of the District, though California’s recent labor market   performance has been a disappointment  The state has taken steps to deal with one source of high   labor costs by reforming its workers’ compensation system  California employers face workers’   comp costs that are more than three times the average for the rest of the nation  With the passage of   two major bills since last summer, reform is well under way  The second of these bills, in   particular, should lead to some short-term rate relief and to larger gains over time   Progress has been made on the state budget as well  California is on track to issue about   $12 billion worth of deficit finance bonds  The first issuance, totaling almost $8 billion is scheduled   for this week and will consist mostly of fixed rate bonds  The second issuance is expected to be   $4 billion and is scheduled for late May or early June  To attract an additional set of buyers, it will   focus on bonds with variable rates  Because these bonds are backed by a ¼ cent diversion of the   state sales tax, major rating agencies recently assigned grades to the first issuance that are several   May 4, 2004 50 of 112       levels higher than those currently assigned to the state’s general obligation debt  More generally, a   somewhat improved revenue outlook, combined with an emerging spirit of compromise reflected in   legislative and public attitudes, bodes well for the state’s ability to eliminate its sizable structural   shortfall in future years   Turning quickly to the national economy, our views about the contours of the forecast for   economic activity don’t differ in any major way from the Greenbook  However, we are assuming a   steeper trajectory for the funds rate through the end of next year  Recent employment data certainly   increase the odds that the labor market is turning the corner, which would solidify the robust   expansion in train  Still, it’s our view that the evidence on jobs is a bit too tentative to be   completely convincing quite yet   The inflation data are a little worrisome  It’s hard to tell if the data reflect transitory   movements following unusually low rates last year or a moderately higher underlying inflation   trend  We take some consolation in knowing that at least part of the recent increase in inflation is   due to one-time effects from oil prices and the dollar  And the fact that there appears to be some   slack left in the economy suggests that containment of underlying inflation is the most likely   outcome  That said, uncertainty about skill-matching issues raises some question about the exact   amount of slack in the labor market  Another ongoing concern is that longer-term inflation   expectations remain at relatively high levels  Overall, we’ve raised our forecast for core PCE   inflation to 1½ percent for this year and expect it to edge back down to an underlying rate of about   1¼ percent for 2005  We see the risks to this forecast as fairly evenly balanced  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  We had a Board meeting yesterday, and during   the discussion, one of our Directors was talking about the use of temporary employees  He turned   to me and asked if I knew the ratio of permanent status employees to temporary employees in the   Federal Reserve  I told him I didn’t know the answer for the System as a whole, but I did for the   FOMC, and the ratio is 17 to 1  And as that one temp on the FOMC at this moment, I will limit my   comments to the specific questions that have been posed   October 15, 2010 36 of 62             First, regarding the description of our objectives for monetary policy as they relate to price   stability, I see benefits to going with option 2, the explicit numerical inflation objective  I regularly   hear from our directors and other business contacts about all of the uncertainty they face, especially   stemming from the government sector, in which they tend to include us  So it seems to me that, at   the margin, one thing we could do to help matters a bit is to add more clarity, especially if it could   help dispel fears about deflation  I’d be inclined to do this in as clear and straightforward a manner   as possible, with the Committee ideally arriving at and communicating a single number rather than a   range   Communicating the Committee’s views on what constitutes maximum employment seems   to me to be a far more challenging question, because this number changes over time and because   there’s such a wide divergence in views  Although FOMC participants seem to be in some rough   agreement about their unemployment rate forecasts five to six years from now, there’s much less   agreement about the current full employment benchmark  This communication, therefore, may be   best left to the description of the projections  However, at this juncture, we also think it’s important   not to give the appearance of giving less weight to our employment objective   Turning to the second question, I think the LSAPs have done their job at getting borrowing   rates down, and I would favor additional purchases if needed  I’m also open to other policy tools as   well, especially clear communication of the conditions under which the Committee will raise rates,   which can complement and reinforce our other policy actions   On the subject of communication, I would make one observation that hasn’t been brought   up today, and that is that I think it would also be desirable to be explicit to the Congress about the   possibility of losses at some point in the future  The implication of a bigger balance sheet with a   longer duration may not be well understood by the Congress and the broader public and may be the   October 15, 2010 37 of 62             source of reputational risk for the System if we are successful enough with our policy moves to   require a fairly quick exit down the road  It seems to me that the most favorable time to get this   point across is when our policies are yielding substantial earnings for the Treasury rather than when   the opposite could occur   The answer to the third question of how to adjust the level of LSAPs is less clear in my   mind  It appears that it is the stock of these assets that affects rates and, thereby, the economy  So it   makes sense to me that in our first communication we would announce the maximum amount of the   stock that we are highly confident we will need to add, and then we would make it clear that,   beyond that, we will be adjusting depending on how events unfold  So I guess I fall into the “large   and discrete” camp for the first adjustment, but I’m more open to how we would handle subsequent   adjustments if they are needed   Overall, I thought the draft statements presented a good set of alternatives  If we think the   initial announcement amount is probably not going to do the trick entirely, I would recommend   language that conveys the likely direction of future policy moves  This is accomplished in the   second and fourth alternatives in paragraph 5 of draft statement number 1, where it says, “The   Committee is prepared to expand its security holdings as necessary”   And, finally, it would be helpful to have a special description of the Committee’s discussion   and agreement on a numerical inflation objective in the minutes  Thank you     Be patient, Mr Chairman  Be patient  [Laughter]     We’ll defer that until later, then     Thank you, Mr Chairman  When the staff was briefing me late last week   for this meeting, they mentioned to me that it might be appropriate to say something about the   World Series, or, if not, to do something related to Halloween  Thank goodness the Giants gave   me some good results to work with, because I’m not sure how well my Lady Gaga costume   would have gone over with this particular crowd  [Laughter]  I’ll say something about the Giants   in a while  By the way, I asked our research director if everything goes into the transcript, and   he told me that certain things could be redacted, if necessary  [Laughter]   The evidence from our contacts in the Twelfth District is consistent with a weak   recovery  The District has been struggling to climb out of a very deep hole, and the pace of   expansion has been disappointingly slow  Following modest gains during the first half of the   year, private payrolls contracted in the third quarter  Our retail sector contacts report   disappointing back-to-school numbers  Households in the Twelfth District are burdened with   poor balance sheets, caused in part by the decline in home values, which have fallen as much as   40 to 60 percent in the hardest-hit areas  The technology sector has been one of the few bright   spots  District IT manufacturing and service firms have been creating jobs at a healthy clip in   response to sustained demand growth  But even this sector has shown signs of slowing recently    Our contacts in this sector expect further slowing over the balance of the year, as the hardware   industry’s inventory replacement phase comes to an end   My views on the national outlook are generally similar to those of the Tealbook  I expect   a gradual recovery held back by households working to repair balance sheets badly weakened by   November 2–3, 2010 70 of 238             equity and housing losses and the slow normalization of financial intermediation  Still, monetary   stimulus and improvements in banking and financial market conditions should push economic   growth somewhat above its potential rate in the next few years and slowly bring unemployment   down  Nonetheless, I am struck by the fact that, in the Tealbook forecast, even with an   additional $600 billion of Treasury purchases, we won’t get back to full employment until 2015   Although my point forecast is for steady improvement in the economy, I admit that the   subpar economic growth during the past two quarters has shaken my confidence  One source of   greater uncertainty going forward is the degree to which the banking sector will suffer further   damage from past mortgage securitization activities  While lax processes around foreclosures   pose some risk, even more concerning is the growing trend of put-backs of poorly performing   portfolios from investors to banks  Although recent declines in the stock market value of some   of the large banks most affected by these problems suggest that the market sees the risks as   manageable, some worst-case estimates present substantial problems for these institutions, which   could damage financial conditions and set back the recovery   Turning to inflation, I expect significant slack in labor and goods markets to keep PCE   price inflation around 1 percent for the next few years, but well-anchored inflation expectations   should help avoid significant further disinflation  Of course, if the economy can’t shift into a   little higher gear than the 2 percent growth we’ve been seeing, I worry that further disinflation   could lie ahead   I close with one reason to be optimistic  The San Francisco research team has studied   what happens to the US economy based on which franchise wins the World Series  The results   are rather startling  The average growth in real GDP has been 102 percent in the year following   each World Series won by the Giants  [Laughter]  The staff tells me that the relationship is   November 2–3, 2010 71 of 238             statistically significant, and they point out that the slowest growth in the year following a Giants   win was still a robust 6 percent  Now, not knowing for certain how the Series would turn out   when presented with these data last week, I asked the staff what the effects of a Rangers win   would be  I was told there was—how do I put this?—insufficient data—[laughter]—to conduct   such an analysis  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  I see two compelling   reasons for resuming purchases of long-term securities at this point  First, we are currently   falling well short on both of our mandates, and just as importantly, we’ve made no progress for   more than one-half year now  Moreover, even if we achieve the consensus forecast for economic   growth in the upcoming periods, progress towards achieving our mandates will be painfully   slow  As shown in the Tealbook simulations, additional monetary stimulus in the form of asset   purchases will help us reach our goals sooner  Second, I see a strong argument for taking out   insurance against downside risks  For example, at our current levels of unemployment and   inflation, further negative shocks to the economy would be very costly  Even in the absence of   such shocks, there is a small but dangerous possibility that the slow trend of disinflation will   continue, and we will slip closer to a Japanese-style period of stagnation  After all, deflation in   Japan developed only after many years of grinding disinflation  I do recognize that further asset   purchases carry some risks, but I believe that the benefits of this action, both in terms of meeting   our mandate and of managing risks, outweigh those concerns  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  After my unscripted reference to pop culture   at the November meeting, my research director coached me on the importance of staying on   message  [Laughter]  I assured him I would do so, but I might have forgotten to disclose that I’d   be adjusting the messages accordingly   For the Twelfth District, the economic news is mostly the same  The high-tech sector,   which was hit very hard during the recession, continues to rebound  Profits at major tech   companies have improved, and one global online retailer is dramatically increasing its office   space in the Seattle area  The San Francisco Fed Tech Pulse Index rose 1 percent in November,   down from the 1½ percent average monthly increases seen earlier in the year  Homebuilders in   the West remain very downbeat  One business contact said recently the word that best describes   the homebuilding industry is “miserable,” and, unlike the tech sector, no signs of pent-up   demand have surfaced  One change is that retailers seem to be in a better mood  Our contacts   tell us that sales were good around Black Friday and thereafter, but they also note that retailers   were much more aggressive in discounting this year, and, of course, they were open for   considerably more hours over the Thanksgiving weekend  So, comparisons with last year may   exaggerate the underlying trend just a bit   December 14, 2010 48 of 127             Turning to the national economy, the incoming data have been favorable  At the time of   our last meeting, I was starting to worry that the economy might slow to stall speed, but I’ve   been somewhat reassured by the recent spending data, which show growth in the second half of   2010 to be at or perhaps even a bit above trend  In addition, consumer confidence appears to be   improving as seen in the latest reading from the Michigan survey, which puts us about back   where we were in the spring prior to the soft patch  What’s more, the recently announced fiscal   package, assuming it becomes law, should provide a healthy boost to household spending next   year   The fiscal situation reminds me of a new piece of apparel that a national clothing retailer   told us about recently  Over the past few years, a huge market has developed for a product called   Spanx—there’s an “x” at the end, not a “k-s”—which are body shaping undergarments for   women  This year the product line has been expanded to include men’s Spanx, a tight-fitting   undershirt that can slim down almost any male figure [laughter]—present company excepted, I   suspect  Where am I going with this anecdote?  Well, as I observe reaction to the Deficit   Commission’s proposal, I can’t help but feel that our country will resort to fiscal Spanx rather   than a good, old-fashioned diet in addressing our long-term fiscal deficit   The recent positive news on the economy has been largely offset by the significant   tightening of financial conditions over the past month, particularly a jump in real longer-term   interest rates  Overall my views on the outlook for growth and employment have not changed   very much and remain reasonably close to those in the Tealbook  I expect growth to pick up to   nearly 4 percent next year and a bit above that in 2012, as uncertainty recedes and confidence   improves  But I don’t think we’ll see a surge in spending or hiring any time soon  A recurring   theme from our directors has been that no business wants to overcommit at this time  One even   December 14, 2010 49 of 127             commented that the near-death experience we recently went through is likely to overshadow any   expansionary desires for a very long time  I think the expansion is more likely to play out   gradually, with sustained growth in household spending slowly chipping away at the reluctance   of businesses to invest and hire  Like the Tealbook, I do not anticipate reaching full employment   until the middle of this decade  One worrying development in the past month or so has been the   escalation of the fiscal crisis in Europe  Although spillovers to the US economy should be   negligible, there is a risk that the crisis could intensify and spread, with more significant   consequences for the US economy as discussed in the Tealbook simulations   Although I’ve been heartened by recent data on economic activity, the very low readings   on inflation continue to be worrisome  No matter how you slice the data, whether CPI or PCE,   total, core, median, or trimmed mean, inflation is on a clear downward trend, and measures of   underlying inflation are running below 1 percent  Many of our business contacts report rising   prices of materials and imported products, especially from China, which could potentially push   up inflation here, but the economic climate does not appear to support much pass-through of   these cost increases  The prevailing thought from our contacts seem to be that these cost   increases will just put more pressure on margins for suppliers and retailers rather than lead to   higher consumer prices   Of course, the bigger problem is that we still have significant slack in labor and goods   markets, putting more downward pressure on wage and price inflation  Indeed, over the past   year, unit labor costs fell 1 percent on top of a 2 percent decline over the previous four quarters,   and I certainly know of at least one sector in the economy that will have zero wage growth next   year  Given the importance of labor costs for businesses, this downward momentum should   offset any upward pressure from commodity and import prices   December 14, 2010 50 of 127             Finally, longer-term inflation expectations remain relatively stable  Taking all of these   factors together, our inflation forecast is similar to that of the Tealbook, with core PCE price   inflation bottoming out around its current level, slightly below 1 percent, but, given the persistent   slack in the economy, the risk of further disinflation down the road remains very real  Thank   you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be very brief  I, too, favor alternative B    I recognize that our eventual withdrawal of accommodation will, indeed, be challenging, but it   seems to me that the fundamental fact for policy at this time remains that we’re likely to continue   to fall short on both of our mandates, not just for a short period of time, but for the next several   years  Our announced asset purchase program is by no means a magic bullet, but it provides a   December 14, 2010 94 of 127             nudge, if not a push, in the right direction and will provide some insurance against downside risk   to the economy and inflation  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the 12th District, holiday sales for retailers   generally exceeded expectations  My contacts also noted a shift in spending away from generic   products towards more luxury items  My staff has discouraged me from describing these luxury   items in any detail after my comments on Spanx at our last meeting [laughter], so I won’t do that,   but I will say that this shift towards these luxury items suggests a more secure, less cautious   consumer   The outlook is gloomier for state and local government spending  In California, total   general fund spending has been cut by almost 20 percent over the past three years, and further   cuts are on the way as the state struggles to balance revenues and spending  Among other   effects, these cuts have squeezed public resources directed to nonprofit organizations  Our   contacts in these organizations have stated that this is leading to widespread consolidations in an   attempt to salvage some semblance of services   Turning to the national economy, recent data have generally been quite favorable    Consumer spending and auto sales have picked up, business investment is rising, and exports are   making a solid contribution to growth  A downside risk to the outlook is the housing market,   which the Tealbook describes as “moribund”  One definition of moribund is “at the point of   death”  That might overstate the situation a bit [laughter], but it is certainly hard to detect much   of a pulse in construction  With 20 percent of current mortgages underwater and house prices   still falling, there is no prospect of an imminent residential resurrection  Continued house price   declines could also lead to additional defaults and foreclosures, putting further pressures on bank   balance sheets and credit availability   Still, the predominance of good news since our last meeting has led to a sizable upward   revision to last quarter’s real GDP growth  The greater momentum has also boosted our GDP   January 25–26, 2011 113 of 282              growth forecast to 4 percent this year and 4½ percent next year  However, fast growth for a   couple of years is not enough, as unemployment is projected to remain stubbornly high    Analysis by my staff that was detailed in the FRB San Francisco background paper described   yesterday suggests that the bulk of the increase in unemployment reflects weak labor demand   and not a rise in structural unemployment  In the special Systemwide survey on hiring plans, the   number one factor restraining hiring was low expected sales growth  Currently we put the   effective natural rate of unemployment somewhere around 6¼ percent, but almost all of the   recent increase in the natural rate should be unwound over the next few years   A key indication of the significant slack in labor and goods markets is the downward   pressure on wages and prices  Importantly, the weak demand for labor is evident in last year’s   widely dispersed slowdown in wage growth  Going forward, the downward pressure on prices   from slack is offset by anchored inflation expectations and higher commodity prices   As noted in the Tealbook, higher commodity prices seem to be driven by greater demand   and by supply shortfalls, not speculation  In particular, after examining high-frequency data, our   staff found no evidence that commodity prices jumped right after our announcements of large-  scale asset purchases and monetary accommodation that have taken place since early 2009  Of   course, only a small portion of the surge in commodity prices will pass through to core inflation    On balance, we expect core PCE inflation to remain at or a bit less than 1 percent both this year   and next   Before wrapping up, let me say that, in light of yesterday’s discussion on structural   unemployment, I’m now seeing the ongoing search process for a new 12th District president in a   different light  [Laughter]  For example, I’m no longer taking it so personally when people use   the terms “mismatch” and the “12th District president situation” in the same sentence  In   January 25–26, 2011 114 of 282              addition, I realize I need to have a chat with our search committee about the concept of low   recruiting intensity  [Laughter]  In any case, I’m hoping, as I’m sure you are, that if the ongoing   nature of the opening is the result of a structural problem, it’s the type that will dissipate soon     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  A few minutes ago,   President Evans used an analogy involving “da Bears,” but as a non-Chicagoan I wasn’t really   fooled a bit by the Bears’ regular season success  [Laughter]  To me, it was clearly noise and not   signal, as it relates to the playoffs  Then, a few days ago, President Fisher compared monetary   policy with playing a higher level, multidimensional chess game  I was never much of a chess   player—even at two dimensions, I couldn’t figure it out  So I thought about what analogy I   might use, and I recognize that I do have a fondness for Formula 1 racing, which I learned the   other night I have in common with President Lacker  So that is where I’ll go today   January 25–26, 2011 173 of 282              The financial crisis was like an in-race accident, and our race car had to undergo major   repairs  Now we are back in the race, but facing a large gap that developed with the lead cars—a   gap which I will equate to the resource slack in our economy  I expect very fast GDP growth   this year with the economy running on all cylinders  But it is important not to confuse fast   growth with full or near-full employment  Just because you are running faster laps than the   leaders doesn’t mean you are going to catch them soon when you are running from as far back as   we are  Even with fast growth, it’s going to be a long trip to full employment  And this   distinction between growth and levels seems crucial to me for our policy communications    Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t have much specific to offer here  I   would just make the observation that I think the Federal Reserve System is perceived as being   very cozy with the financial sector, and very distant from the general public  And, in that   context, I think anything we can do to suggest less coziness with the former and closer proximity   to the latter, would serve us well  Thank you   January 25–26, 2011 210 of 282
