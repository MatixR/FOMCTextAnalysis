9,1976-03-29,"  There’s more to that question, Governor, of future releases of  information, which do not lag as much as these do, because we’ve had several--three monthly,  six monthly--reports  But as far as these facts are concerned, in the case--     No member of the Committee has mentioned that, sir, for many months     3/29/76 - 11 -      No, I think that’s true     I don’t think many people in the market are paying much attention to  RPD     Now, maybe in some academic circles they are, but I would say not very  much     Mr Chairman, could I point out, too, that in our [unintelligible] directive  the Committee regularly calls attention to reserve availability without specifying RPD, and I see  no particular harm, Governor Holland, in dropping RPDs but saying that we’re continuing to pay  attention to various measures of reserve availability without opting for a particular one at this  point     RPD certainly is nothing [unintelligible]     Mr Chairman, we’ve done a great deal of that work going back through  last June up through the end of March  All of this, of course, suffers from one big defect, and  that is, if you’re not operating on a nonborrowed reserve target, as soon as you get away from the  base [period] you know your numbers become less and less meaningful  I think maybe we can  report on the first two [unintelligible] after a Committee meeting  That would be more  significant  We’ve done all this other work, and I must say it’s not very good     No, but it does suffer from a fundamental defect, which is that we’re not  operating on a nonborrowed reserve target and so therefore we may be [seeing] results that are  peculiar in terms of nonborrowed reserves     Presumably, although that still can’t be decided, this is the presumption  that the Subcommittee on the Directive made     Well, Governor Coldwell, let me make that simply a very concrete  observation  And I want Peter to make sure that I say this correctly  As of last Friday, we had  M1 and M2 right in the middle of the Committee’s two-month target  And if we had had a  nonborrowed reserves target, and if we had constructed a [reserves] path correctly--I had many  problems in making sure that we’ve constructed a proper path--we would have been called upon  to tighten the money market, let the funds rate go up  Now is that really what the Committee  wants?  What I thought the Committee was really interested in is the aggregates, admitting that  we can’t judge where we really are     Because we would have been well outside our nonborrowed reserves path  as best we know how to draw it    Do I have it right?     Actually we have been doing that for many months in the report--     --but not at the Committee meetings     Oh, yes  "
34,1976-04-20,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]       I’m not sure about that one  This is something we have under study right  at the minute  I’m not quite sure of all the measures they have taken  It seems to me that it can  work both ways  You know, reserve currencies can be hit with big withdrawals as well as big  gains  And so I’m not sure whether, over the long run, it has any great implications for the yen- dollar relationship, but I’m certainly not clear on that at the moment     Yes, we would be covered in the swap drawing     Gladly, Mr Chairman  First, in our cable to the Italians renewing the  swap for three months, we made it quite clear that we have every expectation that that would be  paid at the end of that three-month period  Secondly, we reiterated our understanding that they  had pledged borrowings either under the EC oil facility or the IMF to repay the swap  Now this  is what we said formally in a wire     In addition, we are watching their reserve position very closely  We know at the moment  where they stand, what they have available still from the EC oil facility, which they should be  getting later this month, and their [position with] the IMF  And while we haven’t established a  firm trigger point, I think we’re going to have to watch very carefully, and as soon as reserves  come down, we’re going to have to insist, if they continue to come down, that they repay the  swap  But [that would be] long before they’re out of reserves altogether because I don’t think we  want to be the one to take their last $500 million away from them  This would be my feeling,  Mr Chairman     There have been other conversations directly with the Italians  They have a really tough  political situation  If they could solve that, you could see some hope, but until something  happens there, it’s very hard to see any real solution  Fortunately, the lira in the last four or five  days--of course, the market was closed for a long Easter weekend, and that certainly helped--the  lira tended to stabilize around 875 after having been as low as 916 without intervention  In fact,  they acquired a few million dollars  Scott, what was the quote this morning?     874-875, so it seems to have stabilized, at least for the time being, on its  own, and I think the Italians are quite realistic in knowing they can’t defend any particular rate   They just can’t afford it, and they are as aware of the paucity of their reserves as anybody else     They have ample reserves for the time being  If, however, for some  reason they thought it would be useful to draw on the swap, and they still had their package  intact and that was a clear takeout, then I personally think that we should be sympathetic to a  British drawing  But as I say, they seem to have ample reserves if they come in     No, there is no takeout provision on the Mexican drawing, but we do  know that they have rights in the [International Monetary] Fund  I mean, this is in the  background, there is nothing specific     I know of no recent developments  As you know, many banks are  concerned about some of their Italian loans, and that concern certainly continues, but I don’t  know of any specific development that indicates a crackdown on the private credit side  I think it  would be much harder for Italian private firms to borrow, although an Italian bank is borrowing  $60 million this week     Well, there are swap drawings up for renewal in the next month  I’ve  already mentioned the Bank of Italy drawing, which falls due on this Thursday but has been  rolled over for three months     We also have the first renewal of $54 million in [deutsche] mark drawings on the  Bundesbank coming up in early May  I’d like to recommend renewal, but I would hope we can  repay that drawing before maturity  We have most of the funds accumulated toward that already     The second--and this is more painful--the full $191 million pre-1971 Belgian franc [swap  debt] and the full $1,147 million of Swiss franc swap debt is again up for renewal, and, I’m sad  to say, it is for the 19th time  We have made some pretty good progress in getting the Belgian  debt down, but as I’ve noted, we’ve only made a very small dent on the Swiss franc debt, given  the strength of that currency  I reluctantly have to recommend renewal, since there is nothing  else we can do, but we would hope that we can continue to make at least some progress on the  eventual settlement of both of these debts     4/20/76 - 5 -             We have not recently, we’ve been going ahead all right on the Belgian  [debt]--I think I’m quite satisfied that we’re right on target  It’s the Swiss one that is the tough  thing, and you know the Treasury has its own debt in Swiss francs  We’re under no pressure  from the Swiss to repay  They’ve been very cooperative in trying to devise procedures by which  the markets [unintelligible] in favor of the dollar  We can move ahead, and we have acquired  some Swiss francs in off-the-market deals, but we have not been going into the market because I  don’t believe that’s appropriate given the strength of the Swiss franc  These are very small  amounts relative to our debt  It would take a major turn in the exchange markets for us to make  real progress     Yes, but we still have more losses to share with them--that’s the thing     We have in the past, and I’d be glad to renew that, but let me say that I  don’t think there is much chance of positive action right now     That’s true     No, Mr Chairman, I think that does it     Mr Chairman, may I point out, though, that the yield auction gives a little  more time for things to adjust if they should go that route     Just the coupon, then the bid comes later  So there’s time, there are a few  more days than we used to have under the old system  "
60,1976-05-18,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     A committee was established at the last meeting to look into this, and it  has not yet had a chance to--     The Committee has not yet met     Well, Mr Chairman, I noted that we had paid off our remaining deutsche  mark debt, and we’ve continued to build up some balances--we have about $28 million  Last  September, the Committee agreed that a buildup of foreign exchange balances of about $150  million would be desirable  That amount appears to be perfectly adequate for our needs right  now, and we would like to proceed and continue to build up balances as market conditions  permit     Finally, I should make some note of the Italian situation  Their drawings on us still  amount to $500 million of the $750 million we agreed to make available to them  They have  since taken down the medium[-term] EC oil facility loan and have arranged another $11 billion  of short term swaps with other EC central banks and the BIS  They also had a swap of $250  million maturing on June 22, the date of the next FOMC meeting and the day after their  elections  And in view of the continuing uncertainty and the nearness of that swap maturity to  the elections, I would recommend that we be prepared to roll over that $250 million if they so  request for another three-month period     The first renewal was rolled over for three months       That’s all I had, Mr Chairman     I think that when you move the funds rate up a 1/2 percent during the  period of a major Treasury financing, that sort of activity would have fit under nobody’s  definition of even-keel, let’s say a couple of years ago  And while I think it is a real delicate  operation, and we did have to keep an eye on the Treasury financing, we did try to get the  [federal] funds rate up before the Treasury financing so the market could take that into [account]   We continued to push it up as we got stronger and stronger confirmation of the strength of the  aggregates  So I think that moving the funds range during the period of Treasury financing was a  pretty good accomplishment       Which was wrong     We weight one by the other, Governor Wallich     Well, Mr Chairman, I think it all depends on whether the current  forecasts of the growth rate of money over the next two months are anywhere near right  If they  are, we would be unable to reach the upper end of this [federal funds rate range] even with a  7-1/2 percent [upper bound to the M1] range  But given the normal margin of error, if we are too  conservative in our estimates, yes, we could hit that upper end, and obviously you hit 7-1/2  before you hit 8-1/2     Well, it would mean that if we’re getting up to the 7-1/2, we would be  moving the funds rate up relatively rapidly  Our own estimate of M1 over the two months is  something like 6-3/4, so there’s some leeway if it’s anywhere near right  It may not be   "
138,1976-08-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     There are two alternatives  One, that everybody goes off and floats  [separately]  Second, they do have a realignment in the snake, as they talked about last March,  in which perhaps the dollar-mark relationship would not be much changed, but the other  countries would depreciate in terms of the mark     I don’t know  I think there will be a lot of sentiment in [favor of] trying  to keep the snake together somehow, but there have been some real problems     We have not  That seems to be an insoluble problem at this time     From time to time we hear some noise from the Treasury that they would  like to pay off and go out and buy Swiss francs in the market  It’s not a very practical thing to be  doing right now; it’s also a little bit expensive     I wouldn’t say that the mark will not appreciate against the dollar to some  extent  But not a great amount  I would think [there would be] a larger depreciation of the other  EC currencies in terms of the mark and against the dollar     I think we are going to make it before year-end, certainly     On the Belgian francs, about 62 million, Mr Chairman  I think maybe  we have accumulated 2 or 3 million in balances so it may be around 60, I would say     I think maybe we should     I know of no new conversation     Well, Mr Chairman, there are no swaps maturing in the period before the  next Committee meeting, so I have no recommendation at this time     I think Governor Wallich has had more conversations on that than I have     I think it would pay for us to look into that very closely     8/17/76 - 4 -       Mexican pesos  "
159,1976-09-21,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Mr Chairman, the Bank of England’s two drawings of $100 million each  under the swap will be up for their first renewal on September 23 and September 30  It had  earlier been understood that the drawings would be renewable only until December 9, when the  British had agreed to arrange borrowing from the IMF  It is my understanding that the Bank of  England is determined to pay their drawings under the swap on time even though IMF money  may not be available until later in the month  I therefore recommend renewal on the two swap  drawings until December 9       Mr Chairman, turning to our Swiss franc indebtedness, last week in  Basel we negotiated a plan with the Swiss National Bank for a possible refunding of our swap  debt and a definite quarterly repayment schedule, which would settle the debt within three years      9/21/76 - 5 -    The plan is subject to approval by the Swiss National Bank board and of course by this  Committee     The negotiations also cover the plan for Treasury repayment of their Swiss franc bonds  concurrently over a three-year period, and the Treasury is in full agreement with the proposal   Total US debt to the Swiss National Bank amounts to approximately 93 billion Swiss francs, or  about $37 billion at current market rates  Of this total, 39 billion Swiss francs represents our  swap debt  The Treasury has agreed to a somewhat faster paydown of our swap debt in the first  year of the proposal, but final payments of both debts would come at the end of the three-year  period     As far as the [Federal Reserve] System is concerned, details are still to be worked out  The  proposal could involve the series of Swiss franc drawings outside the regular swap network, with  the proceeds used immediately to pay off debt outstanding since 1971 under the old line   Repayments would be made in scheduled quarterly installments  We would make every effort to  buy Swiss francs in the market, conditions permitting, and on occasion to sell the Swiss National  Bank other currencies that we have acquired and for which they have a need     Finally, and this concession on the part of the Swiss is what will make the plan work, the  Swiss have agreed to sell us directly at market rates against uncovered dollars any Swiss francs  we need to enable us to meet our scheduled repayment obligations     The loss-sharing agreement reached earlier this year will remain in force, and the Swiss  have extended it to cover the Treasury as well  At current exchange rates, full repayment of our  swap indebtedness will entail a loss of about $415 million, of which the Federal Reserve share  would be $271 million  Losses would be taken only as quarterly payments are made and so  would be spread out over a three-year period  Losses, of course, could either be more or less  depending on market developments over the next three years, and I would certainly not by any  means rule out the possibility that they could be less     Mr Chairman, I recommend that the Committee approve in principle the proposal outlined  above and that we proceed to work out the details with the Treasury and the Swiss National  Bank  In light of the fact that we do not have final Swiss agreement, I believe that final  Committee action should await confirmation by the Chairman that such an agreement had been  reached and details agreed on  That’s all I have, Mr Chairman     I think it ought to--certainly we should have flexibility  But I do think we  ought to set up a schedule for ourselves and really try to stick as closely to it as we possibly can   [If] overwhelming problems in the market or other places [develop], sure, I think we [would]  have to reconsider  But I think there will be no problem in doing that with the Swiss National  Bank     Well, you know, we said that earlier this year  And the Swiss franc was  at 260 [per dollar]  If we’d repaid then, our loss [would] be less than it is now  So I don’t think  we ought to take a risk [by hoping for] a favorable development in the exchange rate, but  [instead] get started even though it does cost us money and even though, if we waited for three  years, we might do it more cheaply  I think we ought to get going     Mr Chairman, I think the Treasury would be willing to take over our  debt  I think they would agree to that  I think the Swiss would prefer to do it in the way we are  suggesting here     9/21/76 - 7 -       I think another possibility might be discussed with the Treasury--I don’t  know how successfully--and that is an IMF drawing as takeout, because we certainly have had  other countries do that  We at least ought to consider it with our Treasury     Not parallel but ending at the same time     No     Yes, there is a possibility at the end of this month They have a large debt  to pay to the Germans, and we might conceivably pay off the whole thing by the end of this  month--I would say, though, at a very poor exchange rate, so we do want to see if we can  improve that rate a little bit  We’ll be working on that the next few days  It’s uncertain right at  this moment, but we will continue to make progress and maybe get rid of the whole thing     Not unless instructed by the Committee to [move] very rapidly if the  aggregates were moving to either end of the range  But you would move further with that range     9/21/76 - 27 -    if the aggregates were moving either way  Unless the Committee wants a different set of  instructions     That’s the way I would interpret it     Well, Mr Chairman, I really have very little to add to what Steve said   We do live in a goldfish bowl, unfortunately, but that’s a fact of life  Telerate is not the only  mechanism, as Steve said, that transmits information that we’re in the market  When we come  [into the market], in every dealer house, lights go on and bells flash, and people or salesmen are  on the phone to their customers  So this is something we have to live with  Telerate perhaps  reaches a slightly larger audience  They’ve been quite accurate in reporting our individual  operations  They can give no information when we’re operating for the System account or on  how much we’re doing, because the street never really knows that     On balance, it seems to me that, while it may be annoying to have everything laid out on a  little machine 20 seconds after you go into the market, I think it’s something that we can afford  to live with without any serious damage to our operations     Mr Chairman, I think Steve and I both thought that this is something that  we expect the Committee to be discussing when they have a special meeting on procedures  And  it really oughtn’t get too much mixed up in something on the Telerate machine itself, but I think  it--     Mr Chairman, I must say that demand for this sort of confirmation of  what people hear in the street or what they see on Telerate has not been very great, and this is a  rare occasion that someone will call and say, “Are you buying coupons?”     I see very little harm in doing it  As I say, the demand is not great  I  mean, we don’t do this at the Desk     I see no harm in changing that policy     Oh no   MR, GARDNER  You really mean “does,” I hope     No, it’s the Public Information Department, not the Desk  We do not talk  to the press     But it’s the same--   MRGARDNER  But the point is, if you get an inquiry, you treat all inquiries the same  way     Absolutely     For the customer accounts  Mr Chairman, when we’re operating for the  System account, we don’t want to announce an amount in advance because part of what we do  may depend on what sort of response we get to our operations     Yes     Sometimes they make rather accurate guesses, sometimes the guesses are  very wrong, because not all dealers want to give everybody else a list of what they had done with  the Desk in a given operation     Yes  "
274,1977-01-17,"  I won’t go into any details, but at the Basel meeting preceding the most  recent one, a group of experts was set up that met in Paris on December 20 and 22, then again in  Basel last Sunday  We started out with why there is disagreement, and ended up in the meeting  last Saturday to agree on what we couldn’t agree on and to give that to the governors to decide  on  And we ended up with a very short document, rather than the usual lengthy report of  experts, which I hope was useful to the governors     More importantly, though, with the bilateral discussions between the United States and the  UK, which were very intense--we met twice in London and once here and at great length to  really work out to see if we couldn’t narrow our own range of disagreement  And a lot of it  was--it was a hard road, a tough road, but it was all done in a cordial sense  And that’s all I need  to say Mr Chairman  Except that I would like to point out, I’m not sure Governor Wallich  emphasized that the [IMF] Managing Director will be acting in a personal role in this, with the  approval of the Managing Board and informing them of what he does  But with no role of the  Managing Board of the IMF in making decisions     It would come under our regular swap agreement with the BIS     At the bill rate     No, it’s quite obvious, Mr Chairman, if we warehouse foreign exchange  for the Treasury, that has a reserve impact  But we have no problems in offsetting that through  domestic operations, and obviously this would be small compared to the normal swing in the  Treasury balance  I think from the domestic side there is no problem, and we had no problem in  warehousing before, so I have no problem all the way through     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     I can’t answer that question with great certainty  I think two things were  involved  They were disturbed when they were seeing the mark appreciate by nearly 1 percent a  day  This, I think, was an effort to calm down the markets, and they recognize, too, that there  have been several large orders coming out of individual banks, probably representing  diversification--$100 million orders--and they took parts or all of those orders out of this market   In addition, I do think they felt that the dollar market rate was becoming inappropriate in some  sense  I think there is an element of that in their thinking  How far that is an element, I’m really  not prepared to say  They were concerned, of course, when they were having such huge inflows  into Germany of the liquidity consequences of that, and so they were delighted to be eventually  able to get the mark turned around and not face further inflows     I would be delighted to build up our working balances  You know, many  months ago the Committee suggested that $150 million might be a proper level  We built up  close to $100 million in all foreign currency balances at one time, and then the market turned  against us and we had to spend them to keep our market in New York orderly  I would hope, if  market conditions permit, that we can build up more-respectable balances  If we ever get  anywhere near $150 [million], I certainly will come back to the Committee for further guidance  on where we should go from there     Mr Chairman, there is just one recommendation  Two drawings made  last November by the Bank of Mexico, in the amount of $75 million each, come up for renewal  on February 10 and February 17  The new Administration [in Mexico] has provided a boost to  confidence  The peso has firmed a bit in the market, and the Bank of Mexico has been able to  recoup reserves  We expect the drawings to be paid in February unless something goes wrong  On the chance that that can always happen, I would like to recommend to the Committee that the  Committee agree to a first renewal if that is requested, although the likelihood is that the swap  will be paid off     Yes, I believe we have, Mr Chairman     Well, they have a similar swap with the Treasury that they will be paying  down pari passu, I assume, [with] the two     I think I would stress Mr Sternlight’s last point, that it’s how you get  there that’s really important  If we had to push aggressively in the market to push the funds rate  up, I think the market would react one way  If it rather drifted into it and then we tended to keep  it there, I think the market would have less [of a ] problem  This is a very subtle difference, Mr  Chairman, but I think it is an important one     I don’t mean aggressive in a real term but I mean in a market-perceived  term, and in that case you don’t have to be very aggressive to seem aggressive  This is a very  subtle difference     We would understand that, Mr Chairman     No, I think we would have to watch what happened  If we got to 4-3/4  and found it was causing trouble, my inclination would be to back away, to come  below--quickly     Deliberate speed, but recognizing there is a Treasury financing coming  up  If we are already closely there, we don’t have all that much time     I don’t know where we are  We were at 4-3/4 earlier today     One would hope that we would be that skillful     That’s a good 16th, Mr Chairman     Well, I’ll [try to] interpret it, Mr Chairman  If we could go a bit above  4-5/8 without causing any damage to the interest rates, or only a very little, that would be the  preference of the Committee  Now, is that right?  That would be my interpretation--I’m not sure  it’s right     5 to 8 basis points on the bill rate--we’re getting awfully precise on that  "
299,1977-02-15,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     We are buying directly from the Swiss primarily  We have had occasion  to buy Swiss francs from some of our correspondents who have been sellers  So we buy them  directly at market rate  We have never really gone into the market  Really, it hasn’t quite been  that good  We hope to, over time       2/15/77 - 8 -             We see no impact of any of this on the market  I think the market has  assumed, and rightly so, that we are buying mainly directly from the Swiss National Bank     Mr Chairman, for once we have no swaps maturing in the period ahead,  and so I have no recommendations to make to the Committee     It would not show the range for the funds rate, Mr Chairman?     Would it say 4-5/8 or 4-5/8 to 4-3/4?      $117 billion, according to table 1      Mr Chairman, would it be acceptable to the Committee if we discussed  with the Federal Financing Bank whether they would like to take over?  This may be very  difficult       Yes, this would be an unusual sort of transaction      Mr Chairman, does this mean that the Committee has adopted the new  guidelines that are--   "
326,1977-03-15,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     I think it was the extent that it was declining on that particular day, Mr  Chairman  It moved by about 3/4 percent, as I recall     Basically, I think the Swiss are completely happy to see the Swiss franc  depreciate  But they do believe in orderly markets and wanted their presence felt     Yes, I would think the rising gold price can be explained by two causes   One, the continued demand from the Mideast and the Far East, which is not really affecting any  concern about European currencies  And second, with a rise in industrial production around the  world, I think industrial demand for gold has picked up rather substantially  So the market has  been able to handle substantial supplies from both Russia and South Africa, and sales by other  countries, without problems     I think it’s partly that, yes     Well, from time to time that comes up  But I don’t think that has really  been a factor in gold prices     Not that I know of     But the market really has handled the IMF sales--which they were very  frightened about when the IMF started--remarkably well  In fact, the price seems to go up just  before each auction     Mr Chairman, as I said, it has been a very dull period, and I have no  recommendations at this time  We do have the Swiss franc swap maturing on April 29, but we  will pay it off before we get there  "
377,1977-05-17,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     No, Mr Chairman, except, as I mentioned earlier, there may be a  possibility that we may want to make small drawings on the swaps  I think we have the authority  to do that  I have no new recommendations to make  "
414,1977-06-21,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Hasn’t been much visible market reaction to that  I know it has caused a  great many people inside government to think about how long we can sustain this without some  pressure developing on the dollar  But I think more important is how well we do on the inflation  front compared with Germany, Switzerland, and some of the others  Right now we’re sort of  average and not doing as well as they  But with our interest rates a bit higher, the dollar has  been extremely steady in the exchanges      We had no appreciation of the dollar, but it did offset these other  movements attempting to weaken it     They had been except around the tax date     No, I think they deliberately tended to keep interest rates on the low side      6/21/77 - 39 -           No, I think the Japanese have really abstained  And I suspect, of all the  central banks, we have a larger share of their total dollar holdings than any other  In fact, they  have used us to keep all those visitors from pounding on their doors  They say, “No, the Fed  wants us to stay with them,” which we have not said  But it’s a good way to keep that steady  stream of commercial and investment bankers away      I have no evidence of this       I have no evidence     What we are doing at the moment  At the moment, if the foreign account  wants to make a repurchase agreement, we do a matched-sale agreement with them  With the  System account     If we need to absorb reserves, that helps us to absorb  And then go into  the market and do it for the System, matched in the market  So that in that case it helps  If we  are not supplying reserves at all, our practice up until now had been to do it in the market  Now  [if] we did [it] with the System account [when we do not need to absorb reserves], [we] offset  that by a corresponding reversing--in other words, we [treat] it like a market factor that [is]  absorbing reserves, and we offset it     Now, when we were supplying reserves, we would also go to the market  We would do  the matched-sale purchase with a foreign account but do correspondingly more in the market on  the reserve supplying side  Again, treating it like a market factor, which we have been doing  If  it helps us, fine; if it doesn’t, we offset it       We would say it’s in connection with a customer transaction     No     Yes, but this is very common in the bill market when we buy outright   As you know, we buy and sell for foreign accounts, over three or four times as much as we do  for the System account outright  And we identify those as customer transactions when we do  them in the market  And that’s caused us no trouble     It’s been entirely, well, if you include some of the monetary authorities as  a central [bank], it’s strictly central banks     6/21/77 - 44 -           But that’s because they do it anyway     Asian Development Bank is also a customer     Yes, some of the international--     But it’s only with people that are authorized to have an account with us   It’s mainly central banks; it would be one or two international institutions that from time to time  might have just raised a bond issue, have plans to invest that money or use it within a week, and  they might ask us to do an RP     I think they would much rather do it themselves  As far as RPs are  concerned, I know that for a fact  That’s a big operation they have, and I wouldn’t want that  operation; that’s a big operation  I’d much rather see them be part of the market       Yeah, but the Home Loan Banks are doing more than that themselves  each day     No     Oh, yes, I believe it would     We have always had the attitude, Governor Wallich, that if central banks  would prefer to deal directly in the market, go ahead and do it  We have interposed no objection  to that  But we feel that ever since we started operations--we have done operations before in  central banks--they like it, it’s part of our close working relationships with the foreign central  banks  And I think they are considerably useful to us, first, in watching these flows into and out  of the dollar, and also in getting subsidiary information from the central banks because we have  close daily contact with them on these operations      No, it’s an actual income because the fact that the central banks brought  money in and left it has absorbed reserves  In offsetting that, we’ve bought securities       I think this would be one alternative, if we gave up the facility     The RP market is not quite as high a rate     I think it would be slight, but there would be some     6/21/77 - 47 -           I think that’s quite right; we are not well informed about what they’re  doing in the market  We can make a big issue of this, and maybe we should make an issue--I  have in one or two cases, but--     To your first question, at least these operations are all in one direction   They don’t go up by 9 billion and down 9 billion; they’re fairly steady in size, and they are  predictable     And they’re repetitive, right  Secondly, we retain the right--if it interferes  with open market operations, I’ll be the first one to come to this Committee and say that we’re  going to stop all of this  Because we can’t allow that to interfere with open market operations  any more than we could let these big swings in the Treasury balance [interfere]  I think since it’s  predictable and not too large, we can approach some people and say, “Look, you’re putting too  much in the RP market, get some of it out”  We can do that, and we have done that--on one of     6/21/77 - 48 -         those occasions where we did have a one-day difficulty doing what we wanted to do for the  System because this was interfering     At least that will get the money out of our accounts     Well, I can recall--remember, go back to the time when we had those  huge currency inflows from Germany and the rest of the continent in 1971  Instead of going into  the market--well, you know what would have happened, the bill rate would have gone to zero   But the fact that it was coming to us and we could see the dimensions of it, we could go to the  Treasury and work out a system by which it could be accommodated without any impact on our  reserves, or much impact--certainly there was some on interest rates      Well, as you probably know, we have tremendous competition  There are  teams from all of the investment banks and all of the large commercial banks that spend all of  their time in seminars and going around trying to sell central banks their services  And in recent  years there has been a drift away from us  I think we have a smaller proportion now of the total  dollar holding  In fact, I know we have smaller proportions than we did, let’s say, three or four  years [ago]  There is a big selling campaign going on       One thing that has concerned me a bit, it hasn’t developed, but it is  something that I think we ought to keep our eye out for  And that is, some of these people who  are selling these services sell them on the basis that they can arbitrage that account very heavily   And that could be bad for our market if it got too large      Well, we really haven’t made much of an effort except when it was  building up to be a problem  But that was quite successful     Some of the money disappeared, and I don’t know where it went, and  some of it went into short Treasury bills--through us  I suspect the other went into Europe     The Treasury has promised very strong support on this     6/21/77 - 51 -           One hundred and four central banks going to the IRS for a ruling     Paul, I might add that a great deal of the countries, the smaller LDCs who  have money, come in for a very short time, and they don’t add much to the size of the operation--  but [it’s] extremely useful for them in trying to manage a fairly small portfolio of dollar assets      The whole legal situation rather confuses me, I must confess  Because  for open market operations these are purchase and sales of securities, and that’s the legal  interpretation  It’s the IRS interpretation, I think, that could be challenged, but I am not a  lawyer  Because when we buy securities on RPs, we take delivery of them  If there were a  failure on the other end of the RP, we would have the right to sell those securities on behalf of  the foreign central bank  So you know, not being a lawyer, I stick with the idea that this is a  purchase and sale       And selection of which of the three  "
439,1977-07-19,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     I think, Mr Chairman, there is nothing that’s happened since June  23--taking that as the base date--that would cause a 4 percent depreciation of the dollar against  the mark and the Swiss franc     Well, if you take last year, Mr Chairman, we have depreciated by about  14 percent against the mark, the Swiss franc, the Belgian franc, and the gilder and about the  same amount against the yen  So over a longer period there has been a substantial movement of  exchange rates     I’m sorry?     Yes, right, right     Going back to June 30 of 1976     Now, there have been developments this morning, Mr Chairman  As I  say, we intervened yesterday, more than we have, but still a modest amount, and not enough to  keep rates even steady, but [continuing to moderate its] going down  Today the Germans have  already bought $191 million  They see signs of OPEC flows of money into marks and out of  dollars, and there are all sorts of rumors of other such flows  A more forceful approach to the  market may be really necessary if we want to avoid some potentially disturbing flows of funds  out of the dollar by important countries  And this could again thoroughly unsettle the exchange  markets and then lead to a further depreciation of the dollar, which I do not think could be  justified by any fundamentals at the [present] time       7/19/77 - 2 -     I’d be prepared to recommend that approach today, but I think this requires further  discussion within the System  It would require the full agreement of the Treasury, which, while  posing no objections to the intervention we’ve been doing so far, has at least been lukewarm in  agreeing to these efforts  So I think we have a new situation in the exchange market  It could  correct itself; on the other hand, unless we want to see things going even further than they have,  and fast, in a disorderly manner, we may have to be prepared to draw a bit more on the swaps  than we have so far     Now, in our other operations, we of course are continuing to repay on our long-term debt  in Swiss francs  We’re paying a further $56 million right on schedule, with our remaining  liability just a bit over a billion at current market rates--which are getting worse every day   That’s all I have, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, as you know, what we’ve been doing is just following the  rate down, not trying to maintain it at any rate  At some point I think it becomes much more  expensive to operate in that way, and I’m not suggesting that we ought to have pegged rates  here, by any means  But the continual depreciation in a rather bad atmosphere--if you’re close to  the market and listening to comments from traders, one gets the impression that it’s reacting  more to what they consider to be an official policy, that we want the rate down, and nobody  knows how far     Yes, I think they have become aware of moderate intervention     I think the impression would be that we’re not doing enough under  current circumstances     Well, up to just recently, when the Germans came back in, the Germans  and the Japanese were really staying out of the market  The Japanese intervened heavily the day  before their Sunday election, I think for political purposes  The countries that have been  intervening are the weak currencies--the pound sterling, the lira, the French franc  And they  have picked up tremendous amounts of money, over $3 billion in the last three weeks     Mr Chairman, if I may add one other point  It seems to me that one of  the reasons that investment demand has been so sluggish in Germany [is that], if they see a  continual appreciation of the mark against other currencies, they don’t quite see where their  markets are going to be in the future  I think a further appreciation of the mark could rebound to  have an adverse effect on the growth of the German economy, [growth] that everybody,  including the Germans and us, wants to see  Which is really the way they’re going to cut back  on their current economic surplus--by internal growth     I would think that the gross amounts are not far different than from other  periods  There have been other periods where it’s been even greater  And you had a different  composition of intervention when the Japanese used to be very heavy interveners  They have  really refrained and intervened only once, I think quite heavily, in I don’t know how many     7/19/77 - 5 -    weeks, but in a number of weeks  There is an acceptance by the Japanese and the Germans and  the Swiss that their [currencies] ought to appreciate  Their concern is that appreciation does  reflect something fundamental and not [just] people talking the rates up or down  I think that is  where their main concern lies     I think, Mr Chairman, for the moment, we should temporize  Talk to the  Treasury and see if we can pinpoint their views, whether they feel that they’ve had enough  adjustment for the time being  Again, I am not thinking of a permanent peg but sort of a relief  from what has really stemmed from too much talk and too much [news]paper comment  If you  talk to the exchange traders, they will point much more to the talk than to anything fundamental  as being the cause of current movements in exchange rates     Yes, sir  I should suggest that we go about as we have, maybe  intervening on the scale that we had to yesterday, perhaps a bit more  This would entail  additional drawings on the swaps, but not massive drawings     Well, this is a thing that does concern me, because we are relying really  on large OPEC flows to finance our current account deficit, which isn’t going to change  overnight  And if you get a redirection of those flows--even [if] they are not terribly large,  because you know, there’s not too many places they can go in any size--it doesn’t have to be  very large to have a rather significant impact both real and psychological on the exchange  market     I think, in our conversations with the Desk this morning with Germans,  they see some as a fact  I think there is much more in terms of rumor than there is in fact, but I  think there is something in fact     We will, indeed, Mr Chairman     I think it’s more the switches of existing holdings  But we had huge  payments into OPEC accounts just over the last weekend and yesterday--the midmonth oil  payments  Some of that is in overnight money and can move out very rapidly     I don’t really have current facts, Governor, on that     Mr Chairman, we have no swap maturing in the current period  And as I  say, we have started drawing on the German swap--for the first time in I don’t know how many  months, we’ve had to draw on a swap line     No, I discussed it very briefly in Basle as a contingency, and they had no  problems     We are buying them from the Swiss National Bank     No, Mr Chairman  Once in a while, we have a chance to pick some up  from one of our customers who’s a seller, and we do that from time to time     Oh, absolutely  We don’t want to make it any worse than it is     I think some reference to the Treasury financing might well go into the  directive for a change     I think if the Committee understands that we do have to keep an eye out  on the financing, that’s all that’s needed; nothing specific is really needed  "
494,1977-09-20,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     It’s something on the order of $670 million     Yes, quite heavily  They bought a large amount of coupon issues, and  they did that through the market using a number of dealers and banks in New York     No, Mr Chairman, with our regular agreement with the Swiss, we will  have some Swiss franc debt coming due, but that’s automatic--no recommendation is needed     Well, I think if it really were at the very top of the range, we would  gradually move toward that  But as you know, we get new projections each week  I wouldn’t  jump all the way to 6-1/2 in one week     I think we would move decisively at least to the midpoint, maybe a bit  beyond, and then wait for another week to see if the next week’s projections kept this at 7  But  not jump in one fell swoop     Or very close to it     Mr Chairman, may I just make one comment  The Board projection  really is at the top of the M1 range  I don’t put this out as any solace, but the New York  projection is 1-1/2 percent lower than that, or very close to the midpoint of that 2 to 7 percent   These are projections we are talking about     We’d be on the high side  "
547,1977-11-15,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     That’s all I have     Mr Chairman, one thing I wish you would just add for the Committee’s  information  We have got a favorable ruling [from] the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] on the  matched sale-purchase agreement  We just got it yesterday morning, and [unintelligible] during  the interval before the next committee meeting, we’ll have the memorandum with a  recommendation in setting out the various options that stand before the committee     I think, with the specification, either form of the directive is about the  same     11/15/77 - 41 -        "
593,1978-01-05,"  I am not very well prepared for this  I think I would like to talk mainly  about what happened yesterday and today when we started to do a little more aggressive  intervention       It’s about $900 million--a little over--since the end of September,  beginning of October  Since the last meeting of the Committee our total intervention has been  $295 million  Yesterday we took a more aggressive approach  It seemed that the approach was  aggressive, but we spent no money and the mark went from around the 206 level to 213-1/2  Today, as we expected, we have been tested by foreign banks in particular and some of our own  banks to see if this policy really means something  So today we have intervened to the extent of  $140 million--with half of that for the System account and half for the Treasury account under their  new swap arrangement with the Bundesbank  Other intervention today--the main ones--[included]  Germany,                       and Switzerland,                      in their market and on their behalf we did                        equivalent of Swiss francs for a total of                          Meantime the dollar has reached a  [unintelligible] in Germany today and [the mark] a 215 level  It went a little bit higher in New  York and since then has dropped off to a little below the 215 level        I think it is more foreign banks that have fairly large positions, Phil  They  seem to have taken a paper loss and they are now trying to protect themselves by building up those  positions further hoping that they can eventually drive the rates back down and come out whole       Maybe to a very small extent  We see no significant evidence of that       Only what we hear through the market, Mr Chairman       We hear it also from some of our foreign central banking friends, but  there’s no direct evidence  There are no statistics that are immediately available       I would think not, Mr Chairman  I think they’re out to make a profit like   everybody else but their positions have been moderate       Not to the best of my knowledge  But we will be checking as soon as we  get some numbers       1/5/78 5    That’s right       Let me ask Scott to answer that question because he is a little more  familiar with the numbers than I am       That is certainly what we are hoping for, but in the meantime we are being  tested  The banks try to assure themselves that this is a meaningful policy move on the part of the  United States        On any weakening of the dollar, no  I think we want to make sure to be  clear that we are not trying to establish a rate  We are trying to maintain an orderly market and to  shake out some of these speculative positions that we think are around the world       That is very hard to judge  As I said, yesterday we were very active in   placing orders in the market but we had no takers; today we did have takers       Well, we have heard mainly that corporate treasurers are trying to make up  their minds, if they do have a long position in marks, whether they should shorten it or if they  should establish a new position  I don’t have anything very concrete, but definitely I could say on  that point that we know a lot of thinking and discussions are going on  And that’s why we think it  is very important to maintain a stable momentum as far as the psychology is concerned  I certainly  agree, Mr Chairman, that it is not only banks that are at fault       I only hope that we can be lucky as well as wise       I think the one thing we need, Mr Chairman, is an authorization, at least  from the Subcommittee, so we will have at least some money for intervention tomorrow       Those are the days we like, Mr Chairman, but we can’t expect to do that  every day       Mr Chairman, we have had that reversal today  The rate is now 21435       It has been as high as 21575       I think it would be back to 206 to 207    "
639,1978-02-28,"  Mr Chairman, in March the System has 17 swap drawings, totaling $541   million, maturing  It seems unlikely, although it=s not completely inconceivable, that we will be  able to acquire that amount in the market  I recommend that the Committee approve the rollover of  these swaps on maturity for 3 months  In all cases, these are first renewals; they=ve only been  outstanding for 3 months       Well, Mr Chairman, in April we have a little different situation  We have   six swaps totaling about $136 million that will mature  As they mature, they will have been  outstanding for 6 months--the maximum called for in our swap arrangement without a special  agreement between the Bundesbank and ourselves  I really think it is premature to make a  recommendation concerning these drawings at the present time, but I would like to have  preliminary discussions with the Bundesbank, which they are also very anxious to have, either at  the Basle meeting in March or slightly before that  While I have no recommendations, I think it  might be worthwhile to point out to the Committee the options it has before these swaps mature   First, they could be repaid  If we are lucky, we can buy the German marks in the market,  conditions permitting, or directly from the Bundesbank  This is one very clear option       That=s right  I should point out, however, that from an immediate profit and  loss point of view, for those people who are interested in that, these swaps are the most expensive  drawings that the System could repay  This arises obviously from the fact that the drawings were  made at rates of about 43-1/2 to 44 [cents] per mark, compared with a rate on our last drawing of  about 49-1/2 [cents] per mark, representing the 13 percent appreciation of the mark since last  October  Now, I remain confident, along with Scott and I think many others, about the chances of  [eventually] unwinding the swaps at a profit or at least without a loss  In fact, the dollar would  only have to regain about half of its losses against the D-mark since last October to reach the  break-even point  And I think that=s obtainable  Consequently, I personally would not be overly  concerned about showing a loss on the repayment of any individual drawing  I think we should,  however, consider whether it would be preferable to pay down other drawings, minimizing our  losses and the Bundesbank=s losses  We have other drawings at different rates that we could pay  down, perhaps even showing a bit of profit  I think that=s something we ought to consider and I  have no recommendation at this time       That=s right in the long run; but in the short run we show a big loss  That   doesn=t bother me, but I just want to point out that if we repay those we maximize our book losses      That=s right  I think we ought to consider it and I have no recommendation   right now  We can wait until we get closer to the [time the drawings mature] for a firm  recommendation       Mr Chairman, another option that the Committee has is that we could   request the Bundesbank to routinely roll over the maturing swaps for 3 additional months with a  possibility of another renewal  In many ways, this is the very simplest approach that we might  follow  It would not, for example, raise the issue of our 50-50 loss-sharing arrangement with the  Germans as a request by us to the Bundesbank for a direct sale of German marks might do  Again,  this is something to be explored  I have no recommendation  I want to point out that this is another  option that the Committee has       That=s right  It is provided for by mutual agreement between two parties in  our swap agreement  But it takes a special agreement to do that  Another possibility, and it=s only  a possibility, is that other sources of D-marks might become available to the System--should, for  example, the Treasury decide to sell SDRs, borrow foreign currency, or draw on the IMF  Now,  this is not [beyond] the realm of possibility, but it=s a very remote possibility--though one that may  be available to us before the problem arises  I think there is another approach the System could  take  That is, we could request a special swap facility of a longer maturity--say, two years--with  prepayment options, of course  Such an arrangement would be roughly similar to our special Swiss  franc arrangement and could be useful if in early April concern about the System=s acquisition of  German marks to repay the swaps or fear that the System is running out of D-mark resources are  putting great pressures on the market  That=s something you can=t judge now but that=s another  possibility  I think there are a number of possibilities and the final choice can only reflect market  conditions as they exist in early April in light of whatever actions, if any, may be undertaken by the  Administration or the Treasury in the international area       I would like to have preliminary talks with the Bundesbank and be clear   about exactly how they feel  They know the same possibilities that I listed here  But I would like  to be able to feel free to talk to them quite frankly about the possibilities and get their thinking on  this They=re anxious to do that       It could; it could indeed  That=s why I think preliminary negotiations or talk   about this would be useful      Well, they would go into the System account until we accumulate enough to   make a decent repayment  We wouldn=t do that with every million that we buy       2/28/78           9      $10 or $20 million  It can be very flexible      Well, I think that=s what you have to decide  Do you pay off using a first-  in/first-out approach?  Or do you try to pick one where the rate is comparable to what you paid?      Mr Chairman, may I say what Scott was saying just a trifle differently?  It   seems to me that there are times when intervention in the Swiss franc--if that=s the problem in the  market and that=s pushing the market--makes some sense as long as it=s limited  And since it=s a  small market, it usually can be quite limited  And if you can have even more of an impact on the  D-mark--which is being pulled up by the Swiss franc--with a lesser amount of intervention using  the Swiss franc, I think that is reasonable in the overall market context in which we operate       Well, if that other currency is a source of disorder or rapid movement in   rate, which is one measure of disorder, then I think it is justified to use that currency--if [the  disorder] is localized in that area       I think they have been [comparable]      I=ll say “no” to that right now, Chuck      I don=t think there is any discernable difference in our--      Mr Chairman, regrettably, I do have one final recommendation  As you   know, the Committee has authorized an open position of $175 billion in foreign currencies  At the  present time, we have a leeway of exactly $106 million, which is not very large relative to potential  [operations]  Hopefully, we won=t have to [breach] that  In between Committee meetings under  the procedural instructions, our leeway would go up to around $215 billion; it would go up $500  million from where we started at the beginning of the Committee [meeting] until the next meeting  of the Committee  There=s no necessary reason why the authorization has to be exactly what is  permitted in the procedural instructions, but obviously the authorization is the important [rule];  that=s what rules us  So I would certainly recommend that the Committee at this meeting, since this  has to be an action of the full Committee, increase the limit on the open position to $2 billion,  which happens to be the limit on our German mark swaps       I believe it could, but I leave it to a parliamentarian      Yes, about $376 million      We have $100 million of leeway and an additional $250 million would   make it roughly $350 million      It is constrained by the Subcommittee      A [limit on the] total of $1,750 million, which would give us a leeway of   about $100 million    SPEAKER(?)  About $100 million?       Right, a little over $100 million      Mr Chairman, my reason is thoroughly defensible  We can hit an   emergency and while we can get to the Subcommittee reasonably promptly--         2/28/78           19    Sometimes, Mr Chairman, we can=t find people; it sometimes takes time  I   would like to have something authorized by the Committee that would protect us in case we do run  into an emergency situation because getting to the full Committee is much more difficult than  getting to the Subcommittee or to you    "
677,1978-03-21,"  Well, President Morris, I guess I’d say we could live with it  I, too, feel   that maybe a redefinition of the open position is a proper solution  Gross transactions to me are not  important, although I must say that the Desk would never consider a huge move from a short  position to a long position staying within a net, let’s say, of a couple of hundred million  Nor  would we want to take over the market and become the market for foreign currency  We may have  to do that for half an hour on a very poor day, but day in and day out absolutely not  We would be  very much opposed to that  But I think we can live with these limits with the provision that we can  have them raised if we see the need  It’s time consuming and if we are very busy with market  operations, we know we have a lot of little numbers to remember on the side, and that’s a little  annoying  But we can live with it, I think, at this time        We would have come up at the Desk with a higher number than that   [proposed] but, as I say, I think for the time being we can live with the proposal and perhaps we  can get around to a better definition of the net position       That’s right      Mr Chairman, during the month of April, the System has sixteen   maturing swap drawings on the Bundesbank, totaling $584 million, and one drawing on the Swiss  National Bank of $189 million  Ten of these sixteen German mark drawings and the single Swiss  franc drawing are first renewals  And that would create no problem under our swap agreement  As  Henry has pointed out, second renewals require the mutual agreement of the Bundesbank and the  Federal Reserve  Governor Wallich has indicated that his ad hoc subcommittee agrees with the  Bundesbank suggestion that swaps maturing in April, May, and June be subject to a second  renewal  And I recommend that the Committee approve the Bundesbank’s suggestion       Mr Chairman, I should also note that this agreement for a second renewal   will in no way impede earlier repayment if the market turns and we are able to acquire marks in the  market--in other words, if we’re lucky       Yes      That’s right      Yes  I think Henry has given a good review of the four options that the ad   hoc subcommittee had in mind  While the immediate problem of the swaps maturing over the next  few months is solved for the time being, as the ad hoc subcommittee report notes, and as other  members of the Committee have noted, the Germans feel a need for further discussion and early  resolution of the issues toward agreement on some longer-term solution  As Henry noted, I did  have preliminary discussions with Bundesbank officials in Frankfurt on March 9 and 10 and then  again in Basle on March 14  During these meetings, it was obvious that the Germans were very  much interested in settling the outstanding swaps on a longer-term basis, as Henry said, either  through a sale by the US Treasury of, say, 2-year foreign currency bonds or by extending the  maturity of our swap line  Should such an extension or funding be undertaken, the Bundesbank  made it very clear in its proposal to increase the swap line to $4 billion that if outstanding swaps  are repaid or refunded, the total line that would be open to the System would be reduced by a   corresponding amount  At that time our drawings amounted to about $16 billion  If we had  funded them, we would have had available to us $24 billion under a so-called regular swap line      Our discussions were, of course, very preliminary and no positions were taken  There was   a useful discussion, however, of the various issues, some of which are technical and some are of a  policy nature that will have to be resolved  Under technical issues, which I believe can be resolved  without great difficulty, I would include the decision as to the exact amount of outstanding  drawings to be refunded; the exchange rate to be applied to the refunded swaps; the settling of  losses incurred at the time of the funding; and provisions for prepayment, which we certainly  should insist on in any swap arrangement  During the discussions it was obvious that the  Bundesbank officials had not really given serious consideration to the possibility of direct  purchases of marks from the Bundesbank by the Federal Reserve  I indicated to them that there  were strong feelings among the Committee members that such a procedure was both desirable and  necessary and I referred to our special arrangement with the Swiss National Bank  They promised  to consider this possibility carefully, as well as their attitude toward purchases of marks in the  market for repayment of outstanding drawings at times when the market impact might be  considered adverse by the Germans  These are our two options--buy in the market or buy from the  Bundesbank  It was my impression that they would not look very favorably on direct purchases of  marks from the Bundesbank by us to repay outstanding drawings at the end of six months but  would at least be prepared to consider the possibility, if a longer-term swap arrangement were to be  agreed on  With such a swap arrangement, obviously there’s a longer period of time over which  the swap drawings might be reversed in the market  And I think they have that very much in mind     We discussed options available on profit/loss sharing should an extended swap be   undertaken  The Bundesbank officials were not sure whether the present 50-50 arrangement could     3/21/78              18  be carried out on a long-term swap; they agreed to consider that possibility  The other alternative  would be for us to share equally any profit or loss that might exist at the time of the funding and  then the System would have to agree to take the profit and loss itself from then on  I would assume  that this Committee would prefer a continuation of the 50-50 arrangement  We also discussed  various options in regard to repayment schedules, should an extended swap be agreed on, and I  believe the Germans are prepared to be very flexible in this respect     The Bundesbank representatives agreed to consider all of these [items on our] check list,   and we’re quite anxious to continue exploration at, before, during, or after the next Basle meeting   I think they really would like to see us reach a conclusion as early as possible  Pending those  further discussions, I think it’s premature to make recommendations to the Committee  I hope,  however, to be able to present a written report to the Committee prior to the April meeting  That’s  not much time but I would hope to be able to do so, and I certainly would appreciate any guidance  members of the Committee would like to provide at this time       Governor, the only thing I’d say is that we also have a profit exposure and   as you recall in ’75 we were way in the hole on a billion dollars worth of German marks and came  out of the [situation] with a profit  So, I remain a little optimistic       Yes, Mr Chairman, I have another recommendation  At the last meeting  of the full Committee, the Committee increased the authorization for our open position in foreign  currencies to $2 billion  We now have a leeway of about $171 million under that open position   Under the procedural instructions, an increase of up to $500 million in the open position--to $2329  billion--would be permitted without recourse to the full Committee  Since this would bring us  above the authorized amount, I recommend that the Committee increase the authorized amount not  to [$2329 billion] but to a round number of $225 billion       That’s my next point      Mr Chairman, the Treasury does have only $50 million left under its $1   [billion] swap line with the Bundesbank  But it has agreed, as we all know, to sell the equivalent of  $740 million of SDRs to the Bundesbank  The Treasury would prefer to wait until the final  ratification of the pending amendment to the IMF rules since it would make the SDR transaction  much simpler  They’re expecting that by month end  But since the Belgians are involved and  we’ve had experience with them before, I guess there’s really no guarantee  If the Treasury does  not have the arrangements to sell SDRs in perfect order--and there’s a period of 3 or 4 days before  that can be done--it seems to me that it would be quite reasonable for the System to take whatever  market intervention is needed, with the understanding that the Treasury will reimburse us for their  share as soon as they draw on SDRs  They are now prepared--I believe our people are working on  the technical details today--to sell SDRs even if the amendment is not put in place in time  So I  think this is something that can be worked out  I would suggest that a few days, if that’s all it is,  where we take the whole [amount of intervention] and then get reimbursed by them in some way  should also be satisfactory       I would say an absolute maximum of one week  The time may run out      I have a suspicion that the Treasury will probably prefer to go ahead and   sell SDRs without the amendment rather than get into this reimbursing problem  But I really don’t  know that     3/21/78              22      Roughly      Right      The consultation has been rather complete      Well, as you know, they’ve come to our capital market and have a large   Eurodollar loan  I think they would probably use those resources--     3/21/78              27      No  I think they have still                        [available] in their Euro loan and   they have not yet drawn on the New York line  So they’ve got quite a few resources  Although  who can tell over time?       No, I don’t think so, Mr Chairman      Mr Chairman, may I make one comment?  It’s not quite clear to me what   funds range the Committee is going to pick but I gather with 6-1/2 to 7 that we don’t go below  6-3/4 percent without consultation  I’m not quite so sure with 6-3/4 to 7-1/4 whether we don’t go  above 7 without consultation  I ask because some members have expressed some reluctance to  move very much on the upside unless the aggregates were extremely strong       No, I’d say we’d [view it as] 6-3/4 percent unless the aggregates tell us to   move up  That’s for the Committee to decide but that’s the way I would interpret what I’ve heard  today       Mexico   "
723,1978-05-05,"  Mr Chairman, as the Committee knows we are having difficulty hearing--        As you know, the [Treasury] auctioned [unintelligible] on Tuesday and  [unintelligible] bonds on Wednesday  Yesterday both of those turned in a very good report  The     5/5/78              3  [10-year] bonds were light and had premiums of 5/32 and the long bond was almost half a point  while [unintelligible] rise  After the money supply figures were announced yesterday afternoon,  however, those premiums dropped away and at mid-morning both of them are showing a discount  to the issue [price]  Those are the most important things that have been happening in New York   Treasury markets are--        Mr Chairman, I think the market is very [unintelligible] maybe a half or a  little more than [unintelligible] but I don’t think that is [unintelligible]       That could be the [unintelligible]     "
767,1978-06-20,"  Mr Chairman, as Scott has noted, we have made good progress in  repaying our System D-mark debt, particularly the drawings of the earliest maturities--those  drawings [totaling] about $800 million that we incurred last October, November, and December  They have all been repaid  We are now working against the drawings incurred in January, which  will be coming up for a second renewal in July  Specifically, there are ten swap drawings up for  second renewal by July 26, totaling $448 million and one drawing for $35 million up for first  renewal  As you know, the Bundesbank had earlier agreed to second renewals of swap drawings  maturing in April, May, and June, all of which have been paid off  They have now agreed for  second renewals of swap drawings maturing in July, should we not be able to pay them off by  maturity  I should note that the swap arrangement with the Bundesbank has been in continuous  use since October 5 and any swap drawings that we renew in July for 3 months, even those  incurred this year, will lead to a situation in which the swap line will have been in continuous  use for more than 12 months  Paragraph 1C of the authorization specifies that any drawings  shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first     6/20/78                3  drawn unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a  delay  To me, this 12-month limit applies to the actual drawings on the line rather than to the  line itself  The language is somewhat ambiguous, however, and to avoid any misunderstanding I  think the Committee should recognize that these second renewals could result in the continuous  use of the swap line--not drawings but the line--for more than twelve months  We would, of  course, make every effort under current arrangements to repay the swap debt in full by October  5th     Finally, Mr Chairman, at the last meeting the Committee reduced the net open position  limit under paragraph 1D of the authorization to $2 billion to conform to the pace of our swap  repayments  With our swap drawings having been reduced by another $500 million to just over  $1 billion, it would be appropriate to reduce the limit by $500 million  Accordingly, I  recommend that the net open position be reduced to $15 billion  That=s all I have, Mr  Chairman       Well, Mr Chairman, I never have felt the need for written procedural  instructions because I felt there was a joint understanding between the Committee and the Desk  about how we did things  But I have no objections to what I hear  I do find some slight problem  with the fact that the overall net limits of $100 million and $300 million are exactly the same as  those for any one currency  That means we=re going to hit one of them before we can get past  either of them  In other words, if we hit $100 million on the overall, that means we only have  $50 million on an individual currency  That concerns me some, but we can live with it as it is       This is something that we would normally report all the time, whenever it  happens  This is the language that I think Scott himself had suggested and it=s nothing that  would bother us       Do I understand that each installation can have five handsets that can be  used?    "
844,1978-09-19,"  Well, Mr Chairman, there is for once not much in the way of swap   drawings maturing before the next meeting of the Committee  We have one swap drawing of $35  million equivalent of German marks maturing in early October  This will be the second renewal   We have two Swiss franc drawings totaling about $13 million equivalent maturing in early October  also, both representing first renewals  I recommend that the Committee agree to roll over these  three swap drawings at maturity should we not be able to acquire sufficient foreign exchange to pay  them off  I think there's a good chance we will, but in these days I don't want to make any  forecasts       Governor Wallich, at the moment we have almost enough marks to pay   off this swap drawing  But goodness knows what is going to happen tomorrow or the next day      That's precisely the point      Mr Chairman, I have a couple of other recommendations      As of October 5th our swap line with the Bundesbank will have been in   continuous use for twelve months although specific drawings under the swap lines have been  repaid well before [they had been outstanding for] a 12-month period  While paragraph 1C of the  Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations in my mind is not exactly crystal clear, it has been  interpreted as requiring Committee approval if a swap line--I'm not talking about drawings but this  is a line itself--is in continuous use for more than twelve months  I request that approval       Otherwise, we'd be in a little problem, except I believe that that   [paragraph] can be interpreted somewhat differently      Mr Chairman, I'd like to do that quite briefly  At the last meeting, Scott   Pardee referred to the proposals that Dr Gleske of the Bundesbank had made to alter the terms of  our basic swap agreement  We will be presenting the Committee with a memorandum containing  detailed suggestions within the next few days but at the risk of being a bit premature, I would like  to preshadow the suggestions that will be made      First, Dr Gleske proposed that the 50-50 profit-loss sharing provisions be eliminated  I   happen to share this view for three basic reasons  Except for our current drawing on the  Bundesbank, this provision has meant a sharing of profits, not losses, from our point of view  The       9/19/78            5  net dollar and cents value of the provision to the Federal Reserve and Treasury has really been  quite small  Second, the fact that the 50-50 ratio applies to our drawings on foreign central banks  but not to foreign central bank drawings on us has caused some resentment, I think you'll  understand, on the part of our partners in other central banks  Third, when we undertake  coordinated operations in the exchange markets, foreign central banks are taking full risk on their  operations, which are usually much larger than ours, and half of the risk on our operations  Since  most central banks in the swap network are already taking very large losses on their old dollar  holdings apart from current acquisitions they are obviously not particularly happy with the 50-50  arrangement     Now, it can be argued that there are political advantages to the 50-50 arrangement and I   understand that in discussions Governor Wallich has had with Treasury, the latter is not prepared to  agree to this change, at least at the present time  I believe we should continue discussions with the  Treasury and, if the Committee should agree, move at an appropriate time  Finally, in negotiations  in Basle, Governor Wallich was able to elicit agreement on the part of Dr Gleske to withdraw his  proposal to eliminate the 50-50 provision The matter is, therefore, not a matter of controversy  between the Bundesbank and us      Linked to the elimination of the 50-50 provision was a proposal that the Bundesbank would   receive interest on the dollar counterpart of our swap drawings at German interest rates rather than  US interest rates  At current interest rate differentials this would involve substantial savings to the  Treasury, much more than offsetting the losses on our current swap drawings  It would also be  symmetrical with our own commitment to provide funds under the swap arrangements at US  interest rates  I would therefore support Dr Gleske's proposal in this respect also but I should point  out that it will probably be withdrawn if we do not agree to the elimination of the 50-50 clause      The second proposal of Dr Gleske is that the current rate of exchange be applied to swap   renewals rather than the rate at which the debt was first incurred  This is in accordance with  currently accepted market bookkeeping practices and I would suggest that we accept it      The third proposal is to clarify language in the agreement with respect to obtaining foreign   exchange needed to repay swaps in the market whenever possible  This happens to be our current  understanding and I see no problem in clarifying the language a bit  It should, however, be linked  to clarification of the obligation of the Bundesbank to [sell] us marks directly should there be  mutual agreement that they can not be acquired in the market in a timely fashion     I would hope that the Committee will be able to discuss the Gleske proposals at its next   meeting after it has had time to study the forthcoming memorandum, which will be in your hands  within a few days  That's all I have, Mr Chairman       6 to 9?      Well, I think it's quite clear that the instruction as tentatively arranged here   is an immediate move to 8-1/2  By immediate, I mean over a few days  We'll see more aggregates  on Friday, again a week from Wednesday, and then again a week from Friday  As you know, I  don't believe in precipitous movement to the upper end of the range right away because the weekly  numbers are very volatile and they can be revised very easily, as we all know  So if we were just  barely above the midpoint of the range--let’s say at 8 percent with a midpoint of 7-1/2--I don't think  I would be inclined to do much of anything but wait to see what the next group of numbers showed  And as we got closer to the upper end of the range, sure, [I’d move up] a shade but not to 8-3/4  right away until we hit the upper end  But I’d make sure that we were above 8-1/2, certainly--at  8-5/8 or something like that--as best we can do it  And as you know, we're not perfect       I have no comments  I think the market will take an 8-1/2 percent funds   rate without much difficulty; I think if we got to 8-3/4 very quickly, we'd get a bit of a reaction   "
868,1978-10-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       Yes       Governor Coldwell, I think we'll wait until we get close to using up the  intermeeting limit before we come to the Committee for that  Are you talking about the overall  limit or--       Yes, on the foreign  I'm sorry, I got confused       About $400 million, which is above the amount that we normally  have--larger [than our holdings] can increase in the interim       All right  I would propose, Mr Chairman, that we accept the proposal that  the current exchange rate be applied to swap renewals and the proposal that certain clarifications in  the language of the existing swap arrangement be worked out  Any language change would, of  course, be cleared with the Foreign [Currency] Subcommittee  I would like to proceed with  negotiations with the Bundesbank and other swap partners along these lines and I ask for  Committee concurrence  There are the two--       Right       That we go ahead on these two       Right  Well, Mr Chairman, on the 50-50 profit sharing, which is another  proposal, and on changing the interest rate to the German rate--       But I would like to see if the Committee really goes along with that sort of  approach because there may come a time, even before the end of this year, when the situation has  changed enough so that the Treasury may have [no objection] and we might agree that we could go  ahead with these, too        Right       That's what they would do under the current swap lines  It's asymmetrical  in that sense  [The proposal is that] they would pay our rate and we would pay their rate       Well, I don't think the loss is the major problem for the Treasury  I think  the status of the [Exchange] Stabilization Fund is their main problem  The fact is that at one point,  as you mentioned, Congress was tending to require that there be an appropriation for the ESF to  cover any possible exchange losses, which the Treasury--I think quite rightly--wanted to avoid   And I think that's the stumbling point, as far as the Treasury is concerned  I do detect on the part of  the Treasury a desire to move ahead and eliminate this once they think the situation has calmed  down and their extended position under the swap with the Germans, for example, can begin to  move the other way       Mr Chairman, if I may respond to that as well  That may well have been  true in the past but I do think, as the Chairman noted, that the situation has changed now  We are  more big boys on our own feet in this business  We do have certain obligations that we have to live  up to  So I would think that would be less of a problem now even though there always will be a  mutual interest in intervention  And for us to insist on 50-50 loss sharing on our intervention--well,  certainly we would not accept that from a foreign central bank who is intervening many, many  times more than we are in our own interest as well as theirs       By a foreign central bank    "
894,1978-11-21,"  [Statement--see Appendix]  [Secretary’s note The Manager made routine  recommendations to renew maturing swap drawings]       If we do not, yes       Yes, it is       Mr Chairman, I'm sorry, but in addition to those routine  [recommendations], I have some that aren't routine       [Statement continued--see Appendix]  [Secretary’s note  The Manager  requested approval to renew the basic swap agreements, in either revised or old form, with the  understanding that the Desk would strive for uniformity as soon as arrangements could be worked  out]       [Statement continued—-see Appendix] [Secretary’s note  The Manager  recommended that actions taken on October 31 involving the approval of a $5 billion limit on the  total open position and the suspension of the intermeeting limit be continued  No formal action  required]       [Statement continued--see Appendix]  [Secretary’s note  The Manager  discussed warehousing foreign currencies for the Treasury]        That's right, at this stage now the Treasury may want some changes in it   There was an early exchange of letters between Secretary Simon and Chairman Burns  And while  that covered warehousing in general, it related particularly to the special sterling arrangement that  the Treasury shared with us back at the end of 1976       It was general in nature  That's right       Right       Well, we invest them in whatever we can       Whatever currency it happens to be       No, we would get the interest       It's a way of financing for the Treasury, really        We have investing arrangements now in all three of the currencies that  would be involved       It could be, yes       It probably would be  It just gets very complicated when you try to look  at it--    "
918,1978-12-19,"  That’s later this week       The midpoint is 9-7/8, which is 9875          Mr Chairman, my recommendations will fall in three categories routine  swap rollovers, the System open position, and the System’s warehousing facility for the Treasury   The System has seven D-mark drawings totaling $451 million equivalent and six Swiss franc  drawings totaling $114 million maturing between December 30 and January 26  All are first  renewals and I recommend that they be rolled over at maturity should we not be able to pay them  off  Now, if the January meeting is cancelled, then we would need approval at this time, I think, of     12/19/78          31    the rollover of an additional $204 billion D-mark swaps, $350-odd million Swiss franc swaps, and  $85 million Japanese yen swaps, which mature by mid-February  Those approvals would normally  be done at the regular January meeting        Typically, we have asked for renewals covering a period after the next  Committee meeting  It gives us a little opportunity to work out repayments ahead of time          That’s right, but typically we ask for renewals of [any swaps maturing] a  week to 10 days after the next Committee meeting         Two billion, 40 million         That’s right       Yes, Mr Chairman  Our heavy intervention in the exchange market  brought our open position to within less than $200 million of the $5 billion authorized by the  Committee last Thursday  An intermeeting rise in that limit would have required publication this  Friday, and given the speculation both in the market and in the press about US use of its foreign  exchange availability, it seemed desirable to avoid the possible announcement effect  In these  circumstances, the Treasury agreed with the Chairman’s suggestion that they provide from their  own account any marks needed for intervention Friday until this Committee meeting, until the  Committee had a chance to consider the question          For two days        Mr Chairman, I think a good case can be made for suspending the overall  open limit authorization  Such action would underscore the System’s commitment to the  November 1 program and particularly avoid the need for an intermeeting change in the  authorization that might [cause] a market misreading because early release of that information  would be required  I’d prefer this course of action  But I think the same objectives can be achieved  by a sufficiently large increase in the open limit  An $8 billion open limit would permit the full use  of our D-mark swap line--we only have $2 billion left in that line--and also allow for an additional  $1 billion for intervention in Swiss francs and in yen  That seems to me to be reasonably  acceptable, although I’d prefer a suspension [of the limit]       Mr Chairman, I’d also like to recommend that the authorization to  warehouse foreign exchange for the Treasury be raised from $1-3/4 billion, which the Committee  approved last week, to $3-1/2 billion  That increase in the authorization last week accommodated  the successful sale of $16 billion Treasury D-mark bonds last week  The Treasury plans to  proceed with the Swiss franc offering in January and is considering a second D-mark offering and a  Japanese yen offering early next year  It would seem prudent, at least for the time being, for the  Treasury to retain maximum flexibility by keeping the foreign exchange proceeds of these bond  sales available for us for intervention if it’s needed  Warehousing accommodates that need for  flexibility without involving the Federal Reserve in any exchange risk  Warehousing does have an  impact on reserves in the banking system, but since that impact is known in advance, it can be  offset by domestic open market operations whenever necessary  It’s just another reserve factor        12/19/78          34        Yes        I think so for this stage  We have to do some rethinking with the Treasury  over the next few months        This will take them through several months        It’s not finally decided, but about that level  We probably would need  another increase  We could go to $5 billion now  That would be one way of handling the second  D-mark [offering]  We could do that now if the Committee so desires        It all comes out of the same pot before we get through           We would lose because we would hold lower-yielding--        Mr Chairman, may I just point out that at this particular moment the  United States is not faced with the problem of having net holdings of foreign exchange  We’re still  relatively short at the moment, and so all the foreign exchange assets we have could be used to  repay debt         That’s all       "
943,1979-02-06," I’m not sure anybody is, Scott We have not  been able to draw any very close connection between the two, Ernie  It may be there, but we have not been able to find it    Dave, there are a number of factors on the  fundamental side, including an improvement in the trade deficit,  perhaps a sign of real moderation in the economy and, of course, less  inflation, which nobody expects in the short run All those things 1  think would take the onus off a decline in the funds rate    About 10 percent or a little above     2 / 6 / 7 9  -43-    [Statement--see Appendix] [Secretary's note  Mr Holmes recommended an increase from $150 to $500 million in the  Committee's informal limit on foreign currency holdings]    I would guess that we wouldn't get to that  amount But the markets are so volatile these days    I recommend that they be rolled over on maturity  if we can't pay them off before  "
967,1979-03-20," [Statement--see Appendix]    Yes, I think the Germans would like it and the  Treasury would not; so there's a bit of an impasse there    And with an escalating scale if they don't pay  off [on time]; that's the point    Well, we're not a lender of last resort,  Governor Wallich; as you know, we will lend only in the case of a  failure to a dealer They just can't come and borrow from us for any  purpose   M R   WALLICH Yes, I see your point    Well, I think the memo that we put out ought to  be self explanatory I am not one who particularly likes daily limits  on operations, but I can see why members of the Committee would like  them, and I think those that are being proposed are ones we can live  with for the time being If we do run into problems operating under  them, we will certainly come back to the Subcommittee and to the  Committee I don't foresee any problems at the moment    I would think, Mr Chairman, that if we have an  opportunity to pay a billion dollars in Deutschemark debt between  Committee meetings, we ought to go ahead and do it Now, if we are  intervening heavily on the other side, obviously, we are going to be  reporting this [intervention] regularly to the Subcommittee and to the  Committee generally But I would like that larger leeway for the time  being because our main effort now will be directed at repaying debt,  and I think we ought to do that as rapidly as we can    Well, as you know, we report daily to the  Subcommittee on what we have done We are not without surveillance on  any of this    That's what it says    I think we can do it  "
989,1979-04-17," Substantially higher, yes indeed    The fact that we were there and willing to  [intervene] probably increased the flow But I think we would have  had a substantially different exchange rate effect if we had not been  intervening at all and if the Europeans had not been intervening at  all    Yes, they might have been squeezed more if we  had not intervened    Well, there's always a possible parallel If we  try to put a complete lid on the rate, one or two things will happen  Either we will have to acquire a lot of currencies or we will so  convince the market that there is no upside risk in the dollar that  the flows will stop I'm not quite clear which would happen; it could  well be a combination of the two    I think the market has been quite favorably  impressed by the fact that, despite weak aggregates, the System has  stayed steady in the boat as far as the funds rate is concerned I  think a change in that pattern would have a negative effect on the  exchange market How big it would be I really don't know    I think they would The market is more geared  to interest rates than it is to aggregates because interest rates have  a real meaning for currency flows    Yes, I think it would have been a disorderly  market on the up side, which is clearly possible    Well, in the last week or so the flows slowed  There has been no new impetus to it Part of the reason was the fact  that the market got the perception that the Germans didn't want to see  the dollar appreciate any more against the mark That may be  overcome, depending on what happens, and we may again get a  reoccurrence of very large flows back into the dollar But it has  slowed down in the last week    [Statement--see Appendix]    Mr Chairman, I don’t have very much to add  The only thing I would stress is that because we have been in the  forefront of this activity for a very short period of time we were  able to buy $2-3/4 billion in foreign currency Now, that type of  period may not repeat itself, yet it could So to give us flexibility  I would feel much happier if we had more than the $1/2 billion of  leeway, of which we have already used half at the moment  Establishing a limit of $2 billion does not preclude us, in my view,  from doing what we may eventually want to do, but I feel we have to  wait for time, experience, and some testing of markets and other  thinking I believe the memos are fairly self-explanatory and I have  nothing more to add    I don’t think anyone is suggesting pegging, but  the whole November program was based on the thought that the dollar  had gotten out of line, it had gone [down] too far Now, that is a  very rough judgment It’s not pegging    I think that was a collective judgment of the  Administration, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve    Government securities    We cannot hold foreign government liabilities    We can hold private--    I am not a lawyer but my impression is that the  Act described what was typically held by a central bank and it has not  been revised over these many years    There weren’t any    That’s right    It's not prohibited It's just not listed as  one of the assets that we might hold, primarily I think because none  [existed] at the time the Act was written    I think it's that simple    That's right We're trying to be a little more  symmetrical on our asset and liability sides    Well, I would not view this as supporting the  mark or other currencies at a low rate but as maintaining an  appropriate rate for the dollar if we can agree that there is such a  thing    I think [it‘s helpful] if we can accomplish an  appropriate rate for the dollar For example, suppose this afternoon  the mark goes to 2 - l / 2  marks per dollar Is that good for the United  States? I’m taking an exaggerated--     4/17/19 -44-   "
1035,1979-05-22," That's exactly what I was going to say!    It is rather nice to be out of swap debt for the  first time in almost ten years--the first time going back to the pre-  71 period [unintelligible] Swiss franc debt    No, I don't think that will be possible   It might be worthwhile, M r   Chairman, to say a few words  about our market operations on behalf of the Treasury as well as the  Federal Reserve As you know, earlier this year we were sharing with  the Treasury any purchases of Deutschmarks that we made in the market,  typically on a 50/50 basis, although different proportions were used  at different times After the Treasury was able to repay its  remaining swap debt to the Bundesbank in late March, all March  purchases, as noted, were for System account and were used to repay  swap debt After April 27 when that [swap] debt was finally repaid,  all purchases have been to cover the Treasury's Carter bond  indebtedness A total of 5-1/2 billion Deutschmarks were involved in  that and the Treasury had spent 12 billion of that amount in  intervention earlier this year The Treasury has already covered a  billion of that amount That means they only have about 210 million  Deutschmarks to go Once that has been accomplished, I think there  would be a real possibility of the System once again sharing with the  Treasury any Deutschmark purchases That's all I have, Mr Chairman    Oh, yes    Yes All year, up until the time the Treasury  got out of debt, we were sharing    That would mean we would be accumulating The  amount, of course, would depend on what the Committee decides    The accumulation comes very fast on some days  and then it just disappears So I think one can't really take an  average that's meaningful here But the billion Deutschmarks have  been accumulated since April 21, including purchases on April 27     5 / 2 2 / 1 9  -39-    I don't think there is any problem in pushing  the Bundesbank to sell dollars They are quite happy to do that    Which is [some distance] away yet    Mr Chairman, I might just say a word about our  current understanding with the Germans on the accumulation of  Deutschmarks At the very beginning the Germans   At the May BIS  meeting, however, Chairman Miller and Dr Emminger agreed that it     5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -40-   I  understand, too, that Under Secretary Solomon reached an agreement  with the German finance ministry just last week for the United States   That’s for the United States,  either the Treasury or the Federal Reserve I’m not sure that all  these agreements are engraved in stone and there seems to be some  uncertainty as to who agreed to what But I believe that is the  position    The 2 billion I think--    It’s news to the Bundesbank, too So I think  that is left to be discussed But in general the Germans are  agreeable to the United States--the Treasury or the Fed--building up a  certain amount of balances    Now we have reinvestment facilities for--    I think the Bundesbank has said that they have  no problems if it’s a small amount     5/22/79 -41-    I think the idea of the joint intervention  probably would be impressive to the market I start with that As  far as the operational side is concerned, if we can really work out a  flexible system where we keep to the right proportions but not day by  day, I think we can do it But, Gretchen, you may have more  operational problems with this than I'm suggesting There are  operational problems, but I think they're manageable We were able to  do that before with the Japanese when we were intervening on the other  side--when we were acquiring yen we had joint intervention--and I  think it can be done   CHAIRMAXT MILLER Gretchen, any particular comment?    As I understand it--    Of which we have roughly $200 million    It's $800 million    That I don't know But certainly the Japanese  feel that the yen has depreciated far too much It's back toward the  2 0 0  level Whether 2 0 0  is the [right] level I think one has to judge  from what happens in the market    Well, although the Prime Minister said ""go back  to 200,"" they found they couldn't do it And they spent billions    That's the basic underlying problem  "
1144,1979-08-14," Henry, I'd say that clearly inflation would be number one on their minds If we had some good price statistics, that    8/14/79  would help a great deal Second, I think is merchandise trade; third, current account; and fourth, interest rates   Sure they do But right now I think those would be the important things in that order, roughly   I think they normally use the publicly held debt as an estimate "
1196,1979-10-05," Yes, Peter is getting ready to come on Paul,  there is a rumor in the market that I think you ought to hear about  "
1307,1980-02-04," Yes, Mr Chairman I can recall back in the great debate over whether we should have lagged reserve accounting, all sorts of claims were made that it was going to help the Desk tremendously and that the Wednesday [settlement date] would be a stable day in the funds market We at the Desk never believed that But, if it does make a difference for bank relations and on that ground alone it is useful to the banks, then we see no harm in the lagged reserve accounting I feel very much as Peter does that it doesn't make all that much difference It seems to me that the System has introduced enough other changes recently in statistics and in procedures that I see no urgent need, certainly, to go ahead with a    2/4-5/80  move back to contemporaneous reserve accounting Along with Peter, I doubt if it really makes that much difference   Mr Chairman, another compromise would be to take a flexible midpoint Take the [average of the] midpoints from alternatives II and III and say you expect variations around that of 1-1/2 percentage points on either side, as we have in the past "
