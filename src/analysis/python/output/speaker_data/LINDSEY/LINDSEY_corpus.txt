 I might say that, if anything, my views are more extreme than Steve's  No, in preparing these memoranda for the Board, we thoroughly reviewed the literature starting from the early '70s on My own view, which isn't particularly humble, is that the quality of the analysis presented here is much superior to the academic work   That's right For those of you who have the paper, you may turn to Table 7 We did try to construct various experiments that pretended we were on different operating targets with different reserve measures in turn and we asked ourselves What is the minimum amount of variability of money month-to-month and also quarter-to-quarter that one might expect? We used two models under the current institutional structure one developed some years ago by the Board's staff and one recently developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco The results appeared to indicate to us that, looking at month-to-month growth rate deviations of money from a targeted level, about the best we could expect to do under the current institutional structure was a month-to-month growth rate error on the order of, say, 5 to 10 percentage points under any reserve aggregate operating target  That's plus or minus 5 to 10, in terms of a standard error, which means that one-third of the time we would even be outside of that band Those results applied to the nonborrowed reserves and nonborrowed base measures; they both gave very similar results As a result of the supply-side problems that Mr Axilrod discussed earlier, the [errors using] total reserves and total base measures under the current institutional structure were considerably larger than for the nonborrowed measures So, that's the range of error in hitting your month-to-month money target with the current institutional structure The actual misses were a bit above that for M-1A and around the upper end of that range for M-1B Now, those did average out to some extent in the Board's monthly model over quarterly periods, as Mr Axilrod mentioned--a bit more in fact than the actual experience quarterly The Board's monthly model appeared to have errors month-to-month that were about random, so they would tend to cancel out partially as the period under consideration lengthened  With the Board model we did look at a change in the institutional structure both in terms of trying to eliminate the supply-side errors that are susceptible to regulatory changes-- eliminating lagged reserve accounting, making reserve requirements on demand deposits uniform and universal, toward which of course the Monetary Control Act will move us as it's phased in, as well as removing reserve requirements against savings and time deposits And there once again I'm summarizing Mr Axilrod's conclusions, but I'll give you some numerical examples Total reserves improved considerably; in fact, it became the best operating target if rigidly adhered to over a control period, giving an error on the order of 3 percentage points plus or minus two-thirds of the time Also, as Mr Axilrod said, that would imply very significant [interest] rate volatility in response to unexpected shifts in money demand over the control period, which in this case is a month So, it's not clear you'd want to control money that closely But it would be feasible even, I might add, with the kinds of errors that we saw over the last 15 months since October 1979 We did try an example with the kind of graduated [discount] rate structure in the Board model that Mr Axilrod referred to and we did get some improvement--on the order of 2 percentage points--with the nonborrowed reserves and nonborrowed base targets That gives you a sense of the range of variability under different operating targets and different institutional structures month-to-month Looking at annual rates, even under the present    2/2-3/81  operating structure, it looked as though for a 3-month or quarterly period the errors by and large fell into a range of 1 to 2 percentage points in both the San Francisco and the Board models As Mr Axilrod mentioned, the actual errors were somewhat larger than that because there wasn't as much averaging out of the monthly errors in the actual experience as was the case with the models  Well, I was just going to say that in the experiment I referred to we essentially took the monthly model, which has borrowings as a function of the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate and we eliminated--  Essentially without the surcharge Is that what you mean?  Yes What we essentially did was to take account of the effects of the surcharge and other sources of error by surpressing the error in that equation in the model completely What we had, then, was a perfectly known function of borrowing with respect to the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate And what that meant was that it really didn't matter whether the funds rate was a little over the discount rate or a lot over the discount rate in that model simulation because we knew exactly how much borrowing would come out of that And then we just simulated the model accordingly We really didn't address your specific question in that model run We addressed another question, which was How closely could money have been controlled if we had had this graduated discount rate structure that would tend to eliminate the noise in the amount of discount window borrowing as a function of the funds rate/discount rate spread?  That was one we didn't explicitly look at, although we did look at the case where total reserves were simply held fixed And, as Mr Axilrod mentioned, the case where you have the penalty rate--where it is always a penalty or you just close the window to borrowings other than emergency borrowings--you essentially create a total reserves kind of target because nonborrowed and total move together So, in that sense we did examine that second case as well  It is true that over time that $33 billion falls For a month, for example, the random noise in the change is $20 billion So, as time progresses, the range of uncertainty about whether it's random or not narrows  That was weekly; and the $20 billion was for a monthly change  We considered all those issues, except for lengthening the reserve averaging period, in a memo that went to the FOMC about nine months ago   No, we're getting separately on the report of deposits a slip sheet, starting with the first week of introduction and for receipt at the Board with about a 10-day lag or so, the macro amounts in the new MMDA in total And then, as Mr Axilrod is saying, in addition we are asking for some other weekly information on the report of the large banks on the MMDAs with amounts over $100,000 and maturities of seven days or more Similarly, when the Super NOW comes in, we are going to get information on that account for--in our proposal--a temporary period of a month on the report of deposits, which is a universe report, and then subsequently somewhat less frequently on other reports   I will be referring to the package of charts entitled "Materials for Staff Presentation to the FOMC" [Statement-- see Appendix]  Well, in 1982 velocity of M1 fell 56 percent This year it's falling at 5-1/4 percent That was an unprecedented decline in 1982 and there wasn't anything--  Well, that was a fair statement I was thinking post-war period  Well, the quarterly model has an interest elasticity that rises as market rates rise And market rates started out in 1981 at pretty high levels So the quarterly model, as rates came down, picked up a good bit of that increase [in M1] You are correct That's less the case in 1985 when rates started out at lower levels  That's right; nationwide NOWs were introduced at the first of the year  We did, in several respects I plotted velocity relationships for 1-quarter lags as well, but I also plotted moving averages for money growth and for GNP growth--say, 2-quarter moving averages--and then tried different lags on that I had a whole set of charts there Averaging growth over two quarters, it turns out that the connection between M1 and GNP is best with a 1-quarter lag over the '80s, though it isn't great But it's better than the other alternatives we tried In a sense that relationship was reflected in the chart I showed you with the 2-quarter lag in M1's velocity; that gives it a chance to pick up [the relationship], in effect, over the two-quarter period The leading relationships in the '80s, which I am not at all sure are as systematic as the monetarists would have us believe, show up best for M1 and less so for M2 I think part of the reason for a leading relationship there is because when interest rates change, the demand for money gets affected sooner than does spending So, when interest rates change--which some might argue is what really is driving the process--money growth adjusts first and GNP growth adjusts subsequently And it looks as though there's a leading relationship from M1 to GNP even though in some sense the fundamental cause, some would argue, could be the change in interest rates  We have been doing some work on two different kinds of weighted aggregates the divisia aggregates originated by    12/16-17/85  Bill Barnett; and more recently, a Fisher weighted index that in effect uses the turnover rates to weight the various components of M1, or in fact, all transactions deposits So with a very low weight, MMDAs which are checkable and money funds which are checkable are included If you examine that measure's growth in recent years relative to M1 and M1A it cuts the difference almost in half Maybe the best way to summarize the results is that since both M1A and M1 suffer problems over this period, it's also true that this new measure suffers some problems as well We have done work on this I'd be glad to send some of it along in more detail  In effect, the growth rates of the various components are weighted by their share of expenditure in GNP; that is the precise way it's done And that, in turn, is related to their debits divided by their stock or by their turnover You have to make some adjustments to take out financial transactions and currency exchange transactions to get to the GNP transactions that you need But that's the basic idea  We ran the L measure through a St Louis-type so-called reduced-form equation that uses current and lagged quarterly growth rates along with a fiscal variable to predict the current growth in GNP If you look at 1985, the error there in predicting GNP was 33 percentage points; it predicted faster GNP than actually transpired If you look in the paper at the results for some of the other aggregates, though, that [result] is better For example, M1's error was 79 percentage points Interestingly enough, though, debt did almost as badly as M1 in 1985 It missed by 7 percentage points on the growth rate of GNP  There is a little of that reported in the New York District--of tying demand accounts for households to savings and other accounts, such as MMDAs, so that minimum balance requirements are satisfied by the MMDAs and deposits in demand accounts can be minimized I am not sure if that is simpler exactly, but it is a kind of change involving these different accounts   Well, it's looking at borrowings as they relate to the spreads So, what we're looking for is the seasonal in that relationship, not just in the quantity per se As Don said, in that relationship for the total adjustment plus seasonal borrowing we're not able to pick up statistically significant seasonal effects, though they do appear in a seasonal borrowing relationship  In a systematic way, that's what we find  Yes, that's right The daily variation would be much larger than what we've shown here We have looked at this in the past, and we've found that on settlement day over the last few years we have gotten more variation than we did previous to the introduction of CRR in 1984 On the other hand, the quarter-ends (except for the year-ends) seem to be somewhat muted by the two-week period  In some earlier work that we did here, in connection with the evaluation of the new operating procedures in 1980, Peter Tinsley and his colleagues did estimate a borrowing function that, instead of being linear as we've drawn it, showed that as borrowings got to higher and higher levels the associated increase in the funds rate tended to rise faster  On the other hand, there has been some sentiment among commenters on this memorandum, that perhaps in some of the more recent data the relationship bends the other way since, after all, as borrowings increase more and more, each $100 million involves a smaller percentage change So, confronted with two alternatives suggesting the opposite, we took a hard look at these data and just fit a straight line through them   [No transcript record exists of Mr Lindsey's remarks, in which he summarized a memorandum (circulated to the FOMC  -16-    12/15-16/87  on October 29, 1987) that he co-authored with Mr Gillum See appendix for the memorandum and a covering note from Mr Kohn]  Don, do you--  Given the results, my view would be that the [borrowing] relationships have been just as close under the current procedure as they would have been taking it out completely It seems to me that there is a presumption on the part of those who would advocate taking it out that the [statistical] results actually suggested it would improve things to take it out Since the results don't show that, I think the inertia you referred to--having to do with the market misunderstanding, that they've gotten used to what we're doing, and so on--would argue for just standing pat  Well, actually it moved a little in favor of the present procedure If you look on Table B-3 of the memorandum, using the spread as the variable the equation tries to explain, the R square is a little higher--75 versus 70; and the standard error of estimate is a little lower--32 basis points using adjustment plus seasonal borrowing versus, say, 35 basis points using adjustment borrowing alone You could argue that that only comes about because we were examining a regime that had been generated under the current procedure You could argue that if we really had switched some years ago to using only adjustment borrowing, then there might be reason to think that result might have reversed and adjustment borrowing alone might have shown up better But that's pretty speculative and I'm not sure it would be true I would view these as little to choose between, really  Actually, in a sense, we have estimated seasonal factors for the seasonal borrowing Presumably then, one would call that the seasonal component with the rest being the adjustment component That's what we adjusted the total for in the tests I referred to earlier  That, literally, is what we did And when we did that, it didn't make a dime's worth of difference in the results  -20-    12/15-16/87  in terms of the predictability of the funds rate So, we actually made a stab at doing that   Yes, that's $500 [million] Judgmentally, the Desk can come closer than that, but that doesn't [unintelligible] the equation   Right, the staff did a statistical test in which they tried the average of velocity since 1982 as opposed to the average since 1955 And, as Don has indicated, the regression analysis suggests no statistically significant difference between the two So, in this chart we went with the simpler longer-term average   Thank you, Mr Chairman The broader monetary aggregates were somewhat weaker in the latter part of December than allowed for in the FOMC's path and, based on partial data, were decidedly weak in the first seven days of January I should stress both the partial nature of those data and the difficulties of sorting out seasonal patterns in the weeks surrounding year-end Even so, the information in hand suggests declines in M2 and M3 of $8 billion and $8-1/2 billion, respectively, in the week of January 7 Indeed, these preliminary data for the January 7th week would put M2 at a level $2 billion below its fourth-quarter 1990 average level, which serves as the base for the 1991 growth range, and some $14 billion below the path implied by the FOMC's shorter-term expectation of a 4 percent growth rate for November to March We now place M2 growth in December at a 1-1/2 percent rate and project a similar growth rate for January That compares with the expectations just after the FOMC meeting of 2-1/2 and 4-1/4 percent for those two months A little of the unexpected weakness in M2 is in the M1 component and in the overnight RP and Eurodollar components that we have in hand But the bulk of the weakness is in nontransaction retail deposits and particularly in MMDAs and small time deposits This weakness is especially surprising in the case of small time deposits in light of the further declines in market rates to below deposit rates I think there is some question about whether depositors are becoming further concerned about the safety of banking institutions For M3 the preliminary estimate for the week of January 7 is $12 billion below both its fourth-quarter average level and the level consistent with the FOMC's 1 percent path from November to March M3 was virtually flat in December and seems likely to decline at about a 1/2 percent pace in January compared with a positive 3/4 percent average pace implied by the FOMC's path There was some strengthening in institution only money funds in December but, even so, the non-M2 component declined at a 6 percent rate Large time deposits and term RPs at banks continued to run off in association with further moderate expansion in both retail deposits at banks and in bank credit in December We are now estimating bank credit growth for that month at just below 3 percent  Do you mean currency?    1/9/91  We are projecting a considerable pickup for January--on the order of a 13-3/4 percent rate of growth--based on a strong performance early in the month That follows growth at a 6 percent rate in December, which itself was nearly double the November pace  The recent weakness in demand deposits and also in the retail components for the week of the 7th was quite widespread by District  I really don't have very recent information on that  Yes, we did see a turnaround--a $70 million net change--in noncompetitive tenders at the Treasury bill auctions this Monday I think that's consistent with that  Well, of course, there have been complications both because of the year-end and the reduction in reserve requirements Peter Sternlight may wish to comment on the implications of that for the federal funds market As you know, our    1/9/91  interpretation of reserve movements, given the funds rate objective, is that reserves tend to be demand determined and, therefore, even before the reduction in nontransactions reserve requirements, primarily follow movements in transactions deposits I could give you some estimates that we have For December we are showing an increase in total reserves of $19 [percent] Now, that is break-adjusted, abstracting from the change in reserve requirements That is followed by a comparable change projected for January, though that is last week's projection and it may be somewhat lower with the new money numbers  The growth rate in both December and January for total reserves is around a 19 to 20 percent pace  We didn't communicate a final decision to alter the path because my impression from talking to Don was that it was still somewhat tentative as of Fed time yesterday So, we didn't communicate a final decision to change policy until this morning on the conference call  Peter can speak to this, but my impression was that we did communicate to Peter before Fed time a very strong predilection for a final decision to be made to ease but not a final decision itself   Well, I think you could answer "yes" to that question without the results of that research necessarily having any implications for a change in FOMC operating procedures I think Al's letter raised some interesting research issues that ought to be given more attention by the staff of the nation's central bank But I guess in my own mind we have a sufficiently close handle on the Committee's desires and on the relationships at work that it wouldn't imply, therefore, that the Committee ought to alter its operating procedures On the other hand, I would support--this is my personal opinion and Al and Don may disagree--additional research, which to some degree is ongoing in any event We could add a bit more emphasis to it But I'm not sure in my own mind, whatever the results of that work within reasonable boundaries, that it would have any real implications for our operating procedures  Well, I wouldn't draw as tight a link as you did between many or only one ultimate target and the procedures for intermediate targeting and operating targets that might get us there I think one could essentially have the Neal resolution passed, have price stability as our ultimate objective--period, and still end up through a deliberative process deciding that our current operating procedure is probably the most sensible way to get there So, even if there were a clear decision to move to price stability with no ifs, ands, or buts, there would still be these issues as to whether or not the way to get there is more or less doing what we're doing now but with that end in mind  Well, it's true that if you're not taking seriously that long-run objective, then you're not going to get to price stability Lee wouldn't disagree with that  On the other hand, if you are taking that seriously, I'm confident that you could move the funds rate in a manner over time that would get you there  Thank you, Mr Chairman LINDSEY Thank you again, Mr Chairman [Statement-- see Appendix] LINDSEY I agree with Peter's comments LINDSEY I personally started out with that view last week and early this week And I thought particularly that if the Committee were to go down 1/4 point, that is what is expected and it could be done in [the midst of] an auction But after talking to Peter, who yesterday read me a litany of commentators saying it's inconceivable that the Federal Reserve would move during the auction I said "Peter, I realize that's a common view, but is it right?" I was resisting even then I did finally come around to the thought that it would be better not to mix this policy change with the middle of that bidding process So, as I said before, I personally come down 11/5/91 with Peter on this one After having thought about it, I realize there are two sides and I've been on both! LINDSEY Well, let's say that the 1/4 point isn't fully built in Let's say we announce tomorrow and there's a little decline in the yields in the 3-year note To the extent that there is some market reaction, those who went short on the 3-year are going to be hurt and we're going to hear from them There are going to be complaints I think they'll complain more if we move tomorrow than if we move on Friday in the sense that they're going into their bidding on the 3-year note pretty sure that we are going to move on Friday So, they're not as likely to write irate letters even if yields move against them So, there are people who potentially are damaged I should probably let Peter--  Well, as a novice governor, I found this to be a very, very interesting discussion My knowledge is about the same as what was contained in the Greenbook The issue I would like to reflect upon is simply what one does when confronted with the Greenbook's statistical [data] I guess I've been not too long out of a classroom when I was temporarily domiciled in the First District  I'd point out that we have three Virginians sitting here; my colleague was born in Richmond What one would look at first is the probability of being wrong, and I have no reason to dispute the argument that the risks are equally weighted on the up side and the down side from the Greenbook forecast But I'd point out  -26-    12/17/91  that those are economic probabilities only One never knows when another Saddam Hussein might come along, when something might happen in Russia or the Russias, or when something might happen in other parts of the world Those kinds of surprises, while we might wish they were symmetric, probably are not symmetric; they are asymmetric on the down side The implication of that probability is not helpful for solving our problem On the one hand, if the risks are on the down side, that might incline one to ease On the other hand, if the risks are on the down side, one might want to keep one's powder dry in case those risks come true So, on the probabilities side, I have no answer  One has to look at what the penalties are for being wrong on either side On the up side, if the economy turns out to be more robust than we thought, the staff forecast suggests that we're going to have decelerating inflation through '93 in any event In fact, if one looks at the labor market data, the big surprise is not that unemployment is as high as it is but that the rate is as low as it is An analysis that we were presented with yesterday suggests that, using the standard [econometric] model, we're not going to see unemployment peak at 7 percent but at closer to 8 percent We're fortunate that that's not the case; but that suggests that there's probably more labor market slack than otherwise So, if anything, I would say the upside risks are very, very low I don't see the penalty for being wrong, if the economy is stronger, as being very [large] on the inflation side I think the downside [penalty] is great If one looks at what could happen--really, we should compare the September forecast with what we have now--the real downside risk is that we're wrong by two quarters, just as the staff forecast was wrong roughly by two quarters in September That two-quarter error in the forecast of when the recovery would start is 1-1/2 million extra jobs; it's $69 billion in lost output at an annual rate And since that will continue for about 2-1/2 years, the cumulative effect of that is a large number even in Washington Other downside risks include banking problems--we know that there are weak banks out there--and, as Dick Syron mentioned, fiscal policy Whatever they do [on fiscal policy] is not likely to be helpful, and perhaps we should think about positioning ourselves to avoid the downside risks of extreme Congressional action as opposed to modest Congressional action So, in conclusion, Mr Chairman, I would say the probabilities may be equally weighted I would stress the penalties of being wrong They are very modest for stimulus; they're very great if we're too tight  Mr Chairman, I'm happy to be able to support your proposal I am struck, however, by comments from people who are disagreeing with your proposal on both sides The term psychology is used by those who would not favor further easing and my good friend John LaWare has just made the case against further easing but by saying that water torture is going on So, there is a great deal of sentiment at the table--and I'm struck by it--that we have not solved the psychological problem by this proposal That issue may have to be revisited But I am very happy to support your proposal, which I thought was a very well crafted statement of the [FOMC'S] position   I think that we're back to the problem of the law of averages Listening to the comments around the table, on average, the Greenbook is correct But with all respect to our staff, when I did a count I counted five who are more optimistic, five who are more pessimistic, and two who think you're about right It means that on average you're right I think about Mike Kelley's comment to the effect that the consensus is wrong; our dilemma is that we don't know in which direction it is wrong One of the reasons that's true is that we have begun in the legislative and executive arenas to adopt pro-cyclical policies instead of the usual anti-cyclical policies Now, if you'll excuse a witticism In the current environment, pro- cyclical policies mean that when things are bad, act aggressively to make them worse If you look at the particular legislation that has passed, I think the pro-cyclical nature is clear Beginning with the banking legislation Through regulatory fiat and through legislative policy we've adopted banking provisions that, when things start to deteriorate because they feed through into the capital environment, rapidly shrink loans When things begin to turn around and we have rapidly rising capital, either through market values or through the ability of the banks to raise equity we will hopefully, sometime, have a rapidly rising ability for banks to make loans, but right now we're on the down side  -25-    2/4-5/92  It very well could be; my memory doesn't go back that far, Mr Chairman, and unfortunately nor does my history  Yes, that's right; we were fighting you guys back then! [Laughter] In labor markets we also have adopted pro- cyclical policies They were well intentioned, but they have the problem of being pro-cyclical In particular, I point to plant closing legislation which requires substantial advance notice I can understand the humanitarian reasons for doing so, but when the economy starts to turn down, or when we're in a down cycle, a company is forced to announce more plant closings, which has an adverse feed into psychology [and] the confidence factor And if you look at what is happening on Capitol Hill, the other two potentially bad things that will happen if things continue to get worse--and they've already been mentioned--are a gross fiscal stimulus, which will push up long-term bond rates, and a revival of protectionism  We have to think about how to interrupt this pro-cyclical policy The keys have already been mentioned The first is that the public knows that the political apparatus is not working well One can see that in that the purpose of the politicians is to engender confidence The President certainly billed his speech as one to engender confidence and the opposition appropriately called it "warmed over" and said that there was no confidence there Further, if you think about why our December policy was apparently as successful as it was in building confidence--just about everyone commented on that--I think it was because it was decisive  With all that as background, I think that on average the staff forecast is right I don't know which way it is wrong, but I do know that it is wrong I do know that the risks are high on both the up side and on the down side And the proper policy call is that we should be as flexible as possible and should be prepared to take on the risks whether it turns out that we're wrong up or wrong down In addition to being flexible, we should also learn the lesson of December and we should act decisively when we act But in which direction that action should be, I share the Vice Chairman's view I don't know Thank you  Thank you I'm going to be distributing a picture of what President Black and I will be proposing Mr Chairman, while that picture is going around the table, I'd like to begin with an apology It had been my intent this morning to wear the Thomas Jefferson tie that Alan Murray made famous following the last FOMC meeting But I got dressed in the dark because I didn't want to wake my wife, and it turned out that I pulled out my Adam Smith tie instead of my Thomas Jefferson tie I was embarrassed, but Bob Black has reassured me that had Smith lived on this side of the Atlantic he no doubt would have chosen Virginia And he also no doubt would have preferred the "Tunnel Option" With that aside--  It's the "Invisible Tunnel"  [Statement and charts entitled "The Virginia Plan"--see Appendix]  Mr Chairman, I understand very much your sentiments Let me say that, looking at the picture, I forgot the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words Regrettably, the picture that I have in front of you, which from my point of view is for presentation purposes, is in error It was based upon preadjusted M2 Am I correct in saying that we had 31 percent growth last year?  Actually, therefore, this box should be substantially closer to the middle of the target range, ie, 06 percentage point closer Further, if we adopt President Black's suggestion, with which I agree completely, the tunnel would be widened to 2-1/2 percentage points on either side and we would be a full 11 percentage point above the bottom end of the target range That wouldn't be close by any measure So, the picture as presented--which by the way is not even to scale but is illustrative--actually should show our starting point as somewhere very close to the middle of the bottom half of the target range That's the only correction I have in that presentation  Probably, and I would be happy to be corrected by President Black on this We were in the middle of this period of uncertainty If I were to select a period of more stable velocity, I probably would have to go back further; and if I were to go back further, I'd be incorporating more base drift in there I would be incorporating so much base drift that the picture wouldn't look very sensible So, I will admit to arbitrariness in the selection I was basing it, really, on the statement of this Committee last quarter which said it was our [objective] to move back toward the middle of our 1991 target range So, five months ago we were willing to say that we should be where that middle line is  You know, Ohio has been part of Virginia, too!  Mr Chairman, I share President Black's good grace, and I concur with the obvious consensus for alternative I With regard to where we end up in that range I'd like to avoid a normative statement and make a positive statement If we do not get the velocity shock, if the staff forecast of inflation is correct, and if in fact the economy has resumed growth as we think it might have  -47-    2/4-5/92  because of the money in the pipeline, then two meetings from now with 28 percent real economic growth we will not only be in the upper half of the target range, we will be at the very top of the target range And I would be very interested in what the Committee decides in May should that come to pass Thank you  Mr Chairman, I am in concurrence with your view The one thing we all know is that we don't know And given that the uncertainties are high, we [ought] to go to the normal kind of analysis, which is a loss function I think the loss function is much greater on the down side than on the up side Secondly, [we need to ask] "How easily can we correct policy?" Again, it's much easier to correct policy if we are surprised on the up side than if we're surprised on the down side So, I think you selected exactly the right course of action  -58-    2/4-5/92   Mike, would you refresh our memories on what the fiscal policy assumption was in the Greenbook?   Mr Chairman, I must say that in my six years in Washington I have never worked with such a modest group of people We have talked this morning about the improvement in optimism in the last few months We've also talked about the derailing of what could have been a disastrous fiscal package I think my colleagues are much too modest; we should have patted ourselves on the back I think the decision that was made in December is one of the main reasons for the rise in optimism; had that decision not been made, I think we would be facing a much less pleasant fiscal situation today So, I believe we have much to commend ourselves for, although you are all too modest to say it  I'd also like to commend the staff I think the Greenbook forecast is certainly the most likely outcome and is also one in which the risks are about balanced I also think the conclusion of the Greenbook that the disinflation process is continuing is one that is easily buttressed by the data--Governor Mullins stated it quite well-- the survey data on forward rates, the strong dollar, and commodity prices Indeed, I would be positively ebullient--in fact I was three weeks ago--but my concern at the moment has to do with what has happened recently with M2 growth It has fallen It is going to continue to fall Using the projections in the [Bluebook] we will have had from the fourth quarter through March 41 percent M2 growth and through June we will have had 38 percent M2 growth That is well below the midpoint of the target range I don't think that is necessarily a disaster, but it is something that raises cause for concern I think one has to take into account not only the fact that the risks are balanced but also what is involved if we're wrong M2  -28-    3/31/92  is signaling an economic risk, which is the risk of perhaps another failure of the economy Confidence would be very severely damaged, and I think we would see a replay of the headlines we saw last year that the Federal Reserve no longer has clout over the economy and that monetary policy has failed In reality what I think has happened is that the desired debt reductions have lowered the effective elasticities on monetary policy and, therefore, greater policy action is needed I think those elasticities would fall further and monetary policy would in fact be weakened if we had a collapse of confidence again and a recurrence of recession  There's another factor about which I'd like to speak briefly Let's put ourselves a year from now and say that the economy in fact has not improved and we are in a second dip or what have you We shouldn't look at political risks except with regard to how they affect the independence of our judgment And one concern we should have has to do with changes that are going to come in this election Yesterday our staff briefed us about the British election and said that there's going to be a hung Parliament I think there are a lot of people who would like to see a hung Congress as well at this point I don't know whether the devils we're going to come to know are going to be any better or worse than the devils we now know But the fact is we know those devils and we don't know what the new devils are going to do If we have a turnover of a quarter to a third of the House and similar types of numbers in the Senate, we would have to be concerned about developing relationships with a new group of people who may not know of our independence In fact, we take a higher risk next year I would think we'd want to be able to look back and have them look back on our performance as one that is commendable and beyond reproach because, while they may get bounced because of rubber checks, we face some risk in that process as well Therefore, I think we have to be very concerned about the risks on the down side and we should probably keep our policy as it was following the last meeting I think alternative A is probably unnecessary Alternative B has the advantages of staying the course, but I do think we have to keep our guns loaded The downside losses, should the economy begin to dip back into a recession, could be quite severe not only for the economy but for this institution And I think the problems in Japan that were mentioned by several of my colleagues only reinforce the need to keep our guns loaded Thank you  Mr Chairman, I support your preference for asymmetric I think we want our words to be both precious and prescient, the words I heard earlier And like Don, I've taken to carrying my calculator I have M2 growth through the end of March from the fourth quarter at 23 percent  From the fourth quarter base and also it is to the end of March  It's 25 percent? Okay I think that we will be both precious and prescient in our words if we keep that in mind  I think it goes up to 1988 now  You have to help me with my memory on this As I recall from the last time this issue came up, if there was a felony involved in this, a suspension is automatic, isn't it?  Thank you for that information  Mike, in the forecast you have an implicit decline in long nominal rates  Explicit decline, excuse me! I forgot where it was in the Greenbook Yet long rates seem to [be stuck in] a trading range; I think we all find them awfully stubborn Suppose they stay in the same trading range How much risk is there to the forecast if there is no decline over the next year in long rates?  I thought it was in support of gold $10 below wherever it is now!  Mr Chairman, growing up I never thought I'd be an economist; I didn't know what an economist was I think my mother is still waiting for me to make something of my life and go to law school! But I always liked math and I liked history and I found them together in economics And my first comment is on math  I don't think anyone thinks velocity is stable on a quarter- to-quarter basis In fact, on a distributional basis using the 120 quarters from 1961 to 1990, there is a 7-1/2 percent chance of velocity being more than 3 and an 183 percent chance of velocity being more than 2 And if you use lagged velocity, I have a distributed lag function where the odds are even greater than that 292 percent for having a velocity shock of more than 2 percent So, I think what we're seeing now is very much in line with historical averages on the up side One need only to think back to the early 1980s I wasn't here, but I've looked at the numbers; there was a very strong negative velocity shock on the order of perhaps 2-1/2 or 3 percent a year So, I don't know if we really want to abandon velocity just because it's unstable on a quarter-to-quarter basis I agree with President Melzer's comment in fact that it's over long periods of time that M2 and the M2 velocity relationship are stable Of course, that means that if we're going to have 4-1/2 percent nominal GDP growth and we have a year and a half of 2-1/2 percent M2 growth, that we should be equally comfortable with a year and a half of 6-1/2 percent M2 growth If one is willing to let [M2 growth] go to 2 or 1-1/2 or 1 percent, one should also be willing to let it go to 7 or 7-1/2 or 8 percent for an equally long period of time on the other side So, the real question is whether or not we want to use money as a policy variable in constraining [the economy] The point is that velocity is stable over the long run, so we're going to have a bounceback Indeed, all the explanations we've heard this morning suggest that that's the case Don Kohn yesterday mentioned that if we include the yield curve we can explain perhaps a 1-1/2 point velocity shock I don't think anyone thinks the yield curve is going to remain as steep as it is now It's going to bounce back and so will velocity How about the flight from CDs? Well, certainly, it isn't going to go on forever; eventually CDs would go down to zero and then [the decline] would have to stop My suspicion is that CDs probably will catch on at some point in the future and money will flow back into CDs So, again, we have to think about the fact that in the long term we have a stable relationship here M2 growth of 2-1/2 percent is not a long-term sustainable rate of growth How long we want to tolerate it in the short run is something we might want to debate But no one says that it's a short-term parameter That's the math lesson  The history lesson is one that I was debating about, but my contrariness juices really got flowing I heard a wholesale abandonment of money here this morning and that takes three [forms]; (1) money doesn't matter; (2) banking weakness is also not a monetary phenomenon; and (3) that one [assesses] monetary ease by looking at interest rates and not money growth I happen to have these quotes from history; we've been here before As to the first that money  -31-    5/19/92  doesn't matter These events "shattered the long-held belief, which had been strengthened during the 1920s, that monetary forces were important elements in the cyclical process and that monetary policy was a potent instrument for promoting economic stability Opinion shifted almost to the opposite extreme, that 'money doesn't matter' that it's a passive factor which chiefly reflects the effects of other forces" That was Friedman and Schwartz They went on to say that there was a tendency--this is again in the early '30s--to regard bank failures and contraction of deposits "as regrettable consequences of bad management and bad banking practices or as inevitable reactions to prior speculative excesses,"--Where have I heard that before--"or as a consequence but hardly a cause of the financial and economic collapse" of the time And finally, regarding nominal interest rates, a gentleman named Sprague who was a consultant to the Fed--and this was in February 1931--wrote that the Fed concluded that an aggressive easy money policy was practically out of the question in the United States "for there is no general acceptance of view in this country that additional good loans and additional good investments are available at a lower rate of interest" And continuing on the line that short-term nominal rates are a measure of policy, the Annual Report of the Fed in 1930 said "The Federal Reserve pursued a policy of monetary ease" in the last year In 1931 it said "The credit policy of the Federal Reserve System in the first nine months was directed toward the furtherance of easy credit conditions, as indicated by further reductions in rates on discounts and acceptances" And finally in 1932--this is over a period in which money shrank by a third-- "Conditions in the open market for short-term money were relatively easy throughout the year and in the latter part money rates declined to exceptionally low levels" We've been there before My suspicion is, and my fear is, that we might be there again I certainly hope not And finally, this is from the FOMC statement of October 1935 and suggests that inflation is always a fear we have "The Committee cannot fail to recognize that the rapid growth of bank deposits and bank reserves in the past year and a half is building up a credit base which may be very difficult to control if undue credit expansion should become evident" They were worried about it in 1935  With regard to existing conditions, clearly we're on a good path I'm not sure that an easing at this time is the right thing to do, but whenever I see the kind of wholesale abandonment of monetary aggregates that I heard this morning I get nervous So, I'd rather have the gun loaded, Mr Chairman  Do you have our average target for that period?  Very internal!  Could I follow up on Jerry Jordan's question? At what point do you predict that the leveling off of velocity will occur?  -37-    5/19/92  Could we call that a continuing response to the steepness of the yield curve?  What happens when the yield curve starts to level out?  Mr Chairman, I understand from your logic that we should keep our options open That is a very compelling case One of the first things I learned at my first [Committee] meeting was that the "would/mights" were not an insect but in fact inhabit our monetary halls This sounds to me as not a "would/might" situation but a "would/would" situation I think we want a symmetric directive but want to keep our options open to indicate that we [are prepared] to respond to economic data So, in stating my opinion, perhaps I'm asking a question Does your suggestion for symmetry mean a "would/would" directive or a "might/might" directive?  Then I would recommend the "would/would" as an approach if we want symmetry  I'm sorry, Mr Chairman, I asked a question but I never stated my view I'd just like to indicate my preference for the record, especially since I see that my colleague to my left has me down as favoring symmetric My preference would be for asymmetric  Okay  Could you tell us where to turn to read that sentence, please?  I'm sorry, Chairman Greenspan "Contemplated reserves conditions"  Mr Chairman, if the numbers are 2-1/2 and  -46-    5/19/92  1-1/2 percent, I'd question the word "resumption" Are we talking about a resumption to 2-1/2?  This doesn't make a lot of sense  We don't have growth in M2, so I suppose we are open for a resumption  So the phrasing would be?   I'm always struck by the purchasing power parity basis Further weakness in the dollar just doesn't seem justified Has that theory of exchange rates been routed or are we neglecting it? Why isn't that showing through in the markets?  What I'd like to do is to summarize briefly what I think I have learned since our last meeting in May It is summed up well in the aggregate; that is, I think the staff have very well assimilated all the data that came out into their forecast While quantitatively the forecast reflects some modest weakening, we still have a 2 percent quarter projected for the second quarter and some minor downward revisions in the future Those downward revisions anticipate that real GDP at the end of the second quarter next year will be about $14-1/2 billion lower than [projected previously] And I think that's a fairly good summation of how much weakening we've seen Although I call that a modest quantitative weakening, I'm somewhat concerned about the qualitative weakening that lies behind the numbers Personal consumption expenditures will be about $20 billion lower Contrast that with a rise in inventories of $12 billion I think what we've seen is a more modest quantitative reduction that masks a substantial qualitative weakening in the economy Much of the growth that is there is moving away from final demand and is moving toward business accumulation of inventories and faster business investment That very well may come to pass, but we are gambling, I think, on a riskier scenario Inventories and investment are necessarily riskier components of demand than is something like consumption Quantitatively, that involves something like 170,000 fewer houses, 13 percent less, and payroll employment that's about 650,000 less or about 06 of a percent of the work force So, that's the magnitude And I think it sums up well the amount of weakening we've seen in the economy since the last forecast I'd also point out that the anecdotal information we have gathered here today suggests that the quarter has ended on a weaker note than it began We were all somewhat more sanguine about the economic forecast at the last meeting than we are now, and the anecdotal evidence from around the country suggests that in fact the economy is weakening in June relative to what it was earlier  -31-    6/30-7/1/92  The second set of data that we've learned is that we've had two tests of market reaction to what I would call basically "monetary policy developments" The first came immediately after the last FOMC meeting on May 19 with the publication in The Wall Street Journal of the Wessel piece which described our reaction as having been one of going toward symmetry At the close on May 21, the 1-year note was up 25 basis points, the 3-year note was up 30 basis points, the 10-year note was up 19 basis points, and the 30-year bond was up 9 basis points on the publication of the Wessel story That is one test--and I admit no test is perfect--of how the market responded to our presumed decision to go with a symmetric directive rather than the asymmetric directive that preceded it The other economic test came last Wednesday when the President had his interview with The New York Times and the paper published what is obviously rather public pressure on us to [ease] The 1-year rate fell 11 basis points, the 3-year rate fell 11 basis points, the 10-year 5 basis points, and the 30-year 2 basis points So, I think that gives us some idea of the likely market reaction to what we might do Those are the two economic things I think we've learned  The political lesson we've learned is one that I wish we hadn't learned I was privileged to be able to meet with the Reserve Bank presidents up in Baltimore and I predicted that we were going to be coming under increasing political risk I think the Chairman mentioned that earlier in his comments Well, I think we saw the political risk in the President's comments Frankly, I didn't like it much So, this weekend I began contemplating how we might respond to that political risk If this were Saturday, I might be quite tempted to want to stand strong in spite of what I think is evidence of weakening economic activity Governor Kelley pointed out some key advantages to our standing [firm] I couldn't imagine a better test for us to establish credibility We have not only a Presidential statement but since the Beltway is within the Fifth District and I've worked there, I've studied the matter rather closely This was a very unusual development for this Administration They got everybody together to give background interviews So, it was a pretty public act of pressure on us We'd clearly establish credibility if we stood tall  Second, there have been arguments around the table which may have merit--but on balance I think they're probably wrong, though I'm quite uncertain about my own views--that we might be at a juncture, an unusual juncture, where an increase in short rates may actually help M2 growth The idea there is that we would stop the runoff into nonbank depositories And as someone who is very concerned about M2, although I don't agree with that description of the sign of the elasticity, I'm willing to admit that I might be wrong I couldn't imagine a better [time] to experiment than right now [and to be] wrong And thirdly, standing tall might have another advantage It's amazing when I go out [in public] that everyone thinks we know something that nobody else does Given the amount of disagreement around this table, it's unclear that we know anything, but they all think we know something that nobody else does And perhaps a sign of strength on our part might be a signal that in fact the economy is recovering; it may be a self-fulfilling prophecy that might get things going    6/30-7/1/92  So, I think the political lesson is that we are at an unusual juncture Were we to stand tall--perhaps we could even raise rates and, who knows, really show our independence--we might produce some very desirable results We might have a tremendous bond market rally and that could get the economy going I have to view that as a long shot, though But it's a long shot with a high payoff I haven't played golf in 15 years, so I'm not going to get into golf analogies but it would sound to me a bit like shooting a double eagle Would that make sense? I'm a more conservative player and I think our real risks are very much along the lines of what President Corrigan said And I think we have to get it right We're not being asked to hit a home run or a hole-in-one, but we are being asked to get a par, not a bogey On net I would have to go back to my economic training and to what I think were both market tests to our behavior and also the overall weakening that's epitomized in the change in the staff forecast I would be inclined as a result of that to reject my instincts to act tough and do what the economy says to me, and that is I'd be inclined to ease  Mr Chairman, I think you have laid out a very good strategy for the approach to our Humphrey-Hawkins report Based on the conversation and particularly President Parry's question, I would like to note that from an a priori view we may know something There are really three possibilities that we're considering, which have to do with the money demand curve shifting because of loan repayments or runoffs of time deposits or what have you The first possibility is that the shift in the demand curve is of a temporary nature and it will shift back That means we believe small time  -38-    6/30-7/1/92  deposits, for example, may come back in vogue in the future or that bank margins somehow may [go] back down If that's the case, then velocity will also bounce back and we are going to need a symmetric tolerance of M2 growth down the road I think that gets to the heart of Jerry Jordan's question The second possibility is that we have a permanent demand shift and we're going to see at some unknown point in the future a new equilibrium emerge between the banking sector and other financial intermediaries, with permanently higher bank margins If that's the case, then velocity will not bounce back but it will stop growing and we'll establish a new velocity relationship but not one where we have this continual 3 percent growth in velocity And in that case our M2 targets are going to have to be roughly what our nominal GNP targets are The third possibility is what I would call a continual demand shift that forevermore we're going to see loan repayments and runoffs of small time deposits That would mean velocity will always be shifting We'll have, say, 3 percent velocity shifts every year In that case, we should permanently lower our money targets Frankly, I find the continual demand shift model incredible If nothing else, there are only so many time deposits to run off; there are only so many loans to be repaid But I think [the shift] will actually stop before that So, I think we're torn between the temporary demand shift and the permanent demand shift models I believe that informs our discussion and if anything, Mr Chairman, it reinforces the view that you have just expressed  Mr Chairman, let me ask a question I probably misunderstood what you said the first time in light of your later comments, particularly your answer to Governor Angell If in fact we go up [to Congress] and say that we are uncertain about where things are temporarily, that's one thing The question I have is If we think, as you suggested, that a continual demand shift may be going on, then aren't we really throwing monetary aggregates out the window on a permanent basis?  So, you would expect within the foreseeable future that we would be back to some kind of stable money/income relationship?  Is it your expectation that that will be by '93 perhaps?  My third question about what you were saying is Are you going up there with no anchor at all? In other words, if you say that temporarily we're not looking at M2, I think Milton Friedman and others have--  Oh, good Okay  Mr Chairman, I think confusion demonstrates why you're such a wonderful person to represent the Fed  Well, I mean you managed to convince us all I must admit I'm puzzled but--  In view of the fact that you are on the other side of the table I'm not surprised I look forward to seeing your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Mr Chairman, in a tactical sense [Laughter] But I appreciate your answer to the question and that we're not abandoning M2  Okay  Mr Chairman, I very much appreciate your efforts to find a consensus What has struck me about the challenge  -73-    6/30-7/1/92  to the independence of the Federal Reserve is a need for us to speak with one voice as much as possible Frankly, I find myself torn between your recommendation, which I will support, and President Jordan's recommendation which I also could support were he chairman! [Laughter] The reason I think his argument is compelling and I think your argument is compelling is that I believe both will end up iterating in the same direction But we face tremendous uncertainties, tremendous challenges, both in the economic arena and in the political arena And I would hope that your search for a consensus would produce one in this Committee because I do realize that the challenges you personally have ahead of you in the next month are great  It's 2 percent for M2 and 1/2 percent for M3; that's what 2 and 1/2 mean; there are two lines  Do we have to have the "contemplated" sentence in there? Does the law require us to have a sentence that says "the contemplated reserve conditions"?  Why don't we drop the whole issue since we're addressing it elsewhere?   Dave, you mentioned some uncertainty about the unemployment rate forecast and, certainly, there is some If we were probabilistic about this, what do you think the chances are that the unemployment rate will hit 8 percent?  I was trying to get a feel for your sense of the risks in the forecast Whether they're balanced or not is one question; whether they're diffused or not is another  Right, it leaves the less efficient workers unemployed!  Given that there's this large stock out there, does everyone come in and redeem them the same day? If so, where does the state get the money?  But the flow of that savings is over 12 months  Thank you, Mr Chairman I woke up in a good mood and then I heard these words listless, torpid, mixed, slowing, softer, sluggish, shrinking, flat, lousy, and sour That was the report The only good news was from Minneapolis I read recently that TIAA is 40 percent owner of that mall And given some of the trash they bought in the First District, I'm glad that at least something is running well I don't know how much I'm going to stake on that  I agree with Tom Melzer that we err when we look too much at the real economy What I learned was that we were supposed to look at nominal GDP as our ultimate target objective and that money, particularly M2, might be a good intermediate target--which may not be true so much anymore--but that was only because it was a good guide to nominal GDP When I look at that, I see we just ended over two years of nominal GDP growth at the 4-1/4 percent level and now it's dropping down to the 3-1/2 percent level at least for two quarters And 3-1/2 percent is summed up as listless, deteriorating, mixed, slow, exhausted, sluggish, etc; it's lousy It is a number that is below any of our forecasts In my view it should be sending off alarm bells as to what we are doing to the economy We cannot control the mix between real and inflation, but we can control the sum of the two And 3-1/2 percent is not the right sum in my mind With all respect to Dr LaWare, if I were on the operating table, I wouldn't want to counsel patience The patient after all is the US economy Sitting  -33-    8/18/92  back and waiting for the outcome, when the outcome could be quite bad, is not something I would advise  Therefore, I share the sentiments expressed here that our likely next move is a cut in nominal interest rates The question is whether to do it now or later The case for later I think is a good one We have all kinds of risks out there in the next three or four months Bill's report included the possibility that Germany may raise the Lombard rate I'm not an expert on this, but my bet would be that that will cause a European currency crisis The French are voting on Maastricht on September 20th; the polls are all moving in the direction of defeat As a little follow-up, the Danes recently had a poll last week asking people how they would vote now on Maastricht and it was booted down 57 to 43, an even wider margin The pound is now below where it was when we were certain that Kinnick would be the next Prime Minister The Financial Times Stock Exchange [Index] is down; it has lost all of its gains since the election; there is certainly a possibility of a pound crisis There's always a possibility of a lire crisis The Japanese market is weak, down another 4 percent The likely reaction to that is going to be an easing by the Japanese, which will put downward pressure on the yen They've reacted to that by selling dollars and that is not going to help our situation We have our own stock market problem There is also the possibility of instability in any part of the world I would add to Governor Mullins's list the USSR We recently had a briefing by a friend of mine who is an oil market operator and he pointed out that we risk an oil supply shock due to unrest in the USSR That certainly has not been factored into the market So, those are all reasons to wait  The best reason to [move] now I thought was summed up in Bill [McDonough's] report The best time to act is when we surprise the markets And because everyone "knows" we would never act this week, that may be the best time to act I am agnostic on when we're going to act, but I would give long odds that the proper next move will be a cut  Mr Chairman, I will support your directive However, I'd like to associate myself with the views of Presidents Forrestal, Keehn, and Hoenig There is the number of bullets and also the quality of bullets I think a little bullet shot now because it's unexpected would have a big effect So, had you not expressed your view, I would have been inclined to favor "A" and shoot 1/4 point now   I'd like to ask Ted and Mike a statistical question We know that the things we don't measure well are exports and imports Anecdotally, when I was in San Francisco lately, I was on the Fisherman's Wharf on a Sunday and I heard German, I heard French, and I heard lots and lots of Japanese When I'm on an airplane, I'm one of the few Americans in the first class section Howard Banks just wrote a piece saying it was cheaper for a Brit to spend a long weekend in New York than a long weekend in Paris We have all this anecdotal evidence An expression I heard that sums it up best is "We've become the world's Wal-Mart" Now, with all these tourists packing their suitcases full of Gucci and whatever else they buy on Fifth Avenue, isn't it possible that we are seeing a miscalculation of the effect of the dollar and that a lot of what we're picking up as consumption might actually be exports?  Right But if our fundamental domestic economy is weaker than we think but the dollar is having a bigger effect than we think--  Right  Right  -11-    10/6/92  Not if they buy the goods that are in their suitcases  I had two thoughts One was on the economy and was prompted by something Mike Kelley said; the second was on the financial markets Twenty years ago I was sitting in freshmen economics with Samuelson's Eighth Edition, and the first thing we were taught was something called the "paradox of thrift" The paradox of thrift was the 1972--or probably the 1952--way of saying "balance sheet restructuring will lead to less economic activity" When I thought of Governor Kelley becoming impatient, all I could think of was Keynes's famous quip about how in the long run we are all dead And that was, in fact, the response  Well, we've been trying to unlearn Keynesian economics for the last 20 years and that may have been a mistake because, in fact, I think it's probably very close to the situation we're in now with balance sheet restructuring in part caused by this mismatch that Jerry Jordan just spoke of between inflation expectations and our inflationary reality As for the economy, I think that's clearly in lousy shape, and my normal training would say we should move to ease  -37-    10/6/92  The second thing I'd like to talk about is financial markets Yesterday, frankly, I had a bit of an epiphany I hope these things don't happen too much in life I looked very closely at what happened in both the foreign exchange market and the stock market I can tell exactly what happened in the stock market because I've set up my telerate to do that I couldn't tell [exactly] in the foreign exchange market but it was close The stock market bottomed at minus 100 and something at exactly 1129 am And it looked as if the foreign exchange markets did a similar thing What is important about 1129 am? Well, that's Fed time and the markets woke up and said "Oh, they're not coming in" I assume that's what they did I don't know what else is important about 1129 am; maybe it was just one data point and so I have an R-squared of one But it looked pretty convincing to me It's also where we hit the circuit breaker  SPEAKER(?) Yes, they hit the 100-point circuit breaker  It worked anyway So, I think yesterday the market was telling us that their bet was we weren't in Looking at the numbers, I also agree exactly with Joan and Bill's analysis that a 25 basis point reduction is factored into the market So, I have to say I'm confused because on the one hand the market already has us in and on the other hand the market is telling us not to come in The only way I can work that out--and I worked it out to my own satisfaction overnight, if not to anyone else's--was that I had your model in mind What the market is not telling us is whether to tighten or ease It's telling us something else and that is whether this organization is in reactive mode or what I would call deliberative mode If you watch the pattern of the market's reaction to our not moving Friday and the pattern of its reaction to our not moving yesterday, the relief came because we weren't panicked We were waiting for this every sixth-week meeting and we were actually going to sit down and talk through rationally what we were going to do And I think the markets were applauding us for having done that Now, again, it doesn't answer what we should do; but it does say that we get rewarded for being deliberative and not reacting to the latest employment report So, that was my epiphany  Now, what should we do? I think, frankly, that our next move is going to be to ease It might be because there is a sharp break in the market and we have to move in to the stem the gap--something like the October '87 [episode], perhaps I hope that's not the case because then we are back to the reactive mode It might be because, as Ed Boehne said, the Fed should be viewed as doing anything we reasonably can in the face of the current economic statistics, which are bad That could be reactive or it could be deliberative The question is When do we move? Option one is to wait for the new Administration, until January 20th or later Clearly, the next Administration is going to need help no matter who wins the election We're going to have a fiscal stimulus which is going to send long rates up; and while fiscal policy is going to be more stimulative, I think its quality is going to go down, in particular with regard to getting small business and employment taxes I think health care is going to be hit no matter who wins the election And while it's good for us in the long run, it's lousy for the health care industry in the short run and that's one of the few growth industries we have So,  -38-    10/6/92  we're going to add our hospitals to the layoff lists next year That's a case for waiting until January, when [the economy is] going to need help We could wait until after the election but before January; I wouldn't recommend that It's going to be a time of maximum uncertainty largely because appointments are going to be coming out at a rate of about one every two or three days I would not want our actions to be interpreted as applauding or rejecting particular nominees, say, for Secretary of the Treasury The other possibility is to act now at this meeting I believe that's the commendable course of action Even if I don't know what the rules are on our specifying a time-- whether or not we have to vote to do it today--I think we should take the action here at this meeting and not leave it to random events in the future I think the odds that we will be [easing] before the next meeting are overwhelming I think it will come either from a stock market break or because the economic statistics will make it imperative for us to do so Given that choice and given that reality, I think we should be deliberative and not reactive and we should vote to ease here today  Mr Chairman, it may be that epiphanies only happen rarely; it's probably good for the soul that it's that way I looked at the list of upcoming indicators and I have to say I agree with President Parry I don't see one that would convince me any more than the discussion that we had around the table today as to what shape the economy is in The major statistic coming out is industrial production; we know what that is; that's going to be released a week from Friday The other two big indicators are the PPI and the CPI I don't think they really give us a--  Yes, you're right Again, what I think we should do is for this Committee to establish the guidelines; that decision should be made here [today] because we're being gamed very much the way the European central banks were being gamed With each major statistic that comes out, people take sides; [people talk about] the possibility that someone may have some inside knowledge or rumors spread that someone has it and that's going to affect Fed actions; that is what is driving markets Frankly, I think that's increasing the instability in the markets And the way to restore stability to the markets in part is to have this body make decisions and have a fixed date rather than an effectively random date for taking actions One particular area of instability that has been mentioned is the foreign exchange market, and that is an area of concern But I would make two observations First of all, to the extent we have a concern about the foreign exchange market, it would not fit into the paradigm of strongly asymmetric because the only "cure" that we would come up with would be an increase in rates, and I don't see that coming Also, I think the fundamentals are quite different here in the United States I think the United States is like France and not like Italy or the UK in that we do not have an obviously overvalued currency; quite frankly, we have an undervalued currency So, for both of those reasons I don't think the foreign exchange instability is a reason for not acting now I think we ought to make the decision here In my mind that decision could even be a contingent decision contingent on having over 400,000 or whatever you would like in the initial unemployment claims or a CPI under 3 percent But I really think there's an advantage in our making the decision here today, and that would be my very strong preference  Yes   Mr Chairman, I saw a good advertisement last night; unfortunately it was [unintelligible] and I don't know what company it was for But I do remember the scene It was something about predicting the future In walked two scruffy characters who looked like Attila the Hun and the witch doctor They dumped a bunch of bones on the table out of their bag and made some appropriate grunts I must say, having seen the economic indicators go up a little and go down a little, I feel a bit like one of those two gentlemen  The good-looking one! I share very much the attitudes that have been expressed in that I think the tone of the data looks a little better than last time But what has really changed are attitudes; attitudes are much better Here is where I get nervous because of the old saying "once burned, twice shy;" this might be the third time we've been burned The first time was the Saddam Hussein defeat when we had a big boost in attitudes The second time was after our rate cut last December when there was a big improvement in attitudes And now we have a new President and a big improvement in attitudes I don't know whether attitudes are going to translate into real changes If I have a disagreement with the staff forecast, it has to do with what I expect to occur in the early part of next year, particularly with regard to fiscal policy I remember the 1981 tax cut from being inside [the Administration] I think what is being proposed today is not that dissimilar Essentially, the big proposal earlier was an acceleration of depreciation deductions rather than an increase in the investment tax credit The present value of the tax incentive, though, is roughly the same Three events resulted from that [earlier tax cut] that we should keep in mind The first is that the first relative price change you induce when you impose an ITC is that you lower the price of old capital relative to new capital, ie the stock market declines The second factor to remember is that there is a delay before investment picks up There was a very substantial delay in 1982; we waited almost 12 months to see an investment pickup after the new depreciation deductions came into play I think that's very consistent with the econometric evidence But the expectations in the market are that the investment will happen almost immediately and therefore we will see a rise in near-term and intermediate-term interest rates well before investment picks up And the third factor to keep in mind is that tax bills never get through quickly even when it looks as if the President has a mandate as he did in 1980 and as he does this time Everyone promises that things are going to be speedy It's worth remembering that the 1981 bill almost passed and then got bogged down; it actually got new impetus only after the President was shot and, therefore, a "second honeymoon" occurred I don't expect that to happen this time but, again, it  -12-    11/17/92  takes a major, major amount of movement to change tax legislation; that shouldn't be underestimated  There are, in fact, two worse situations this time with regard to what is likely to happen The first is that we do not have safe harbor leasing in the current proposal The safe harbor leasing allowed loss-making or non tax-paying firms to be able to get tax advantages That will not be the case this time Secondly, we have a much tougher minimum tax in place which, in fact, is proposed to be increased under "putting people first" Those companies paying the minimum tax are essentially investment intensive firms Therefore, that's a further complication Where I think that would play out is not in what will happen after the bill is passed but in delaying the passage of the bill The Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has particular industries he is concerned about; the various power players have particular industries; and right now every Big Eight accounting firm is doing very good business with clients to calculate exactly what the changes in the tax law have to be in order to encourage investment in that firm I would say Don't expect anything quickly  So, I'm more pessimistic about the start of the year I think what we're going to see is a stock market decline, a rise in intermediate-term interest rates, and no fiscal stimulus I think that's going to lead to a sense of disappointment We're going to see the continuing layoffs that people mentioned GM is on the line And, Jerry, I would ask the same question about IBM I notice [its stock price] is now down to 65; the last time I looked it was at 85 We're going to see continuing weakness abroad We have the possibility of collapse in Russia this winter And we always have the Middle East So, to [abuse] a phrase, maybe what we're seeing is "deja voodoo," in line with Attila the Hun and the witch doctor We've been here twice before and I would not be overly optimistic since all we're seeing, really, is an improvement in attitudes  Mr Chairman, I think the issues are linked  Can they be discussed simultaneously?  It is my view that the issue of the ranges for next year and the short-term decision with regard to fed funds are linked issues I was wondering if it were possible to discuss them simultaneously  Okay  I'd like to start with the interest rate issue I wasn't going to originally, but I was interested in Bill McDonough's comments and I don't mean to dispute them The entire yield curve bottomed out on the day of the last FOMC meeting Since then three- month bill rates are up 30 basis points; one-year rates are up 51  -33-    11/17/92  points; three-year rates are up 73 points; five-year rates are up 65 basis points; and ten-year rates are up 56 basis points The headline in The Wall Street Journal, Section C, on October 7th said "Treasury prices fall sharply on failure of Fed to cut rates and worries about new supply" On October 8th the headline was "Treasury prices plunge on continued failure of Fed to ease, hedging of unsold corporates" Then we got a little rally on the 8th and the headline on the 9th was "Bond prices finished higher on stronger dollar and renewed hopes for Fed interest rate cut" Then October 13th, that fine weekend that we all remember, started with Friday's headline about your talk in Virginia, Mr Chairman "Treasuries climb as Greenspan leaves door open for pre-auction easing" On the 15th it said "Treasuries are mixed amid disappointment over economic reports and lack of Fed move" Now, as a Republican, I'd love to blame it all on Bill Clinton, but I can't I have five headlines that tell me the opposite Now, maybe they don't know what they're talking about but--  Media bias in this case, okay My first thought is about the direction of what the market is expecting I will give a copy of the articles to those who want them My mind was on headlines So, Mr Chairman, when you were making your proposal, I jotted down a few headlines [that might be used] if we were to cut the ranges and not cut the fed funds rate I started first thinking about John Berry's piece--I don't know where he got it--about "The Fed gives Clinton the green light" Well, since The Washington Post is always right, they would have to change it to "Fed changes signal from green to red" For the Daily News, in honor of New York, I had a more provocative headline--I don't think Mort Zuckerman's ownership will change things--"Fed gives Clinton the finger" Then, in Section C of The Wall Street Journal the headline of these stories would be "Fed changes range to match policy miss" and the first sentence would be "Having failed to achieve its monetary policy targets during a recession year, the Federal Reserve today announced that it would change its targets rather than change its policy" I could imagine how the rest of the story would go  I am very persuaded that the right thing to do here is to send the right long-term signal and send the right short-term signal as well The story I would like to see is the green light We should accommodate what the Administration wants to do and that is to give the economy a kick to get going But that should be followed with "but we will not let it get out of hand" And that is exactly what a cut in the funds rate coupled with a cut in the target range signals  The final issue is whether to do it now or in February I hear the comments about it being less politically risky to do it in February when Congress is back Frankly, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me If we were to announce a cut in the target range in February just after President Clinton has made his speech to Congress or perhaps just after one of the houses of Congress has passed a fiscal stimulus package, I think The Washington Post might even pick up the Daily News headline I think it would be that provocative So, if we're going to do anything, I would do it now What I would do is give the markets the right long-term signal and coat it with a little sugar to give the Administration the right short-term signal  -34-    11/17/92  I'm for a cut in the range  I'm willing to be persuaded either way  Mr Chairman, I think there are two issues here One is the deliberative process and the other is timeliness I think the deliberative process has to be preserved at all cost because otherwise there's just no way we're going to come to a candid decision Looking at other situations, I think the public mood is that people like timeliness of information For example, the Bundesbank holds a public hearing right after their meeting Or when a Congressman comes to meet the President in the Oval Office or the Cabinet Room, the press is there at the very start and everyone is sitting around joking The press leaves; they do their deliberations; and then afterwards they hold a press conference That way the public has the sense that they have timely information on what was decided but the deliberative process isn't compromised So, in reaching our decision right now maybe we have a problem in that we're providing no deliberativeness and no timeliness We are somewhat subject to criticism on timeliness because our decision "dribbles out" and creates the appearance that there are unfair advantages Maybe what we should do is move to the timeliness option   Mike, I'm a little concerned about the signals we're going to be getting next year if we have a particular fiscal twist If I listen to Little Rock right, what we should be doing is moving social spending off the government's books and onto the books of businesses Let's suppose we did that; say there is $50 billion less fiscal spending but mandated benefits of the same amount I think of that as something like a lump sum labor tax In my mind the markets would interpret that as fiscal contraction and rates would drop, but at the same time we would be seeing costs rise and perhaps we'd be getting higher inflation numbers as a result Is that a reasonable interpretation of what we'd be seeing?  No, it's a "what if" question  Would that cause a net increase in measured inflation rates?  In an ideal world, shouldn't it be a wash?  Bill, I don't see that [issue raised] at all in the newspapers It is rather strange I see references to a chance of fiscal contraction or $25 billion in extra spending, but I don't see that mentioned at all as a possibility  Mr Chairman, 1992 has been a great year and it's too bad we didn't enjoy it until December! But now that we have a President that the Washington Post credited with the upward revision of the October retail sales data and who has an expansion named after him that started in the third quarter of the year before he took office, I think we all should just hang it up and go on vacation! I wasn't going to say anything, but I'm going to anyway As a way of introduction, Don Kohn talked at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony about a tax-free, regulation-free enterprise zone at the North Pole and then introduced me as the Fed's only certified supply-sider and, therefore, the person who should talk about it So, I'm going to take that tack  I have to agree with a lot of the comments here that (a) quarter-to-quarter projections are hard to make and that (b) if anything, we should be biased at the moment toward a slightly faster expansion in the quarters ahead But I'd like to look down the road just a little at what I think are some of the problems headed this way First, I'll pull out my supply-sider's list of longer-term problems this economy was facing in May 1990; it is a list that I was asked to create in my last job before the current recession began The three that were on that list were the expansion of OSHA that occurred in the Bush Administration; the Clean Air Act; and wetlands Just to show how important these can be in terms of our hitting a brick wall, I'll relate a story from who comes from Wisconsin As a biased Easterner, I always think of Wisconsin as a place where housing inflation should never occur But he tells of tremendous housing inflation in Wisconsin because of a shortage of nonwet land to build on They've had something like 12 to 15 percent house price inflation up there, which means that what they are hitting really is supply constraints That as well as clean air are going to be examples of our hitting supply constraints earlier than we otherwise would  The second area of supply shock I see comes from labor market changes I think labor market legislation is made all the easier during a period of expansion, so I think we're going to see striker replacement legislation, an increase in the minimum wage, and even more aggressive Civil Rights legislation, all of which are going to put upward pressure quickly on costs in the labor market Finally, I think the chances of a supply shock on the international side are high I agree with the forecast that the dollar is going to rise and that our trade deficit is going to increase, and the supply-side result of that is increased protectionism--probably starting as a game, but one never knows when it will get out of hand All of these factors suggest that, if anything, what we're going to see is an increase in measured inflation sooner than we otherwise would expect But what is different about it, and what I hope we keep in mind in 1993, is that inflation induced from these factors is not a monetary phenomenon It is a one-time increase in costs that will ultimately be played out in the form of lower GDP So, my wish for 1993 is that    12/22/92  the staff forecast is right; but my fear for 1993 is that, if anything, we're going to see more inflation sooner than we'd like, and I'm afraid we're not going to react properly to it  If I could pursue what Don said, and maybe the General Counsel would like to comment Are we precluded from announcing a nominal GDP target?  -25-    12/22/92  Oh, I see Your view is that we're not mandated by law as opposed to not allowed by the law  Okay  The advantage of nominal GDP targeting, especially if we allow a range, is that we're not driven to guessing whether this is a positive supply shock or a negative one Jerry, I'm a little surprised by your negative comments on nominal GDP targeting  Let's say, for instance, that we had nominal GDP growth over 6-1/2 percent What would be your policy prescription for such a result?  Mr Chairman, if my colleague wants to change 200 basis points to get us out of the habit of being at 3 percent, I'm afraid the Dow is going to get out of the habit of being at 3000, too But "B" symmetric is clearly the right move   Mr Chairman, I am more optimistic than the staff about 1993 and more pessimistic than the staff about 1994 Two meetings ago I made a comment regarding the difference between the expectation of fiscal policy and the reality of fiscal policy I'm trying to think how an academic would put it delicately, but I think I got the coefficients right and the sign wrong I had been anticipating that there would be an expectation of stimulus without the reality Instead, what I think we have is the expectation of deficit reduction without the reality As a result we got a fall in interest rates, particularly on the long end, buoyant attitudes, and yet no bite from either tax increases or spending cuts I, as a gambler, would say that the deficit reduction package isn't going to happen And I get that feeling from everyone I talk to inside the Beltway I'm not a big believer in conventional wisdom about anything that happens inside the Beltway, and that's what we're talking about here First of all, I think the Administration is sincere In Mr Panetta and Mrs Rivlin in particular I can't imagine more sincere deficit cutters Unfortunately, when we go down the list and compare it to whom they're going to have to offend, it gets tough Someone, a good friend inside the Administration, told me that the February 17th date was picked because they had to get out of this endless circle of not being able to find something to cut and it was a way of imposing a deadline on themselves Students of political history remember that  -28-    2/2-3/93  Ronald Reagan did this very, very effectively But that's why we're having it inside the Administration If you look at anyone on the Hill such as the trade associations and the truckers, they have the xeroxes all lined up to go out as soon as February 17th's speech is over about how you can't raise gas taxes without putting it into a trust fund and infrastructure improvement I'm sure AARP has their February flyers all ready to go Even the recent experience with gays in the military shows that Congress won; they know it and they're feeling their muscles So if I may mix some metaphors, I heard here today that the deficit reduction train is moving on fumes and Wall Street is inhaling  My other fear, Mr Chairman, has to do with the supply side I have some fears about what is happening in that regard I think the $10 billion tax number is almost a mind-boggling one--$10 billion more in tax receipts largely because of expectations of what is going to happen To put that in context, $10 billion is about 2-1/2 percent of all personal tax receipts But a more meaningful number is that it's close to 15 percent of tax receipts from people making over $200,000 Another way of looking at it is that it is larger than the combined annual gains we would get by putting in both the 36 percent bracket and the millionaire surcharge So, we're talking about big swings in fiscal policy in the anticipation of what's about to come Second, Labor Secretary Reisch mentioned a minimum wage That was the first time I heard that one I'd heard of it being indexed but the word [he used] was "increase" I think that's a sign that adverse supply side policies are in the making Finally, just before this meeting, I met with Griff Garwood who's in charge of the Consumer and Community Affairs Division [here at the Board]--this would be a seasonally adjusted factor--and he mentioned three agencies that want to talk to us about ideas that we would not consider good ideas I'll leave it at that All three of those agencies do not have their political appointees in place I remember this from when I signed on in the Bush Administration on January 31st The first thing that confronts you is a pile of absolutely horrible ideas that are percolated up from bureaucracy My sense is that that pile of ideas is not under control So my fears are, first of all, that the market is going to be disappointed with what is actually going to happen on deficit reduction I don't know when that will happen, but when it does I could see a rise in real rates Second, and this will be a longer- term effect, as supply side effects take effect growth and employment gains will become more difficult And I'm afraid that's going to lead to increased frustration in the Administration and Congress And that unfortunately is where monetary policy is going to come into the story  Don, at Monday's staff briefing, you mentioned something that did not come up in your answer earlier to President Boehne It has to do with what happens to M2 when there are capital losses in stock and bond funds We had an experience of that in 1986 I was wondering if you thought that might be another reason why M2 growth might in fact be better  -35-    2/2-3/93  Mr Chairman, I think your point is well taken; this is largely a political decision Politically, I think we can all agree that 5-1/2 percent nominal GDP is good, so it won't cause us any trouble And I understand your case for lowering the average range 1/2 point I would suggest a slightly different twist If I were going to go out there and with a straight face use these M2 ranges as a political signal, the signal that I would send is that the first thing we want to do is to prevent a relapse into recession And second, I would want to signal a willingness to prevent a resurgence of inflation That adds up to me that what we want to do is cut the top end to, say, 5-1/2 percent and leave the bottom end at 2-1/2 percent If we really believe what we're saying about 3-1/2 percent velocity, then 5-1/2 plus 3-1/2 is 9 percent nominal GDP growth I can't imagine anyone seriously thinking they would support a policy of 9 percent nominal GDP On the other hand, 2-1/2 plus 3-1/2 gives us 6 percent GDP, which is only 1/2 point higher than where we think we were last year So, I would say that if we believe the forecast, what we want to do is maintain the bottom end of the range and cut the top end of the range  There's a second possibility and that is that it's not wholly a political issue I would recommend the NBER Conference Papers, though I was not able to attend the conference Academic economists-- it's almost a shock compared to what we're thinking--not only want us to focus more on M2 and nominal GDP but they actually have quarterly adjustment processes; [they suggest] that we should look at what happened last quarter to determine what we should do with money next quarter And that is so far from what we're talking about at this table--  And reality But given that academic economists can be our most important constituency when times get tough, if we are moving that far out of the academic ranges, we should be a little concerned I have the numbers in front of me It was pointed out earlier that in the last 7 years on a quarterly basis there have been only 3 out of 28 quarters where velocity has been more than 3-1/2; there have been only 5 when velocity has been more than 3 I would think that, if anything, the conditions that led to a large velocity shock last year are less in place than they are this year As President Jordan said yesterday, we've had no big increases in the narrower monetary aggregates In addition, there's more bank aggressiveness, not less, going on Restructuring has occurred more, not less, than a year ago And we've already seen a substantial amount of CD runoff So, I would say that if we want to avoid what  -42-    2/2-3/93  Jerry Corrigan was afraid of, and that is an outcome outside our range of expectations, we'd want to have a range of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent That's just to throw another option on the table  A narrower band   Given the sentence on what we're expecting in  regard to velocity, shouldn't we also make it clear that if those  expected velocities come to pass we would expect M2 to be at the lower  end of the target range?     Mr Chairman, I will vote for "B" symmetric I am thinking about aiming down It's one thing to shoot a dog, and I love dogs It's another thing to shoot yourself in the foot, which is  -57-    2/2-3/93  a bit lower still So, that may be a case for "A" rather than "B," but they are all down to me  How little is the change?  That's little  I was going to speak in support [of the work done]; I thought the document was very good My only comment was on your side comment about Mr Kaufman's idea I'm a great believer in the providence of the President of the United States I don't see any reason why we should have any objection to the President of the United States meeting us whenever he deemed it appropriate I don't think we should invite such a meeting and I would not necessarily counsel the President to meet us frequently, but I don't see any reason why we should not be open to that  I doubt it too, yes  -64-    2/2-3/93 -65-  David, I wasn't sure whether your comment reflected that   Mr Chairman, I have two very small but specific suggestions for the second point about growing our way out [of the deficit] I think what you ought to say is that to inflate our way out is not [possible] Further down in that paragraph you stated that productivity increases will not change the federal debt outcome I would say that productivity increases, absent spending restraints, will not change the federal debt outcome The reason I say that is that the new activity with respect to real income growth is quite high, on the order of 13 percent The reason that down the road it will not bear on the deficit is that the spending growth [unintelligible] So, I would propose those two very specific changes  What you're saying is that the programs may be more than we expect because they're underestimated by the committee or--  And the Congress will add new [spending] programs I think that's yet another reason to put in the words "absent spending constraints" because that's exactly where the shortfall--  Yes  Mr Chairman, one specific question you might get is on the $11 billion--the proposal that is supposed to come from rejiggering the term structure of Treasury offerings  That's more than 100 percent of the spending reduction, which is the proposal--  Well, net, there is almost no spending reduction in the proposal The spending increases cover the spending reductions pretty much Another way of doing it, I think, is that it's one of the few areas-- If you look at most of the spending reductions, they're actually user fees  But I think it is going to come to you--it's a monetary policy question--as Do you find that $11 billion a plausible number?  I'm going to argue in my presentation, though, that there is a feedback effect from the lower interest rates, particularly in real terms--that the future strength of the economy and the fiscal reductions in the out years did in the markets' mind shift back aggregate demand for constant real rates such that the ensuing real rate declines helped to mitigate those fears, giving investors a sense that the economy could continue growing at more or less a moderate pace I also think, going back several years, that clearly the decline in inflation expectations has played a role as well LINDSEY Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] LINDSEY Oh well, I'll fill in for Don I do think the alternative sentence that we gave for the directive concedes that the meaning of that table for policy implementation is not what it used to be when M2 relative to the Committee's expectations truly was a factor in decisions to alter the degree of pressure on reserve positions or the federal funds rate It was not the only consideration but it was an important one in a way that one can't say is still the case today So in that sense I think your insight is a correct one The next question you also asked is Okay, what other intermediate target variable then do we use as a substitute for M2? If I knew of one, I'd supply it But I'm not sure there is a unique alternative intermediate target that could play that role, at least -38- 3/23/93 for a time Down the road I think there's a chance that M2 or some other, possibly redefined, aggregate might show itself worthy of reasserting that kind of role But I can't say that I can offer one today for you LINDSEY Well, let me take a minute to answer that question because it is complicated First of all, the answer depends on the lag that you look at Here we're simply going out four months to midyear There I think the evidence is pretty clear that we've got the sign right Around the ends of the two prior years the System eased and we got big increases in money growth in February of the succeeding years Indeed, it was such a large effect that we're now saying we think X-11 distorted our seasonal factors So, I think over the short run, given the lags and how quickly deposit rates adjust downward, there clearly is an effect from the narrowing of the opportunity costs and inflows particularly into liquid accounts So in answer to that part of your question I would say I'm confident of the signs for these near-term effects It gets tougher as you go out for a year You'll recall in the February Bluebook that we put together simulations that did show that a decline in the federal funds rate would tend to increase the rate of M2 growth over a year's time You, I recall, asked Don if he thought that was reasonable and his answer was--I'm paraphrasing it--that it's questionable in the sense that we had to make the intermediate-term rate adjust down faster in response to a funds rate [decline] than is standard in the quarterly model in order to get a result like that If you allow the intermediate rate to come down with the speed that we did in that simulation then, yes, M2 will increase We used the Feinman/Porter model for that simulation; that's the result we got It is interesting, as Governor Angell pointed out at that meeting, that nominal GDP [growth] was more responsive to the decline in the funds rate than was M2 In other words velocity in that simulation tended to rise when we lowered the funds rate Nevertheless, that simulation was based on the Feinman/Porter model with an extraneous assumption about how long rates react to movements in short rates Finally, and I'll try to keep this very short, my own view is quite different from the Feinman/Porter model My own view is that that model attributes too much to interest rate spreads and attributes, therefore, too little effect to reductions in short rates over time; it has a very small interest elasticity because there are certain variables that it doesn't embody at all And it seems to me that those variables were at work over that period pushing M2 down at the same time our easing moves were tending to support M2 In my view, the model doesn't fully appreciate the support that we were giving to M2 through our easings because it isn't quite rich enough to capture the omitted variables -39- 3/23/93 So, my own personal answer to your question is Yes, even over a year's time, there is an appreciable interest sensitivity to M2  It wasn't just that the dollar didn't strengthen, the dollar weakened precipitously on the cut in German interest rates I'm glad I wasn't in the classroom that day to try to explain it to my students Do you have any other thoughts on why that happened?  Are those stronger hands bond funds?  Mr Chairman, I think the comments to this point really reflect the divisions that we're seeing It's almost a  -32-    3/23/93  dissonance So, I ask myself What's wrong with this picture? We have a soggy economy and rising CPI numbers We have a Greenbook that says one thing and Blue Chip forecasts that say another We have commodity prices pointing toward a boom and a dollar which is weaker than it should be given the current economic situation On the other hand, we have a bond market rally and [weakness in] M2 What I have to conclude from that is that we're probably looking at the wrong things What I'm struck by as I go around the country--and this is how I tend to piece it together--are the regional [variations] in the current economic situation What does that signal to me? It might mean that we could have a version of stagflation, but more likely-- well, let me sum it up this way The statistic called the unemployment rate outside of California--not to pick on a particular state but it's a good state to pick on when it's down--is 67 percent That's a lot closer to NAIRU than our 7 percent sounds And I suppose if we could pick out other states such as Connecticut, it would help us get the number down closer to NAIRU In other words, in many markets of the country we are closer to what we call full employment than we seem to be when we look at a 7 percent unemployment rate [for the nation] That might be why we're starting to see the CPI pick up a little My mind was changed last week when I was in the Third District, which I never think of as a particularly booming district But a number of comments were made to me One was by I've already told this to my colleagues [on the Board]--a man I've never viewed as an inflation hawk I was sitting next to him at lunch and asked him what his forecast was And he thought that we easily would have 4 percent inflation this year He's worried about labor market [pressures] picking up Then I spoke to the dean of the school; he is a macroeconomist who has to negotiate His theory goes something like this--again we're looking for what's wrong with this picture That we have a change in attitude [Unintelligible] workers have been rehired; the airlines have been told that they're going to receive loan guarantees; we saw what I thought was a humorous spectacle of going to the Administration and urging them not to impose import quotas In other words, the tough guys are out and the easy guys are in and now's our chance to grab something I don't know how much [credence] to put in that, but it does signal to me that when there is the capacity for people to ask for a greater wage settlement than they otherwise would or [for firms] to raise prices, the kind of hesitancy that we may have seen in the '80s is no longer there  My objective function is to maximize long-term growth It seems to me that we might be nearing a point, and it might be today, where if a stitch in time saves 9, maybe 25 stitches today will save us 200 down the road If that's the case, I would much rather see us signal that we are concerned about these inflation numbers than take another chance and find that maybe in 6 months time we do not have a 3 percent fed funds rate but a 5 or 6 percent rate That's [unintelligible] from Larry Lindsey anyway!  A question, if I could Mr Chairman, if we got a 5 [increase] for the next CPI or, say, a couple of 4s for the next two CPI numbers released before the next meeting, would you consider that sufficient evidence?  If I could just ask a follow-up to that I share what you said about the CPI I wonder what the bond markets' reaction would be to our not responding to, say, a 5 number or 4 or even 3  Mr Chairman, I listened to what you said, and unlike Governor Angell, I'm not the fool who sees it the way it is; I'm probably the fool who sees it wrong! You stated, and I agree, that we now have an unsustainably low federal funds rate You also stated that at some point in the future we're going to have to move and move aggressively You also pointed out that slowing down an overheating economy through monetary policy is expensive You mentioned inventories; you mentioned that 400 basis points would slow down real investment, and I agree with you--  And we are not now talking about a rapid expansion of credit?  I think you're right on all counts, Mr Chairman, but if we have an unsustainably low [fed funds] rate, wouldn't it be better to have a mild move now? The mechanism by which I see that being translated into the real economy is that, frankly, I think we have overextended financial markets I think you said so yourself; you said you would be quitting the bond market right now And you said that the stock market is quite high There's probably not a lot of real effect from 25 basis points on the fed funds rate I do think, though, that it is a signal to those markets that perhaps we think they are overextended And I would rather raise the fed funds rate 25 points now to put a little cold water on them than to be in a situation in a few months where we might have to raise it significantly more Again, I am saying that with full respect for your judgment, which is far greater than mine I'm lucky that I am just a governor and not chairman; that perhaps gives me more freedom of movement  When it comes to other [developments that people] mentioned that are holding us back, fiscal policy and the international situation were mentioned As for fiscal policy, this year the fiscal policy situation is not contractive In fact, they've decided to postpone the tax increase in order to make it that way The timing is probably smart from their perspective With regard to international policy, the transmission mechanism from international weakness should be a strengthening dollar That is what is going to restrain inflation in this country and it is not happening And I am very concerned that it is not happening When industrial production is rising 3 or 4 percent at an annual rate in this country and is falling at a 3 or 4 percent annual rate in every other country in the world, to have the dollar unchanged should be sending out alarm bells So, I am not persuaded that those two factors, which should normally hold back inflation, are going to hold it back  Finally, the real reason that decided me to jump off the deep end and join my colleague is the point he just made When I joined the Fed I had to go through the cells in my brain and ruthlessly rip out all those I had learned in college that said inflation is really okay And I prepared a speech in which I wrote down every reason why I thought price stability was crucial Unfortunately, I have now given that speech so many times that I actually believe it [Laughter] The point is that what we are really saying--every one of us around the table said it, perhaps by indirection--is that it's fine as long as inflation does not accelerate, meaning that 3 or 4 percent is fine Well, that should not be acceptable to anyone here Three percent inflation is not acceptable In fact, it's in my speech; I have managed to convince myself that 3 percent inflation is not acceptable Furthermore, if it goes back up to 4 percent, then we go back to the situation where we ask what was gained by the last 5 years of monetary tightness And the answer is absolutely nothing And our friends out there who were my former professors will say "You see, we told you so You can't hold inflation down; you can try for a little while at tremendous cost to the economy; but you can't hold it down permanently" So again, Mr Chairman, I have tremendous respect for your point of view and I know I'm voting in a tiny minority but I have managed to convince myself that at this point long-term economic  -46-    3/23/93  growth without inflation can best be had with a small rise, maybe 1/8 point, in the fed funds rate  "C"  Oh, I don't care Yes, it looks fine  Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] LINDSEY We have attempted to construct an M2 plus mutual funds We've tried to define the bond and stock mutual fund component of that aggregate as consistent with M2 by pulling out the IRA/Keogh components of bond and stock funds and also institutional holdings, which unfortunately are reported to us only once a year We, therefore, have had to interpolate The most recent data we have for this measure are through March They show that whereas M2 has fallen since December, M2 plus mutual funds was about flat in January and February before jumping up to a 67 percent rate of growth in March As you may remember, M2 growth for all of last year was 18 percent and growth of this broader measure was about 4-1/2 percent or so LINDSEY Well, they are not absolute but our guess was that banks would tend more or less as a knee-jerk reaction to maintain the spread, given the opportunity Presumably, at some point those spreads would come down but I'm not sure it would be tomorrow if the FOMC decides to move up the funds rate LINDSEY The problem is that there are a lot of other things going on If you held everything else equal and affected borrowing by $200 million, that would have a big effect LINDSEY Oh, my goodness! [Laughter] You're approaching zero or near double-digits, I think, with that kind of change Maybe that's slightly exaggerated LINDSEY Well, around current levels, [we estimate that a change of] $25 million in the borrowing level will have a 50 basis point effect So, you're talking almost 10 times that much  Mr Chairman, to what extent is it your judgment that the success that day was due to the fact that it was largely not trade or even capital fundamentals but senior administration official statements that were driving the market?  Well, before having driven the dollar down and that, therefore, we were successful with our intervention  Thinking of a supply shock more broadly, one would include in that an upward revision to inflationary expectations; in a sense that would worsen the possible combination of output and inflation  Mike, this morning's Wall Street Journal said that the health care package would involve a 9 percent payroll tax for extending benefits--7 percent on employers and 2 percent on employees Assuming this were enacted, how would we think that 7 percent tax would be reflected in terms of prices versus lower nominal wages?  Why wouldn't that be perceived as a positive demand shock then? Because it's either higher real compensation if you lump workers and beneficiaries together and what you're saying is that profits would eat it for a while Why wouldn't that be a positive boost for consumption?  Mr Chairman, I have one disagreement with the Greenbook The Greenbook implicitly has a reduction in inflation from a 46 percent rate over the first four months to 26 percent in the next eight months in order to get to the new higher inflation forecast Again, I respect the talents of the people involved, but that seems like an awfully steep deceleration of inflation in order to get to the new [forecast of] 33 percent for the year I think the reason that we've had the higher inflation was well argued by you, Mr Chairman It is expectations-based You ran through a better list than I could mandated benefits, strike replacement, calls for a higher minimum wage, re-hiring of workers; that's for labor For management, there's protectionism, protectionism, and protectionism along with loan guarantees for our failing industries such as airlines So, no matter whose side you're on, labor or management, there is Uncle Sam to stand behind you  You asked for another reason why inflation might be there I'm going to give it to you I don't mean to say that this is a dominant reason It's not one that people in this room are familiar with It goes back to the redistribution of income literature I doubt many people in this room are readers of "Nation" or "American Prospect" I would hope not anyway I read this literature some years ago as part of my research for my doctoral dissertation You can also look up Ira Magaziner's writings on this The most unspoken part of the health care plan is its redistribution elements Right now, effectively, health care is a lump sum tax It's $4,000 per worker on the payroll, paid over to the health insurance company What is going to change, and the only question is to what degree, is that it is now going to become what is effectively a proportional tax; it's payroll based Those are very different because income is distributed [unevenly] Now, when we are talking about a shift of 14 percent of GDP in the income among various quintiles, that will dwarf whatever Reagan has accomplished by a big factor, and in reverse  There is a good reason to believe--in fact I can argue four reasons--that at least in the intermediate term such a redistribution is likely to be inflationary The first comes from the higher tax on the wealthy Now, in the short run at least, we would expect some of  -25-    5/18/93  that higher tax to come out of savings That might not be true in the longer run; but certainly in the short run the part from the higher taxed people will come out of savings On the other hand, for the lower taxed people it's more likely to augment consumption So on the demand side the redistribution effect of the burden of health care costs is liable to increase demand via increased consumption On the supply side there are also two reasons to suspect inflation The first is the "classic" supply side argument that when you move from a lump sum tax to a proportional tax what you're going to get is less output And if you think about both the substitution effects and the income effects, they're both going in the same direction I'd assume that with, God forbid, another 9 percent payroll tax, the typical worker will be pushing 50 percent as a marginal rate And people in this room will probably be at around the 65 percent area for the marginal rate That is a whopping substitution effect On the income effect side, if you no longer have to work to service a $4,000 bill, you will get less work on the other end as well The other supply side reason why an intentional redistribution is liable to be inflationary has to do with the Keynesian argument about nominal wages being sticky Effectively, a low cost worker for whom [a firm is] now paying $4,000 in health care is entitled to a raise And the unions representing that individual certainly will make that point So, I think nominal wages will rise at the lower end Indeed, it will reverse probably two decades of declines in real wages at the lower end On the other hand, for those who are taxed more--who will cost management more to hire--[firms] actually would have to force a decline in the nominal wage of those people That would involve, say, middle management on up In a 7 or 8 percent inflation environment that would be easy You'd simply hold nominal wage increases down In a 3 percent inflation environment, you're not going to have nominal wage cuts So, what you're going to have is a bit of a wage/price spiral, with rising wages for workers and insufficiently falling real wages for management So, for all four of those reasons--again, one can go back in the literature even from the '20s about redistribution and its effect on inflation--it all adds up Now, I'm not saying that's what is causing it But we all know the health care story is on our minds and it might be one reason at least to explain why, [given] the supply shock, the higher [inflation] expectations might actually turn out to be rational  Just a question  Mr Chairman, last time you argued very eloquently against an asymmetric directive because of the costs involved I was wondering what has [changed]  Well, I can't say it as well as you did last time, but the case against an asymmetric directive last time was that there are fixed costs in our putting out [such a] directive And in fact you persuaded me actually to dissent So it's relevant  I have to agree with what President Parry just said If what we have is psychology, we want to deal psychology a death blow I think that is [best] done at a meeting and I would suggest now  I think we have another problem Governor Angell and I may have more of a problem than anybody else; on Friday our dissents [at the March FOMC meeting] will come out And it will be obvious that the Committee considered a move and rejected it again at this meeting So, I would again say that the best thing to do, if in fact what we have is psychology at work, is to [vote for] an increase at this meeting   Conceptually, why does that differ? People couldn't write a check against the capital gains of 10 years ago, to use your phrase They can now Isn't it really the innovation, the nature of the consumer product, that has made us more suspicious that this is M2-related? So [why] wouldn't a stock-adjustment-type [process] or looking just at flows be appropriate?  But, again, to use the analogy of the capital gains that happened 10 years ago, [then] I may have been in that fund for reasons other than liquidity reasons whereas today I might put money in that fund for more liquidity oriented motives That in my mind would be a reason for counting the flows in today or stock adjusting at some point I agree with you that it is not a step function, but clearly the product is different today than it was 10 years ago, and some kind of adjustment might be [appropriate]  What are your bets on what the market will do after the Japanese elections on the 18th?  So, a weak government is pretty much built into the market right now?  [You said] "workers' comp" That's workmen's compensation?  Mike, Chart 13, the capital-labor cost ratio, is an exciting chart, if I'm reading it correctly I don't know if I am or not  If I interpret this correctly, between '88 and '94, say, the relative price of capital, the user cost of capital, has fallen 40 percent relative to the wage rate, roughly Am I reading it correctly?  Do you have an historic series on this?  Is this an unusual amount of change?  If you're talking about computer prices, okay But when you use cost of capital, there are some tax effects and interest rates and weighted cost of equity and debt and things like that in there And the compensation rate is something like an hourly wage rate?  And this has been falling like that since the '70s?  Well, it also forecasts problems in the labor market  That's a part of it, but what's the good rule of thumb for cross elasticity substitution?  Even a tiny number there when you've got a 40 percent decline is going to knock a heck of a lot off employment  They are, yes My heavens! Thank you  When the crush is off, you can send me a copy I would appreciate it  Yes  Because the internal flows--  But what surprises me--I understand with computers--but in the cost of capital equation [1 minus] ITC minus tau z over 1 minus [tau], the only things that have changed would be either a rise in the real term or a fall in the true depreciation of plant and equipment The tax variables haven't changed since 1988 I suppose--I made a quick calculation--that if you took a seven-year piece of equipment, the [unintelligible] has gone up 19 percent in real terms, but that's going to work through to maybe a 6 or 7 percent  -17-    7/6-7/93  change in user cost over that time out of 40 percent So, Jerry, I think all the computer effect would have to be in the [unintelligible] You're saying that computers have caused the real return of capital to rise  Right, right  See, you weren't last!  I thought the Chart Show was very, very interesting, particularly on why inflation has picked up It reminded me a bit of the story of a tenth here or a tenth there and that pretty much explains it Interestingly, Charlie Schultz when he was explaining what happened in the Carter Administration described something very similar He said suppose we raise the minimum wage, what's that going to cost us? He estimated about a tenth And the next idea to come down the track will cost about a tenth So a tenth here and a tenth there sounds pretty much like what happened in 1978 It adds up, though The staff has raised its forecast for 1993 inflation by seven-tenths On average at this table we've raised ours five-tenths And the Michigan survey is up six-tenths This is all from the beginning of the year I think we also should look a little bit at other prices Jerry Jordan mentioned that farm land prices are going up I also sense that--  Yes, but you are all under water!  I worked to register wetlands The definition of a wetland is something that has pooled water on it for 14 days out of the year or is spongy for 21 And that's the entire state of Iowa at this point  Yes, switch to rice Well, enough of that On the inflation side, [our central tendency] is 31 percent I think we're going to be lucky to hit that To get 31 percent for a year we can have 30 tenths over the 12 months We've had 17 of those tenths in the first five months, which means we've got to go from an average of 34 percent to an average of 18 percent, or cut our inflation in half for the next seven months, to hit our forecast So, if you ask where the risks are, I think they're on [the side of] higher inflation Let me also say that I agree with John LaWare and others that the risks are on the down side for the economy Why? Well, the staff has estimated that the budget will be a $37 billion drag on the economy in '94 Is that fiscal 1994?  That's an incremental fiscal drag  Yes, it's an incremental fiscal drag of six- tenths of a percent of GDP Roughly the first year multiplier on fiscal drag is close to one; it probably goes up a little after that So, that means we're going to knock off six-tenths of a percent from whatever [rate the economy] would have grown--I don't know what that rate would have been but we're talking about a number between 2-1/2 and 3 percent--just from normal old fiscal drag If I knock six- tenths off, I don't get our median forecast; I get something below that So, again, I think the risks are on the down side Nor do I think that this is your run-of-the-mill fiscal drag I think this is putting the economy in chains; in fact everyone around the table mentioned it This is not a normal tax increase; it's a tax increase on small business in addition to which we're shutting down the defense sector and the health care sector When you have a targeted fiscal drag, the capacity for individuals who lose their jobs to find jobs in other sectors quickly is reduced relative to an across the board fiscal drag where, say, it takes $100 out of everyone's pocket So, I think the downside risks for next year are substantially more than what we are talking about here At the same time, the risks of inflation are also more than what we have here That adds up to John LaWare's forecast of stagflation I would [agree with] his prediction that the deficit will not go down by as much as is being predicted by the Administration and I'm willing to take bets with anyone around the table on that one  I'm not going to get any takers! What do we do if we have stagflation? Well, how did we get out of the problem the last time we had stagflation? The first point is that the basic solution is not monetary policy; it is fiscal policy It is not to do the things that everyone around the table mentioned are going to be the problems The 19 of us don't have any votes on that, so we may as well forget that What else does monetary policy do? I would again commend the way we got out of the last stagflation While we do the right thing on fiscal policy we also hold the line on prices because if we don't, then the easy path out is more obvious So, I don't like the situation we're in any better than anyone else It is only going to be worse next year; it is not going to get any better And on that cheery note, I will commend exactly what President Syron said, Mr Chairman Given that we don't have any easy way out and you're the one who has to go up there and wheedle your way through the [Congressional] Committee, I will defer to your sense of logic on what will appeal to them to get you through it But I do think that we should also have to face the fact that for us to make the tough call it is only going to become more difficult as time goes on  I'd like to go a little further out in time if I could This would be in a world where the transitional effects of new financial products have disappeared and we have a stable interest rate environment and we have discovered a new M2, which may turn out to be the same M2 or M2+ or M2- or the square root of M2 or something like that! What is your sense of the relationship that that money aggregate would have with respect to nominal GNP?  "After a while"  Right Given that we're talking about the period after 1994, would you bet any money one way or the other on whether the velocity trend would be positive or negative or zero?  Right, okay  Mr Chairman, it's my opinion that many out there view the M2 target as similar to or actually in lieu of a nominal GNP target because we are not asked for the nominal GNP target And this would be across the spectrum, say, from Milton Friedman to Paul Sarbanes  In that case, and I do think that's a widespread view--  That our announced M2 target range is a proxy for our nominal GNP target range because there is a continuing perception, based on history, that over the long run the trend velocity is zero  Also, when the trend reasserts itself--while no one is betting any money for sure--our best guess of the trend in the    7/6-7/93  long-term future is zero Lowering the target range now, therefore, invites one or possibly two charges The first is that we have lowered our nominal GNP target now to a midpoint of 3 percent and not a midpoint of 4 percent And I think 3 percent is probably a low target for nominal GNP Or, even if we can get around that problem-- and I'm sure you can in the testimony--when we finally get to the long run, it will be necessary for this Committee, I think, to raise the M2 target in order to hit the nominal GNP target I don't know in what year that will come, but I'm very much worried that it would send the signal that we are backing off on inflation So I would prefer to keep the 2 to 6 percent range--though I understand what you're saying --to avoid the short-run charge that we're cutting our nominal GNP target and to avoid a long-term risk of re-raising the target range and, therefore, looking weak on inflation  Credibility on inflation? Let's take the baseline CPI projection in the Bluebook Assuming that comes true, we will have had 33, 31, and 29 percent What are we credible on?  Mr Chairman, I fully support your recommendation I think the interesting debate that we're going to have is how to respond to a supply shock; we're not going to have that debate today But if, unfortunately, the supply shock continues, the fair question would be Can you cure an adverse supply shock with easy money? And I look forward to the intellectual discourse that solving that problem will produce  "Familiar with the Fed's deliberations," that's different   Mr Chairman, I've either been an academic all my life or else a government employee, so I've never had the opportunity to pay the kind of taxes that some people are going to pay But--I have an example that's going around the table--I get my kicks either by buying lottery tickets when the pot gets really, really big or else figuring taxes for people who are very well endowed What I'd like to do is to talk through briefly what the first quarter is going to look like for a self-employed business person who makes $1 million There are roughly 50,000 of these individuals in the country If we reduce that to a half million dollars, we are talking about perhaps another 180,000 people, all of whom are in roughly this type of situation The earnings for the first quarter for one making $1 million a year are $250,000 What is going to be due next April 15th are their first-quarter estimated taxes, which under the new bill will be $92,000, and only one-third of the retroactive tax increase The latter is a bit less than $25,000; the total retroactive tax increase is on the order of $74,000 And first-quarter FICA is about $14,000 So, the total due on April 15th under the new tax bill will be $131,000 out of the $250,000 they will have earned in the first quarter Now the thing I would point out--  That's a part of the FICA  In the process of the tax bill, they got this interest-free loan provision in it so that on April 15, 1994 they would only owe one-third of their tax increase Had that not been the case, these individuals would have owed roughly another $50,000 on April 15th or another 20 percent of their first-quarter's income, meaning that they would have been working three-fourths of the first quarter of the year to pay their April 15th federal tax bill There are no state income taxes in these calculations Maybe the rich really are different, but anyone who has any kind of cash flow constraints at all and has to send 75 percent of his income to Uncle Sam I think would probably have been in an interesting situation April 15th I think a lot of the pressure has backed off because of that one-third provision; it's a tiny little provision in the tax law, but it probably is going to help the economy quite a bit in the first and second quarters next year  I did another calculation Most people who go to accountants, of course, want to keep money in their own checking accounts and not give Uncle Sam an interest-free loan You just have to pay 90 percent of your tax on an estimated basis If that's true and you are rigorous about it, you will owe on April 15th $151,000 instead of $131,000 and that's 60 percent of your first-quarter  -19-    8/17/93  earnings I think these are somewhat interesting numbers; I don't know how they're going to affect the small business sector There is a lot of debate about it Again, there's no behavior here or anything else; it's simply a cash flow issue  My own personal anecdotal survey is that most people who are affected by the tax bill have underestimated how much they're going to pay This millionaire, for example, will see federal taxes go up by 33 percent next year Most people I've talked to figure their taxes are going to go up by 10 to 15 percent I think a surprise of that magnitude next April 15th is something that may affect the economy  Other than that, Mr Chairman, I think the Greenbook has it about right  Mr Chairman, back in 1965 George Aiken, the Senator from Vermont, recommended that we declare victory and get out of Vietnam I always thought that was a wise judgment It applies today First of all, I think the reason we should get out of the asymmetric directive is to reload because we are going to have to fight another day That goes without saying But I think the other part of what Aiken recommended--that we declare victory--is also very important I am somewhat concerned about what Governor Mullins indicated that some will take our move as a signal on the budget vote But actually what we're doing is that we had a very, very well planned--it's almost miraculous how well it worked--shift in the nuance of policy, which I thought conveyed very well to the markets what we believed It led businessmen, instead of talking about inflation, to come back saying "We tried to raise prices and we couldn't" I think it really has changed expectations out there We should let the world know that we've done it right and that's why we're doing it And by the way, declaring victory is part of making it easier for us to reload the next time when we have to So, I'll go with what George Aiken said 20 or more years ago and vote to go symmetric   Mr Chairman, given what I've done in the last month, I think my contribution would be to talk about a district we don't have represented here It's what Congressman Clay called America's internal third world nation Having been to hearings all around the country, I thought I'd just report on economic conditions that I've heard about There seems to be a growing gap between expectations, which are rising, and realities, which are falling The rising expectations stem largely from political changes and promises of change and reform I'd point out that there are extremely high expectations about what potential changes in the Community Reinvestment Act could do I doubt very much that anything we do could fulfill those expectations So I think it's going to lead to disappointment  With regard to realities, in the 1980s real black family income rose about 70 percent faster than real white family income Black small business creation as well as Hispanic small business creation was quite quick Both of those trends have stopped, which seems rather puzzling until one thinks about the usual process that's going on The usual pattern for all ethnic groups moving up has first of all been the civil service And limits on civil service employment at the state and local level and now in federal civil service are impacting minority communities particularly Even more dramatic, particularly for young people, are cutbacks in military hiring which has long been a way out We've seen an historic and continuing trend of decline in pay in manual jobs; that's no surprise But during the '80s there was robust growth in office jobs, which led to rapid gains in female incomes relative to male incomes In minority communities female incomes are a more important component than they are in the white community, so that was a net plus That has stopped and it is one of the problems being faced And finally on the horizon is the fact that the health care industry, which has also been a major employer of blacks and Hispanics, now appears to be facing cuts As a result there does not seem to be the job growth going on and, therefore, the realities are somewhat grimmer  There is good news Minority test scores, SATs and what have you, continue to rise; they've been rising now for 12 years It's interesting that white test scores are unchanged, but for all other groups test scores have been continually rising The reason they're static for the country as a whole is that the composition of the population is changing But, still, progress is being made Graduation rates are up and, according to survey data, drug use is    9/23/93  down In fact, it was lower in the last survey for the minority community than for the white community The other big piece of good news is the [increased] affordability of housing--and that's largely due to lower interest rates--which is a real plus  But I'll tell you, I heard quite a bit about the effects of regulation Jerry Jordan mentioned that with regard to small business and minority small business in particular There are three that I think we should take a close look at The first is the appraisal mess, which is without any question devastating for the minority community Appraisers, even licensed and certified ones, have no idea how to do appraisals in the inner city and as a result are literally destroying what equity might exist there Second is the tightening of down payment restrictions; the monthly payments are more affordable but it's a lot harder to come up with 20 percent down than with 10 percent or 5 percent down And tightening of bank regulation has adversely affected the minority community in that way Finally, and I heard this everywhere I went, is something we don't think about; it's a classic unintended consequence For historically underserved communities, cash is not only a medium of exchange, it's a store of wealth If you don't have a bank account you keep your money literally in cash Well, in the name of anti money-laundering laws, we have made the use of that cash and its entry into the banking system virtually impossible I had a lady in Denver confront me She was trying to buy a house and had $5,000 in cash; obviously she was not allowed to use it by the bank, as you might imagine, under our laws And she said "You're treating everyone in the community as if they were a drug dealer" And I had no answer for her I thought it was a very good observation  It's something we should definitely think about I don't think the Congressmen who are leading the fight on the Hill are aware of exactly what that's doing So, I saw a tremendous amount of bitterness I had never seen anything like what I saw at the hearings in Los Angeles I think the country would see a great cloud lift if we could somehow cut southern California off from the rest of the country! The bitterness there was not only directed against the establishment but against other minority groups to an extent that I just found unbelievable in a public hearing setting  Yes, and backwards in time We had testimony from the Chinese banking community, which was a good lesson in history As late as 1946, it was illegal for Chinese to own land in California 1946! So, needless to say, this community felt that it has been historically disadvantaged and yet has solved its own problems We had a witness testify who said, in effect We solved our own problems; don't expect us to solve anyone else's problems And the witness said it that bluntly Also, I think the amount of tension that exists in Los Angeles between the Mexican American community and the black community is something one never sees on the news, but it came through loud and clear in the hearings So, that was a matter of some concern  Yes  Yes It's competition for everything It's competition for civil service jobs; it's competition for contracts; it's competition for housing I don't know what implication it has for the Greenbook, but it is a matter of great concern that we have a situation of rising expectations and falling realities And in the long run we've got to reverse those two curves  Thank you I see the recorder is on  Well, Mr Chairman, when we used to be asked "Are interest rates going up or down?" we always dodged the question by saying "Yes" We can't say that anymore; we have to say "Maybe" [Laughter] But I think your analysis is quite right   Because the person spoke on the assumption that what he was saying was confidential  Isn't that prospective?  Right, it's prospective from the time when that law was changed That would be the case  No, they exist That is the point which I--  Yes Jerry, I didn't know about the tapes either until this process What I am surprised about is that there's not enough concern about changing the rules of the game, [although] it came up in some of the conversations But what we're doing is retroactively changing the rules of the game And I think the relevant date is today We all now know that in the future what we say at the FOMC will soon be broadcast to the world  No, I don't believe that I think they're going to get it; we no longer have any bargaining chips The Congress was willing to give us three years before, but we don't have any bargaining chips now  Well, but that's irrelevant The more important point is that prior to today the vast majority of the members of the FOMC did not know that what they were saying was being taken down in anything like a literal form and kept Now that material is suddenly going to be released I find that objectionable I think it is nothing more than another abuse of personal liberty I don't care if people read what I say, but I think [this abuse of personal liberty] is appalling And I really think we should make a stand on this ground But I'm the only one who feels this way, so I'm certainly willing to be outvoted  This is Dave Lindsey But part of the proposal is explaining to Justice that we plan to put in place an orderly process for releasing the substance of the material, in other 10/22/93 -5- words, the Memoranda of Discussion idea That's part of your proposal LINDSEY Well, this is Dave Lindsey again I guess part of Virgil's premise is that it may be difficult to protect those raw transcripts and, therefore, they may get out absent this fallback position of going forward with the process of an orderly release of Memoranda of Discussion  The real question you are asking, though, is whether after the vote on NAFTA we expect the Mexican peso to return to a normal value or not It is not a yes or no vote on Mexican policy in the past, which we all agree has been excellent It is whether or not this new random event, which is going to take place down the road, will change the fundamental value of the peso  Right  It is 315 but they have allowed it to go to 324?  Wouldn't provision of the swap line simply work to encourage them to stay at 315?  They have?  But if they are not running an artificial exchange rate, why increase the swap line?    11/9/93  Well, then let those people who are irrational lose money in the market If people want to move the peso to 350, and we all think it should be 320 or 330, let them--  Don't we have a critical day coming up? Isn't this whole thing a charade to get through next Wednesday? We are trying to give a vote of confidence that our elected representatives are unwilling to give What we are being asked to do right now is to cover the United States' foreign policy commitments because the House of Representatives will not I propose that we make it no longer than Wednesday because that is when the Congress is going to speak  Why did we increase it?  We have not been asked to increase it   Does that mean the answer is yes?  Does that require [a Congressional] appropriation?  But if they have $1 billion and only $1 billion, how would they go to $3 billion legally? How would they acquire the rest?  Of foreign exchange, I see  Mr Chairman, do I understand that if we were to vote, this would be released next Friday?  If Bill is going to ask for a request, procedurally what is he going to tell them?   Mr Chairman, I must say that I've become quite cynical about the process I think we've been negotiating with ourselves; there's no one on the other side of the table where people on the other side of the table refuse to [bind] themselves The court's decisions can be overturned by a decision by the President and the Attorney General So my basic suggestion would be to do whatever you think is best I think it's entirely a tactical call I think it's tragic that the rules can be changed and people's rights can be reversed ex post facto; that's my most important concern In that regard I would prefer that the tapes never be released Failing that, I would prefer 30 years; failing that, I'd prefer 29 years My 26th choice would be 5 years How does one function in a world where there are no property rights and laws can be changed willy-nilly? I would note that in Chairman Gonzalez's letter he did not necessarily stress the process; he wanted the results of the meetings out earlier I really think that is what is key [for him] There's a good reason why we value the process of how we got there, and I think that's important for us to protect They value the results I think if they had the results they wouldn't give a fig how we arrived at them and no one would bother to read through 150 pages of unedited transcripts I would suggest, therefore, giving them the raw transcripts with a five- year delay I think the key to getting out of this mess is that we really have to change when we release our decision  Five years  Five for both  Raw transcripts If you want to have this annotation and what was the term--recision--to take out?  SPEAKER(?) Redaction  Redaction Yes, so redact and annotate But if anyone can go past a hundred and so pages of that raw transcript, more power to them  My first choice is raw transcripts with annotation; and lightly edited is fine  Mr Chairman, are you going to be negotiating with Chairman Gonzalez on this?  We're just going to make a decision and then--  Infinite and five  And so noted on the cover  I'm going to go with Sy Keehn  To enhance enhanced, I'd switch from current to enhanced  Release everything  SPEAKER(?) Except you've said [you would redact material] that's secret  A working lunch?  I move that we work through lunch, Mr Chairman  If that's the case, why are we voting suddenly to authorize it now?  Oh, I see So it just happens that the last time we did this was 12 months ago?  Mr Chairman, just about everything has been said I'd just add, first of all, that adding a child has taught me something I did the checkbook last weekend and calculated that a significant fraction of the decline in the national saving rate was caused by the Lindsey household in October! [Laughter] So, I imagine that's going to be a temporary phenomenon My other comment is that I was asked a question at breakfast about CRA and I have a document here for anyone who wants it And that's all I have to say  "B" symmetric   Yes, I so move  So move  Could I ask a question about the fiscal model on this last green page in the first Greenbook section? I assume the default, which would be a no law change model, in the first, third, and fourth quarters is essentially a 5 percent increase in receipts I'm reading across the top line So we have, say, a $15 billion increase Q1 '94 over Ql '93 and in Q3 it's a $17 billion increase, etc And that carries through What I'm puzzled about is the timing, where what we have is a $49 billion increase Q2 '94 over Q2 '93 And I'm even slightly more puzzled about the Q2 '95 over Q2 '94 where the percentage increase is more than in the other quarters Could you briefly explain the way the timing is scored on government receipts?  Unified budget receipts  Now, if these come from OMB, okay But I didn't think they did  That would be great, thanks At any rate, that kind of bump I assume is unlikely to affect consumption patterns because it is pretty much anticipated  Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, want to second what Governor Kelley said about Wayne Angell's departure Mr Chairman, you used the word "subliminal" in his effect If I may, I would say the phrase should have been "subliminal but never subtle" [Laughter]  We have two puzzles that everyone has been discussing One is the unsustainably low personal saving rate and the other is the absence of price pressures in the presence of a rather  -26-    12/21/93  high capacity utilization rate I have two thoughts I've thought about both of them and, since they haven't come up, I thought I'd throw in my two cents worth The first relates to why the consumer in general is pretty happy He has just gotten three tax cuts The first is from OPEC; and that's $120 a family at $4 a barrel The second is refinancing of a home; with a $100,000 mortgage that could be $700 or $800 a year easily And thirdly, taxpayers in the 28 percent bracket, which includes me and people with taxable incomes of, say, from $35,000 to $85,000 will on January 1 get a tax cut of between $200 and $300 because of indexing All of this works well to encourage people that things are going their way There's still a tax increase coming and I think we're seeing the effects of that I think it's coming entirely out of savings One need only do some calculations that I'm sure higher income people are facing and you can see where the money is coming from If your alternative for paying Uncle Sam is, say, a regular short-term vehicle, your real after-tax return on that short-term vehicle is now about minus 1-1/2 percent It doesn't make any sense to hold that kind of cash, so you may as well dissave So, I think the decline in the saving rate we've witnessed is really not among the scared middle and upward middle classes worried about their jobs but it's because the rich are dissaving  Where my key disagreement with the [Green]book would come is that that $49 billion in extra revenue we're expecting to see in the second quarter is not [all] going to materialize; I think about half of it will As we can see again through the low saving rate, where people are putting that money is in asset redeployment The first is the reemergence of the $1 million home Actually it's a $1,250,000 home with 80 percent financing and a $1 million maximum mortgage that [qualifies for] a deduction I know a few rich people And the majority of them, who have always paid cash for their homes--gee, what a nice situation that would be--tell me that they in fact are now taking out mortgages for the first time in the $1 million range It's a nice saving Furthermore, it's a nice form of long-term cheap funds The nominal after-tax cost of a mortgage for someone, say, in New York right now is about 3-1/2 percent, that's the nominal after- tax cost That sounds like borrowing money for free for 30 years, and that's a pretty good deal What we would expect to see as a result is a bunch of asset re-diversification, a flow of funds into real estate and also into durables which are untaxed I wonder if the boom [areas of the economy] we're hearing about [are indicative of this] In Wyoming, for example, I heard [the boom in real estate] was particularly true around Jackson Hole where low and moderate income housing is no longer available and California-type prices are coming in That's another way, again, of sheltering money [Another] asset re-diversification is out of dividend paying stocks into OTC stocks; 85 percent of OTC stocks, I'm told, have outperformed the DOW this year They are nondividend paying, basically speculative Utilities have been hit in spite of a favorable interest rate environment because they're high dividend paying Then the classic is the new issues such as Boston Chicken As a Virginian, I'm outraged I'd suggest opening a Virginia corned beef and cabbage to fight back [Laughter] Maybe we can make some money on that What do you think, Al? The further other types of diversification that would make sense would be to hold commodities, and we're seeing those prices go up; or to have your firm purchase business equipment, and we've had a record boom in that And most important, Mr Chairman, you mentioned  -27-    12/21/93  to me earlier that we're not going to have inflation without C&I loans going up You have to be crazy to go into C&I loans You don't want to bring any more cash on your books; you've got plenty there already And what you have to do is to dispose of it because you can't pay it to yourself So you borrow against your house and your portfolio and you use that money for something that's going to give you a deduction up front And that way if you want to keep cash in the company and not pay it to yourself, you're going to push it this way rather than pulling it this way And I think that's why we're seeing it So I think we have a low personal saving rate because the rich are doing what they should do, faced with confiscatory tax rates  The second issue is why there are no price pressures in spite of boom conditions I think it's because traded goods are traded and non-traded goods are not, and we're going to see $1 million houses and land in Wyoming go up in price We missed our forecast in the early '80s during the last time we hit negative real interest rates because we ignored the outside world We thought the budget deficits would do us in; in fact, we borrowed from abroad The check this time that the rest of the world is having on us is that it's going to restrain price pressures  Well, what does that do for monetary policy? First of all, I think our current monetary policy is exacerbating the effects of the tax cuts by keeping real after-tax rates decidedly negative Furthermore, if we want to keep that [restraint on] price pressure from abroad, I think ultimately the only way we're going to have to do it is perhaps to see some appreciation in the dollar The surprises are going to be abroad We're going to have no government in Germany by the end of the year The Bundesbank seems to be caught We have a very gloomy picture in Japan The Japanese are near a liquidity trap situation And perhaps one way of helping both of them out of their dilemma is not to look for a relative decline in their currency but a relative increase in the dollar So I think the foreign situation, if anything, calls for action on our part Finally, we all agree that the 3 percent [funds] rate is unsustainable We also know that we always act too late I was particularly impressed with a presentation we had here yesterday which showed how long monetary policy lags are And we had better act now if we're worried about inflation in '95 So, I think some modest adjustment along the lines of what Governor Mullins was talking about--away from highly accommodative toward neutral--would help stabilize some destabilized parts of the economy  Don, I would imagine there was some kind of relationship between lags--how long it takes us before we start raising [rates]--and how far we have to raise [them] Do you have any good ideas or rules of thumb on that?  But even more  The only case I can think of was '66 where the Fed [implemented] just one small increase Can you remember how much of an increase that was and how long it lasted?  The comments I've heard so far suggest an incompatibility I agree that we want to take action at a meeting; I think that's important I also think that what Jerry Jordan said was very true We don't want to be reacting to a high real growth number That's simply bad policy and it's also bad PR We have nothing against growth Because the February meeting coincides with the release of a real GNP number that we know is going to be high--I believe that's correct--yes?  -34-    12/21/93  Well, we are betting that the number is going to be high And I think it's [released] that Friday Isn't that correct?  When is the first [release of] the GNP number [for the fourth quarter]?  So the last statistic out before [that meeting] would be a strong real growth number, and I think we'd be perceived as reacting to that high real growth number And we'd probably have a strong employment report following that Therefore, I don't see us acting at the February meeting; I would see us postponing until March before we moved That brings me back to the logic that the best time to move is right now, with a 1/4 point increase, to show that we are not simply responding to strong real growth  Mr Chairman, I have two questions The first is I'd like to follow through the--  If that happens--and I understand why you'd want other people here--there is a possibility that the people who come here will go away with different interpretations  Chairman Gonzalez's representatives might have a more conspiratorial interpretation than other people who might listen to it, in which case what we'd have is a "Yes you did, no you didn't" discussion I think we'd have to think of what our reaction would be to that likely outcome Unfortunately, I don't believe it would end with just the people involved listening here but would involve ultimately what Governor Kelley intimated might be the unfortunate long-run result, which would be actual release Could you see a different outcome?  Well, if we're trying to dispel suspicion-- The conspiratorial types will always believe in conspiracy as long as someone out there is whispering the word conspiracy  It depends on the likelihood The second question, if I could, I'd ask our counsel Has the FOMC ever authorized either taping of meetings or the permanent retention of transcripts?  So there's not--  That's correct So right now we're taping the meeting without authorization of this Committee?   Mr Chairman?  I'm sorry, there was a resounding silence on the last vote I think that may reflect the fact--frankly, I didn't understand the issue and that's why I didn't say anything I think we had two "Yeses" and one "No" While I agree it passed, could we at least have some kind of document laying out the pros and cons?  Well, I suppose what I really want to hear is-- I'm asking Jerry Jordan--you said we had a letter outlining what Secretary Simon said At some point, perhaps next year, I'd--  I was not here in 1990  Thank you  I have two questions The first has to do with personal income numbers Do you have a breakdown for personal income, a forecast by source of income?  Could I get a copy of that breakdown?  Horrors! [Laughter]  I realize that you need more details to develop forecasts I'm not going to hold you ex post to the forecast, believe me, but I do want to have some sense particularly about whether the functional distribution of income is going to change from 1993 in your forecast And that's why I'd appreciate more details  Yes, and small business income  What you've told me is that everything is going up I believe that is true I would just appreciate seeing the data expressed as relative increases at some point  My other question was on housing I had a consumer group allege that a third of all new single-family housing starts are manufactured homes  Are trailers part of that?  Prefabricated?  That seems high  The other question I had was on the homeowner- ship rate If you take out seniors, the homeownership rate declines more precipitously than it does here But suppose you also took out two-adult households? You mentioned the role of demographics in here  -8-    2/3-4/94  Knowing the home maintenance that's involved, I couldn't imagine doing it by myself I wonder if that adjustment would change your conclusions about a rebound in homeownership?  It's more a time impediment or a hassle impediment  Do you know if data exist?  I call the phrase "two-adult" households as opposed to "single-adult" households--homeownership by two-adult households  In the housing census, okay  Okay  Mr Chairman, at the last meeting I talked a little about the differences between the rich and the poor, and I focused primarily on how taxes would affect the rich and how that might affect our forecast I got some compliments, so at the risk of discouraging all praise, I thought I'd try it again and this time focus on the other end of the spectrum--the bottom 99 percent of which I am clearly a part The thesis here is that demographically different people have different tolerances for borrowing The two groups that I have separated out were individuals over 65, who are unlikely to incur additional debt for life-cycle reasons, and those in the top 1 percent in terms of income, which is roughly people making over about $225,000 I would imagine that debt may be a convenience for them but it is not subject to their economics The data that I have come from a number of sources Generally, they are from the P60 series the Labor Department puts out and also some tax data  The first chart in my handout, which I think was distributed, shows that we have a trend that has developed over time where the share of income going to the old has risen since the end of World War II; it has more than doubled And the share of income going to these two groups, the old and the rich, has just about doubled  Netted out--taking out the old rich  It's the old plus the young rich Actually, the way I did it was the rich plus the poor old [Laughter] That's because getting the data was a bit easier that way  John, you're not in this group!  That's right Well, we struggled with that labeling I started with the "middle-aged middle class" and that didn't sound too good So, we ended up calling it those likely to borrow of the non-rich, non-old  The next chart shows the debt service adjusted for Chart 1 which is the rise in the income share of the old and the rich The bottom line with the triangles on it shows the regular series that is presented by the staff and the top line shows the adjusted series The adjustment seems to make some difference, particularly in recent  -20-    2/3-4/94  trends If you apply debt service to those of us who actually have to borrow, it's quite high The same is true on the debt outstanding share, on the next chart, which again assumes that debt is being borne by those who have to borrow It's now up to 110 percent of disposable income, whereas the more standard measure puts it around 75 percent So, I would say that those who actually have to borrow to expand their spending are probably more constrained than the data that we've looked at indicate I might say that these are not publication-quality analyses, but what I did to see if my thesis worked was to try approaching it from an entirely different angle So, rather than use P60 data, my next approach was to go to the NIPA data and see if that showed the same effects based on a functional distribution of income  The first thing that's important to realize is that the NIPA data do not mean income earners actually get the money I convince myself of that every year when I do my taxes, when I also compile for my wife a breakdown of our income and where it was spent I find that useful because I always tell her we never have any money but we end up managing to spend lots of it and she never believes me So I present the actual breakdown and she is forced to concede the facts The interesting point that I want to make here is that not all NIPA income is actually spendable by households, and that's particularly true with regard to interest and dividends For example, the income that accrued on your 401K plan is counted as interest and dividend income to you, but you really can't get at it And that actually is a very important phenomenon in the economy So, I broke down the NIPA income into a number of areas Cash income--excuse me the chart says "cash" but it should say wages--wages are basically all paid in cash Only about 8 percent is received by the rich and 3 percent by the non-rich elderly So, 89 percent is received by those of us who are likely to borrow Of interest income, only about 45 percent actually finds its way to the households where it can be spent And the way I got this number was to look at the ratio of what is reported on tax returns to what is reported in NIPA The tax return data probably are fairly reliable at the moment, since paying institutions are now required to put out a statement for everything over $10 So, only about 45 percent of interest in the economy actually is received by households  They are using the same data, yes I had to get the income for the elderly too, so I had to go back and look at tax return data where people used an exemption for those over 65; that flagged the returns to be used in the tabulation It turns out that only about 14 percent of total NIPA interest is actually received by people likely to borrow The same is essentially true of dividends-- 16 percent--and of small business income at 27 percent The income retained by small businesses includes such things as inventory appreciation, capital consumption allowances, what have you, which while income really can't be eaten or used to pay a credit card bill That's why the distinction is here The reason I think that's important is that what we're seeing is a big change in the functional distribution of income away from wages, particularly in the last two years For a comparison period, I took the change in personal income from 1983 to 1988 which was of course the heyday of Reaganomics when we all know workers were being stomped on by the capitalists who were  -21-    2/3-4/94  in power! Still, in spite of that, 56 percent of all the increase in personal income was paid in the form of wages If you turn to the last chart, of the increase in personal income in 1992 and 1993 only 47 percent was paid in wages During 1993 that fell to 38 percent And even during the fourth quarter of 1993, when everyone was saying how good the economy was and optimism was rising, only 384 percent of the increase in personal income actually was in the form of wages So, the way I would talk about the last three charts is that the non- rich, non-old live paycheck to paycheck, quite literally That's where all their income comes from Remember, virtually none of the capital income or business income goes to them They have to live on their wages and that wage share is also declining So, whether you look at the aggregate numbers from NIPA or at the aggregate numbers from the P60 series, the middle-class, middle-aged people who are borrowing are really getting their income squeezed What that would suggest to me is that unless the trends change and employment picks up, the capacity of households to take on ever more debt is going to have to stop at some point, and perhaps sooner than we think  We're not writing a press release  I think that's a little premature  Mr Chairman, I agree with you completely I think that it's right for you to make the statement because you have the authority The Committee is not establishing a precedent; we always can fire you And you are making the judgment that this is an  -37-    2/3-4/94  instance where you want to speak In fact, I would go so far as to suggest, although you know what we want--we've already said it--that we not dictate to you what you're going to say because it should be only your statement That way there is absolutely no precedent; you are simply acting as Chairman of this Committee  They got to the last page of the release!  I notice that the hours were way up, from 1252 to 1263 Is that the basis of your higher GDP forecast?  I agree it's certainly the time to move I have three thoughts on why I would prefer a move of 1/2 point over 1/4 point First, the staff in yesterday's presentation said that to maintain not price stability but constant inflation we have to raise interest rates 150 basis points by mid-1995 We have to make a choice as to whether we want to move six times in the next year and a half or three times My answer is that I have a strong preference for three times  Well, if anything, I think the risks are that we are going to have do more than 150 basis points to lower the level of inflation I think the bias of the Committee is that if possible we want to bring inflation down a little more Furthermore, the staff noted today that GDP momentum seems stronger than they thought when they came up with the 150 basis point estimate So, based on what we've learned since they did their forecast, it seems that the risks are on the up side, and that would suggest even more actions to tighten I appreciated very much Bill McDonough's analysis of the "Fed on hold" versus the first in a series of moves If I think about it this way, though, what we are out to do is to minimize the effect on long-term growth, for a given amount of disinflation If we go a 1/4 point, we are telling the markets that this is the first in a series and we're going to be raising rates over a long period of time That would seem to me to be a signal that over an extended period of time the average short-term rate is going to be higher than it would be if we did it quickly And since what affects long-term growth is equity prices and long-term bond prices, a slow gradual move--because it means on average higher long-term rates for a longer period--would be more damaging to growth So that would be another reason, I think, to move suddenly  Finally, I don't have any personal memories of it although I was alive at the time, the most successful Fed move against inflation, as I recall from what I read of history, was back in 1966 At first the data showed a recession then, but that recession was revised away  -50-    2/3-4/94  The Fed was able to overcome an inflationary condition by a short, sudden rise in interest rates The downturn was actually not a downturn but simply a slowing in the rate of growth that lasted at most six months and it brought the country another two years of high rates of economic expansion I think the 1966 model is really what we want to emulate today  You want to correct my sense of history?  But the 10 percent surcharge wasn't enacted until 1968 and didn't take full effect until 1969  Okay In any case, if we have to do 150 basis points or more, I think the greatest "bang for the buck," with minimum harm to long-term growth, would be to move 50 basis points today  Mr Chairman, if we could make it specific, I would recommend that we do 25 basis points today and have a conference call within two days after your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  But there will be a phone call?  You answered my question  -57-    2/3-4/94  Mr Chairman, I agree with you completely on a 1 to 5 percent range for exactly the reason you gave My question is on debt, however If you look at Chart 4, the world was lovely until about 1981 or 1982, then it fell out of bed And unlike M3 and the rest of them, it didn't even change course It looks as if during the 1980s we moved to a new secular plateau We know what happened during that period There was corporate restructuring in favor of debt for lots of reasons; there were lots of learned papers to explain that development Similarly, households moved toward debt Not only have those trends stopped in the corporate sector, but they are now reversing themselves Equity is now being issued to replace debt Wouldn't it be reasonable to expect that, if anything, the velocity of debt would accelerate in the years ahead largely as a result of responses in the corporate sector?  You are basically predicting an elasticity of one with respect to nominal GDP and debt spending  But there has been a secular change in the relative costs of debt and equity in the corporate sector They are voting with their feet now and issuing new equity, particularly IPOs and what have you  In the takeover of Paramount, what I find striking about the composition of that offer is how heavily equity oriented it is compared to offers five and six and seven years ago  Well, I don't know if I would make that conclusion for the aggregate effect of the taxes I might argue the other way  But while I agree with the alternative I M2 and M3 target ranges, I prefer alternative II on debt  Mr Chairman, the broader monetary aggregates appear to be weaker than we thought on the afternoon of the policy tightening when we tried to build in those effects M2 appears to be declining at about a 1/2 percent annual rate in February The falloff in mortgage prepayments this year is, we think, deducting some 2 percentage points from February M2 growth after boosting that growth late last year In light of M2's growth of 2-1/4 percent in January, from the fourth quarter through February, M2 has expanded at a 1-1/2 percent annual rate, quite close to its pace last year and quite close to the pace we estimated, abstracting from the various special factors influencing it M3 is weaker still in February than M2, declining at about a 6-1/4 percent annual rate after growing 1 percent in January From the fourth quarter to February, M3 is declining at a 1/2 percent annual rate Sharp declines in the money market mutual funds component of M3, however, explain virtually all of its decline in February Bank credit is continuing to expand in February, in fact a little faster than in January--about 5 percent in February following 3 percent in January But there is an artificial upward boost to both months' growth rates in bank credit coming from an accounting change that is boosting the "other securities component," non US government securities So, if anything, since bank credit grew 5 percent over all of last year, in an underlying sense it seems to be slowing some this year The recent weakness in bank credit so far this year reflects runoffs in US government securities and a flattening of 2/28/94 real estate loans after they showed pretty strong increases late last year Business loans were quite strong in January but their growth apparently is slowing in February My February interpretations for bank credit are still somewhat preliminary, as some of the month is still projected  Joan, you mentioned 7 percent; could you tell me when they think the long bond will get there?  Oh, I see  I'm sorry, I apologize   Mr Chairman, may I just ask one question?  I'm sorry I didn't do it in a timely fashion There was some talk in Europe that was critical of the hedge funds of banks for contributing to the instability Do you think that worsened the situation or had no effect?  Mr Chairman, I am in general very supportive of your comments, and I have the exact concerns that you and my colleagues have But two points came up in this discussion that troubled me The first is the use of the phrase "this Treasury"  Well, if I read this morning's paper correctly,  Apparently there was some talk in the Washington wire or one of those columns that he's going to be out but  -13-    3/22/94  that Mr Altman will not be the successor, Mr Rubin will be That's just part of it Is that malicious gossip?  That's US news It has nothing to do with the point except that I want to make certain that we are clear in our own minds that we are not making a deal with "this Treasury," "this Secretary of the Treasury," "this Deputy Secretary of the Treasury," or "this anything" So we should not cloud our judgment because we will be in bed with other Treasuries and other Secretaries of the Treasury as well  Parallel to that is the phrase that was unmentioned and that is "this Mexican government," which is very much like "this Treasury" except that it is much more volatile than "this Treasury" "This Mexican government" may very well be replaced and we don't know who the replacement is going to be  So before we jump on board with our very warm and legitimate feelings toward "this Treasury" and "this Mexican government" we ought to realize that's not who we are really signing on with  The other question I had--this is actually a question rather than a statement or speech or whatever--is how do we say "no"? What I've felt very reassured about is double bullet two on page 3 of the memo and that is that drawings on the Federal Reserve swap line would continue to require the agreement of the FOMC I assume, therefore, that when these unstable market conditions occur the Chairman would call a conference call and we would discuss it and vote on it as needed Is that correct?  Well, this Chairman will be with us a long time  Well, I think the real question to ask is how hard do you think it would be under real live circumstances for us to say "no"? Say, for example, we are coming up on two weeks before the Mexican election and there is a legitimate run on the peso--a  -14-    3/22/94  disorderly market because it looks as if someone else is going to win or whatever That is a real live case It's hard to separate out the politics from the economics And if we have a disorderly market, could this FOMC easily say "no"?  Mike, I note that in the forecast there is a roll-back at the long end of about 1/2 percentage point, but suppose that doesn't happen How would that change your forecast?  Let's assume the first; could you quantify it at all? How sensitive is the forecast--  Mr Chairman, I think we have heard today a very optimistic view outside of New York and Washington and a very pessimistic view from those of us in New York and Washington I hope it's natural for people in Washington to be pessimistic; you just have to live here and watch it [Laughter] But I've decided that everyone is right I think the reason comes down to the fact that the real after tax return to riskless saving is negative And that is our problem The natural response to that situation is that people first of all go into durables and housing, as they have been doing Indeed, I think the last time that the rush into real assets was as great was probably 1979 when the real after tax return to riskless savings was also probably as negative or more negative than it is now The other things people do are to take on more risks, avoid the tax man, and go abroad for new opportunities  I just want to throw out a few fun facts In 1993 the rise in the dollar value of the Hong Kong stock exchange was almost half the rise in the dollar value of the New York stock exchange Hong Kong is an emerging market and they have lots of reasons to be optimistic about China, but the fact that it grows half as much in dollar terms I think suggests that people are running overseas in search of higher returns I'm a little more concerned when I see that the rise in the value of the Bangkok stock exchange was $51 billion compared to $432 billion in the NYSE and that the Ankara stock exchange--I wonder what percentage of the American people could identify Ankara on a map of the world--was $42 billion, almost a tenth of the increase in the value of New York stock exchange stocks  Home equity loans and mortgages in general because of their tax favored status have reached levels that clearly suggest that the funds are being used for consumption purposes and not simply for buying new homes They may also be used to fund tax sheltered investments, which have also reached new record shares of total saving In addition, at the end of the year margin debt hit a level as a ratio to disposable personal income not seen since the month after the Chairman joined the Board of Governors, and we know what happened shortly after that! Margin debt fell precipitously, we know  -37-    3/22/94  that Again, people are reaching for risk; it is also a tax favored method of borrowing because up to a limit it is tax deductible I think, therefore, that we can have a booming economy and at the same time have the very high risk situation that Bill McDonough talked about and that my colleagues on the Board just discussed Both are true The answer, I think, is to raise the real after tax return to riskless saving My preference for how to do that would be largely in the fiscal policy area, but I'm not going to hold my breath So, although I'm leaping to the next agenda topic, I would go for what we can do  Mr Chairman, I think I'm with you with a modification We definitely want to send a signal to the market, and I think that there are two ways of doing that One, which is not an option before us, is to go to a number that is a credible--a round number that people would say is the natural rate One might contemplate a 75 basis point increase to 4 percent I'm not recommending that, but one could suggest that It would be clear to market participants that we had stopped Going to 375 percent in my mind doesn't indicate anything It doesn't suggest that we are going to stop at 4 percent; it doesn't suggest we are going to stop at 4-1/4 percent; it doesn't suggest that we are going to stop at 4-1/2 percent It does suggest that we have another increase coming down the road Since I don't think a 75 basis point move is credible and I don't think 50 basis points sends the signal of certainty, I found your suggestion of 25 basis points probably preferable But where I disagree is on the asymmetric directive because the great benefit of a move at this meeting with the intent that we are probably going to move at the next meeting and at the meeting after that is precisely to remove this uncertainty that we are going to move on some odd Thursday in April, which is one of the things that was spooking the market last month So, while I have no disagreement at all that we want to get there as quickly as possible, in my mind a move of 25 basis points now, 25 in May and 25 on July 5th seems to be a pattern that will get us there in splendid time No one can accuse us of upsetting the markets, and we will establish more certainty in the market that we are headed to a fixed point that is higher than I think we would achieve with 50 basis points So I would vote for 25, symmetric  But the minutes won't be seen until after the next meeting  I know, so what we are talking about is how we are going to look in the future?  I would prefer that It's more internally consistent  Mr Chairman, I know we are somewhat bound by tradition, but there is a sentence that we really don't need about slightly more or slightly less reserve restraint during the intermeeting period Why don't we just drop it? That'll take care of your observation that in fact it's slightly less probable that an easing is going to happen It's the same as being symmetric  -53-    3/22/94  Okay  All right  Mr Chairman, I have no problem at all with anything Don said as far as the statement and when to announce it are concerned But this Committee is going to be considering other issues regarding our openness in the months ahead And I don't see any advantage to the Committee in separating this issue, which is a pro- openness stand from other issues that may incline us toward less openness if we are in fact going to be producing a package down the road So, I would suggest that the Committee not act on Don's proposal today But it is certainly in the power of the Chairman to make any announcement he wishes My personal advice to him would be to go ahead and make the announcement But I think an announcement by the Committee would be committing ourselves to a pro-openness move  -55-    3/22/94  that would be a card we would permanently lose in the future for issues on which we might not be as open  Or that you make the statement  That is correct Yes   I'll second   Peter, given what the Chairman just said, which I agree with, and given what you said--that even if our policy moves along the lines of market expectations, there's not going to be upward movement in the dollar--that opens the question as to what is next and means that we may have another run on the dollar How long do you expect the latest intervention to hold? I suppose the intervention last August bought us 9 or 10 months I assume the second intervention will buy something less than 9 or 10 months Do we have any ammunition left?  Does the potential reversion, which hopefully we won't have, that you mentioned involve foreign policy issues or does that include monetary policy statements?  Yes, in other words dollar bashing being foreign exchange statements, how about Fed bashing being monetary policy statements If there were a recurrence of the former, would that be harmful?  How about Congressional statements?  Joan, just a quick question What is your estimate of the Treasury balance shortfall?  -6-    5/17/94  Yes  Mr Chairman, what struck me most at the table today was the talk of inflation I've heard more on that than I've heard in all the meetings I've attended in 2-1/2 years That was a surprise to me I don't think that the concern we have in the analysis is really on the demand side I think the staff is right on target We have moderately expanding demand We have what would otherwise be robust demand being checked this year by fiscal policy contraction, by a rising yield curve, and by a deteriorating international situation That's moderate What we don't know, really, is what is happening on the aggregate supply side Governor Kelley mentioned a very, very positive scenario, one in which productivity is improving as a result of substitution of capital for labor over the past few years If he's right, then we have room for a very extended expansion And, Mike, you have a surprising ally in my former colleague, Jim Medoff--I don't think we've ever agreed in the past--who sent me from the Center of National Policy an analysis of the normalized help wanted index against the unemployment rate He concludes that the NAIRU is more like 5-1/2 percent because of the changes you've mentioned I think that assumes that it is positive technical change that has driven the substitution of capital for labor If, on the other hand, what has caused this substitution is a rise in the relative cost of labor to capital because labor is more expensive, perhaps because of government mandates or what have you, then really what we've had is a supply shock And that may explain why I hear so much talk about inflation here in spite of the fact that the help wanted index is at the same level as it was at the depths of the 1982 recession That surprised me; no one is demanding labor, yet we're hearing about inflation all the time  -29-    5/17/94  We're going to have to see, and fortunately this is not the meeting where we are going to find out whether we have to go to something more restrictive I think that President Jordan was right on target The thing that we have forgotten is that during an expansion the mix in nominal GDP between inflation and real growth tends to worsen In the Greenbook forecast, it's not worsening; it's staying at about 50/50 That probably isn't going to happen If Governor Kelley is right, maybe it can last for a while longer; but history says otherwise and my bet is that in three months or six months we're not going to be talking about neutrality But fortunately we can wait for three to six months for that to change  I support the statement, Mr Chairman I think we will be coming back I thought President Jordan made a very good point, and probably nine days ago I was about where he is But I think this is the right move for right now and I don't know if I can pick any number where I could go out and say that the probabilities of moving up or down are equal There's a level of uncertainty about the economy and about the financial markets that causes me to express some uncertainty about my interest rate objective I think the statement is very well written, and I support it   Reading the transcript from the last meeting-- unfortunately these transcripts will come back to haunt us all--but I am going to haunt you for a moment, if I may [Laughter] The reason given for the previous intervention in late April and early May was that it was to underline a change in policy Was there any change in policy that this intervention underlined?  Right  The market's reaction to that increased clarity, as I recall, was to send the dollar down  Did the Treasury know about the President's forthcoming statements?  Was the President aware that we were going to intervene?  I have a follow-up question The transcript for the last meeting reads that I was asking you "How long do you expect the latest intervention to hold? I suppose the intervention last August bought us 9 or 10 months I assume the second intervention"--which we had just had in late April and early May-- "will buy us something less than 9 or 10 months" It bought us four weeks "Do we have any ammunition left?" You said at the May meeting "I think the operation and the action of the Bundesbank last week and whatever the Committee does in the realm of the expected, if I can put it that way, will tend to stabilize the dollar/mark rate" Well, we didn't stabilize it How much time has this intervention bought us? With the last, we went from nine to ten months down to four weeks Will this intervention buy us four hours or four minutes? It bought us about twenty minutes, I think  Given the interest rate differential--this is the last question, I promise--what is your expectation of the yen or DM exchange rate or both a year from now?  Higher or lower, how does that sound?    7/5-6/94  Well, Ted, I don't want to dig it out of the transcript, but I can swear that Chairman Greenspan, who I guess is authoritative in these matters, said that if one were to list the reasons for intervening, underlining policy was about the only reason I will find the quote for you It may be in one of our Board meeting minutes, but if I am substantively wrong, Mr Chairman, please correct me  I was accusing you of being quite correct actually in making the very wise statement that, if one looks to reasons for intervening, the most legitimate reason one can think of is to underline a change in policy  And would you view our last attempt as success or failure?  So, the intervention last time didn't meet your second criterion?  Okay  As the Chairman said, there were no shorts in the market; we weren't pricking anything speculative  This is really for Don Kohn, but it is related to the foreign exchange operations and I wanted to pick up on a point that Bill McDonough mentioned Suppose we had a change in price without any change in position Let us just imagine something catastrophic--and for the recording of this meeting this is just hypothetical--suppose we had a drop to 85 in the yen, to pick a nice low round number, what would be the reaction?  That would be my reaction, and that shows why I am not on Wall Street, Mr Chairman  I would think we'd have a big rally in the bond market if the dollar/yen rate suddenly went to 85  But if we have any confidence that markets can be stabilizing factors--I picked 85 because I was trying to take a  -10-    7/5-6/94  worst case scenario of the dollar/yen fall and I thought 85 was so low that the rate would not get there--wouldn't we view a fall to such a level as the foundation for a rally in the bond market? I would think the answer is yes So, I would say that if the markets want to overstep themselves and they are going to overstep themselves irrationally, why not let them?  Thank you  No  Mike, I may have misunderstood you, but when Jerry Jordan asked you why there was this 100 basis point shift in your assumption, you said that exogenous factors had changed including, for example, the price of oil Now, this could just be another experiment If a Mideast war broke out tomorrow and the price of oil went up $20 a barrel, would you recommend that we raise interest rates?  Nominal GDP is unchanged in the forecast-- essentially unchanged In order to get that result--to have virtually the same nominal GDP as we had before--you are telling us we have to raise interest rates 100 basis points, and that's because of exogenous factors?  I was looking at Chart 16 in the Chart Show  I see; the previous estimate is the January forecast?  But going back to these exogenous factors--  But it would be your view or the model's view that an exogenous shock, such as leaving monetary conditions unchanged, would raise nominal GDP?  If the price of oil went up, you'd have a higher nominal GDP level?  Thank you  The inflation blip but not the nominal GDP blip?  Mr Chairman, this economy sounds as good as it gets But before we all start feeling too good, I thought I would report on something that I have not mentioned for a little over a year--it won't make us feel good--and that's health care There are four Congressional committees considering the health care bill, and I thought I would share with you some of the economics that are implicit in that legislation It looks like the direction in which it is moving has some kind of subsidy for moderate income families If we think about it, that's a very natural path that we should applaud The catch is that when the subsidy is phased down as family income rises, it is no different than imposing a tax, at least in terms of the side effects The numbers involved are impressive The CBO has scored the Clinton plan for a family as worth $7,000 So, say we phase down the $7,000 subsidy over a range of $20,000 or something like that; that is a 35 percent marginal tax rate The chances are that something that generous will not pass So, I scaled back the Clinton plan by about 30 percent to a 1994 cost of $4,800 For a family, these numbers are very much in line with what Senator Cooper has proposed and what Senator Moynihan got through his Committee For a family of three, the health care bill would add 27 percent to the  -33-    7/5-6/94  marginal tax rate So on top of a 15 percent federal income tax, 765 percent social security and FICA taxes, state and local income taxes, plus the phaseout of the earned income tax credit, a single mother supporting two kids would be in a 757 percent marginal tax rate bracket for income from about $14,000 to about $34,000 I know our staff's model doesn't take marginal tax rates into account directly, even 75 percent ones, but that would seem to have some serious effects, especially to me For larger families, the phasedown range is wider and the effects are more modest Assuming the earned income tax credit is already phased out, families of four earning between $20,000 and $50,000 would have marginal tax rates of around 49 percent So we are now in the situation of having the great bulk of moderate-income America facing marginal tax rates of between 50 and 75 percent And that's with a moderate health care bill! We speculated earlier about possible supply shocks that might come from the Middle East but the actual shock might come from Capitol Hill Things are as sweet as they get, but we always manage to shoot ourselves in the foot somehow Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman Don, I was surprised by Chart 1, particularly in light of what the Chairman just said about our eclectic views of the Phillips curve, which is that one probably exists in the short run but not in the long run That Chart 1, if I believed it--and I believe everything you tell me, Don--would convert me into being a wild dove because what we could do with easier money is to reduce the rate of unemployment permanently below what it would otherwise be without ever paying any cost for that Now look at the bottom of the chart It means, as I understand it, that simply by printing money we can increase the long-run aggregate amount of output in the economy  Into the next millennium!  No, go ahead, please finish  Right  What does this cost? I assume the civilian unemployment rate is not a bad proxy for real GDP, so we never pay a real output cost The only time the unemployment rate even starts to go up under this chart is when we eventually raise the fed funds rate  -39-    7/5-6/94  But if I were going to vote just on this chart or if Mr Gonzalez or any member of Congress asked me to vote on this chart for a term that exceeds a senator's term, we now can vote to have an interval, which is really what we want to look at on the CPI, that would--let us see it looks like, I am just going to ballpark it and say 3/4 percent for 6 years So 4 million extra job years can be bought by this Committee by voting for the easier money path at virtually no inflation cost  And when will we ever pay the price?  But there's no cost in terms of output?  If you extended that to 2006 or 2008 or something like that, you do believe I think that we would actually be starting--  -40-    7/5-6/94  I'd like to take President Boehne's point and just reduce it to a single question If we ran the model out, do we believe that if we applied some social rate of discount, the losses in output later on would be more than, less than, or equal to the gains in output in the short run?  Ever?  But if I heard you right, we never have a net loss in output resulting from a choice to go for inflation?  If we don't believe that the present value of output in this economy will be lower by letting inflation alone, then  -44-    7/5-6/94  we should let inflation go up It's as simple as that Is there anyone around the table who thinks that by printing money, the present value of output of this economy will go up? If there is, I will join them in voting to cut the discount rate to zero  Why not?  If we can prove--  Yes I was surprised that Alan bought that  That's true Do we believe that printing money will increase the present value of output?  On M2 and M3, don't bother changing them Changing the debt aggregate range isn't going to make much difference,  -55-    7/5-6/94  but I think we should probably lower it because I think it's a proxy for nominal GDP  On forecasting, I think John LaWare had a very good point I remember what happened to me when I was on the staff at the CEA in 1982 In December 1982, there was a deep recession and we had to make a forecast for five years out Marty Feldstein, who had sort of a baseline, said let's guess 4 percent a year, starting in the second quarter of 1983 Here is the dart thrown at the dartboard It turned out that the 1987 real GDP forecast was off in fact in 1987 by a total of $3 billion, which is as close to a bull's eye as I have ever seen anyone make But in the meantime, first it was criticized as wildly optimistic, and then it was criticized as wildly pessimistic as the economy went above and below the forecast So anyone has to be crazy to make that kind of forecast even if it turns out to be right! [Laughter] Nobody ever remembers you were right At the very least, I think Jerry Jordan's point is correct, that this is going to be interpreted somehow as our wish list For us to put out numbers that have unemployment and inflation rising has to invite an attack It's worse than forecasting 4 percent growth for five years  Regardless of whether we were symmetric or asymmetric  -69-    7/5-6/94 -70-  Mr Chairman, I agree with "B" for the reasons you indicated However, I strongly, avidly am against asymmetry My reasons are twofold First of all, if we look at our four moves to date this year, the most efficient ones with regard to the move in the long rate relative to the move in the short rate were in May and in March, when we moved at a meeting In fact, we had bond market rallies when we moved at a meeting The next least efficient was in February, which was our first move, when we moved at a meeting The most inefficient, the only one in which we actually had a bond market selloff, was in April on our surprise move--a surprise in the sense that it was not taken at an announced FOMC meeting I don't think the market likes surprises; I think moving between meetings will buy us nothing; and it will cost us something on the long end of the market  Second, the question comes up on what data we should move I don't think we want to move on employment reports (a) for the reason Jerry Jordan mentioned and (b) for the reasons you gave You commented on just how inefficient and unclear the employment report    7/5-6/94  data are; they are lousy in this respect We don't know how to interpret them and we should not move on their release With regard to moving on a price number, I have to agree with Jerry Jordan's assessment that, even though I would tend to be very concerned, I would want to wait probably for two bad numbers before I drew any certain conclusions For example, you stated in the past that the homeownership component could move suddenly and that would bias the number I cannot imagine a single number that would cause me to want to move between meetings, given the inefficient results we have seen to date on our past four moves The only reason given for doing it is--your phrase was--to maintain the notion in the marketplace Well, in fact, the marketplace isn't going to know anything about it until after the next meeting was over And given that, based on current expectations, we probably are going to move at the August meeting--and I agree with your analysis completely--I see absolutely nothing to be gained and quite a bit to be lost, by an intermeeting move  But has it--  I think we have to make a terse announcement   Ted, I was very interested in your analysis about what might happen after the election It would seem to me that the election is what is putting the pressure on the peso Here we had a country that actually had enormous capital inflows and that not too long ago had to intervene in order to stay, depending on how you look at it, at the upper end of the value of the peso to protect it from going above its ceiling value Why do we think the fundamentals are    7/20/94  such that once the political pressure is off we would see a possible devaluation?  Is your view informed by you or is it informed by your conversations with Governor Mancera and others?  Weighing on the other side of the calculus is, I would imagine, the view of foreign investors who would be seeing in effect with your proposal a 10 percent confiscation of value    7/20/94  Thank you  On non-Mexican issues?  I'd like to ask Ted about the Super 301 story on Japan Do we think that there is any credibility to that as a possibility by September 30th?  I guess this question would be for Peter Fisher or anyone What would be the impact on the foreign exchange markets of naming Japan on the Super 301?  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman I noticed in the Greenbook projection a substantial decline in the rate of growth in domestic final sales relat ve to GDP, and I think that will come true I have distributed a table that I've based on something I've been playing with for a number years since I didn't know what was happening It involves distinguishing NIPA personal income from the money that households actually have to spend It's based on a fairly accurate theory that you can avoid taxes nowadays, but to do so you can't spend the money [Laughter] To show the adjustment--I'm going down the chart, line by line--wages basically pass through to cash flow Interest does, if you receive it, but most household interest- bearing assets are actually held in such things as 401Ks and never accrue in a cash form directly to the household And so the adjustment here is that I take both taxable and tax-exempt interest, which obviously does flow through to the household, as a share of total NIPA interest  With imputed interest? Imputed interest is not cash flow  But it is in the NIPA, that is correct--in proprietary income The same thing would be true for dividends It's a little challenging because a lot of what NIPA considers to be proprietary income actually may take the form of business-type consumption And so what I do again is to take the share that the taxpayers actually report as the share of total NIPA-based proprietary income With transfers, I'd like to thank the Research Division here I learned a lot about medical transfer payments which turn out to be a substantial portion of transfers I'm taking those out because if Medicare reimburses your doctor or if your insurance company reimburses your doctor, you really don't see the check, so that is taken out of transfers The same thing is true with other labor income which is paid into pension plans or health plans  It probably would feed through to cash flow and I'm willing to stipulate an adjustment several points to the right of the decimal point for that  1 A copy of the table discussed by Mr Lindsey is appended to this transcript  -17-    8/16/94  Especially for Federal Reserve directors, which may not even show up as an asterisk!  Rent and farm income--most of this number is actually income on owner-occupied houses I always reassure Susan that we have a higher income than we thought because we live rent free in the house, and she just laughs at me because we can't spend the money and indeed I believe her when it comes to assessing our household cash flow The other point on this is farm income Farmers generally have no income It's amazing that the industry still exists given how much they report on their tax returns The government would regularly make money in a budgetary sense by making the farm sector tax exempt But the easiest thing to do for this purpose, as far as I'm concerned, is just to zero it out I take out social insurance contributions and personal taxes, and what's left is the difference between disposable personal income, on a NIPA basis, and disposable personal cash flow You'll note that one is substantially below the other I then compared that to personal consumption expenditures And, indeed, looking at NIPA we might take a rather sanguine view of the household position because in fact during the last year, which was a very strong year for household employment, income actually grew faster than expenditures But if you compare it to cash flow, and here I think it's important to take out the third-party medical payments that pay for part of medical personal consumption expenditures, the number to compare would be 2052 in spending versus 1551 in cash flow And it suggests that in fact the increase in household spending was much more than the increase in the actual cash that they are seeing  Now, households could do this for a long period of time Where I see this as of concern is that it can't go on forever The difference between cash flow and income, in fact, I think is consistent with the double-digit rates of growth we have been seeing in installment credit The question is why are households doing this to themselves I think the Michigan survey had good reasons for it We created for other good reasons a great buying opportunity in the last year for houses and cars The survey asked people why, for example, now is a good time to buy cars Well, back in July of 1993, 38 percent said it was because prices are low, and that percentage has fallen to 28 percent, meaning prices are not seen as good today as they were a year ago On the other hand, a year ago 7 percent of respondents said now is the time to beat price increases That has doubled to 14 percent currently Another reason to buy now was the expectation that interest rates would go up, and that number has similarly increased So households a year ago or in the last year thought now is a good time to buy cars because prices were low and were going to go up, and interest rates were low and were going to go up I don't consider that a good indicator for the future The same thing was true with houses, but even stronger The argument that prices are low for houses has fallen from 33 percent to 19 percent in a year The expectation, on the other hand, that now is a good time to borrow in advance of rising interest rates has risen from 6 percent a year ago to 21 percent currently For houses as well, consumers have been spending money they don't have because we have had a bargain  -18-    8/16/94  basement sale for the last year That is not going to continue no matter what we do today Similarly, I think businesses have been having a good time in the last year If you look at the difference between cash flow for businesses and plant and equipment expenditures, it's been running with cash flows substantially above plant and equipment expenditures since about 1992 At the same time, there have been record-setting net increases in nonfinancial equities and bonds outstanding  All that put together suggests that there are a lot of expectations of inflation in the household sector; there is a substantial accumulation of cash, which presumably can feed inflation in the business sector The question is whether or not it will come to pass So I think we are in a very bad dilemma I think nominal GDP is growing too fast; I think the mix is going to worsen; I think the consumer is going to spend less; and we are going to have less real growth But at the same time, I believe we are going to see accelerating inflation and that means the good times are over and we have to stop celebrating and we have to make a tough decision  I support your proposal, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman I tend to concur with both the staff and the markets that both nominal and real fed funds will be higher six months from now than they are today That doesn't mean we should feel any compelling need to move today And what I would like to do is to take a look at what I think are two important events that will take place between now and our next meeting, and they were touched on by Peter Sternlight earlier on [Laughter]--  Oh, I'm sorry!  His ghost is here; he is haunting me Okay, good, so much for my credibility!  Yes, if that's possible  I would highlight two dates The first is September 30th and that was mentioned earlier That's the deadline for the negotiations between the United States and Japan and the issue of rhetoric comes up I think the situation there has worsened in the last few weeks and that has to do with the changing perception of the bargaining position of the two countries Beginning with the United States, I think it is clear to the Administration that its confrontational approach to the Japanese has been an unmitigated disaster The US bargaining position today is substantially weaker than it was 12 or 18 months ago We used what would normally be a weapon of last resort, dollar devaluation, and we used it inexpertly, and the Japanese economy seems to have survived it Indeed, the market reaction to this inexpert diplomacy has been so adverse that it has hurt the Administration's claim to have brought long-term interest rates down The political ramifications have been negative and I think that fact is now widely appreciated within the Administration So as of a few weeks ago the Administration, from what I was told, was looking for a graceful way of surrendering In effect, the Japanese were told that they could basically set the terms as long as they made noises about how painful those terms were, the intent being to save face for the United States  On the Japanese side, the choice is a tougher one It's whether to take that offer and presumably buy peace for the rest of this Administration's term or to try for something more In general, I think politicians over there seem inclined to favor a deal that would be sufficiently mild to get them through the next Japanese elections, but it would have to be demonstrably mild I think the current LDP-socialist alliance, which represents the anti-reformist portion of Japanese politics, would find it a particularly sweet irony to score such a victory, given that this Administration failed to cut a deal with two clearly more pro-United States and pro-reform governments earlier in the year However, some politicians and the bureaucracy see enormous potential for getting even more by holding out, and I think this was what the hawkish comments suggested earlier The fact that the United States has been defeated by the Japanese is widely appreciated in the Japanese government, and as a result the option is there for a humiliation of the United States that would be made clear by a negotiated defeat, which so far has not entered US political consciousness The gains for the Japanese by forcing a humiliating set of terms on this Administration or at least avoiding a face-saving exit by the Administration would mean not just two years of peace, but perhaps a period of peace lasting several Administrations That would mean in effect that future politicians  -19-    9/27/94  would have been scared from using Japan-bashing as a weapon Of course, this Administration can't accept humiliating terms five weeks before our elections, so the possibility that neither side may blink is I think pretty high, and the result for the markets could be tumultuous  The second date that we should be paying attention to is October 16th, which is the date of the German federal elections I am a bit of a political poll junkie and those polls coupled with the Bavarian elections on Sunday suggest to me that Mr Kohl is unlikely clearly to win a fourth term Too many things have to go right The Free Democrats have to make the 5 percent threshold to get into Parliament; I think they probably will, but it's no sure thing The PDS, which is the Party of Democratic Socialism--my, how names change --probably won't get the 5 percent, but they are probably going to get into Parliament another way, which is to win three seats outright, as they probably will in East Germany by direct vote, and get their full proportional share So, somehow they have to fail to get those three seats The far right has to fail to make the 5 percent threshold as well And assuming all these things go right, the blue/yellows or the Christian Democrat/Free Democrat vote has to be greater than the red/greens, or Social Democrat/ecologist vote Any one of those events may be likely, but I think the chances of all of them going the right way seem to be quite small As a result, I think what we are going to see is the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats agreeing to a coalition The markets know what that means, namely an inexpert, compromising, and vacillating German government for four years with the growth of both right and left on the fringes That would not be good for Europe; it would not be good for Germany; it would not be good for the bond markets  In sum, if things go wrong on September 30th, we could face some combination of foreign currency bond market problems If things go wrong on October 16th, I think the result would be a short-term appreciation of the dollar coupled with a general sell-off in worldwide debt markets in the longer term In either event, the potential need for an adjustment in US rates is possible I'm going to be quite specific I made my views on the efficacy of foreign exchange intervention fairly clear several meetings ago, and I won't go into that again, but my suggestion this time is that if intervention is requested, we make explicit that it be accompanied by a change in policy and in particular that it be accompanied by a change in policy of 50 basis points Frankly, Mr Chairman, I think that having that be the policy of this Committee would strengthen your negotiating power in resisting what most people in this room find distasteful But hopefully we will survive both September 30th without a need for foreign exchange intervention and October 16th And if we do so, no rate increase would be needed and we can come back to the normal considerations of monetary policy in November  I support what you propose, Mr Chairman I normally don't like moving intermeeting, but I think the chances are we probably should this time   Yes!  A one-year old girl  For now, it is either feed me or change me; that won't always be so  So move  I had Governor Blinder's question But I had another one on profits You have a very sharp deceleration in profit growth in the forecast, and I have a cause and effect question about that The cause question is whether the deceleration is due to a narrowing of margins You were mentioning earlier your perception of the PPI and the changes there Secondly, on the effects side, I am surprised that given a very sharp deceleration in the outlook for profits, you have real business fixed investment holding up as well as it is at very high levels Could you also give me on the effects side your perception of what this means for equity markets?  And the effect on investment?  So that would begin with 1997?  Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the national picture, I'd like to associate my comments with the very eloquent analysis of President McDonough; he was right on target With regard to the staff forecast, I would only add the issue of timing We do not know in what quarter the economy will slow down, but we do know that it will slow down I think the point about forecasting increasingly hard landings is a good lesson for us As a side note on hard landings, if anyone really wants to experience a hard landing I recommend Rumanian Air [Laughter]  -25-    11/15/94  At the last meeting, I set aside my normal reservations and favored an asymmetric directive because I perceived the possible need for foreign exchange intervention I specifically recommended that, if we had that intervention, it be accompanied at that time by a 50 basis point increase in rates Frankly, I think that had we done that at the time, the move would have been both appropriate and, I would add, sufficient Why did we have the intervention? It wasn't because of volatility or disorderly markets It wasn't a signal of policy change at the time The word that was most commonly used was a "bridge" A bridge to what? At the time, cynics in the market and a few of the press reports guessed it was a bridge to the election I hope and trust that that was not the case, and no one knew what the outcome would be anyway I think the other option was that it was a bridge to what we are about to do today If so, if we are bridging to a 50 basis point move, which everyone anticipates, then it would be like building a bridge to the middle of the river, which is actually another thing they do in Rumania, [Laughter] but so much for that The key is that I think markets will probably think we are all wet if we do [Laughter]  That is what happens when you are awakened at 200 and 400 in the morning by a one-year old! The other part of my trip, I had both our bureaucracy and the Rumanian bureaucracy prepare a serendipitous schedule The first part of the week I was in Paris and I was able to go on from there after meetings I think both in meetings and also in private meetings I had with  and with folks at there was a strong sense that US policy is behind the  curve I can only second what Peter mentioned about the perception that we are behind and that therefore a big increase would be coming Of course, diplomats always talk about it a little circumspectly My favorite description was by one of the Europeans that monetary policy was behind the curve in non-European OECD economies [Laughter] I don't think they were talking about the Australians and New Zealanders, but here we are The bottom line is that while I certainly do not believe in the tail wagging the dog, and I certainly don't think that foreign exchange concerns should drive our long-run policy, I do think that given what the folks around the table have said about the strength of the economy, the issue is not whether to move but when Frankly, I think our intervention really boxed us in a corner, and I don't think that the 50 basis point option is still there So, I would join others in recommending that we do something more than that  Mr Chairman, I agree with your analysis and your recommendation I also agree with the points that Governors Yellen and Blinder made earlier I hope that we won't go 150 basis points, because I think your analysis was on the money The question I have to ask myself is how best to avoid that I think the best way is by going 75 today Frankly, I think if we go 50 today, we are going to be locked into doing 50 in December I agree we can't prejudge the next meeting, but I support 75 today in the hope--and I must say the expectation--that December will be 0  There are two counter-factuals One would be not intervening and having something happen at this meeting; the other would be intervening coupled with a monetary policy change at the time That's one you did not mention; that's in fact the one I recommended Had we done that, I think we would have been in a much better position; we would have been at 50 instead of 75 I think we would have signaled a policy change that is at least intellectually consistent with what we all believe  There is no question that we have no way of making that judgment; that's what markets are for That's why I think it is inappropriate for us to take on the job of guessing at some point that the market is oversold and now is the time to plunge in The Sword of Damocles would hang I agree that markets are not always rational When those players who behave irrationally are punished by losing money, the people who hold the Damocles Sword and wield it effectively are rewarded by making money That's how those markets work We are putting ourselves in that position So my first choice would be for us not to intervene But I think we have to think about this from a public choice perspective Right now, it is absolutely costless for the Treasury to decide to play with what former Vice Chairman Mullins used to call that "little toy in the closet" We all wrote papers saying we should never use it, but when we get in the position of having it, we just can't stop ourselves from using it If we are going to intervene, I think that we gain two advantages by having our general posture be that the intervention be coupled with a monetary policy change One, it is at least intellectually consistent; the intervention may work, but then again it may not work But secondly, it creates a price for the Treasury  Let's not admit it to the world But when the phone rings in your office, if you have behind you the view of this Committee that a monetary policy change will ultimately accompany an intervention, you will have a weapon supporting you in the view that I think you really hold, and that is that intervention should be used rarely if at all  We don't, but I think we should have that as the Chairman's weapon  In point of fact, we had a view; we stated it in our asymmetric directive It was quite clear what this Committee wanted to do It was quite clear that that was consistent with an appropriate action if an intervention occurred And I will stipulate that the Committee's view may vary from time to time  My precise recommendation at the last meeting was that because foreign exchange markets were likely to be unstable, that we go asymmetric and have a 50 basis point move as our explicit price for intervention I think that was quite appropriate I think that that would be the right kind of message for us to send in the current environment if a multilateral move or any kind of intervention were to come up in the intermeeting period  There may be other reasons to adjust monetary policy, but it should be clear that there is a price associated with intervention There is a monetary policy change that accompanies our intervention  I am very sympathetic to that point of view I don't think that in practice we could withdraw On the other hand, I also know that we have a Treasury that likes to intervene more than we would like it to intervene What I would like to do is give you, Mr Chairman, an extra weapon to say "no" The only extra weapon that I can think of, the only extra bargaining chip that we can give you, given that I don't think we can do what Al wants and given that we are intervening too much, is the implicit threat that we will view the price of exchange rate intervention as being an interest rate change  -53-    11/15/94  It sounds to me that you are saying that we are acting in order to restrain our ability to act, and I am not sure that that makes a lot of sense Ted referred to opportunities to discuss proposed operations in conference calls Now, one of the great beauties of the US Constitution, which makes our foreign policy adversaries furious, is the Senate's right to say "no" My real question for Ted is Do we have the right to say "no"? If we had that right, in other words if actual vote approval of this Committee were required, the sticks in the closets would be quite numerous and that might be quite an appropriate move If it is just to notify us and have us ask questions, I think that's a different issue   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll try and stay entirely on the right side of the fence by talking about fiscal policy! [Laughter] I have three observations to make First, we are now getting the first indications of the effects of the 1993 tax law changes I have presented scoring stories to this group before I want to stress that what we have are very preliminary indications, but they are from both the macro aggregate level and from detailed micro data that were published in Statistics of Income  According to our staff estimates, if you look at a liability model estimate of what taxpayers owed, in 1992 it was $498 billion and in 1993 it was $522 billion We had a net gain of $24 billion in liabilities  Yes, I'm looking at the individuals' side here Personal income rose 43 percent between 1992 and 1993  Slightly below that--41 percent But there are offsetting factors I could go on for too long, but you don't want me to  The general approach to estimating, given the adjustments the Chairman is talking about, would be to take per-tax- return personal income The elasticity of receipts with respect to per-return personal income based on the index used for inflation is 10 The elasticity for real increases is about 15 The inflation index for 1993 was 28 percent So we would expect, if nothing had changed in the law, about a 5 percent overall increase in nominal receipts or $25 billion We got $24 billion, which doesn't leave any room for revenue from the tax increase Looked at from an alternative point of view, the estimated revenue from the tax rate increase was $15 billion So, that would leave $9 billion left over, or an increase of about 18 percent attributable to economic growth So, we would have to assume that receipts grew at only about 40 percent of the rate of increase in nominal income, which is also implausible The micro data tell a very similar story These are early tax return estimates and every year the Statistics of Income publishes an early compilation I would stress that the data are early What I want to contrast is, for the same type of sample, the top 763,000 taxpayers which in 1992 were those making over $200,000 Overall AGI for those taxpayers rose 4 percent versus 2-1/2 percent for other taxpayers  -22-    12/20/94  But when you break down the composition of income you get a pattern that I think strikingly suggests an enormous behavioral response For example, looking at Schedule C income, which is notoriously susceptible to changes in tax rates, people making under $200,000 did not have a bad year; they gained about 3 percent, but the rich people did terribly They had a decline of 43 percent in their reported business income And while corporate profits for C Corporations did great in 1993, and partnership and S Corp profits for people making under $200,000 rose 28 percent, those sorts of profits fell 25 percent for people who were affected by the tax rate increase The third parameter that is probably most susceptible to tax rate behavioral responses is charitable giving Where overall charitable giving rose about 3 percent, charitable giving by those making over $200,000 rose 41 percent If we add up the dollar changes here, a $55 billion decline in business income, a $14 billion decline in partnership income, and $29 billion in extra charitable deductions, just looking at those three factors we get a shortfall from 1992 levels of $223 billion that would have been taxed at an average rate of 38 percent That would give us a shortfall of $85 billion In other words, more than half of the tax increase was offset by behavioral responses I found it striking because both the micro and macro data point in the same direction  I think that that type of evidence plus evidence that has accumulated over the last 15 years is going to lead to some modest changes, and I want to emphasize the word "modest," in the scoring process that Congress will use But I do want to disagree--and I rarely do--with Bob McTeer's observation I think that we should keep in mind a number of effects with regard to what is going to happen to fiscal policy In my mind the short-term effects of fiscal policy will probably be contractionary To explain why, first, I think the dynamic will be to produce a near-term balanced change in the overall scoring There are two philosophical reasons why the new leadership in the House should do that First, Newt is a political philosopher, and his basic strategy is to reverse the observation that all politics is local, which is Tip O'Neill's approach, where you buy off the taxpayers in your District by putting up a project and they don't care about the national effect, meaning the tax implications The election was run on a reversal of that strategy And so I think if you're placing yourself in Newt's shoes as a political strategist, you want both to pay off your constituents and punish the opposition That requires both tax cuts and spending increases  In addition, I think the lesson of the iron triangle is not lost, and there will be intentional efforts to try and weaken the long-term effects of the relationship between the bureaucracy, Hill staff, and the press by defunding it So I think we will see that the timing of spending reductions will be much quicker than anyone anticipates And they will be heavily oriented toward what in Washington we call "reductions in force" and the rest of the country calls "firings" They actually are not firings; they are buyouts So, here is why I'd like to elaborate on why we should keep in mind that probably the net effect of what we are going to see is a fiscal contraction With a buyout you give the departing employee a lump sum payment That expands the government deficit But the newly laid off employee does not run out and spend his buyout immediately; in fact, he's a little traumatized and will actually cut back on spending So  -23-    12/20/94  there would be one example of where you'd get an increase in the budget deficit which would not feed back into higher aggregate demand  Second, of those prospective tax increases, I think two in particular will happen One is a child credit which actually will be dribbled out over the course of the entire fiscal year and may not even start until midyear So you get $10 a week in your paycheck The timing of the median-dollar fiscal impetus will be much later than the timing of the offsetting dollar of spending cuts The other tax cut, which is capital gains, I think has clear timing issues More important, I think there are issues for the effect on the marginal propensity to consume that dollar, which I think is probably quite low So, I believe the net fiscal impetus that is going to come from the budget changes on a timing basis is going to be quite negative for 1995 and 1996 Second, I think if we look at the marginal propensity to consume issues again, the effect on demand of any fiscal change is going to be rather small We always taught that the balanced budget multiplier was around 1 in a very simplified model or more precisely that the effect of a spending cut is more dramatic than the effect of a tax change  There is a third reason why that's going to affect the economy in a negative way, and that is that we are going to see I think an intensely regional distribution of the spending changes, mainly focused in the northern portions of the Fifth District! If you want any indication of that, go for a tour of some of the nicer sections of Upper Northwest section of Washington, and you will see "For Sale" signs just about everywhere, although I think there were local elections which may have affected that outcome as well as the national elections As in the case of defense spending cutbacks, I think we are going to see a highly regionalized effect  The third observation I'd have on the net impact is on the regulatory side I think that compared to the fiscal actions the regulatory actions of the new Congress will be extremely dramatic Here I think the right model to think about is what happens to GDP when you stop building a pyramid I don't mean to imply that all of our regulations are pyramids, but some have cost-benefit relations which are not much better When you stop building a pyramid, you lay off workers and you have a negative effect on GDP Those workers will eventually find employment Their real output will be higher, but those real output gains will not be seen for two or three years I think we are going to see a major change in the regulatory apparatus, and particularly in the mandating of the private sector and state and local governments to spend money for federal regulatory purposes The net result, I think, will also be contractionary on the economy, at least over the forecast horizon Thank you  I want to associate myself fully with Governor Blinder's views My reasoning is similar The first observation is that I think the November move was extremely successful Our decision to go 75 basis points took off the market pressure in both the foreign exchange market and the bond market I think had we moved 50 basis points, we would be moving another 50 basis points today So in that sense we should be patting ourselves on the back for our last move And as a result I don't think we should move right now  I have four reasons for not preferring an asymmetric directive The first has to do with data Reporters often ask whether we are waiting for information from the Christmas season to decide what we are going to do The right answer is that there is absolutely nothing that we are going to do at this meeting that could conceivably affect the Christmas season or vice versa In fact, as our discussion about lags has indicated, what we are talking about is not even the first quarter; what we are talking about is late 1995 and early 1996 with regard to the effect of our actions So, rather than looking at current activity we have to use our crystal balls, which admittedly are cloudy, and stare down the road So, I'm not sure what information is going to come out in January to cause us to change our minds  On the other hand, I do think that over the longer period we are going to have information that will be useful We will have more information on where fiscal policy is headed and sooner than we usually do In addition, we are going to have information on the consumer I think the anecdotal evidence on the consumer situation, as Governor Kelley suggested, is that they appear to be tapped out In fact, when you talk to bankers, they are now issuing credit cards to C and D class credits, and they are doing so profitably I'm saving this for the next meeting,'but when I look at the cash flow situation of households, the only private sector support for this spending in my mind is a buildup of consumer credit I think the credit data bear that out So, I would rather delay for information reasons--certainly not move in January, and I may even want to delay at our next meeting on January 31-February 1  The other issues have to do with our tactics in the market We have learned this year that moving at meetings gives us a much more efficient tradeoff measured by the short-term move compared to the long-term move Generally, we have had flat or rallying markets on moves at meetings We have been unsuccessful when we moved intermeeting, and I think that is another reason not to go asymmetric and not to move intermeeting  Finally, and I think this reinforces President Melzer's point, we will have to consider our long-term intentions at our next meeting and we will be making not only a tactical move but a strategic move And I think we should at the very least want to hold whatever tactical moves we have until we know where we are going to go  -37-    12/20/94  strategically So for those reasons I concur with Mr Blinder and urge symmetric "B"  Somewhat and slightly? You said somewhat more and slightly less?   Alan, this is Larry Lindsey I just was wondering if we have any estimates of how much the current devaluation will shrink their current account deficit   Could I ask Peter Fisher a question? There has been a lot of talk that the dollar is going to be weak for a number of reasons In the case of a leveraged takeover, which is how some people view this, should you short the acquirer, which is us? In addition, this is kind of un-Bundesbank-like of us isn't it?   I nominate Alan Greenspan as chair  This should have been staged better!  Unfortunately I am going to be dissenting on this I realize I am in the minority The discussion in your memo says there is a strong consensus that we would all be better off if the practice of taping FOMC meetings had never begun That is true  -15-    1/31-2/1/95  It is also true that this Committee never authorized the maintenance of tapes As the memo points out later on, most of us were taken by surprise when we found out that the transcripts were maintained So I think that there is an issue of justice here and that we are ratifying an injustice by approving the recommendation, practical though it may be  The second concern I have is a hypothetical one At the moment we live in a very benign political environment in which the chances that the tapes will be used against the Committee are very slim That is not necessarily the environment we should presume in considering whether or not it is wise to tape these proceedings In fact, an abundance of caution would suggest that we should imagine a very non-benign situation One might think of it as a witch hunt in which we are turning over to the prosecutors evidence that is really none of their business It is possible for us to prevent taping under those circumstances by turning off the tape now It will not be possible in that less benign political environment for us to turn off the tape when we feel we need to So, I think we should show at least a little caution about the vagaries of the political process and protect not ourselves but some future Committee that may be in a more hostile political time than that in which we find ourselves and I'd turn off the tape now while we can do it  I have a point of information that I think gets to the heart of President Boehne's comment and our willingness to redact certain materials Mr Chairman, is it your intention to turn off the tape during the discussion of Mexico we are about to have later this afternoon?  No quarrel from me; I think it makes the point that we were making earlier  To turn off the tape; let's turn it off  Pardon me!  What do you think they do on weekends?  Just a point of information--I always thought dissenting statements were required They are not?  -33-    1/31-2/1/95  I have always been asked for one whenever I have dissented I didn't want to bother writing one [Laughter] If you are going to tell me that in the future that I have less work to do when I dissent, I will be delighted [Laughter] So, I take it that there is no requirement to issue a dissenting statement?  Thank you for the point of information  Yes, I hope not to dissent very much, but-- [Laughter]  I think, first of all, that the blackout was defined so that we never, never, never talk about what goes on at an FOMC meeting, period--whether that is one week before, two weeks before, eight weeks before, or seventeen weeks after It is not an issue of talking about the FOMC because we never should I have no right to tell someone what any of you said; that is your business  -36-    1/31-2/1/95  That is correct and I think that is important We should separate out the FOMC from the blackout issue I think not talking to the press about economics or monetary policy is very useful the week before because of the issue of how we are going to vote If we do, reporters are going to write it all up in the Sunday supplements It probably was useful to have the blackout after the meeting while there was some ambiguity about how we voted, but in practice I think that, given the obligations we have to the public to explain our views, allowing us to talk about the economy and give economic speeches the week after is not unreasonable Otherwise, we are in a situation where we are in blackout literally one-third of the time I can respect the people who like that situation, but it is very, very difficult If we are going to have the kind of strict blackout that Joe discussed where we do not talk about monetary policy or the economy, then I suggest we limit it to one week per meeting  I think we have just proved the anti-economist adage that, if we lay all the economists in the world end to end, we will not reach a conclusion I will at least try to touch both ends At the last meeting I was looking for a bridge to both sides of the river; I will continue that analogy I thank you for raising the Mack measure because I think it focuses our discussion  The first point I would make is that if it comes down to a choice between Humphrey-Hawkins and a Senator Mack proposal, I think the right way to do the Mack proposal is to see it as a way to change Humphrey-Hawkins Governor Blinder probably incorrectly characterized Humphrey-Hawkins as giving us a dual objective; it does not It gives us seventeen, eighteen--heaven knows how many; there is a paragraph of objectives That is not a good directive for the Federal Reserve I think I can say that few of us would select Humphrey-Hawkins if we were drafting this kind of legislation The gain here is that we are opening a door that we should use as a vehicle for change  Second, I view as very well taken Janet Yellen's point that we should not oversell and should not underestimate the costs of a Mack proposal We need to be honest, and I do not think there is any disagreement on that at this table The Mack legislation would be costly Third, I think if we look at the loss function, or the other side of the loss function which is a gain function, we find that politicians are well aware of the gain function The reason we have fourteen-year terms is the recognition that politicans are well aware of the gain function and want to exploit it They exploited it as recently as the late 1970s, and we had a very painful disinflation to pay for it If there was an advantage to changing the law toward focusing on price stability, it would not necessarily be to change our behavior but as a recognition of this political disequilibrium I think that is a real plus in passing something like that  Fourth, one of the things we all taught in economics was that, if we have one instrument, we can only work with one target I don't think it necessarily follows that the target should be price  -53-    1/31-2/1/95  inflation I think it should be nominal GDP, and I believe that is somewhat in line with-what Governor Yellen said But once we pick nominal GDP as our objective function, it begs a second question that has to be answered It is that a nominal GDP target probably has to be consistent with some desired level of inflation So, having this process and having Congress tell us some desired level of inflation, I think is probably good But our target should not be the desired level of inflation; our target should be nominal GDP You disagree? Well, not wildly! [Laughter]  The final part of whatever Congressional testimony we have on this subject is that the real focus of Congressional action should not be to tell us what the inflation rate should be, although that would be useful It should be on the policy actions they control that affect the nonaccelerating rate of inflation I do not think it is given to us by God; I do not think it is etched in stone; I think it is given to us by the Congress I think that higher real minimum wages raise the NAIRU and lower real minimum wages lower the NAIRU We can go through a whole list of other things So the right way to improve the loss function or gain function is not in this room; it is up there on Capitol Hill Maybe part of our objective should be to remind them of that  Ted, I'm sorry, we are having trouble hearing  Why do we come before other creditors to the Treasury--I guess that is another way of stating the question--with regard to any funds? In other words, why do we come in front of Social Security recipients?  But 80 percent of their balance sheet is going to be pesos!  $26 billion?  Ted, credibility has been a problem all along I want to ask two questions First, you said that Governor Mancera wants $2 billion so he can pad his balance sheet before it is released tomorrow Now, one of the things that would be most useful in the long term would be for the Bank of Mexico to provide an honest description of its balance sheet not only to us, which would be useful, but to the public at large  After we pad his balance sheet tomorrow is this going to stop?  But they are not releasing the Bank of Mexico's balance sheets?  That is right  My second question has to do with our credibility I don't know what questions to ask, and I hope you will help me out in that regard I have this document in front of me, which includes a page entitled "What is the Exchange Stabilization Fund?" The document came from Treasury International Affairs I gather it was written by them I have written enough of these to know what you do, and that is to tell your point of view Paragraph 3, not to mention the dots indicating an omission in paragraph 2, got me a little nervous Paragraph 3 says these holdings in the ESF are used to enter into swap arrangements with foreign governments, to finance exchange market intervention, to provide short-term bridge finance, etc, and all these things are great So, basically paragraph 3 is establishing that this is not unprecedented My question would be Do we do all these nice things if it's not in support of the dollar? Is this unprecedented with regard to the fact that we are supporting another currency?  I am talking about the third paragraph I will go to the second paragraph in a second I'm sorry I am running a little out of order It is saying the ESF has done all these things  So that has happened before?  -68-    1/31-2/1/95  I think we all will be asked questions about this Can you read this paper and tell me that there is not something missing that I should know about, meaning that this is not only the truth but the whole truth?  Yes  Is there anything missing on this page?  About notifying Congress in writing in advance?  Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to join what sounds like virtually universal praise for the new approach in the Greenbook I thought it was very, very helpful to have it stated this way  I also want to agree with what Bob Forrestal and Bob McTeer were saying about the tendency to go too far There are some caution signs out there Even those rabid inflationists, the Shadow Open Market Committee, have suggested that we might want to consider saying, "enough is enough"  I am not sure exactly what a soft landing is all about, but I would like to pose a thought as to what it is We tend to approach policy by looking at a way of restricting flows sufficiently to get the economic expansion down to a sustainable growth path In practice, most major recessions including the 1991, 1982, 1980, and 1974 recessions involved wealth destruction That was the main cause of the slowdown in the economy I am toying with the notion of defining a soft landing as one where the slowdown is accomplished without wealth destruction I hope we keep that in our minds when we think about how far we are going to go in raising interest rates The Greenbook is about right in saying that we are going to have a  -93-    1/31-2/1/95  slowdown, but I think it is going to occur a little later than the Greenbook is indicating  I am very concerned about the situation in the consumer sector where I think we are going to be seeing a cut in flows anyway The consumer is simply overextended Of the roughly $250 billion increase in personal consumption expenditures from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, 44 percent was put on installment credit, meaning credit cards or auto loans People just can't finance 44 percent of their increased spending through higher debt and do that for very long Mortgage data are a similar concern If you look at increased mortgage payments over gross investment in housing in 1993, the ratio was 77 percent The 80 percent figure is pretty standard for a first-time home buyer If you figure that existing homeowners also are going to be taking out mortgages, however, that will take appreciation out of existing homes If that calculation is made, increased mortgages exceeded net investment in housing by $55 billion, meaning aside from our capital gains, people were taking money out of the housing sector as well as financing 44 percent of their increased spending on installment credit That is just not going to go on for much longer The question is When is it going to stop?  I think the Greenbook has the fiscal policy slowdown just about right, but the fact is we just do not know, and we are going to have to see Again, I think the risks as in the consumer sector are probably on the down side and not on the up side The risks come because our Congress is not a smoothly functioning machine The biggest cog that I can see, and it is a whopper, is the debt ceiling bill Assuming Congress can pass a budget resolution in April, which is probable, the debt ceiling traditionally has been something on which every congressman can hang a bauble and try to get it through because the legislation has to pass or else the government shuts down Since we have that coming up, I think that the risks in fiscal policy are big and their financial ramifications are also large  Similarly, I think the risks in the net export sector are all on the down side If one thinks about the uncertainties When is Deng going to die in China, or is he already dead, and what will that mean? Russia seems to be in chaos; the Middle East seems bankrupt; Latin America will speak for itself All of these problems suggest that we have a lot of downside risks to the economy  There is a major upside risk that has not been mentioned and that I think will tend to delay the timing of the slowdown That is the cut in FDIC premiums, down to 4 basis points, that was announced yesterday by the FDIC That cut is in effect going to be pumping $5 billion more into the capital of the banking sector That $5 billion would have been very, very valuable back in 1991 when bank capital was constrained At present, given that banks are not capital-constrained but will want to put that capital to use, I look forward to such things as getting two credit card solicitations a day instead of the current one, and similar frivolous uses of bank credit All of this, I think, is going to postpone the inevitable slowdown  I am in have a slowdown occur later than  agreement with the Greenbook that we are going to It will be flow-based But I think it is going to  in the Greenbook projection That raises the  -94-    1/31-2/1/95  question of whether we have gone too far, and I think it is a fair question We also have to balance it with what I think is a very risky international situation There I come back to being a two- handed economist, and I am not going to bore you with both hands Instead, I am going to wait to hear what you are going to tell us, Mr Chairman [Laughter]  When is the deadline?  We all care passionately!  Moving up toward two per day, yes!  Mr Chairman, strictly on the basis of domestic considerations, I would associate myself with Governor Blinder for the reasons he stated and for another one We are going to be finding out not only retail sales; we are going to have both the Administration's budget and Mr Gingrich's budget unveiled in the next two weeks I think the reactions to that will answer some of our questions about fiscal policy I do not know about the quality of the answers, but at least that will light a match in an otherwise completely dark room I think your observations on the international side are well-taken The case against waiting--I am going to flip the nuances of the way Governor Blinder said it--is that if we had a compelling reason to go one way or the other domestically, we should do it If, however, we wait and we have a crack in the dollar in the next two weeks, the amount of tightening we would have to do in order to counteract that crack would be a lot more than 50 basis points So, given that there is some uncertainty about the domestic scene, I view a 50 basis point increase as probably buying us some insurance that we will not have to tighten further And so, I can very much support your proposal  I have two questions The first has to do with the responsibility that we might have to monitor the agreement It is widely believed on Capitol Hill that the reason to vote for this is that the Federal Reserve will be monitoring Mexican monetary policy In addition, the IMF released a statement yesterday saying that the Federal Reserve along with the IMF will monitor developments closely during the next six months Would you tell us what our responsibil- ities are to monitor an agreement that has not been reached yet and whose terms we don't know?  Right  us?  Do we know what other commitments they have  You are confident there are not a lot of big surprises?  There was supposed to be a letter to Senator Dole, I believe today, outlining the conditions that we were going to place on Mexican economic policy Do you have any idea what those conditions are at this point?   Okay But, believe me, in the minds of the members of Congress we are locked in; we are the ones who are to uphold this agreement even though we have not agreed to it  There is a difference between technical assistance and the word "monitor"  Even though you have not been asked, it has been reported that you have agreed!  To umpire zipswitch [Laughter]  Mr Chairman, I had two points the big "P" political point and the small "p" political point First, I find myself uncomfortable disagreeing with you Pat Buchanan had a good quote in The Wall Street Journal the other day He was talking about the collapse of the Mexican bailout bill He said that this was the first complete rout of the governing elite since the League of Nations went down to defeat Now, I was for the Mexican bailout If I had been here in 1919, I probably would have been for the League of Nations So, I am on the side of the governing elite  Well, he is running against us Our political risk is not going to come from the chairmen and the senior members of the current majority Our political risk comes because people in the country are damn mad A bill that they opposed was defeated, and now the governing elite, to use Pat Buchanan's phrase, has said in effect We are going to win anyway because we are going to go around all the normal processes and pull money out of this little pot people never knew even existed and use that money Well, maybe everyone will forget about it, but I don't think so I think that is where--  If it does not work we--and I cannot imagine a greater governing elite group than this institution--and all governing elites are going to be under a microscope I very much agree with the point made earlier that because we are so obviously an elite, if the elites come under question, then our functions are going to be revised by Congress Our political risk in this is enormous  -140-    1/31-2/1/95  The second point I would make is that, frankly, given examples such as the Camdessus memo, we have been treated--to borrow a phrase--a lot like mushrooms The only thing we can do about that, I think, is to maximize what little bargaining power we have when we have it We happen to have the maximum bargaining power right now Once we approve these two documents, which I have no problem with in themselves, we have no bargaining power left So, I would modify the pace at which Governor Blinder said we should do things and request that we get answers to those questions before we ratify this Now, we could even make the motion that we approve these subject to getting the "third page," to use your phrase But once we approve these, we have no more bargaining power, and the people who are committing us without our consent have unlimited capacity to commit us to more things   I just pulled out a confidential Class II-FOMC document here It reports on exchange rates I read the document very carefully and I don't see why it is confidential  I understood it to be a deterioration  Thank you, Mr Chairman Like my colleague, Governor Kelley, I am agnostic The difference is that I am a scared agnostic Maybe I have to find the right church to go to or something to make me feel better about the future I am scared for two reasons First, with regard to the domestic economy, I think that the Greenbook underestimates what I view as very likely fiscal contraction later this year It seems to me that the way the politics are stacking up, we are going to have a contingent tax cut passed The contingency will be that we be on a steady and sure path of deficit reduction of about $25 billion a year in order to reach balance by 2002 Now, one can fantasize about how we will get to the out-year parts of that, but we can easily understand why Congress would be interested in passing such a near-term contingency in order to put dollars directly in voters' pocketbooks I would imagine that beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, where we now have what is described as a change in the High Employment Budget of roughly zero on a quarterly basis, we would see about 1/2 percent of GDP on an annual basis, about $25 billion a year, knocked off I think that will be a significant brake on the economy The reason that is a little frightening is that we are also in a situation where the financial sector is in much more precarious shape around the world than it is here The problems with the Japanese banking industry are well known in this room They will have to be marking to market on Friday, and that will be an interesting exercise both at the Bank of Japan and at the private financial institutions I think there will be some interesting activity between now and then Similarly, the German economy seems to have been slowing down I think the pressure on the Germans to do something about the deutschemark will become irresistible Here again, going back to Governor Kelley's analogy of history repeating itself, this reminds me a lot of late 1992 or early 1993 where the possibilities of strange things happening in currency markets seemed high  Back in this country, there is one other ghost on the horizon and that has to do with the debt ceiling bill that will have to pass, probably in September of this year I have been through two of those where the government shuts down and I went home as a Federal worker-- or whatever we do I went home anyway! [Laughter] The difference here is that the dynamic is slightly different Previously it was a failure of negotiations where the Executive was trying to restrain spending and Congress was trying to increase it That makes a lot of sense What we will have this time, I think, will be Congress trying to restrain spending The default in that situation really is a zero spending game, and I think it is quite possible to have a protracted period, unlike the 8 or 9 hours or in one case a 2-day period, when the government is shut down The ramifications of that for the economy and financial markets could be quite interesting There is a good chance we will avoid it, but if we don't the effects in our bond markets and world currency markets this fall will be very interesting to observe So, I am worried about the end of the year I think we are going to have a general drag on the economy from fiscal policy And with the Japanese, the Germans, and our Congress and Administration, the capacity for something worse happening certainly seems to be there  That is why I am an agnostic  Mr Chairman, in considering an asymmetric directive, I am reminded of the spring of 1993 I have been here so long that I am starting to look backward! In the spring of 1993, the fear of a bubble was mentioned at this table We actually had a pretty good bubble develop in the bond market, and we paid a fairly significant price for it in financial market instability later As you noted, that bubble gave an extra impetus to demand in late 1993 and early 1994 What we did, though, was to go asymmetric and then back off I have to conclude that doing that, if anything, cemented the market's view that we were stuck at a particular rate It only built the market's confidence that they could borrow at 3 percent and lend at 6 percent, which is literally what they were doing I'll be happy to vote for whatever the Committee majority favors But if what we fear is a bubble, we should not in my view go asymmetric unless we really expect to raise rates If people do want to raise rates and want to send a signal that we might be doing so, I think a few dissents would be a much more appropriate way of sending that signal Given what we did in 1993, going asymmetric and then backing off, I am afraid we would only strengthen the conviction of the market and maybe actually exacerbate the bubble So I favor symmetric   Overall consumer loan growth was 14 percent and that came in spite of a reduction in car loans?   Mr Chairman, I think I am going to be a minority here Two things concern me, one of which has not been mentioned at all and that is credit conditions It was pointed out that there has been a lot of easing of credit terms At some point that is going to stop Having arrived here at a very scary time in 1991, I am getting a little nervous that we may be setting ourselves up for another pro-cyclical move in our credit terms that might end up exacerbating the next business cycle Our surveys, for example, are all saying that credit terms are easing In the last month I must have had four delegations of bankers through my office complaining not only that their competitors were easing conditions, but that they were easing conditions too much Please stop me from doing it to myself was their message! That has to be of some concern I think it also is showing up in the data I remember getting briefings shortly after arriving here to the effect that never again in this millenium would another office building be built in America, and yet cranes are back on the horizon just 2-1/2 years later Similarly with household debt, 12 billion credit card solicitations were mailed out to the American people in the first quarter of 1995 That is five for every man, woman, and child in the country So, I suppose if I were typical I would have to say, now that my three-year-old has three cards and my one-year-old has two, that I should keep accepting new cards This is certainly not the kind of environment that is sustainable I would point out that the Greenbook forecast for 1996 has a decline in the saving rate from 1995 in order to sustain the rate of consumption growth Furthermore, even the higher 1995 saving rate is not sufficient to slow the rise in the ratio of installment debt to personal income, which means that it is going to rise even faster in 1996 Well, at some point that is going to stop; forty-four percent of all PCE growth last year was financed through installment debt, and that can't go on forever At some point either the banks are going to stop it themselves or we are going to stop it when, for example, we have a profits downturn or a cash flow downturn and suddenly all these backward-looking assumptions our examiners make about the quality of the balance sheet begin to go in reverse I don't know when that is going to happen, but I know it is going to exacerbate the downturn when it comes  Second, on fiscal policy, we also have to be a bit forward- looking and make the call The question that Mike raised is whether or not Congress will follow through or whether there will be some moderation in the fiscal policy actions We can make a bet either way There are four reasons why I think Congress is going to follow through The first has to do with the decision to take on Medicare All the campaign ads attacking the incumbents are already made for 1996 The advocates of Medicare cuts have heard the charge that old people will be pulled out of their sick beds and tossed onto the curb and everything else These members of Congress already know that they are going to face that kind of attack, so they may as well get some pluses out of this situation The only pluses they can get are to save the Medicare system from default and reduce the budget deficit There is no point in stopping now because they already have incurred the political cost Second, I think the party discipline which was expected to break down on hard votes has not done so There were 237 votes in the House for the reconciliation bill--they lost 5 Republicans and gained 12 Democrats on the vote Party discipline is  -25-    5/23/95  not breaking down and won't this year Third, in the power structure between the Congress and the Executive Branch, we have a return to what Madison had in mind when he envisioned a spendthrift king being checked by the taxpayers' representatives in the legislature That was the model for most of the republic's history It was reversed legislatively in the 1974 Budget Act, and the picture we all have now concerning how compromises are struck is based on the last 20 years In fact, the default option in fiscal policy is zero The President who wants to spend more than the Congress does not have a credible veto threat because the default option will produce less than he wants to spend That is going to become clear as we move through the 12 appropriations bills this fall In the end, it is going to be Congress that is going to pass a reconciliation bill Such a bill can't be filibustered and the President will have the choice of shutting down the entire government or signing the reconciliation bill Every president has bowed in the past and presidents will continue to bow to the more powerful position in negotiations that Congress has Finally, there is a temptation to lock these changes in place If the Medicare cuts are enacted, then point-of-order rules will require that any increase in spending be paid for And if you want to enact reforms that are going to survive, and arguably that is what some of the leadership wants to do, then the time to put those changes in is now  Logically, I don't understand how the process is not going to end up with a substantial fiscal contraction in 1996 Frankly, I think the yield curve is indicating that that is the expectation If it is true that we are not going to have growth in the low 2's but growth in the mid 1's--there is a real risk in waiting to find out, assuming the lags in monetary policy remain what they have been in this cycle If we wait, say, until the autumn, our rate reductions would have their effects about the time that the second round of fiscal reductions would hit in the fiscal 1997 budget That is certainly a risk There also is a risk in moving now because we are going to see oscillations in the likelihood of fiscal policy restraint actually passing I don't think we want to get involved in that game So, we have a tough call to make  On net, I think that monetary policy is probably a little tighter than we want it to be, but our regulatory policy is a little easier than we want it to be What I am afraid we are setting ourselves up for is another situation where we reverse monetary policy, and end up with too easy a monetary policy and too tight a regulatory policy We end up with the pushing-on-a-string phenomenon we saw during 1991 and 1992 I would urge earlier action in both areas to avoid that  12 billion in the first quarter  The bankers gave it to me  It is scary!  I support your proposal, Mr Chairman  I think you mean "might"   I have two, Peter First, could you just quickly repeat the part about the Mexican transaction?  Second question There seems to be a decline in the amount of liquidity in the foreign exchange markets brought about particularly by redemptions by hedge funds and others Do you think that has implications for the efficacy of intervention down the road? If the private sector has fewer poker chips, might we actually see intervention become more successful?  We only know about the individual withdrawals-- I guess they are called redemptions Do we have any sense at all of how big the market is and how much it has shrunk?  Five years from now, it will be read in the transcript for this meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman As at the last few meetings, I wanted to give a fiscal policy update, and I have distributed a table to the members of the Committee I think the table carries with it several messages First, I would refer you to a comparison of the two columns labeled "1995 Enacted" and "1996 602B Allocation" The 602B allocations are given by the budget committees to the various appropriations committees, and this is the amount of money they can divide up for actual spending I think the first thing that is instructive is that the basis for comparison on this table is nominal 1995 levels of spending We are not cutting from some baseline that includes growth; we are cutting from 1995 nominals The amount of the cut is just shy of $22 billion This is not mandatory spending; in other words, Medicare is not in here; Medicaid is not in here; food stamps are not in here  Oh yes, Social Security is not in here; interest payments are not in here These are real-money-out-the-door types of programs The $22 billion figure roughly contrasts with the discretionary number of $18 billion that is in the Greenbook The fact that these cuts are from a nominal level leads me to make some adjustment to see just how much contraction is occuring If we thought that real spending should be roughly constant next year, we would need to have an idea of GDP in 1996 and we would at least want to assume some kind of constancy in real spending and perhaps a little above that If we add a 3 percent inflation factor, we really are cutting real spending by something on the order of $37 billion as opposed to $21 billion, and that is before we get to the Medicare adjustments  The second observation I would make--we have a small sample of only five subcommittees on the table here--is that four of the five subcommittees have cut more than their 602B allocations These are appropriations subcommittees that refer back to the Appropriations Committee I can't remember this ever happening before  It hasn't happened, yes The chairmen of these subcommittees often are called the 13 cardinals If you have a problem, no matter what party you belong to, you go to one of the cardinals and their job is to take care of your post office or your  -25-    7/5-6/95  road or something like that Needless to say, when they are up against a 602B allocation they manage to spend all the money Otherwise, they don't keep their robes very long or whatever, I don't know what the analogy would be So, four of the five committees that have come in have cut below their 602B allocations The only thing I can read into that is that there is perhaps more political seriousness than is usually the case  The third thing to keep in mind here is that what is being balanced is that one has to successfully logroll to get a majority among two different groups of people The Budget Committee allocations involve one group of people, but they don't really have responsibility here These appropriations committee people are another group, and the fact that they are managing to get majorities in both is very, very instructive Basically, these are going through on party-line votes So, the amount of cohesion is quite high This, of course, is very, very early in the process We go from here to the Senate and then to a conference and then to the presidential veto, but so far I would say that the Appropriations Committee actions suggest that deficit reduction is at least on track Perhaps we are seeing some reductions below 602B allocations to have as bargaining chips later on You have to have something else you are willing to cut in order to get your program back But I think it is very, very striking that we are truly in a new world, as the Chairman just noted  Don, do we have evidence--I think there was some earlier--that the velocity of M2 is now back closer to zero  Yes  -37-    7/5-6/95  But it looks stable for the last two years?  I will phrase this as a question, but it is really a statement If in fact we are back to a more stable relationship, wouldn't a 1 to 5 percent growth range for M2 be a bit low?  That's the year 2000!  I want to explore a little further Don's answer to Governor Yellen I think in the past the Committee has lowered the ranges in part because we thought that the trend velocity of M2 had increased somewhat It was not that we believed that the ranges should be consistent with 3 percent growth in nominal GDP The latter was closer to 5 percent I think the fair question to ask is whether we think the velocity trend has shifted back to something closer to zero, and if we believe that, then I think it would be consistent with the Committee's forecast to change the M2 target range So, I think the rationale had more to do with our beliefs about the trend in velocity than it did with our trying to establish a range consistent with price stability in the year 2000  Mr Chairman, I had the unfortunate pleasure of having my maiden interview with the American Banker quoting me as saying that I am an M2 kind of guy  I understand exactly where you are coming from, but I will phrase it a little more cynically If after a year M2 growth is above the top of the target range, you will suggest then that we once again shift the range up as we shifted it down because growth was coming out near or below the bottom of the range  Given that you are the one who will be up on the Hill to testify on these issues, I am willing to go along with your suggestion My preference would be to go back to a higher range I would go for what I would call alternative III for 1995, which would mean raising M2, and alternative II for 1996 In fact, there is no alternative III listed in the Bluebook Even alternative II for 1995 has an M2 range of 1 to 5 percent I think a 2 to 6 percent range would be better and that is the range associated with alternative II for 1996  I remember well our embarrassment when M2 growth fell below the range I am a little concerned that we will have a similar embarrassment when M2 growth ends up above the range and folks who might want a tighter monetary policy will use that as evidence against us But, again, you are the man who has to be up there, and so in the end I will support whatever recommendation you make  You can do what I did  I gave him alternative C  Thank you, Mr Chairman Going back to February 1994 when we began the process of raising rates, I remind the Committee that at that time the unemployment rate was still above the natural rate and inflation was still coming down We made the very wise and prudent decision to take a forward-looking stance on monetary policy and not react to current conditions I am glad we did I think it was the right thing to do, and I would suggest that we do the same thing today When we look down the road 6 to 12 months, we are looking at the first half of 1996 when our action will have its impact Therefore, I agree with the point that was just made that we  -63-    7/5-6/95  cannot think of ourselves as reacting to the current slowdown because there is nothing we can do about the current slowdown What we can do is affect what we think is going to be the economy in early 1996 In that regard, I think we are fortunate that we have had the slowdown in the second quarter of 1995 Had we had the slowdown in the fourth quarter of 1995 or the first quarter of 1996 when some other factors that I foresee are going to come into play, we would be in the proverbial soup  I think the Greenbook, although I am glad to see they have made an assumption of fiscal policy contraction, understates the actual amount What they did was to average the President's proposal and the Congressional proposal when, in fact, these proposals start from different baselines The Medicare saving that the President proposed is from a rate of growth in Medicare spending that is the same as the Senate's, and on the appropriations side that is not where the differences really are I think we may see something a lot closer to $40 billion followed by another $40 billion rather than the numbers in the Greenbook In addition, in the first half of next year, we have to add to that the potential of three other downside risks In the order of their likelihood I would call them Japan, Canada, and Europe None of us can really bet on the state of the Japanese economy The chances of something significant happening there are probably less than 50/50, but they are high enough when we add that to the probability of continued sluggishness in Canada and/or less expansion than the Greenbook forecast for Europe; the latter seems high to me given that they have to have both a fiscal and a monetary contraction to meet the Maastrich criteria It all adds up to a slow first half of 1996  I agree, therefore, with Governor Blinder that ultimately we are going to need more than a 50 basis point reduction If I were betting I would say that a year from now we will be 100 basis points under where we are now, and we still may be chasing where we want to be However, Mr Chairman, I agree with your point on tactical grounds I think that 25 basis points is the right move to make today largely because of those foreign exchange rate considerations I would be very nervous, given the current state of the yen, about making a move that was considered bold and aggressive and might send the yen up, with all kinds of perverse implications for our bond market and for the Japanese economy And so, I support your recommendation  I hate to raise the "slightly" versus "somewhat" issue, but if we are moving only 25 basis points, then we should make it "slightly"  What time does this announcement come out?   It's recorded  Mr Chairman, I want to take up Governor Blinder's question and Dave Stockton's answer regarding the risks in fiscal policy This should not surprise you at all because fiscal policy is what I have talked about all year I would like to start off with two observations The first has to do with the level of deficit reduction we are talking about Now, there are a lot of ways of looking at budgets, and the word baseline has a lot of meanings I like to think of baseline as being what we would be spending if we adjusted for inflation and demographic changes without changing the law That number is $20 billion higher than the baseline that the staff is using So, when the Greenbook refers to a $30 billion deficit reduction from the baseline, we are really talking about a $50 billion reduction from what I think of as a current services baseline When we talk about the House and Senate budget resolutions, which have a $50 billion budget deficit reduction, we are really talking about a $70 billion reduction These are numbers that we have to keep in mind because we are talking about more "real" money than we might think, to use Senator Dirksen's phrase Second, when we look back at this, I think we are going to be happy that the second-quarter pause happened in the second quarter and not in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 1996 because I think the fiscal contraction we are going to have coupled with random events such as an inventory correction, if those happen coincidentally, would lead to much worse problems than we thought I agree with Dave Stockton that we don't have any particular expertise on the fiscal side I don't think anyone has any real insight into how this process is going to work out But I decided to be cynical about it I decided that our elected representatives may have something on their minds other than purely the national interest So I talked to pollsters and political advisers of both parties, actually most of them are independent I asked them for some poll numbers so that you could see exactly what they are seeing and you can make your judgments accordingly  The first thing you hear when talking to anyone is the importance of Perot voters One only had to watch the parade to Dallas to understand how important they are So, I am going to focus on Perot voters They have been called the radical center--I don't know if that's the right phrase Demographically, they are more middle class than most voters 37 percent of them had incomes in the $40,000 to $80,000 range versus 28 percent for all voters They are also less religious than other voters; 47 percent admitted not going to church at least monthly versus 38 percent of all other voters, and the percent of voters that go weekly was well below that for the general public Those are important characteristics to keep in mind They are also decidedly more anti-government than Republican voters, and this is where it becomes interesting When asked if the federal government has too much power, Democrats thought yes, 63 to 24;    8/22/95  Republicans said yes, 79 to 17; Perot voters replied yes, 88 to 9 A pre Ruby Ridge question was Would you actively resist the government if you thought it was threatening your rights? "Actively resist" is a pretty strong phrase Perot voters said yes, 57 to 34 Do you think the government is your partner or your opponent in your pursuit of the American dream? Perot voters said it was their opponent, 71 to 23 Does government hurt or help people like you? Democrats split about evenly Republicans said "hurt," 50 to 36, and Perot voters said "hurt," 51 to 24 How about the welfare state? There were two choices government is there to take care of people who can't take care of themselves; or groups like the Salvation Army and/or the United Way would do a better job Democrats like the government, 48 to 39; Republicans like the private sector, 61 to 25; Perot voters like the private sector, 67 to 18 Do we even need the federal government to provide a social safety net? Democrats said yes, 53 to 33; Republicans said no, 60 to 36; Perot voters said no, 68 to 24  In all these questions, the Perot voters are to the right of the Republican voters They are even more so in the case of regulations Do regulations cause significant job losses? Perot voters agreed, 71 to 24, more than the Republicans Does it increase the cost of things we buy? The Perot voters said yes, 83 to 12, more than among the Republicans And this is something that maybe the Fed should keep in mind How much trust do you have in regulators to act in the interest of most Americans? The split was a great deal or a fair amount versus not very much or none Among Perot voters the largest category was none, and they were negative, 54 to 16 On the key spending issue of Medicare, the choice was Would you want to tinker--to which most people said yes--leave it alone, or completely redesign The public in general split 21/20 on leaving alone versus completely redesigning Perot voters were for completely redesigning, 30 to 14 When given the choice of reforming Medicare to control costs or using money allocated for tax cuts for the rich to maintain the current Medicare system, they split 3 to 1 in favor of reform over using tax cuts for the rich Those are the numbers that the Republicans in Congress in particular are focusing on since these voters are the ones that gave them the majority Perot voters in 1992 split evenly among the parties; they went 2 to 1 for the Republicans in the last election  The first conclusion of the pollsters and analysts is that the Republicans think they have to deliver on budget cuts to keep these voters The second is that the decline in the Republican numbers since January is more a result of the budget-cutting process slowing down than their doing the wrong thing Independents, for example, were asked whether Congress was stalling or going too fast They said stalling, by 43 to 30 Third, GOP freshmen are by far the most Perot-like Secretary Rubin spoke to the freshman class to try to talk them out of not approving the debt ceiling He came away shocked; that was the word I was given There are now 160 members of the House of Representatives who have signed their names to something that says they will not raise the debt ceiling unless there is a balanced budget resolution with it People in both parties gave me a flat prediction that a debt ceiling bill will not pass the House of Representatives unless there is also a balanced budget resolution to go with it Fourth, specific bureaucratic cuts are not going to be reduced They are, as the numbers suggested, even more popular among Perot voters than among Republican voters Finally, shutting down the  -22-    8/22/95  government is perceived as posing very little risk You might get a sense of that by looking at the vote on the bill to limit the authority to use the Exchange Stabilization Fund that the House passed by over 100 votes  The Democrats' constituency is best served by saying that there is no problem, and that is in fact the case Remember, the Democrats we are talking about are the survivors and they don't need to go after the Perot voters Gephardt says that there is no problem, for example, on Medicare and he is in fact angry that the President said there was When you look at the Democratic voters, you get a sense that they really have to hold their base if they are going to be re-elected For example, 47 percent of the attendees of the last Democratic national convention were government employees The largest group of those were teachers As a result there is an incentive not to cooperate in the process, which is going to be important both at the beginning and at the end  What we should expect in September, I was told by the pundits, is a series of filibusters in the Senate over the appropriations bills If the Senate cannot act and we don't have appropriations bills, the President can blame the Congress, and that is the opening for him I was told that one of the reasons for Bradley's defection was that he became so fed up with this mess What Clinton is hoping to do is not so much get the Perot voters as to have them not like the Republicans The way to do that is to have Congress not produce the appropriations bills, and that is the strategy The path of least resistance, according to the party leaders I talk to, is to have something like the GOP level of budget cuts because they are not going to get anything else through the House But to achieve presidential victories on issues such as abortion, where we already have seen some, especially if Medicare cuts are incorporated into the process, the President may have to compromise with the Republicans and get the Democrats in the Congress to go along They would not The final result may be that a bill will have a lot of difficulty passing because there is no bipartisan support for a compromise The final caution in all this is that if a reconcilation bill is vetoed, all the deals that were cut in getting the appropriations process are nullified You have to start the process all over again A veto of the reconciliation bill probably means that it is going to take weeks and weeks and weeks and not a matter of hours or days to get a second deal through All that makes me very depressed, but it seems to me that we are probably going to get much larger deficit reductions in the form of spending cuts than the Greenbook is calling for, and I think that should be a factor in our thinking  Suppose your objective was to maintain nominal GDP in calendar 1996, and suppose on November 7th we got protracted, torturous messes on Capitol Hill and in the bond market Suppose we got a contraction of government spending somewhere around 3/4 percent of GDP, and again it was messy in the bond market Which would be more effective as far as influencing nominal GDP in 1996 to have a  -30-    8/22/95  sharp cut in the fed funds rate at that time or to have gradual reductions leading up to it?  The issue is resolved on that date  If you knew now that this was going to happen and the objective was the same Maybe, Governor Blinder, you can help me out in phrasing my question You are right; I don't think Don answered my question  No, I'd rather he grade the papers If that was what was going to happen, would it be more useful to wait until the event and have a sharp reduction on that day or to have a reduction sooner than the event?  Right  I support your policy proposal   There seems to be a lot of movement into Swiss francs, particularly by the Germans Is there a general search in Europe for--I hate to use the words--a "safe haven," or what is it?  Are they actually going to their local Deutschebank to buy Swiss franc money market funds or whatever it might be?  How long have they been reducing their rates?    9/26/95  I can't top that! On the fiscal situation, the Greenbook now assumes that the Congress ultimately will pass 85 percent of the reductions called for in the Congressional budget resolution Believe it or not, I think that assumption is still a little too low I think it will be more like 95 percent, but at least we are getting closer and at this point I see no reason to quibble The net effect of that is a negative fiscal impulse for 1996 of 3/4 percent of GDP I want to talk about what that means for the forecast in just a second, but there were two comments related to the fiscal situation that I would like to return to I forget--what town in Ohio?  Wooster Well, I didn't hear it right  The question I would pose is what would I hear if I were to go to Wooster, Ohio just after Thanksgiving Everyone has come to grandma's house and a cousin, who unlike all other federal  -27-    9/26/95  workers is a good worker, [Laughter] has been laid off and tells his tale at the Thanksgiving table I think there would be a perceptible view that federal spending will indeed slow down and that if even this hard working person with the safest employer has lost his job, whose job is safe? So, I do think that in spite of what people believe, and as you know I am hardly an advocate of big government, the transitional effects of moving people from the public sector to the private sector are real I think the people in Wooster will know it after Thanksgiving  With regard to the role of monetary policy, I completely concur with the view expressed by some that what we should look at is not fiscal policy per se but its effect on aggregate demand On that point I would note that the Greenbook has projected nominal GNP growth of 44 percent in 1996 and 39 percent in 1997 Two years ago I didn't think we would see 3-point-something percent during my term as a governor despite our pursuit of price stability unless we had a major recession Frankly, 39 percent is below what I would think of as an appropriate target for nominal GDP So, I don't disagree with your theory I would say 39 percent means that we are at price stability in effect That would be, say, a 2-1/2 percent trend rate of growth and 14 percent inflation That sounds like a definition of price stability to me So, we are there  Returning to the question about the fiscal impulse, if we did have a negative 3/4 percent fiscal impulse, it would mean that to get 2-1/4 percent growth next year the rest of the economy should have a trend growth rate of 3 percent in it That does not seem plausible to me, particularly when we are at 56 percent unemployment already There is another alternative, and that is that we have had a completely painless and seamless transition from fiscal contraction to private sector expansion; but I don't think that comports with reality So, let's go back to the possibility of 3 percent growth of the private economy as the underlying assumption here If we look at what has happened to the incomes and wages of people, the reason that we are not seeing inflation accompanying the low unemployment rate is that structural changes have occurred in the labor market They are manifest in the fact that the wage share of personal income has declined dramatically In 1989 at the last business cycle peak that share was 59 percent; in July it was 57 percent At the margin in the last 12 months, wages have accounted for only 50 percent of increased personal income It is not hard to understand how we can get both lack of inflation and an improvement in the unemployment rate when in fact wages are being suppressed The problem is that we cannot have wages that continue to be depressed and have a 3 percent expansion of the real private economy; it just does not add up One of two things can happen In one, workers get restless, wages go up, the profit share falls, and there is upward pressure on inflation That is scenario "one" that Mike described Or we get scenario "two," where the demand is not there, we do not in fact have 3 percent expansion ex-government in the economy, and we get slower growth than the Greenbook is forecasting My own bet is that the second result is more likely than the first Certainly, when we are talking about 44 percent nominal GDP growth going down to 39 percent nominal GDP growth, I hesitate to think what the trend is going to lead to Clearly, we have a real federal funds rate that is too high I guess I couldn't camouflage myself as a termite, but I end up tearing down  -28-    9/26/95  the house just like the termites do in Governor Yellen's story Thank you  But they are held harmless from change  Mr Chairman, I think we adopted a strategy earlier this year to wait and see how things play out I may have preferred a different strategy, but I think that one we adopted is reasonable Having selected this strategy, our tactics should be consistent with it, and in my view what you propose is consistent I think we are going to have to rethink the overall strategy, though--if not at the November 15th meeting then in December as we learn more about the economy So, I support your proposal for now  Everyone here dislikes Humphrey-Hawkins--good riddance--and we basically like long-term price stability What we also don't like is having legislation defining what we should do Frankly, I think the crux of the issue comes back to that We could wish that the Congress of the United States, which created this institution, would stay away and not give us instructions That's not going to happen Given that's not going to happen, we are going to get legislation telling us what to do What is that legislation going to say? At worst it produces some horror like Humphrey-Hawkins; at best it produces something like the bill we have before us It is not ideal  The key here is that we get to define and redefine what is meant by price stability For example, one issue is the time period over which we are measuring prices Questions have been raised about supply shocks, and I agree that is a concern Do we mean that the CPI has to be reported at 00 every month? Certainly not Or even 00 in a year? Certainly not The goal is long-term price stability The other issue is what price measure do we use Here I am going to go back to the misfortune that a good Virginia boy like me had in the First District We had something called the Massachusetts miracle Now, I bet that the CPI for Massachusetts, if we had such a thing, was not much different from the national CPI and was pretty stable But everyone knew the New England economy wasn't stable; we had a bubble going on In retrospect, that's obvious I don't know why our definition of price stability in the report would not include sectoral monitoring If we observe bubbles occurring in the economy we know that they are destabilizing, no matter what the price level might be, and ultimately inconsistent with long-term price stability I really don't see how our hands are being tied If we are allowed to define and redefine what we mean by price stability, what measure we are looking at, and over what time horizon we are focusing--and given that Congress will not go away--I think we have gotten the best deal that we can get  I think that may be spelled out in the report language A bill has to be short and understandable  I don't think clarifying it in the legislation is the way to go The ambiguity is best left to the report language   I just want to get something clear Do any of these reciprocal arrangements with other central banks potentially involve warehousing funds for the Treasury, should the Treasury want to engage in foreign exchange transactions?  They are separate  I am going to follow up on what Governor Blinder said If you are taking whatever is offered on the open market, might there not be a propensity for you to buy securities in default or potential default that people might have questions about? If you are willing to take whatever is offered and you are not willing to discriminate against defaulted securities, won't you end up taking a disproportionate number of them?  Actually I have two questions about this path, particularly of household durables spending The fourth quarter of 1995 number seems high Is that a growth rate of 113 percent? Is that a misprint?  Is it basically a Christmas phenomenon and then it falls off next year?  Second part of the question You've got PCE growing fast  I have been trying to eyeball it Is PCE generally growing a little more quickly than income?  Then why does the forecast go off the cliff in the third quarter of 1997?  But you have consumption down and, in particular, durable purchases are down in the third quarter of 1997  I see  Mike, I was interested in your comment that the current situation reminded you most of developments in the late 1980s I wasn't here then What I remember about 1988-89 is the cover of Business Week that asked "Have we repealed the business cycle?" If I were to put a cover on this Greenbook, I too would say "Have we repealed the business cycle?" At the least, your forecast puts off any perceptible slowing for another six quarters--until mid-1997 I'm  -30-    11/15/95  suspicious of that I hope I'm wrong, but I have a number of quibbles, particularly on the international side, and one major concern that has to do with the consumer debt situation We continue to have a robust forecast and robust debt growth The Greenbook rightly notes that consumer debt levels have moved up In the last 2-1/2 years, consumer debt as a percent of disposable personal income has risen 2-1/2 percentage points from about 16 percent to about 18-1/2 percent One way of looking at that is that 40 percent of growth in PCE in the last 2-1/2 years has been financed by higher non- housing consumer debt The reason I am more concerned about that than the Greenbook and the reason that we are going to have some problems is two-fold first, I think that the quality of income that consumers are receiving makes that debt level worse than what it is perceived to be; and, second, there is the view that the stock market can be a panacea for the deterioration on the liability side I don't believe that is accurate  Let me start with the income situation Although personal income has been rising at a respectable rate, not all personal income flows through to spendable income for the consumer Although that is true for wages, that is not true for substantial portions of interest and dividends One check on that is simply to look at income tax data Now, if you receive more than ten dollars a year in either interest or dividend payments, that income is reported to the IRS So, it is not a question of evasion; any received interest or dividend income by a taxable entity is going to show up in the income tax data Yet, only 30 percent of personal interest income is reported on income tax returns That includes nontaxed interest The same thing is true for 50 percent of dividends and 65 percent of business income If you define spendable income, you can either include transfers or not include transfers The numbers I have don't include transfers, but that doesn't change the story What you get is a picture of the income situation that suggests there is a lot less spendable income out there than what we have perceived By itself that is not a disturbing fact What is disturbing is that over time the relationship between spendable income and disposable personal income has been deteriorating For example, spendable income in 1988, as I just defined it adjusting for what actually flows through to household checking accounts, amounted to about 61 percent of disposable personal income In 1995, that fell to 574 percent So we have had roughly a 6 percent decline in the base, what I would call the denominator, which we should be using to measure debt service burdens That means that the 18-1/2 percent that we scored in the second quarter of this year has a ratio of debt to disposable personal income that, after adjusting for the deterioration in the composition of income, would really be a number like 197 percent That would be a record high substantially above anything that we have seen Obviously, with the average of spendable income to disposable personal income falling, it is even worse at the margin, and the last year has been the worst year to date  The second issue is whether the very substantial stock market gains could in fact offset this deterioration on the household liability side It is an obvious statement to say that people who own stocks are the same people with credit card debt But if you take a careful look at the distribution of stock market wealth, it becomes increasingly implausible to believe that a rise in stock market wealth could actually be the cause of any kind of sustained expansion in  -31-    11/15/95  consumer spending For example, 31 percent of dividends go to the 8 percent of households at the top of the income distribution and half of all dividends go to people over 65 Actually, among the non rich, substantially more than half of all dividends go to people over 65 I don't know if we have any detailed studies of the marginal propensity to consume, but if you are counting on stock market wealth, which I'm using dividends to apportion, dividends would be a rough signal that a lot of that increase in stock market wealth is--I'm going to use the word--"wasted" on people who are unlikely to spend a large portion of it and certainly unlikely to be the people who are running up this consumer debt To try and probe that a little further, if in fact stock market wealth is going to be the leading cause of consumption expansion, we would expect it to permeate down at least into the $75,000 to $100,000 income class There are about 4 million house- holds in this income range; there are about 4 million households that are richer than that We are talking here about the 92nd to 96th percentiles of household income If we are expecting a wealth-led increase in consumption, they clearly should benefit Yet half of all households in this income class receive no dividends at all, suggesting that they have no stock market wealth And 71 percent of households in this category under age 65 receive no dividends at all, suggesting that they have no stock market wealth Of the remaining 29 percent in this category--about 1 million households that received dividends--the average dividend is about $3,000 The median dividend is about $600 If you figure that there was a 401 price to dividend ratio, that would mean that even among the 30 percent of this relatively wealthy class that got dividends and owned stock, their portfolio is only about $25,000 The gain in their portfolio was on the order of $6,000 To expect that small a group and that small a gain to somehow sustain consumption spending seems implausible to me So, I have to believe that the problems that we all acknowledge on the liability side of the household balance sheet are real and can't be offset by improvements on the asset side of the household balance sheet I think this is going to show up, for example, in continuing declines in auto sales I don't know that we are going to have a recession, but I do know that this type of increased risk in household balance sheets will mean that whenever there is a misstep--a shock if you will--in some other portion of the economy, it is going to spill over into the consumer sector with magnified effects I think that means we have substantially heightened risks on the down side That is my quarrel with the Greenbook  I would like to say one other thing about the economy and that has to do with the current budget negotiations We have 800,000 federal employees who are furloughed and close to 1-1/2 million who are not receiving paychecks Now, that is a lot on the spending side If these people are actually liquidity constrained, it is in effect a sudden 1-1/2 percent rise in the unemployment rate, which would amend forecasts about what is going to happen to consumer spending, particularly in the fourth quarter Staff has estimated that each week that we continue to have an impasse takes 3 point off the fourth-quarter growth rate Well, it looks as if we have one week for sure according to this morning's papers and, as I read the rhetoric, I don't see where this is going to end any time soon As we start adding up the weeks people are not getting paychecks, we begin to get a little nervous about how this might spill over Secondly, if it is resolved, the direction in which it most likely will be resolved would be a compromise on the Medicare side I think that would be    11/15/95  unfortunate and I believe the bond markets particularly would view it as unfortunate It would mean that we would get the short-run cuts on the discretionary side, that is, the layoffs in the government sector But it also would signal to the bond markets that we are not going to be getting our arms around government consumption over the long haul The effect of that would be that yields on intermediate- and long-term securities would tend to rise The big rally in securities markets has not come from proposed cuts in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts but from proposed cuts in Medicare and long-term government consumption on the order of a trillion dollars So, I am afraid that the kind of compromise that we most likely are headed for will give us the worst of both worlds--short-run contraction in 1996 due to layoffs plus a run-up in intermediate- and long-term rates that will adversely affect the auto industry and housing starts I am substantially more pessimistic than I was, and I am much more pessimistic than the Greenbook  Thank you, Mr Chairman On the Taylor rule, I think that even if we were to take it at face value, it implies downward pressure on inflation It has an implied inflation target of 2 percent Current monetary policy appears to be tight on that rule, but even if it were on the money it would be putting downward pressure on inflation So, on the basis of the Taylor rule, current monetary policy is tighter than simply putting downward pressure on inflation My second thought is on the yield curve Governor Blinder mentioned the four reasons why we had a bond market rally One is not only a decline in inflation, but the perception that inflation will continue to drop I suppose Jerry would agree that either the staff is right or the bond market is right The bond market also sees an increased chance of federal deficit reduction It sees a weakening expansion And here I suppose the length of the tooth becomes important Although there are not the excesses in the economy that suggest extreme risks to the expansion, what happens as the tooth lengthens-- is that the way to say it? Help me out  It lengthens! My teeth are going the other way! [Laughter] Well, as the tooth lengthens, increased risks begin to appear and we may already have detected some I think the consumer is one of those risks The international picture is another, be it instability in Japan and Europe, which I don't see as growing, or in Mexico The risk of a fiscal misstep is still another that could tip the economy over So, I see the yield curve as signalling that in fact we should be reducing rates today I also want to associate myself with Governor Blinder in the "let's not get caught flatfooted" waiting for the Congress and the President to act It is conceivable  -50-    11/15/95  that they will not produce a fiscal agreement for fiscal 1996 The government could be operating on a continuing resolution forever So, we certainly don't want to wait that long  Less than forever is better, yes I think today actually would be a very opportune time to move for exactly that reason The public disenchantment with the budget process is high and going to get higher That in itself is a shock But I think the Fed would be sending a very appropriate signal that we are above the process in all meanings of the word "above" So I would support a reduction in the funds rate today   Peter, would you refresh my memory as to why we increased the Mexican swap line from $1-1/2 to $3 billion last February 1?  But we are now getting out of the second program?  So, why are we not taking our level of commitment back down to $1-1/2 billion?    12/19/95  Second  Thank you, Mr Chairman I wanted to focus on one of the points that Mike Prell made, and that is how we could interpret the likely consumption response to the rise in asset values He was kind enough to share the regressions with me The general story is that the marginal propensity to consume from an incremental stock market gain is about 5 percent The macroeconomic regressions very much support that What I would like to do today is to test that at the micro level I asked the National Bureau of Economic Research to run the 1991 individual tax model file, which is the latest one they have up, to look at a detailed distribution of dividends received by taxpayers I would be happy to give the detailed tables to anyone who wants them I broke this down into five classes  Look at Table 1, which has been distributed to you, and you can get a feel for this The first row is zero dividends; 80 percent of taxpayers, which I call households and the terms are roughly synonymous, received no dividends at all Another 13 percent of households received less than $1,000 in dividends, and these dividends made up about 44 percent of the total As you can see, about 6 percent of households got about 30 percent of total dividends At the very top, I broke down those people who received over $10,000 of dividends into those with less than $200,000 of adjusted gross income and those with more than $200,000 of adjusted gross income Group 5, the high-income, high-dividend recipients make up about 230,000 households and got 30 percent of total dividends The next thing I asked the NBER to do was to calculate after-tax adjusted gross income They have a federal tax calculator, a state tax calculator, and a social security tax calculator Column 3 in Table 1 shows the distribution of after-tax adjusted gross income for each of those groups The last column is designed to get at disposable personal income in the national income and product accounts The main ingredients that are not in AGI but are in disposable personal income are first, transfer payments, second, fringe benefits, and third, the excluded portions of dividends and interest, which generally tend to flow into 401(k) plans and other constrained vehicles  No Personal taxes and direct taxes are out of both columns three and four  That's true, but I computed "after tax" adjusted gross income I started with AGI and and took out federal, state, and employee FICA taxes  -9-    12/19/95  As you can see, it doesn't make that much difference, but I allocated that portion of disposable personal income that was not in AGI in proportion to wages and that gives me the last column Then comes the thought experiment Let's assume that we get a $50 billion increment to consumption, which is about 1 percent of personal outlays That would correspond to a 5 percent marginal propensity to consume out of a trillion dollar rise in the markets, which is about the order of magnitude we are talking about If you assume that the distribution of dividends is a rough proxy for the distribution of stock market wealth, then we can calculate for each group how much its total consumption would be expected to change Of course, if you don't have any stocks, tough luck If you are in group two, which includes people with less than $1,000 in dividends, then on average we would expect your household consumption to go up by $154 Maybe this can be picked up in the statistics and maybe it can't It amounts to about 025 percent of disposable personal income for people in group two Now you get to the interesting people, people in group three, which I suppose does not include me since I am in the zero category and I can't even borrow at Toys 'R Us! [Laughter] It does include my mother with her AT&T stock There are a lot of households in that group They might be expected to increase their consumption by $2,000 per household or about 3 percent of income Now we get to the people who have dividends and therefore the capital gains Again, just doing the straight apportionment, for those households making less than $200,000 but having at least $10,000 in dividends, we would expect an average increase in consumption out of stock market wealth of $14,000 It is conceivable to me that I could spend an extra $14,000 a year, but it isn't conceivable that these households would do so, given their relatively low level of disposable personal income Remember, they are making less than $200,000, and if this is right, we would expect them to increase their consumption by almost one-fourth in order to account for that extra spending out of wealth In category five, where everyone's income is over $200,000 and the average income is substantially higher at about $800,000, each household would have to spend an extra $65,000 They could buy two Cadillacs they otherwise would not have bought, and that would mean a 77 percent increase in their consumption out of disposable personal income  The lesson that I draw from this is that, given the very narrow distribution of dividends, it would seem that the increments to wealth are relatively concentrated Even combining those two categories, I find a 12 percent increase in spending out of stock market wealth by well-to-do individuals implausible Therefore, I don't see how the microeconomic data support the macroeconomic estimate of $50 billion in extra consumption as a result of the rise in stock market wealth There are other channels that could allow it to happen I could, for example, feel happier and more secure in my job because the stock market is booming and go out and spend There must be channels through which it operates, but I am not going to go on any longer I have other tables to show how liquidity-constrained households are They suggest that it would be very hard for that kind of transmission mechanism to account for a lot, particularly when saving rates are already as low as they are  -10-    12/19/95  So, Mike, I have to disagree with you I don't see the upside potential I think we are unlikely to get an extra $50 billion in consumption out of the stock market increase  I think that is a very fair observation and I would be happy to use that to supplement my interpretation of the regression The regression had labor income, capital income, transfer income, and wealth in it So, I would expect that that would appear in that transition The extra capital spending might feed through into higher disposable income I think that would show up in the income numbers and not in the wealth numbers  As I read it, the income was in the regression  They are in there as well as the stock market  So, the consumption levels in the forecast do not reflect those from the MPS model?  -11-    12/19/95  Don, I am a little surprised that you recommend responding to a supply shock or a demand shock in the same way in your  -32-    12/19/95  matrix I would have expected different signs The easiest way for me to think about it is to suppose the reverse happens if you have a negative supply shock, say an oil embargo, versus a positive demand shock If you had a positive demand shock, I think the right prescription would be to raise nominal real rates because you would want to offset the demand If you had an oil embargo, I would not recommend raising nominal and real rates In other words, I think there is a difference  I will talk to you another time  Thank you, Mr Chairman Having dissented in favor of ease last time, I am reminded of Governor Blinder's basketball coach I certainly support your recommendation I also support your view that there should be no mention of fiscal policy in our statement, but I do think that in fact there will be some linkage made and in this case an unfortunate one We would have been much better off to have moved in November Also, I don't think we should pretend that we in fact ignore fiscal policy in our actions To do so would be silly The government is one-third of the economy For us to ignore the actions of one-third of the economy, well, we don't do that If there were a 10 percent cut in government spending or a 10  -43-    12/19/95  percent tax increase, would any of us say that we should hold the nominal fed funds rate the same? That is just preposterous I don't think that was what is implied; we certainly pay attention to fiscal policy I would give those two cases as examples of demand shocks where we clearly should respond There is also a question about government causing a supply shock For example, if the government were to raise the minimum wage to $10 an hour, that would be an adverse supply shock If I followed Don's outline, trying to be symmetric in following your logic, we would respond to that with a cut in interest rates It's an adverse supply shock  A rise in interest rates, yes So, we should make ourselves even more miserable! I think this sort of analysis tends to break down, and that's why I have problems with the difference between a demand shock and a supply shock Basically, when it comes to government actions on the supply side, I really don't think that we should get in the way I think that's particularly applicable to what I am afraid may be the response next year to our action today There was a major bond market rally this year in large part because of an expectation that the out-year federal deficits were going to be reduced substantially If those reductions do not come to pass, and according to reports yesterday's stock and bond market corrections were in large part linked to the first realization on Wall Street that such reductions may not materialize, we may have a backup in intermediate and long rates If that were to happen, I would view that as an adverse supply shock Government is doing something stupid and the markets know it Therefore, there is less confidence reflected in the price at which the markets are willing to lend to the government If that were to occur, I don't think there is a lot we could do to undo it So, I will look forward between this meeting and the next meeting to see what happens on the intermediate- and long- term portions of the yield curve If in fact we get a backup, I think it is going to be very difficult to make any further easing moves Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the Bluebook, starting with the table on page 11 [Statement--see Appendix] LINDSEY I don't think the market's view is very different from that of the Board staff regarding the reliability of forecasts of velocity Market participants have not been focusing on the monetary aggregates They essentially have accepted the FOMC's analysis that in the 1990s there has been a heightened degree of uncertainty regarding velocity behavior So, I don't think they would change their view of whether velocity was predictable or not if the Committee were to raise the ranges The wording of the Committee's report and the Chairman's testimony surrounding this decision could attempt to disabuse them of the notion that we felt there was any greater reliability to velocity forecasts than previously Judging at least from the experience to date for which they have accepted our analysis, we might have a chance of persuading them LINDSEY It turns out that in 1990, when the process of very slow growth of the broader aggregates began and M2 velocity started on its upward march, we were a bit slow in catching up But subsequently, despite the uncertainty, we were not too inaccurate I vividly remember briefing this Committee in May 1993 with a projection of 1-1/4 percent for M2 growth through that year Perhaps luckily, M2 ended up growing that year at 1-1/4 percent I also know that last year we were quite-- LINDSEY The transcript of this will be out in five years and I will be vindicated! [Laughter] LINDSEY That's right We are revising M2 and that alters the comparison For 1995, M2 growth and nominal GDP growth came in almost exactly where we predicted six months ago when the Committee last visited this issue, and that involved a judgmental -30- 1/30-31/96 adjustment on our part to a model forecast that was predicting much slower M2 growth, a forecast that we essentially did not believe This year we are closer to the model forecast in predicting M2 growth of 5-1/4 percent, but we have been influenced a bit by the slope of the yield curve In a way, our judgmental forecasts have been better than one might have expected, but I wouldn't say that that would necessarily argue for upgrading the role of money as an intermediate target, or even as an information variable LINDSEY I wouldn't deny that there is a significant range of uncertainty around our forecast even if the Greenbook gets the pattern of the macroeconomy more or less correct I wouldn't want to assert that there is not a pretty big range of uncertainty that the Committee ought to take into account But, as we tried to argue in the Bluebook, it seemed to us that any of the alternative ranges could be justified and a reasonable case constructed even on the assumption that the aggregates were not being upgraded  Thank you, Mr Chairman I wanted to talk about Cathy Minehan's perception of why people feel so grumpy and to do so in the context of the staff's Chart Show presentation Larry Slifman very generously provided charts 11 and 12 a little early today, so I had a chance to look at them and at some of the data behind them I am more pessimistic than the staff about the state of the household sector My first observation is that, although the    1/30-31/96  distribution of assets and debt--particularly the distribution of assets--does not look like an issue of rich or poor, I don't think the issue of rich or poor is the right way to look at it If we look within each income class, we get a very different picture of the distribution of assets Within each class, asset holdings are highly skewed I have thrown out the very poor and the very rich income classes because there are problems in interpreting both of those If we look, for example, at the $20,000 to $30,000 income class and the distribution of interest income within that class, the top 47 percent got 60 percent and the top 13 percent got 79 percent of the interest income received by that class So, it does not matter that, broadly speaking, the $20,000 to $30,000 class has some assets Of course they do, but those assets are concentrated in a handful of people within that income group The same thing is true further up the income scale In the $50,000 to $100,000 income class, the top 84 percent of taxpayers got 70 percent of the interest income received by everyone in that class Again, asset ownership is very concentrated and is sorted not by income but by other factors Age probably is one of them  If we add it all up, we get some very surprising statistics 19 million low to moderate income households with incomes under $30,000 got $29 billion of interest income That is more than 165 million households earning over $50,000 received, including some making more than a quarter of a million dollars Sorting this way does not, in my mind, overcome the fact that capital income is unequally distributed It just happens not to be unequally distributed in ways that would show up in total income  I would like to focus, in particular, on column 5 in chart 12 It shows financial assets greater than non-mortgage debt I might mention first of all that I calculated my own financial position and to my delight I actually have financial assets greater than my non-mortgage debt Perhaps I should pass that information on to the Bank of New York in Delaware! I am in the lucky half of people in my income class But the fact is that half of all people, even in the well-to-do range, have non-mortgage debt in excess of their financial assets Let us focus on the median rich person and see what has happened since 1992 In 1992, household financial assets, according to the flow of funds, totaled $165 trillion and non-mortgage debt was $12 trillion For the person with the median income those two numbers were the same, but for the household sector as a whole, financial assets were 135 times non-mortgage debt  A way to start a simple thought experiment is to say that 125/135 of financial assets do not count as far as the median well- to-do household is concerned What has happened since 1992? If we were to have no improvement in that situation and no change in the distribution of financial assets or debt, household financial assets would need to have risen by some $43 trillion by my calculations to offset the reported increase in non-mortgage debt In fact, the increase has been only about 3/4 of that amount So, again, just taking the numbers in the table and assuming no changes in distribution, we have had a worsening of column 5 since 1992 In other words far more than half of upper income households, not to mention lower income households, do not now have financial assets that exceed their debt I think even that result may be optimistic The reason for that has to do with the Census Bureau report on what has  -11-    1/30-31/96  happened to income since 1992 In the aggregate, income has done quite well We have had roughly a 5 percent increase in household real income, but 77 percent of all the income gains went to the top 5 percent of households; 21 percent went to the next 15 percent The remaining 80 percent of households shared only 2 percent of all the income gains over the last two years for which we have these data, 1993 and 1994 I would suggest that a lot of these people probably have had their debts worsen relative to their financial assets  The last point I would make, and it relates to the top of chart 12, is that starting in the third quarter of 1994 through the third quarter of 1995, households have actually been net sellers of stock according to the flow of funds data This is not counting capital gains The reason why that might be troubling is that, in a booming stock market, they must be liquidating some of their holdings to pay off something I would suggest, however, that households are in fact consuming some of their capital gains in order to cover short- falls between their income and their consumption So, there is reason to be pessimistic, not in the overall numbers but in looking more closely at the majority of households that have not been enjoying income gains and are trying to maintain levels of consumption Thank you  In his briefing, Dave Lindsey indicated that the M2 range in Alternative I would be the target range that we would have once we reached price stability, assuming that M2 velocity returned to its traditional trend We don't have either of those conditions At least we can't be sure about velocity, and we certainly have not reached price stability None of us to my knowledge put down zero as our estimate for the GDP deflator or more precisely that real GDP growth and nominal GDP growth are the same in any of our forecasts In fact, I doubt very much whether any of us put down less than 2 percent for our expectation of GDP deflator growth Given that and given that we are not being asked to provide guidelines for what we would like the M2 range to be in some future time when we reach price stability--clearly that won't happen this year or in 1997--I think the only honest thing to do is to have something like the Alternative II range for M2 At least the staff projection indicates that M2 growth is going to be within that range For the Committee to say that our range does not encompass expected M2 growth either says that we don't control the aggregates or that the range is not consistent with our policy So, I think the only honest presentation is Alternative II I could vote for Alternative III, but  -35-    1/30-31/96  I don't think that alternative is going to be favored by a large number of people  Trapezoids  I want to follow up on something else that Jerry Jordan said, which I thought was very good His example referred to an announcement of an increase in the inflation rate to 5 percent In fact, I think we went through this exercise about a year ago The staff model did not have an announcement of an increase in the inflation rate, but it indicated that increased inflation itself would raise real GDP In fact, higher inflation in the model raises the present value of future GDP I don't agree with that conclusion, but I have to believe that if we were to announce higher inflation, the increase in GDP would be less than it would be if we slipped higher inflation in there That has to be true So, why wouldn't we believe the reverse? Why wouldn't we believe that if inflation were to go down that we wouldn't have the same improvement in the trade- off?  Could it be that on the way down we are doing what we are supposed to do and on the way up we are not doing what we are supposed to do?  Don, you mentioned the fiscal package If we went from a cumulative deficit of $1 trillion to zero over seven years, how big a shock do you think that would be? How should we compare that to what you have here?  Mr Chairman, last year I was predicting that we would see a very substantial change in the stance of fiscal policy I was wrong That has been the big surprise to me since the last meeting Three weeks ago I was betting that today we would see a long bond rate on the order of 650 percent because it seemed to me that the markets also had realized that we were not going to get the fiscal action expected earlier I was very interested in Don Kohn's estimate that the magnitude of what we are talking about here would be equivalent in this language to a reduction of about 100 basis points in the equilibrium real federal funds rate So, it seemed about right for bond market rates to back up to 650 percent on a realization that the odds of some fiscal restraint agreement had been reduced from, say, 90 percent to 50 percent The market didn't react that way; the long bond rate stayed around 6 percent I think the reason for that, I forget if it was the two-step or the three-step--  -58-    1/30-31/96  Or the do-si-do I think the market perceived that near-term economic conditions were deteriorating rather dramatically It is probably true that that is happening As I have said, conditions in various sectors of the economy are much worse than we thought, and that is what the market was seeing Hence, what I would normally interpret as a reason at the very least to stop easing and perhaps even a reason to move toward tightening, ie, the breakdown of the budget negotiations, is overwhelmed by other factors The failure of bond market rates to move up 50 basis points suggests to me that even a reduction of 25 basis points in the real federal funds rate would still be less of a move than the market is calling for and therefore is consistent with the strategy that Don Kohn outlined in his memo about taking advantage of deflationary situations Cathy, you raised that in your discussion I would say that given the failure of the market to act, the funds rate is probably at least 50 basis points too high right now By splitting the difference at 25, I think we are buying a little insurance on the real side and we are at the same time taking advantage of what might be an opportunity I hate the term "opportunistic strategy," but I guess that approach is consistent with what is termed an opportunistic strategy to reduce inflation So, I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  What's the time of the release?  Why don't we do it right now?   Second  I'm glad Jerry pointed that out When you construct the forecast, do you start with the nominal GDP forecast and work back?  Right I am fairly startled at your answer That is why I am asking the question as to how the nominal falls out I would think that you would start with a monetary policy forecast that would determine a nominal GDP--Don is shaking his head, so I have it wrong Tell me exactly  But you have a full percentage point change in nominal GDP--  Well, all right, this burst of nominal GDP was the way of reconciling things that did not add up in the model    3/26/96  I think the change in the data, the closing of the government, and the snow have allowed us to forget there are still three unresolved issues in the economy The first I would call the labor market/household sector issue I think the story is that we  -20-    3/26/96  can't go on like this, but I do not know how it will change The anecdotal comments around the table universally have referred to tight labor markets That is what I hear anecdotally as well I was in Indianapolis two weeks ago and, as they phrased it there, "you can't hire people at any wage" I won't comment on their economic logic, but no one was raising wages at the time they were saying they could not hire people at any wage! We have had very low increases in nominal and real wages That is inconsistent with reported labor market conditions In addition, household spending has been growing substantially faster than wage income, and the gap has been financed by higher debt levels This situation is going to be resolved either through greater wage claims in a more militant labor market, which could be financed incidentally by foregoing any further increases in the share of profits but would require at least a stabilization in the profit share, or through curtailed spending at some point  The second unresolved issue is fiscal policy We thought we were going to begin to see it get resolved, but the fact is that we still have unsustainable entitlement policies in place The entitlements will have to be cut at some point The market has decided that that decision will probably be delayed until after November Of course, the election results in November may well serve to defer the decision still further  If that is the case, I think it will lead to what I see as a third unresolved issue, the level of prices in capital markets That level is one of the reasons why we have been enjoying an investment boom; in fact, the investment boom and rising prices in the equity markets have been feeding on one another A booming capital market has made equity capital very cheap and has allowed the double-digit rate of growth that has occurred in gross private domestic investment Focusing on the computer issue, when we have a deflator that is actually deflating, the effective hurdle rate of return needed to justify a purchase becomes quite high That's because the nominal price of the good is going down, and in addition we need a positive nominal return on the capital To justify buying a computer now, we have to add the 12 percent decline in the deflator to a 6 or 7 percent rate of return on the cost of capital, a total return of 18 or 19 percent There just are not many investments in that sector that can be justified on that basis, and at some point such investment is going to end It will end more quickly if in fact the cost of capital rises at the same time That in turn will depend on how the labor market and fiscal policy issues are resolved If we end up with greater wage claims or if we end up with a decision to defer the entitlements reform, we will see a substantial further increase in intermediate and long rates, and that will precipitate a market adjustment On the other hand, if we see curtailed spending by both the household sector and the public sector, we probably will see a decline in the share of profits and a decline in investment as a result  I think that the weather hiatus has allowed us to forget that we still have some fundamental unresolved issues The Greenbook is forecasting a sustained middle course on how the economy will resolve those issues The risks around that middle course are probably balanced at this point, but I think those risks are growing In fact, especially in the sixth and seventh year of an economic expansion, there is an increasing probability that the expansion will not be able to stay on the middle course but will fall to one side or the other  -21-    3/26/96  We really just finished breakfast!  I agree with your recommendation   Move approval  The move in oil prices in the futures market suggests that the market has changed its expectations toward higher    5/21/96  prices going quite a ways out If you just look at the inventory balances held by the majors, which are now at record lows, why do you think we are going to see a decline in oil prices?  What is the average price in your underlying assumption?  You are saying that Iraqi oil exports won't exceed 700,000 barrels per day in this period?  You mentioned that GDP on the income side was almost a full percent higher Where do you suppose the big surprise comes from?  I was thinking about the report on the Treasury balances that was mentioned earlier and why those balances are higher Back in the old days, I would have said that the reason is the realization of capital gains because that doesn't show up on the income side So you are saying that there is something else  I have not been here since the last meeting for all intents and purposes, so I don't really have anything to say about the US economy But I find this discussion very informative and useful Where I have been, I must say, makes me appreciate coming home It is very depressing to live and work in Washington because it makes one begin to think there must be something wrong with America But when I go abroad I realize that this is the way it works  -26-    5/21/96  everywhere; there is something wrong with the world So, at least I feel relatively better  For the first time in years I agree completely with Ted Truman on Japan, and I think that means, Ted, that we are both wrong! In Japan, I was very much struck by the fact that the recovery is under way They are going to have a solid recovery this year Solid growth probably will not be sustainable next year but is likely to slow somewhat Some of their larger banks have begun tackling their banking problems What was most encouraging in Japan was the end of denial I thought they were very candid about what their problems were That candor was reflected also in a question that they always asked me about our stock market I was thinking very much about what just came up in Jerry's comments about the bubble in the software industry If you watch the OTC, not the Dow, you begin to appreciate that a bubble might very well be forming On one day last week when the OTC was recovering, all of the top 10 issues were up at least 9 points There are IPOs that do not trade at 20 times earnings; they trade at 20 times sales My suggestion for such a company would be to sell, put the money in 10-year notes, and it would be better off that way This is the silly season To be sure, our stock prices are not at Japanese levels, but who knows how much longer it will take They are getting closer In Japan, it was nice to have candid questions  Bill McDonough and I were in Basle last week, and I was in France and Italy and Switzerland the week before I think there has been a decline in candor and an increase in the sense of denial It really is stunning to me how everyone who even thinks about the issue will say You are right; what we are doing is not economically sensible, but it is politically necessary If they follow that kind of policymaking long enough, I don't see how they are going to come out of it They are going to be announcing more deficit reduction measures, mostly on the spending side The French are going to be following up the cuts in spending they have already made with further cuts just to look credible I think they will hit 3 percent of GDP When you have the kind of marginal propensity to tax that those economies have, which is 50 percent or more, and you begin to have spending contractions, it is very hard to lower the deficit because the inevitability of G and Y and T make the math very, very difficult They are chasing themselves down There is also a remarkable sense of denial or willingness to deny the problems  This seems like a very implausible basis on which to run a democratic society for very long I think it is a good example of the state of denial in France and Germany  I do not share Ted's view that we are going to have a weak euro I believe we probably are going to have a strong euro because I think the only thing that they will be valuing after convergence is  -27-    5/21/96  credibility I do think that they are going to have some credibility problems In my view that means their policy will have to be tighter than tight to begin with I think the path of convergence is going to lead to a downward spiral in Europe, and after they get there they are still going to be continuing with that sort of policy So, I came away from Europe very, very depressed, from Japan mildly encouraged, but, gee, it is great to be in America!  Thank you, Mr Chairman I listened very carefully to your argument regarding the downward pressure that is now being put on prices The model that crept into my head was what I will call the secular versus the cyclical factors There are some secular changes occurring in the economy such as a decline in unionization and the spread of different kinds of retailing These changes have put downward pressure on the capacity of the economy to increase prices I have to believe that the secular trend is probably not a permanent one, and the question that we are facing is when it will come to an end I agree with the Greenbook and with the majority of the people at the table that cyclical pressures are pointing toward more inflation The question is whether the secular trend will keep the cyclical pressures from adding to inflation  I have just one data point, not enough to base a decision on, and that is some information where I shop a lot! Actually, this information does not come from my shopping experience, but from the company itself Over the last two years or so, they have been cutting prices on the average of 2 to 3 percent a year That is partly an effort to gain market share and partly, I believe, the result of new developments in retailing That policy has now changed They have stopped cutting prices and are now starting to increase them, albeit very modestly While this is only one data point, it  -37-    5/21/96  does suggest to me that the secular factors are probably coming to an end We have benefited from them for a long time  The second issue is about events I can't imagine any forthcoming economic event that is going to change anybody's point of view What future statistic is going to cause us to move? There isn't one So, I am not expecting the need for a telephone conference, and I don't think anyone else does either because there just is no number that would change something fundamental in this period The reason is that we are not in an emergency kind of situation When we tightened policy in 1994, I defended the move even though the natural rate was below the unemployment rate The reason was that if we had waited for inflation to get embedded into wage rates, it would already have been too late and we would have needed a recession at that point to get the inflation out of wage rates So, I don't think we should be driven by events If we actually are looking for a reason in the ECI or in wage rates, it will be too late when we see it It is my hunch that nobody here knows anyone who is expecting to cut some salary The betting has to be that the salary is going to go up  Having said all that, I have one hunch and one observation, and that is not enough for me to support an increase in rates today But given that we are not driven by events, I am not sure that that is the basis on which we should decide symmetry versus asymmetry As I listened to the comments around the table, I detected a strong undercurrent of unease So, I am in concert with Jerry Jordan's observation that perhaps symmetric is not the way to go We should take note of what is happening, and even though I favor symmetry procedurally, I would prefer "B," asymmetric at this point  I think I am an opportunist I am proud of being an opportunist, but the thing I don't know is when the opportunity is going to present itself We are not going to induce a recession, but we know the business cycle is going to produce one When it does, then inflation will come down I don't know if that will occur one or two business cycles from now Perhaps the year 2000 is a good year for a goal; perhaps "ultimate" is another desirable goal; but I would not use 1998  Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] LINDSEY A quarter point increase for the next four FOMC meetings, so an upward adjustment of 100 basis points by year- end LINDSEY Yes, I looked at the chart that I got from him yesterday We have done a little work on MZM That chart and our earlier work do not show anything like the breakdown in the velocity/ opportunity cost relationship that has occurred for M2 in the 1990s On the other hand, judging by that chart and the econometric work we have done, MZM has a rather substantial sensitivity to movements in short-term interest rates and thus opportunity costs Therefore, it does not recommend itself as an intermediate guide to policy The example I like to think of in this regard is that if nominal spending starts to drift up sufficiently to cause a problem with inflationary acceleration and the Federal Reserve tightens a little, the result could be to drive the growth rate of a very interest-sensitive aggregate back down at the same time that nominal GDP is still spurting ahead Inflation could get out of control by insufficient, gradual increases in short-term rates even though we would be keeping this interest-sensitive aggregate well within a range This is a problem that harkens back to the situation that developed with M1 after the introduction of super NOWs in the early 1980s Indeed, I think the fundamental reason why the Committee deemphasized the Ml aggregate was that it had become too interest sensitive to be of use as a normal intermediate target LINDSEY Yes I am somewhat sympathetic to that suggestion Obviously, we do not currently target Ml; we do not currently put much weight on it Clearly, the sweep-account problem, which involves these adjustments only for the initial sweeps, is making it more and more difficult over time to have confidence in Ml, even after sweep adjustments I am a little sympathetic to that idea I will not speak for my division director, however [Laughter]  I share your concern I am a little worried about what we may be seeing I had thought about this a little differently It would seem that this autumn is going to be an interesting period, particularly among European currencies What is motivating banks to write options, to bet on continuing low volatility in the exchange market when, just reading the papers, we are told that volatility is going to be increasing? It seems to me that there is a lot more risk out there than usual  So, we are back in the incentive-structure problem?  It is not the first time  Ted, in Chart 10, you have given us a nifty tool of analysis I had a question about one of your assumptions The policy assumption in the chart is that US and foreign monetary authorities target nominal GDP To my knowledge the nominal GDP developments in the developing countries, including much of East Asia and Latin America, have not had a big effect on our decisions Would there be a need to relax that assumption with regard to developing countries?  But your added constraint certainly isn't --  Why wouldn't an exchange rate peg work in that model? It would be a somewhat more relaxed assumption than the one you made, but less relaxed than in an unconstrained model  I think these semiannual meetings are best used to assess whether there are any major trends that have surprised us There are two that have surprised me consumer debt and public policy I will restrict my comments to consumer debt  I think the consumer situation is best summed up by the old labor ballad about "another day older and deeper in debt" The ballad concludes with the phrase, "I owe my soul to the company store" Of course, the song was written in a less enlightened time than the present one Today the singer would simply declare bankruptcy! [Laughter] The reason all this is a surprise to me is that 18 months ago I thought the consumer would have cut back spending by now either out of voluntary recognition of the family financial situation or because creditors would have stopped extending additional credit Neither has occurred In fact, it is now obvious that credit extensions continue to mushroom in at least some areas Credit is much easier to get than it was 18 months ago Revolving credit increased $75 billion in the 12 months ended in April according to our latest statistical release That is a 205 percent annual increase Auto credit increased only 10 percent and total consumer credit was up 13 percent Our 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, when adjusted to match flow of funds data to overall household debt, shows that roughly one household in six now pays 40 percent or more of its income in debt-service payments  This is showing up in consumer delinquency rates In the first quarter, just under 3 percent of all auto loans at finance companies were 30 or more days delinquent In 1991 when the unemployment rate was 68 percent, which was the previous peak, the delinquency rate was 265 percent Credit card delinquencies at commercial banks were 349 percent in the first quarter of this year and they were 321 percent at the previous peak in 1991 Interest- ingly, the Survey of Consumer Finance shows that the usual signs of economic distress were not the cause The proportion of consumers with debt payments exceeding 40 percent of income who reported either unemployment during the survey year or unusually low income for the year was actually lower in 1995 than in 1992 That may help explain why the new computerized underwriting procedures continue to extend ever more credit even as debt levels grow The traditional warning flags simply are not present for the great majority of people who are taking on new debt  -31-    7/2-3/96  Anecdotally, lenders invariably cite "competitive pressures" as the reason for granting ever more and ever riskier credit I called up the American Automotive Manufacturers Association (AAMA) to get some feel for their view on credit The average term for their members in extending credit is between 52 and 57 months The standard offer now is 60 months, although one of the captive auto finance companies is now offering a 72-month loan on minivans The reason they gave for extending the maturity on such loans was competitive pressure from the banks My colleagues on the Board might chuckle since the members of TIAC, who were here last week, were saying that they were now offering 72-month loans and even some 84-month loans The reason given was competitive pressure from the auto finance companies! When I hear about an 84-month auto loan, I know that the credit merry-go-round has not stopped and it is probably picking up speed But I do not think that is the whole story The AAMA reported their captive members are now financing only 15 percent of their total sales  Fully 30 percent of sales--I guess we call them sales--are now leases In addition, that 30 percent tends to be heavily weighted toward higher-priced cars The economics of the auto leasing industry is interesting From the point of view of consumer debt, it should make our view of the household situation even more troubling Auto leases are not in the debt numbers or in the debt-service numbers But in fact, they are really the worst type of debt service since there is absolutely no equity buildup in the payment I have gotten deeper into this area than I ever dreamed, thanks to our current work on Regulation M Those efforts have indicated to me that we actually face another macroeconomic problem from leasing, which I thought it was important to share The auto companies currently are tending to offer high residual-value option prices on their cars They know this will mean that fewer consumers will end up buying the leased vehicle when the lease is up The reason for this practice is that it tends to make the lease more attractive to current buyers because it lowers the monthly payment And given the high sticker price of autos, this is viewed as a necessary sales incentive The auto companies are willing to do this because they are making an implicit bet on the ability of their cars to hold up in value for longer periods Now, this is not an altogether bad bet Auto quality and durability are up But higher prices in the future for used cars depend in part on prospectively higher new car prices For this to work, new car prices must therefore continue to rise faster than family incomes, making them ever less affordable and requiring continuing innovation in the financing areas in order to keep sales up The auto companies are now recognizing, or at least their finance divisions are now recognizing, that they are on a credit-based merry-go-round of their making that must eventually stop But at the present time, none of them can afford to get off  Future credit problems also are apparent in the trend in home mortgage financing According to the Federal Housing Finance Board, 45 percent of all mortgage loans granted in May had loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) in excess of 80 percent Some 26 percent had LTVs in excess of 90 percent The average LTV on all 30-year fixed, non-jumbo loans was over 82 percent Also, it is not the S&Ls, the traditional and well-qualified source of mortgage funds, that are making the bulk of these loans Mortgage companies and commercial banks had 28 percent of their originations in over 90 percent loan-to-value  -32-    7/2-3/96  mortgages versus just 18 percent for the S&Ls Now, from my experience at Neighborhood Reinvestment and from the studies done here at the Board, it is clear that high LTVs are a big risk for future delinquency No one purchases a home expecting to default, but when economic distress occurs, individuals with no equity in their homes have less incentive to stay than those who have such equity Our experience shows these high LTV loans can be successfully and profitably made, but they require enormous amounts of handholding and follow-through with the borrower While there are firms with staff capable of doing this, the personnel infrastructure in the country is simply not adequate to do an effective job at anything approaching the current volume The problems here are already showing up and are going to get worse Although, as Mike Prell pointed out, 60-day delinquency rates on mortgages are still fairly modest in the aggregate, the same is not true for those loans that are targeted to populations likely to get into trouble For example, FHA 60-day delinquencies hit 283 percent in the first quarter of this year That is a new record, and the worst is yet to come Delinquencies and foreclosures tend to peak a few years after the mortgages are originated Mortgage lenders were particularly aggressive in this type of lending during 1994 and 1995, in large part because of impending CRA reform and other regulatory jawboning  Why care? I think there is a long-term social cost we are going to pay from all this, but my Calvinist instincts should not have any bearing on your decision More topically, I do not believe that these issues are of the type or magnitude that will affect the integrity of the banking system The banks are well reserved for any reasonably expected losses and increasing portions of their mortgage portfolios are being securitized But from a timing point of view, the increased availability of credit has allowed this expansion to continue longer than it otherwise would Consumption has expanded more quickly than the income of the great majority of American households This has not proved troublesome for the expansion because these households took on increasing amounts of debt I admit to having been surprised that this has gone on for such a long time and I am now convinced that it can go on so long as lenders remain willing to extend the terms and conditions under which they make loans But the price we are paying is the increasing fragility of the underlying financial structure of the household sector While increasing debt burdens will not of themselves end the expansion, they do make the economy more susceptible to unforeseen developments The next recession will be longer and deeper than it otherwise would have been because of this extra debt Our memories of 1991 and particularly 1992 should be fresh enough to remind us of what balance sheet problems in a significant sector of the economy can do to macroeconomic performance  At the same time, I do not believe that a sudden burst of aggregate demand is likely, given these conditions As long as the real incomes of the great majority of American households remain stagnant, borrowers and lenders would have to take complete leave of their senses to finance an accelerated consumption binge It would be one thing to go deeper in debt; it is another to go deeper in debt at an ever accelerating rate I am also concerned that the computerization of the credit-granting decision is going to accelerate the speed with which any adverse economic shock is transmitted to and throughout the household sector Aside from lowering the cost of  -33-    7/2-3/96  credit decisions, credit scoring also makes it easier to review existing credit files In the present upturn, this has meant faster granting of increased credit lines on credit cards and easier terms for auto loans and mortgages In the future downturn, it will mean just the opposite The normal decision lags in the process will be far shorter next time, and thus the time available for the shock to work itself out before it becomes self-reinforcing will be reduced From a policy perspective, this is the real meaning of the term fragility with respect to the economy; and all we can do is watch and wait  That is actually what she said  I am very impressed with the Vice Chairman's Jesuit training, and I think I agree with him completely I also agreed with what I thought Janet Yellen said, which is that we should reduce inflation to a lower rate and we should proceed gradually from there as we gain experience Having agreed with her, I got very nervous when Al Broaddus said he was not going to rebut her because the readers of this transcript five years from now will then conclude that we actually are all on one side of the issue So, I am going to do the rebuttal that Al did not do only because she provoked me with the use of the word "taxes" [Laughter]  No, she said the word "taxes" I heard it and she is not going to get away with this!  Let me start off with some calculations very quickly The presence of retirement vehicles does not solve the problem, and here are some examples Let us do an IRA-type calculation versus a permanent savings account that is taxed every year and a "let's abolish inflation" calculation If you have a 30 percent tax rate, a 2 percent real return, and no inflation, the real after-tax return after 20 years is 34 percent If you do not have IRAs, after 20 years the real return would be 10-1/2 percent, assuming 3 percent inflation If you do have IRAs, it is 197 percent That's because under the IRA system, the fact is the inflation buildup is still taxed  -54-    7/2-3/96  and so the real return is depressed So, in fact, you have to take inflation out of the system in order to solve the problem  It cuts the gains, but by this calculation it would reduce the gains by 40 percent, not by 90 percent  Okay, I just wanted to put that in The economics profession has for 30 years gone through the functional equivalent of CRA reform by arguing that we should change the tax code for inflation indexing We have tried, we have tried, we have tried, we have tried; we have failed, we have failed, we have failed, we have failed It is not going to happen, and I think the reason is summed up in what is the most egregious part of inflation treatment in the tax code, and that is depreciation Back in the early Reagan Administration, indexing depreciation was one of the proposed reforms The companies are not for it; the Congress is not for it When it was tried again in 1995, it just floated up there and was absolutely shot down because, horror of horrors, a company could actually deduct over time more dollars than it spent That was considered politically unacceptable by the enlightened members of the Congress So, we are never, never, never in my opinion ever going to index our tax code correctly That is not a first-best solution because it is not a solution  Second, on nominal wage rigidities, I agree with your analysis; I think it is right on target Here is the case for reducing inflation gradually, which is where I agree with you completely What would happen is that, over time, we would see a change in the method of compensation in the economy toward a profit- sharing mode If we reduce inflation gradually enough, there is time for this fundamental change in compensation to occur Then, I do not think we will have the same slope of the Phillips curve as we had before Such a change is happening right now  Third, I think there are a lot of other rigidities in the system One classic example is our housing mortgage rules with which I am intimately aware and have discussed There the solution is no inflation So, I do think that the social gains to no inflation in the long, long term are actually greater than you suggested, Janet, and the cost, if we do it slowly and gradually and allow the labor market to get used to it, will be less than you implied Let's move to 2 percent inflation, and I will bet that if we do it gradually, we can move lower than that  The ecological effects would be the same, and we would be all set  -55-    7/2-3/96  You are assuming that savings are not responsive to interest rates?  You assume zero responsiveness?  No, I heard the word tax again [Laughter] You have the right to tell me to shut up, but I will otherwise persist  No It is true that the economics literature does not show a correlation between the real after-tax return on savings and the rate of savings However, in the example I gave  -62-    7/2-3/96  before, 3 percent inflation and a 2 percent real return converts a 30 percent tax rate on savings to an 80 percent tax rate on savings No sensible person would recommend that as a sane policy That's not because of this elasticity with respect to growth, but because it is distorting and unfair within the tax system What it does is to induce people to "save" in other forms that are quasi-consumption oriented, which causes an untaxed stream of benefits Now, given that they do all that--hold more "saving" in the form of more jewelry, more land, more housing, rather than financial assets--that is a very different proposition I see everyone shaking their heads that they agree with me; maybe that is to encourage me to be quiet [Laughter] I will take it as assent with my point that what you measured as the elasticity is not the "be all and end all" of policy here  It is still unfair  But it is a level change, not a permanent increase  What happens in the second quarter?  Right, that is the point That is what I meant by a level change  That would require a constant acceleration in oil prices  How much tighter is the tighter alternative?  Mr Chairman, even though you did not utter the word "tax," I am going to respectfully disagree [Laughter]  If you had uttered the word "tax," I probably would have disagreed disrespectfully or something  As you stated, Mr Chairman, we set a range that we thought was going to be consistent with our intermediate- or longer-run targets for inflation The number that I heard yesterday was 2 percent inflation as an interim target The number that I heard on expected growth was 2 percent And 2 plus 2 equals 4  That is probably true The first consideration is that the midpoint of the Alternative II range is 4, and that range is therefore consistent with our stated purpose in setting a range Second, even though there may be an argument over what the word "tighter" means in the shorter run, if we tighten 100 basis points this year, M2 growth will still be near the upper end of the Alternative I range Next year, it would fall to the middle of the range under a policy that we would all acknowledge to be "tighter" The word "tighter," if translated into a monetary aggregate, means to me that we are running our monetary aggregate below a normal rate because we are deliberately trying to disinflate Under the tighter  -71-    7/2-3/96  scenario, our nominal GDP is not 2 and 2 It is 2 and 1-1/2 or something like that  I also disagree about how perceptions would be affected Frankly, I do not think that there is any perception out there that we are aggressively easing policy I do not think that is true in the bond market The risks in that direction may have existed in the past, but I do not think they exist now With regard to why we would be raising the range, the answer is that it is a technical readjustment just like M3 was last July In your testimony, you can state that, Mr Chairman No one here is arguing that M2 should become the pinnacle of monetary policy again We are reporting these ranges only because it is required by law Because it is required by law, we have a moral responsibility to report a range that is reasonable and consistent with what we actually are going to end up with  Mr Chairman, yesterday I thought Governor Meyer laid out two issues very well One of them is how GDP will grow relative to trend Your analysis showed exactly how we would respond If we saw a rise in inventory accumulation, to use your example, that suggested a sustained, above-trend rate of economic growth, we would move right away That is in fact why you are recommending an asymmetric directive I do not think there is any disagreement about that The other issue, to simplify it in terms of the labor market, is where the existing unemployment rate is relative to the natural rate, the NAIRU I also have not read Governor Yellen's paper, which probably has had about the best press so far of any paper in history for a paper that may not yet be finished [Laughter]  With both religion and economics, we tend to be schismatic The Episcopalians can't sing from the Presbyterian hymnbook, and that is always a problem But let me see if I can put what has been said before in an ecumenical sense Jim Stock had a very interesting paper earlier this year on the NAIRU in the last three decades He observed that it has been highly variable Yes, if one had to pick a number and bet on it for 30 years, one would pick something like 6 percent But it has been as low as 5-1/2 percent and as high as 8 percent Let me talk about the 8 percent number, for example It came during an adverse oil shock What exactly does the term NAIRU mean? It means the level of unemployment we have to attain to stop inflation from accelerating An oil shock produces a lot of inflationary impetus in the economic system To prevent an acceleration of inflation, the unemployment rate has to rise sharply and put downward pressure on wages to overcome the oil shock and hold inflation in place The lesson is that the NAIRU is variable, but changes in it due to supply shocks are temporary The NAIRU in his story came back down again after the oil shock ended  Mr Chairman, when I heard you mention the numbers 4-1/4 and 5 percent for the NAIRU, that set off alarm bells The way I interpreted what you just said is that given the rate of disinflation we recently experienced, the current level of unemployment, and the usual relationship between the amount of disinflation and the difference between the rate of unemployment and the NAIRU, you backed  -88-    7/2-3/96  out an implied NAIRU But that is a temporary NAIRU I do not think we would gamble policy on the presumption that we have permanently reduced the natural rate to 4-1/4 or 5 percent A backlog of fear-- this is my word for it--generated by the layoffs and the downsizings and whatever else in the early 1990s, created what we could think of as a positive supply shock, and the labor markets temporarily pushed the natural rate that low It will not stay that low, and we should not bet that it will What does that mean for short-run policy? I think you have it exactly right You told us how we are going to respond to a demand-side shock or surprise, and I think the natural rate probably is much lower right now than it has been historically But it is there only temporarily The stock of fear that pushed the natural rate down will wear off We do not know how fast that will occur, but we had better be prepared to respond when it does I think we have reached the right solution in whatever New Age church [laughter] it may be that you are describing  Second  I am certainly no advocate of withdrawing from the world,  Two issues have been raised The first has to do with what I would call the dual purposes here, which is concern about withdrawal from the world versus a domestic political consideration As some members have emphasized in this discussion, there certainly will come a time in the future when we will wish to be in a position to intervene in foreign exchange markets I am sure that will happen We have managed to intervene in foreign exchange markets quite a bit I can't think of any instance since I have been here when we really had to intervene It certainly was not because of an emergency or a financial crisis As I recall, every time we intervened the reason really came down to what was in effect a domestic political consideration Some major trading partner had too high a currency or too low a currency or something of that nature and that was the real motivation It was not a systemic risk situation There was no question about systemic risk In every instance that we can think of, except perhaps for some hypothetical developments in the future, we know why intervention is being used It has nothing to do with systemic risk; it is an arm of the domestic political apparatus, and I do not like that I do not think that is what we are here for, and I think there are risks to this institution if we play that game  We really have to think about two issues The first, as has been mentioned, is the list of countries with which we want to conduct these transactions, and related to that is the question of whether or not the other currency is a major store of value Mr Chairman, you indicated that we should exclude countries where the State Department does not want US citizens to travel I do not think we need a repurchase agreement with North Korea or Cuba, and I do not know where else we cannot travel, so I think that is too small a list of excluded countries  Iran, okay We do not need a repurchase agreement with Iran right now  SPEAKER(?) They have their own printing press! [Laughter]  Let us think about the Indian rupee or the Chinese renminbi  All right, let us pick the case of a repurchase agreement with China  In dollars Let us think about the odds that the transaction would be used to prevent systemic contagion to the US banking system versus the odds that it would be used for domestic political considerations because the Chinese are selling us too many shirts or whatever it is Do you want to give me the odds on that? I know which way it is going to come out The only place where I think the issue gets really difficult is with the yen, which does serve as a true world store of value currency Even in that case, it can still be used for domestic political considerations So, I think we have to draw the net very tightly on countries with which we will undertake to do these transactions I believe the way to think of this is in terms of the probability that we may need to intervene for good reasons versus purely domestic political considerations  The second issue is one of duration I do not remember any discussion of this although, Bill, you did allude to it We could have a two-day reverse repo or a three-day reverse repo, but if we renew it 100 times, it suddenly becomes what I would call a real extension of credit I would suggest that we think hard about that issue; that would be one of the clearer lines in the sand that we would have to draw I remember in our discussion of the Mexican bailout that we all knew we were going a bit out on a limb for a year We viewed that as a long time, and we certainly did not want to go beyond a year If we are going to focus on this and we want to avoid the appearance of an extension of credit, I would think that the duration has to be a lot less than a year Maybe it should be a matter of weeks  I agree   Mr Chairman, I agree that this is not the time to dismantle the swap lines, but I have a question as to whether there really is ever going to be a good time The establishment of the European Central Bank is not a foregone conclusion, although the odds may favor it It is also unclear who is in and who is out Even if all of Europe is included, that does not do anything for our Japanese swap line So, I am not sure that we have identified an appropriate time as a target date to get rid of these arrangements While this may not be the moment, it would be nice to have a little more comfort that there is a time when we think it definitely will be appropriate to revisit the issue  Let us think about what the ECB is going to look like in 1998 I do not have the complete list of countries that we have swaps with, but I would wager that some will be in and some will be out  Would it not be even more disruptive if we started to talk about getting rid of the swap lines at a time when, say, there was a great debate as to whether France or Britain met the criteria--I am just using that as an example--and we had some of Europe in and some of Europe out when the decision was made to go ahead with the ECB? We would encounter all the delicacies and ramifications of European politics if we raised this issue then I would think that, if anything, that would be an even more sensitive time than the present  That is, not now?  Thank you, Mr Chairman I think Governor Phillips said it well when she said we have more data but not more information, and maybe that is good I have two observations The first is on the business use of credit cards, which I think is certainly happening In fact, small businesses have always used credit cards as a means of finance, and that use has expanded It has expanded in part because a lot of the small businesses that are created now involve people who had lost their previous jobs through downsizings or are now in a relationship with their employers that involves consulting As a result, it is natural for these people to go to credit card financing However, that is not necessarily a basis for optimism  First, if the entrepreneur is not careful, the apparent 69 percent or other low rate of interest is in fact quite expensive financing because, if the entrepreneur is mingling private consumption debt with business debt, the IRS will quickly disallow the deduction of the interest For example, for a middle class entrepreneur, a 69 percent credit card debt is like a 108 percent business loan That tax consequence has not been featured in Money Magazine or on the front page of the business column of the Wall Street Journal, but I think entrepreneurs will be finding out about it soon if in fact that is what they are doing  Second, with regard to the riskiness of credit card debt, it is important to recall that the proprietary type of income is in the personal income numbers There is no real capital behind what these people are doing They are basically in the service sector There may be a computer in the business; but we all know what the resale market for computers looks like, so there is no significant amount of capital behind what they are doing In a sense, they are giving themselves a consumption loan, but they call it a business loan, and they pay themselves higher salaries than otherwise with the difference in interest The result is no different from anyone else running up a credit card debt to buy, say, a vacation So, I think Gary Stern's point is well taken, and if anything I think we should be a little more concerned about small-business-based financing than we are about general financing with credit cards  As far as the economic data are concerned, we are going to get more data and we may or may not get more information in the intermeeting period Where I would think that we have a risk,  -32-    8/20/96  however, is not in the US economy I think our risk will stem from the activities of our good friends located not far from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the Second District and our compatriots around the world returning from the beach and looking for a source of money to be made In fact, there is a great deal of money to be made in speculating on the European Monetary Union or nonunion or whatever In that regard, there are two obvious events and probably a lot more that are not obvious One is the French budget, which will be a fake and everyone knows it The question is, how much of a fake? That should cause a little instability with regard to the franc/mark convergence The other event--to call it an event really is not fair --is the Italian government, which provides an ongoing spectacle France and Italy both are risky I think there will be lots of bets on both the franc and the lira and maybe on the Spanish peseta that will tend to push money into marks For some reason that I am not fully comprehending, the consequence is not just a mark/franc gain or mark/lira gain The dollar tends to lose when the mark appreciates I think this situation is risky for us for two reasons The first is a long-run fundamental reason and that is that a weaker dollar will result in a net stimulus to the US economy at a time when we really do not need any extra stimulus The greater risk is that it will tempt policymakers to intervene I think that would be a serious mistake We should be ever vigilant in watching the data come in, but I see that as the key piece of information that actually poses a policy risk for a potential intermeeting move  I support your proposal   Concerning the French budget, it appears that the French got from here to there with asset sales Of course, the budget is a very flexible document, but one would think that asset sales would be a little suspect by the terms of Maastrict Why is the European Monetary Union going to bless this?  So, the markets are saying that the triumph of politics over economics is a good thing?  Thank you, Mr Chairman Last night one of the TV news magazine shows had a story about people who won the mega bucks lotteries, millions of dollars, and ruined their lives [Laughter] That was a popular thing to show since most of us lose in lotteries and maybe we should be grateful because losing helps us to get on with our lives [Laughter] The TV show reminded me that we have been having a string of what appears to be good luck, although the people at this table all know it is the result of our skill at managing the economy! I would like to comment on the possibility that our luck may be running out  First, it is clear that we are seeing definite acceleration in nominal wages Second, it also seems clear that the acceleration  -23-    9/24/96  is not now being passed through to prices, and that is the best of all worlds A question we have to face, one of the questions that Governor Meyer addressed, is whether this subdued inflation is going to persist along with sustained growth further out I have done a back-of-the-envelope calculation It takes 70 cents of extra spending per capita per day to increase economic growth 1 percent Now, I use this example whenever a reporter asks me to comment on the economic outlook I ask how much are you going to spend tomorrow, within 70 cents, and when they can't give me an answer I say that I can't tell them what economic growth is going to be next quarter [Laughter] Without using the sophisticated analysis either of the Greenbook or that Governor Meyer presented, let me use some very unsophisticated math  In the last four quarters, the economy has grown at a 27 percent annual rate Indeed, the economy has grown at a 27 percent annual rate since the fourth quarter of 1991 So, I am going to use as my operating assumption that we are in a 27 percent economy, which I agree is probably above the sustainable pace at this point Even if we make that assumption and if we assume that the staff forecast is right about the third quarter, then in the fourth quarter we are going to need a 17 percent rate of growth If the Greenbook forecast is right about the third quarter and the fourth quarter, growth in the first quarter of next year will have to be at a 15 percent rate In other words, just simple regression toward the mean, in addition to all the reasons that Governor Meyer noted, suggests that our luck on the real side may be about to run out, if we think of this lottery drawing as the number from the BEA But who knows? They may deliver an extra B-2 bomber one of these quarters  Similarly, we are running a risk that our luck is going to run out on the inflation side In the last year, the monthly CPI increase has been 1 percent four times, 2 percent two times, 3 percent three times, and 4 percent three times That is what inflation at an annual rate of just under 3 percent is all about It is essentially a random number month to month on which apparently billions of dollars are being bet But if we view it as a random number, the odds of our pulling a 4 percent number in either of the next two months run just a tad under 50 percent That will be, judging from the recent reaction to the 1 percent increase, not a happy day So, I think we have a chance of seeing our luck run out on the real side of the economy, including inflation  But that is not where I am most worried What worries me more is that our luck is about to run out in the financial markets because of what I would consider a gambler's curse We have won this long, let us keep the money on the table You can see early signs of this It includes real estate appreciation in the Hamptons, Connecticut, and Manhattan BMW and Mercedes both had their best summer in history in the United States The IBES earnings expectations survey for 5-year projected earnings hit a 12-year high in August It indicates that earnings are expected to grow at a rate of a little over 11-1/2 percent per year Now, if we assume nominal GDP growth of 5-1/2 percent over the same period, this means that NIPA profits will rise from 107 percent of national income to 143 percent of national income in 2001 Readers of this transcript five years from now can check this fearless prediction Profits will fall short of this expectation Unfortunately, optimism is ripe in the markets  -24-    9/24/96  Excessive optimism is also necessary to justify current levels of IPO activity and valuations of highly speculative stocks While it is not so large as to exert undue pressure on the real side of the US economy, this emerging bubble is nonetheless real As a survivor of the so-called Massachusetts miracle to which Cathy Minehan referred earlier, I can attest that everyone enjoys an economic party But the long-term costs of a bubble to the economy and society are potentially great They include a reduction in the long-term saving rate, a seemingly random redistribution of wealth, and the diversion of scarce financial human capital into the acquisition of wealth As in the United States in the late 1920s and Japan in the late 1980s, the case for a central bank ultimately to burst that bubble becomes overwhelming I think it is far better that we do so while the bubble still resembles surface froth and before the bubble carries the economy to stratospheric heights Whenever we do it, it is going to be painful, however  In addition, there is an associated risk that we face every two or four years, and it is related to the bond market The markets have built in an array of rather optimistic scenarios for the effect of the upcoming elections on the nation's health The dominant view is characterized by a recent missive from Goldman Sachs which predicted a divided government "Continued divided control of government in fact might provide the ripest political conditions for a fresh push toward mandatory spending program overhaul in the next Congressional term, which would have the clearest favorable ramifications for deficit control in the coming decade" A second equally optimistic view was provided by a friend of mine who straddles both the political and the financial markets He predicted a Democratic takeover of Congress and said with regard to entitlements reform, "Look, their program of savage cuts becomes our saving the system and it will get enacted" In this regard packaging is all that matters It is what we might call the Japanese business gift theory of politics  In short, the markets now have built into them a very optimistic view of what is going to happen after November 5 They may be right no matter what happens I think there are two reasons to differ The first is polarization and the second is party parity Any look at the political advertisements now running makes clear that the new Congress is going to be fairly polarized I see two types of members those who got there by accusing their opponents of wanting to throw granny out in the snow and those who survived by vociferously denying that they wanted to throw granny out in the snow How is either going to enact Medicare or Social Security reform? Second, no matter which party controls Congress, the margin of control is likely to be a relative handful of seats This creates a very interesting dynamic The majority will be ill-inclined to take risks for fear of losing its status The minority will be both hungry and embittered and quite unwilling to help the majority shoulder the responsibilities of governing That is not an optimistic recipe Now, it may be that the optimists in the bond market who believe these optimistic scenarios are right and that the people are going to send only statesmen to Capitol Hill, just like they have every two years In this scenario we, the bond market, and the country have nothing to worry about But if the optimists are wrong, then indeed not only our luck but that of the markets and of the economy has run out Thank you  -25-    9/24/96  Just a question, yes, about the productivity numbers President Jordan mentioned that there is a plug in the employment statistics to cover changes in employment associated with business starts That would all be in the noncorporate sector How do we know that overstatements of employment in the noncorporate sector are not an explanation for the productivity statistics?  Thank you, Mr Chairman I was very struck with the group of prominent economists that Cathy Minehan assembled at her Bank That is in part because I learned a lot of economics from the people in that group, and I do not think that they are at all unrepresentative of what I would consider mainstream academic thinking I do think that moving today would be the academic thing to do It would comport with history It would comport with what our models tell us is going to happen down the road But I also think that history and academic analysis tell us that we face an asymmetric loss function if we are wrong We will pay a higher price if we are wrong in terms of more unemployed people in 1998 or 1999 or whenever  -37-    9/24/96  than if we were to move today Because of the academic respectability of that argument, I would respectfully disagree with the Vice Chairman in this regard I think that the motivations of the people here are very, very sound I do not believe that we actually disagree It is much more important that we pull together in public than around the table  Having said that, Mr Chairman, I believe that what you are proposing is more reflective of what I would call an entrepreneurial, hands-on approach I think it is built frankly out of self-confidence and nimbleness, and you have earned the capacity to have self- confidence and to be a little more nimble in the conduct of policy I will be supporting your recommendation based on what I think is a very well-earned reputation of success Where I remain nervous relates to what is going to happen at 215 pm today, or whenever the magic hour may be I think that the potential for seeing a wave of relief on the screens and the resulting reaction is going to be quite instructive as to our real long-term problem and the challenge facing this Committee  Peter, the word "euthanasia" has been used and I think it is appropriate One of the options you did not address was to dispose of our DM holdings President Jordan may be right in saying that this is not the time to consider that issue, but we need to decide at some point why we are still in this Why do we still hold those large DM reserves? We have talked about getting rid of them since I have been here We will have to get rid of them before 1999 We do not know how the euro is going to come into play We do not know if we will want to intervene in euros Why don't we take this opportunity to go to the Germans and say, look, let's really clean our books?  The reason is that the interest rate risk that you are discussing is trivial in comparison to the exchange rate risk, especially in the transition to the euro That is why it comes back to you But if we are going to consider this question another day, I am reassured Let's consider it another day  But why wouldn't it if we are adding to our short-term portfolio in an era of, say, low deficits? Why wouldn't that allow the Treasury to ease off on its issuance of long-term debt and move the whole maturity structure of the debt toward short term issues?  I would imagine that to accommodate a growing money supply and a move toward liquidity on our part over time the Treasury is going to have to respond in an era of low deficits by lowering the average maturity of the debt structure I think that is the incentive we are creating  If the deficit comes down and we are increasing our take of the short-term debt, why wouldn't they have to respond by moving into supplying more short-term debt?  Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] LINDSEY I will turn to Mike Prell for answers to some of your questions about the forecast As I look at the nominal GDP numbers on a four-quarter basis starting this year, I don't see much change in the annual growth rates, which go from 47 percent this year to 45 percent in 1997 and 44 percent in 1998--actually a little deceleration I do think, though, that the question of the CPI versus the broader measures of prices is something I should probably pass on to my R&S colleagues -28- 11/13/96  When you estimate a consumption function, do you divide the population into subsets?  It would seem that the potentially liquidity- constrained or debt-constrained population would be different from the people who have had stock market wealth gains I would think that the key to sorting the two out is to try to disaggregate the trends This is just a suggestion for future research  Thank you, Mr Chairman I think this Committee is going to be facing some difficult issues in the years ahead As if we don't have enough to worry about, I want to throw one other issue on the table and explain why I think it is more important than what we have been talking about Mr Chairman, you were the one who put me in this pickle You had to go to another meeting, and so I had to talk to a group after you walked around the table, shook all their hands, went out the door, and there I was! [Laughter] Interestingly, it was a group of Dutch visitors, but there also were Japanese in the audience One of them said that 15 years ago when he was stationed in New York the Dow was at 1,000 and now it is at 6,000 He asked me how I explained that Well, that is a sure way to get oneself in trouble, so I did some quick, fancy math and explained how 6,000 was a perfectly reasonable number Throw in nominal GDP growth and profit share growth and, voila, we were pretty much there In fact, I got the Dow up to 6,600 [laughter], and then I stopped and just breathed a sigh of relief I had other things in the background in case I did not make it!  But here is the problem Let's take a shorter period, 1992 to 1996 The S&P index has gone up about 69 percent and corporate profits have gone up 63 percent That sounds pretty reasonable The catch here, of course, is that if the markets are at all forward- looking, they are presumably buying the next five years' profits, not the last five years' profits It is not clear all mutual fund buyers know that, but that is what they should be looking at At the  -24-    11/13/96  beginning of an expansion when you are about to face five years of 13 percent growth in profits, you can put a higher evaluation on stock prices Implicitly, therefore, the fact that stock prices have risen as fast as profits implies an expectation of another five years of 13 percent growth in profits But that would be inconsistent with the numbers in the Greenbook, and that gets to the root of our problem I think that because of our success people have now pushed the perceived risk of a recession so low that they are putting valuations on financial assets and--God forbid, they are erecting buildings in Boston again--on real assets that pose a problem for the future I think Governor Meyer was exactly on target in quoting the Blue Chip as an indicator of where people think we are heading The consensus now is that inflation is permanently under control and that we will have continued moderate growth, probably permanently, though with some down quarters and some up quarters As a result of our great success here, we have low and stable interest rates I would suggest that our recent well-intentioned silence may actually be leading to even more of a sense of security, which may be good in the short run but is probably not good in the long run In addition, we have world peace The only remaining risk in the forecast is political risk, and the market says that we have taken care of that by electing a divided government  So what is there to worry about? Well, I have a little list and I am going to go over it in reverse order One is the oil sector which I think is probably riskier than is perceived in the Greenbook, particularly when one looks at the situation in the House of Saud and places like that That is a low probability risk Then we come to the consumer debt slowdown Here I think we really have a two- to three-quarter story at most, unless either we or the banks mess it up, and I do not promise that Back when I first commented on consumer debt at the beginning of 1995, I was looking at 1994 numbers I estimated that to get out of the consumer debt hole, the personal saving rate had to rise by about 1-1/2 points from what it was then, about 38 percent in 1994 We are up to almost 5 percent now; a little more and we will be there There is nothing really to worry about A couple more quarters of drag on consumption growth and we will be fine But I think there is the possibility that we as regulators and the banks will make things worse, particularly if Jerry Jordan's story is true about what to expect in 1997 I have learned in this job that bankers are very predictable and regulators are very predictable as a result We have to be very, very careful in making sure that we do not have a consumer recession that we create by regulatory decree But basically I do not think there is that much of a risk if we leave well enough alone  There is also a political risk At our last FOMC meeting, I said that if we got a narrow election result, which is what the markets wanted, the result was going to be a lack of political courage The new Congressional leadership has signaled that they are going to sit back and wait six months for the President to come up with a budget The President has signaled that he is going to support a balanced budget amendment, which he is going to be stuck with anyway So, we have nobody taking action except to push through something that will save us from ourselves That sounds a lot like what I hear in Europe, which is that Brussels is going to save the politicians from themselves in each of the countries I think that, when the markets recognize that we are trying to postpone severe  -25-    11/13/96  fiscal problems by finding commissions or balanced budget amendments to deal with them, there is a potential risk for the bond market and for the economy in the years ahead  The biggest risk relates to the current stock market valuation based on 13 percent growth in profits It comes back to simple math Nominal GDP growth in the last four quarters has been 42 percent As Jerry Jordan pointed out, if we look at the money growth numbers, there is absolutely no reason to expect such GDP growth to accelerate I admit that we do not know a lot about money growth, but everything we do know suggests that nominal GDP growth is not going to accelerate How we are going to get 13 percent growth in corporate profits, or 11 percent growth or anything like that, to validate these levels of the stock market I am not sure If we have a problem there, either the market will stop rising or we will have to decide whether we are going to make it stop by injecting a little risk into the process And, frankly, I think that call is going to be our toughest decision in the years ahead  There is a question at this time regarding the availability of coffee  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I think it is important when we think about symmetry and asymmetry that we not focus too much on conditions in the current quarter or even the next quarter When we have unemployment of 52 percent, we can tolerate a substantial short-term weakening of the economy and still want to be poised on the asymmetric side toward tightening It would take, for example, two to three quarters of growth in the 1-1/2 to 2 percent range just to get the unemployment rate moving back toward 5-1/2 percent, which arguably means no more acceleration in pressures on resources and inflation So, I think that being asymmetric is exactly the right thing to do, and frankly I think we are going to be there for quite a while because I do not see any signs that we are going to be removing inflation pressures in the economy very quickly   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think that in spite of your best efforts, 1997 is going to be a very good year for irrational exuberance [Laughter] I take the Greenbook as Exhibit One In mid-1993 I got into a little trouble because the wire services quoted a quip I made at the beginning of a speech to the effect that monetary policy had been reduced to the number 3 or 3 something 3 percent inflation, 3 percent growth, 3 percent fed funds rate Now, I have to change it to 2 something because what I see in  -28-    12/17/96  the Greenbook forecast is quarterly GDP growth rates of 21, 23, 23, 22, 21, and 19 percent; and for the implicit deflator from the second quarter of 1997 it goes 21, 20, 20, 23, 22, 22 and 23 percent I suppose the real fed funds rate is "2 something" percent, too So there we are That is known on Wall Street as the Goldilocks economy, and that perception is exactly what is causing the stock market boom I remember Goldilocks from when I was a kid, but I have not read it to my kids I can cite Green Eggs and Ham by heart, which I will spare you, [laughter] but I cannot remember too much about Goldilocks except that there were three bears So, here are the three bears that I think are going to give us a little further irrational exuberance in 1997, and when we write the history of 1997, we will ask ourselves why we didn't realize it at the time  The first relates to the budget deal cited by Governor Rivlin I share her optimism that a deal will be reached, but I also have a substantial amount more cynicism than she was willing to express I think the core of the budget deal will be, as it is with most political deals, to make things sound a lot better than they are If we look at the Greenbook we note, for example, that the high employment budget deficit actually rises in the next year in spite of all the talk around town and during the campaign about record low deficits Basically FY97 is locked in So, we might think of 1997, at least from the point of view of perceptions, as the "all gain, no pain" year I also agree that there probably will be a Medicare deal, which will make us all feel better My suspicion is that the rhetoric will focus on a line that the President used, namely, that we will have extended the life of Medicare by 10 years Now, I actually chased this quotation down with some CEA staff when I was in Paris The President said it first in 1995 and the 10 years he had in mind were through 2005, which really is an extension of 4 years But since everyone will be signing on, everyone will be saying that we extended Medicare by 10 years The examples that you gave--a little squeeze on the reimbursement rates for doctors and a tad of means testing are not going to hurt anybody--will make it sound as if the Medicare problem has been put off for 10 years  Did not include means testing--so maybe its inclusion will get us to 11 or 12 years, but it still will not be that far into the future In addition, I think both OMB and CBO have become a little too optimistic with regard to tax receipts They discovered that the increased tax receipts were not from capital gains, which should make us all pause a little because that means that those gains are not being realized and are not in the spending stream boosting consumption right now Instead, the discovery was that the extra tax receipts were coming from higher small business receipts That was certainly true for 1994 and 1995 People who were downsized formed their own businesses and started paying the very high tax rates that small business people pay basically because their fringe benefits are not deductible But as our staff discovered, small business profit margins are now starting to be squeezed I think that the declaration that this tax gain is a permanent gain--because it is from small business and not from capital gains--will in retrospect prove to be false We will look back and find that, in fact, our deficits have been larger than either the Congress or the Administration now believe they will be For the short term, the news will be great We will  -29-    12/17/96  have a fiscal deal, but in fact, we will not have solved our budget problems The bond market will think that we have and will help fuel irrational exuberance  I think the second bit of fuel for irrational exuberance during 1997 is going to be the credit situation I noticed that today's Wall Street Journal was carrying a story that the next Congress was going to be considering bankruptcy reform I can think of few worse ideas, frankly First are the politics that are involved Here we have a group of bankers saying that Congress has to tighten up on bankruptcies, and on the other side we have bankrupt people, some of whom have sick children, some of whom were unemployed for very good reason, and some of whom have gone through divorces, although they do not generate enough sympathy to serve on the panel If we have to satisfy those two constituencies and we open up the bankruptcy laws, those laws will only get worse Unfortunately, the reason I think the exuberance will be irrational is that the lenders have now switched from saying that they were not making a mistake lending to these people because their models were so sophisticated to now saying the problem is that the bankruptcy laws are too easy If we actually ask lenders what they are doing, we find that they are turning around and making loans to people who just declared bankruptcy The easiest solution to this problem in my mind is for banks and other lenders just to say they will not lend to anyone who has declared bankruptcy within the past three years The lenders are not ready to do that Instead, they are going to push for new bankruptcy laws That will create the illusion that something is being done when that really is not the case So, I think we have probably another year to go on the excessive credit expansion  The third bear is going to be the dollar I think Ted Truman has underestimated how much the dollar is going to appreciate this year In both Japan and Europe, there is now one clear recipe for getting out of their mess That is export growth, and there is only one place to export to and that is the United States The way to increase exports quickly is to devalue The Japanese, I am told, decided that they were willing to let the yen go to 120 The Europeans are now deciding whether it is better to devalue before or after convergence I think in the end, they will go for it before That is going to be good news, and it is going to feed irrational exuberance in this country as well because it is going to keep inflation artificially low for a little while longer We are going to be able to continue to sustain demand in the context of downward price pressures on domestic producers because of relatively cheaper imports  All in all, I think there will be good news in 1997 on the fiscal front, the credit front, and the international front But in each case it is going to be creating bigger problems for us to solve down the road So, 1998 looks like the year in which irrational exuberance will meet its match  Don't wait a whole year  I support your recommendation I was just thinking about what Jerry Jordan said I like the line--I am sorry I forgot who said it--that nervous reactiveness may be the best we can hope for When we look at the loss function and the amount of uncertainty out there, I think prompt action when we first get a signal in this environment is a reasonable conclusion I would say that that is very much along the lines of an asymmetric directive I could imagine asymmetry going the other way as well; in fact, we were asymmetric going the other way through much of 1991 and 1992 So, I think it is the right recommendation and that it is consistent with the way President McDonough defined it   The Committee was given some colorful charts yesterday, but today I will be referring to the colorless charts entitled, "Material for Staff Presentation on Long-Run Ranges" 3/  The first page of your handout reproduces the table on page 11 of the Bluebook except for a revision to the M2 and M3 growth rates for 1997 in the first column The receipt of new data from the Investment Company Institute on the IRA component of retail money market mutual funds in the second and third quarters of last year has caused us to revise upward the annual growth rates for M2 and M3 by 03 percentage point each Thus, the revisions place M2 growth somewhat above the 5 percent upper bound of its range for last year and M3 growth even further above its 6 percent upper bound  The second column shows staff forecasts for money, credit, and nominal GDP this year Nominal GDP and M2 are both expected to grow at annual rates of 3-1/2 percent, which represents quite a slowdown for both measures The Committee's own central tendency for nominal GDP has a midpoint a bit above 4 percent, implying a somewhat faster rate of M2 growth than the staff foresees this year, assuming flat V2 The lower panel of the next chart, also revised from the Bluebook, puts the implied prediction of a flat V2 over 1998 in the perspective of the experience of recent years Despite the uptrend of V2 from mid-1994 to mid-1997, we expect the pattern of little velocity change that held late last year to persist through this year The steady funds rate assumed in the Greenbook forecast implies that the opportunity cost of M2 will change little We also believe that the sogginess of stock prices in the staff forecast will divert some inflows from stock mutual funds to M2 assets, with their stable principal, thereby short-circuiting any renewed updrift in V2 With that outcome, the behavior of V2 this year would parallel its performance during the three decades prior to the 1990s shown by the dots surrounding the regression line in the upper panel of this chart Over that period, the velocity of M2 was relatively stable unless the opportunity cost of holding M2 balances varied  Your next chart shows our forecast of a sharp decline in M3 velocity this year that follows from the staff's projection of 6-3/4 percent growth of M3 At more than a 3 percent annual rate of decline, the line this year is not only steeper than  3/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Lindsey are appended to the transcript (Appendix 3)    2/3-4/98  the nearly 1 percent trend rate of decline over the three decades prior to the 1990s but it is also steeper than the 2 percent average rate of contraction over the three prior years The staff foresees rapid M3 growth relative to that of nominal GDP this year, in part because businesses should continue to find the institution-only money fund component of M3 an attractive cash management tool More important, depository institutions will need appreciable M3-type funding to finance lending if they are to maintain their share of relatively rapid debt growth  Our projection is that the growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors, at 5-1/4 percent, also will exceed that of nominal GDP by a sizable margin Hence, projected debt velocity, as shown in the lower panel of this chart, falls this year at almost a 2 percent pace As may be seen in this panel, apart from the exceptional drop in debt velocity during the 1980s, this ratio has evinced little trend since the early 1960s The fall in debt velocity this year mostly reflects larger business borrowing necessitated by flagging corporate earnings and greater merger-related retirements of equity  Turning back to the table, three alternative sets of ranges are presented for Committee consideration Alternative I retains the provisional specifications that the Committee chose last July In recent years, the FOMC has not interpreted the ranges for broad money as suggestive of its expectations for growth over the year or two covered by the ranges Instead, because of continued heightened uncertainty about the demand for broad money, the Committee has interpreted the ranges as being consistent with the trend of money growth under conditions of price stability With true price stability, nominal GDP would grow at a rate of around 3 percent each year; that increase is composed of measured potential real growth of 2-1/2 percent and an upward bias in the GDP price index of a bit more than 1/2 percentage point If V2 were flat and V3 were to trend down by 1 percent as was the case in the three decades prior to the 1990s, then the midpoints of the provisional ranges of alternative I would match the expected growth of M2 and M3 under price stability  The FOMC has interpreted the 3 to 7 percent debt range of alternative I differently than the ranges for the monetary aggregates The Committee has intended the debt range to encompass the likely growth of debt over the year in question The actual growth rates of debt over the last three years, in fact, turned out fairly close to the 5 percent midpoint of this range This 5 percent midpoint, however, would be too high to characterize our expectation for trend debt growth under conditions of price stability As we have seen, debt velocity has tended to stay about constant, apart from its decline during the unusual decade of the 1980s Alternative III in the table adjusts the debt range down to 2 to 6 percent, matching  the provisional M3 range and in effect moving the rationale for the debt range closer to one consistent with trend debt growth over time under conditions of    2/3-4/98  price stability Under alternative II, all three ranges would be roughly consistent with price stability  Because the staff projects a step-up of debt growth from 4-1/2 percent last year to 5-1/4 percent this year, though, the Committee may not consider 1998 to be an auspicious year to harmonize the rationale for the debt range with that of both broad monetary aggregates If the Committee chooses to leave the debt range and its rationale unchanged at this meeting, it may wish to consider alternative II This alternative encompasses the expected growth this year of all three aggregates Thus, it makes the rationale for M3 more like the familiar one for debt in the  provisional ranges It raises the M3 range to 3 to 7 percent, so that the upper end is above the staff's projection of 6-3/4 percent M3 growth this year Of course, raising the M3 range even more, say to 4 to 8 percent, would come even closer to centering the range around expected M3 growth for this year But such a move would depart even further from the specified range for trend M3 growth consistent with price stability, making it even more wrenching in some future year to return to a price stability rationale for the M3 range  I should add in concluding that the staff remains somewhat uncertain about its projections of the broad money aggregates relative to nominal GDP M3, in particular, has shown itself to be subject to unpredictable surges or sluggishness in its non-M2 component This behavior has resulted from changes in bank reliance on large time deposits, which are included in M3, versus borrowing funds from foreign offices, which are outside M3 Even M2 velocity behavior may not have returned all the way to normal Specifically, the staff is still unsure whether any significant uptrend of V2 independent of the opportunity cost of holding M2 balances will resume in the years ahead as financial innovations or perceptions of attractive returns lead households to diversify further their savings away from M2 balances Any such uptrend is unlikely to be of the dimensions of the shift in the early 1990s, but the possibility of continued shifts in money holders' portfolio preferences makes projecting the future behavior of V2 still error prone  On balance, it has not; that's right  That is the open question It is true that we think the velocity of  M2 since mid-1994 has moved more closely to its behavior over the three decades prior  to the 1990s However, it also is true--and we sent the FOMC a memo to this effect--that  we can fit an equation with only M2 velocity, opportunity cost, and a time trend from  mid-1994 to mid-1997 that gives an annual growth trend of 1-1/4 percentage points We  certainly do not see that uptrend in the last part of 1997, as one can see from the chart, nor  do we foresee such an uptrend going forward because as I mentioned in my briefing, we  anticipate some weakening in stock prices in 1998 The latter should, as I said,  short-circuit some residual trend toward increasing velocity However, we are somewhat  unsure of what the future holds in store It is true that we have estimated a model over  this whole period that in the early 1990s has velocity change starting to move in a gradual  "S" pattern This model fits recent years better than any of our other models It suggests  that the residual uptrend of V2 in 1998 will be only about 02 percentage point, virtually  zero, and that it will move down to 01 percentage point in 1999 So, to the extent we  believe the "S" pattern indicates that the updrift in velocity is gradually coming to an end,  we would not anticipate much of an uptrend in velocity going forward Whether one can  believe that is, as I say, an open question Personally, I feel fairly uncertain about the  behavior of V2 going forward, but having said that, I certainly feel more secure than I did  as we went through the early 1990s and observed that extreme updrift  We have estimated a variety of M2+ and M3+ models in an  effort to capture the non-M2 or non-M3 components of those broader measures We have  had some success but not a perfect success One issue is that inflows to stock mutual  funds were negatively correlated with inflows to M2 until the last two years Inflows to  both M2 and stock mutual funds subsequently increased to fairly rapid rates, so they  became positively correlated It could be pointed out that spending also was strong,  tending to provide a third reason for that positive correlation I would not say we were  entirely successful in our efforts to construct models that capture well the behavior of  M2+ or M3+ I would be interested in Don Kohn's view of that, though  That, of course, is a matter that gets decided by this Committee  The historical precedent is that the ranges through 1987 were three percentage points  wide and the Committee raised them to four in 1988   Thank you, Mr Chairman The long-run simulations shown on Chart 2 following page 9 of the Bluebook provide one way of placing the Committee's short-run policy decision in a longer-term strategic perspective 4/ The solid lines show a baseline extension of the Greenbook forecast for ten more years, along which the economy makes a reasonably smooth transition to the steady state implied by the staff model  With the current nominal federal funds rate, shown in the upper left panel, held in place through the year 2000, real GDP growth--not shown--remains below the growth of its potential just long enough for the unemployment rate, in the middle panel, to return to the staff estimate of the NAIRU of 54 percent by late 2001 During the interim, inflation in the lower panel--as measured by the core PCE price index--gradually rises to a 2-1/4 percent pace, which is maintained thereafter During this time, the rise in inflation combined with the steady nominal federal funds rate causes the real funds rate, in the upper right panel, to edge lower A declining real federal funds rate is consistent with rising unemployment as the effects of  4/ A copy of the chart is appended to the transcript (Appendix 4)    6/30-7/1/98  the earlier increase in equity prices on consumption abate, as investment spending throttles back, and as the trade deficit continues to widen  Once inflation levels off in 2001, the process of declining real federal funds rates is continued through very gradual policy easings of the nominal federal funds rate The real funds rate stays on a gentle downward glide path toward the long-run equilibrium real interest rate of 2-1/2 percent embedded in the staff model  The dotted lines convey the effects of a tighter stance of monetary policy in the near term that is designed to achieve eventual price stability By the end of this simulation, inflation has been reduced to 3/4 percent, only a bit above the assumed remaining measurement bias To achieve this result, the nominal federal funds rate is raised to a little more than 6 percent by late this year, and is held there through the end of next year The boost to the real federal funds rate depresses real GDP growth enough to raise the unemployment rate to a bit above 6 percent in 2002 Thereafter, the unemployment rate can be gradually returned to the NAIRU  The Committee could view the baseline simulation as a successful strategy With 1/4 percentage point of the updrift in underlying inflation offset next year by the further methodological improvements assumed in the Greenbook, the measured core rate ends up no higher than the rate prevailing early last year If the Committee could accept this inflation outcome and also views the extended staff forecast as plausible in terms of a "best guess," it may be inclined to stand pat on policy for some time, as under alternative B, at least until the economic outlook starts to diverge from this baseline scenario  If the Committee were dissatisfied with the prospect of a reversal of some of the recent deceleration in prices, it might be inclined to tighten in the near future, perhaps at the current meeting The 25 basis point rise in the federal funds rate of alternative C in the Bluebook would be a halfway house along the road to the increase of around 50 basis points that characterizes the tighter strategy  Of course, both simulations could be viewed as based on an overly sanguine set of longer-run structural relationships and temporary factors A particularly obvious risk that would add weight to the case for a policy tightening is that the staff has underestimated likely inflation pressures The recent upside surprise to CPI and PPI inflation, despite softer than expected oil and non-oil import prices, may be an early warning that the staff has gone too far in lowering its estimate of the NAIRU and in raising its estimates of the growth in trend productivity and potential output As for the actual unemployment rate, the lower than predicted May report confirmed a 4-1/4 percent jumping-off point, well below any plausible    6/30-7/1/98  estimate of the NAIRU And the unemployment rate would stay lower than in the baseline if the downshifting of spending to a sustained sub-par pace, which the staff considers to be now in train, does not in fact eventuate After all, financial conditions remain accommodative and stock prices have shown remarkable resilience to adverse earnings reports  In case the Committee foresees either a higher NAIRU or stronger aggregate demand, it might anticipate that a funds rate path something like the one in the tighter strategy would be necessary over time just to produce the resource pressures and inflation outcomes of the baseline Tracing out the assumed path for the funds rate in the tighter strategy would require starting to tighten policy fairly soon, if not at the current meeting If the Committee saw a higher funds rate as being necessary in the not-too-distant future, then the longer tightening action were delayed, the more aggressive would the subsequent tightening have to be Indeed, based on this policy outlook, a tightening at this meeting could be defended as the best way to minimize the harm done to emerging market economies in Asia and elsewhere; by keeping domestic inflation relatively low, such a move today would limit the extent of future interest rate increases  The Committee instead may view the recent deteriorating situation in Asia as posing a serious enough downside risk to the US economic outlook to counsel against any monetary policy firming for some time If anything, this risk to the outlook has become more prominent over the intermeeting period, as the lower tail of the probability distribution for Asian developments and possible contagion to non-Asian emerging market economies seems to have gotten fatter of late To be sure, the staff has made significant adjustments to its baseline forecast in reaction to the recent disappointing news, as Peter Hooper noted But the Committee still may be more apprehensive than before about unanticipated adverse impacts on the performance of the US trade sector, which would directly damp aggregate demand, resource utilization, and inflation pressures in this country As Peter's more pessimistic Asia scenario also noted, worse than expected Asian developments could well be accompanied by continued dollar appreciation and by extended further declines in commodity and other import prices, which would further damp US inflation pressures And these downside risks to developments abroad and in the United States would only be heightened by a tightening in US monetary policy at this meeting  In particular, an increase in the federal funds rate today would catch market participants unawares and probably induce a backup of US interest rates across the maturity spectrum Such a rate increase would be enlarged to the extent the policy tightening were perceived to reflect a Federal Reserve judgment that inflationary pressures are stronger than previously recognized, hence raising the odds of further tightening actions down the road While the inflation premium in interest rates might rise, real interest    6/30-7/1/98  rates would increase as well, and the rise in real rates would make US debt instruments more attractive relative to those abroad, thereby tending to strengthen the exchange value of the dollar The associated decline in the value of the yen and other Asian currencies might be especially troubling to the authorities of China and Hong Kong, whose currencies are fixed relative to the dollar, and contribute to further instability in the Asian region  Given the relative likelihood of the main risks in the domestic and foreign outlook, together with the relative costs to the United States if they occur, the Committee may conclude that standing pat continues to make sense If so, the Committee would be balancing the not unlikely probability of a somewhat worse inflation outcome than in the Greenbook against the smaller, but growing and perhaps more damaging, possibility of a meltdown in Asia The Committee's previous decisions to await more information to clarify macroeconomic trends both here and abroad seem to have paid off to date The Committee may not yet see any compelling new consideration that would induce it to change  As for the choice of the tilt to the directive, the enlarged risk of more surprising bad news from Asia may be seen as warranting a return to an unbiased directive Alternatively, the Committee may prefer to maintain the tilt toward tightening on the grounds that the threat of faster inflation also has intensified considering the recent stronger than expected incoming data on consumer prices and employment   Mr Chairman, beginning on page 15 in the Bluebook for today's  meeting, we list three options for Committee consideration Option 1 is the traditional language  Option 2, which was included in a memorandum that I wrote to the Committee in early  November, reflects the revisions that President Hoenig suggested at the September meeting  There are optional inclusions of some "furthers" in options 2 and 3 that the Committee may    11/17/98  wish to consider The purpose of the latter is to pick up the possibility that after the Committee  has moved at a meeting, it may wish to reflect that fact in the wording of the tilt sentence I have  indicated in the note on page 16 of the Bluebook how some presidents and one Board member  have reacted to the proposed addition of a sentence in Option 2 concerning potential adjustments  to policy during an intermeeting period I think I should turn the discussion of Option 3 over to  President Minehan, since it is her proposal  We actually were using monetary growth numbers in that sentence  earlier When the Committee downgraded the monetary aggregates further in 1993, we changed  the wording of that sentence to eliminate the numbers and include a qualitative description Our  intent always has been to provide a qualitative description that exactly describes the staff forecast    11/17/98  over coming months--not always over the next month or two but, for example, over the 6-month  horizon that is currently in the Bluebook Unfortunately, as 1998 has progressed we have been  hit with continuing upside surprises in relation to our forecast So, we have been somewhat  embarrassed by not having the slowdown that we predicted  In recent memory, which includes the last couple of years, we have  altered the wording in that sentence to say "consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 in  coming months" when we thought such growth would continue to be moderate While actual  monetary growth has been strong this year, we have had a persistent staff forecast of moderation  in the future So, the wording of that sentence this year has continuously reflected our staff  forecast of moderating growth  Exactly It is not locked in It just happens to describe the staff  forecast over coming months  When it has been appropriate in terms of our forecast, we have said  "moderate"  That's a good point At meetings in the future, the Committee could  choose what the exact wording will be The Committee may want to do that henceforth  We were actually prompted by a question from Governor Gramlich a  couple of months ago to look intensively into this question We have considerably improved our  estimation procedures, including our seasonal adjustment procedures We have come up now  with a series that we find to be the best estimate we can produce What that shows is that  whereas in recent years there has been an effect of a little less than 1/2 percent on the growth of  M2 coming from demand abroad, that seems to have lessened some most recently Let me give  you some figures to suggest what I'm talking about In September and October, our estimate is  that foreign holdings of US currency grew at 138 percent and 85 percent respectively That  implied, however, growth of domestically held US currency in September and October at even  faster rates, 18-3/4 and 12-3/4 percent respectively When we contrast the growth of M2 with the  inclusion and the exclusion of foreign currency holdings, it turns out not to make too much of a  difference in those recent months For example, M2 as we normally calculate it, including the  foreign currency holdings, grew at a 148 percent rate in September Without the foreign  currency holdings, we have estimated the growth to be 149 percent In October, the two  numbers are 123 percent and 126 percent respectively So, on balance in recent months and    11/17/98  recent quarters, it doesn't make a material difference whether we look at our overall estimate of  M2 or our estimate of M2 stripping out the foreign currency holdings  Yes, there is no question about it Everything you have described is  quite accurate For example, look at the chart of M2 velocity versus its opportunity cost--in  honor of Bill Dewald I will mention a piece he has published using opportunity cost defined as  the bond rate less the own rate on M2; Board staff tend to look at the three-month Treasury bill  rate less the own rate on M2 With either chart, you will see an upswing in velocity that  occurred in the early 1990s extending through mid-1997 Then velocity started coming back    11/17/98  down, and since mid-1997 it has fallen every quarter Depending on where the opportunity cost  line is placed and if the velocity shift is deemed to have ended around 1993, then velocity is  shown as returning to that opportunity cost line One interpretation, particularly if one chooses a  scale that shows the cluster of points to be fairly narrow, as Bill Dewald did, is that velocity is  more or less returning to normal Another interpretation, on which I personally tend to put more  weight, is that we saw a continued increase in velocity after 1993 that was somewhat  inexplicable Now we have seen a reversion to declines in velocity, which also are not  completely understandable Indeed, for this quarter, if we take the Greenbook forecast of  nominal GDP along with the money forecast, which we do our best with but as I indicated before  is not always perfect, we get a velocity decline of 87 percent In other words, much of the  liquidity that you have been describing seems to be showing up in the ratio of M2 to GDP rather  than in GDP either currently or in a predicted sense, at least if one believes the Greenbook  forecast We have some explanations We can always come up with them after the fact But the  truth is, as I mentioned to someone yesterday, I sat in that seat in February of this year telling the  Committee that it could expect M2 growth of 31/2 percent this year, given the Greenbook  forecast We now have a forecast of 9 percent growth in M2, a slight error in our February  projection [Laughter] The Greenbook forecast admittedly underestimated the strength of  spending this year and maybe there was a signal from the monetary aggregates to that effect But  there was a lot more to it than that Velocity took up a great deal of that error  Thank you, Mr Chairman The Committees's choice today would seem to boil down to standing pat or easing by another 25 basis points The Committee's last two easing actions were of a preemptive nature, taken to ward off undesirable economic weakness prospectively, as opposed to being based on softer economic data already in hand The economic data received since the last FOMC meeting, while somewhat mixed, would not necessarily alter that perspective That is, they continue to paint a picture of satisfactory real growth looking backward, turning into a significant slowing in the future The inflation outlook is little changed In    11/17/98  the staff forecast, credit market stresses gradually unwind further in coming quarters, but conditions do not return to their earlier lax state, while stock prices move back down, damping spending Financial problems are not predicted to intensify in Latin America  Because resources gradually return to a more sustainable utilization rate while the rise in inflation is limited, the Committee could well find the staff forecast to be an acceptable outcome The Committee also could consider the forecast to be plausible as a point estimate Ironically, the staff forecast can be read as providing support for either standing pat or for easing slightly at this meeting The Greenbook forecast assumes one more quarter point of policy ease later this year Easing now simply would move forward the staff's assumed action by a little more than a month, while standing pat to await further information on the impact of previous policy easings could still accord with deferring an easing until the next meeting as assumed in the staff forecast Of course, these two courses of action would presumably have basically indistinguishable macroeconomic effects, assuming no disproportionate differential impact on financial markets For that matter, the outlook presumably would not be altered greatly if there were no further quarter point easing at all, again absent an unusually adverse financial market reaction Instead, the Committee's decision today would seem to hinge, as many have pointed out already, on its assessment of where the forecast could go wrong--that is, on where the most important risks to the forecast may reside  In the present circumstances, several areas of possible downside surprises come to mind, and they could provide a rationale for the quarter point easing of alternative A Despite the support package put together for Brazil, that country, as well as others in Latin America, could be further affected by financial contagion, as Karen has noted Closer to home, potentially sizable further losses could be felt by key banks and other players in our financial markets Also, the projected decline in corporate profits could foster a greater stock market correction than the staff has built into its forecasts of consumption and investment spending  The still tender state of other securities markets means that the reversal of extreme risk aversion since the mid-October policy easing is still incomplete and somewhat tentative This condition has raised the concern in some market circles that a decision not to ease today could be enough of a disappointment to market participants to spark a short-circuiting of the recovery in risk spreads and trading conditions This concern has lost some force with the recent scaling back of expectations of Fed easing The probability of easing at this meeting built into fed funds futures quotes has receded from more than two-thirds two weeks ago to somewhat better than even odds as of yesterday, in part because financial market stresses have    11/17/98  continued to unwind on balance Even so, as the Bluebook discussion suggested, not easing today probably would induce some immediate widening of risk spreads, as private rates back up more than rates on Treasuries, especially those "on the run" Some increase in liquidity premiums, and shrinkage in trading volumes, also could be expected to occur right away But on the assumption that markets still will perceive the Federal Reserve as closely monitoring financial developments and prepared to ease again if necessary to head off any reversion to extremely unsettled conditions, the adverse market reaction is likely to be essentially limited in scope and duration  Another, perhaps related, concern that might add support to alternative A has to do with the likelihood of unusually severe year-end financing pressures, especially for borrowing institutions not viewed as being of top-notch credit quality Already some commercial banks have reported restricting their interbank lending to certain domestic institutions and to Japanese and, to a lesser extent, European counterparties generally As Peter noted, banks also have tended to shorten the maturity of their interbank loans to overnight In the commercial paper market, contracts extending over the turn of the year now embody a substantial interest rate premium Although a policy easing may not appreciably affect the extent of year-end-related increases in rates on loans and securities in the money market, at a minimum it would lower the base interest rate levels on which those pressures would operate, muting some of the adverse effects on credit costs for affected parties  A phenomenon likely to be longer lasting is the firming of conditions on bank loans to nonfinancial borrowers A large share of commercial bank respondents to the November Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported tightening standards and terms for C&I loans to large- and middle-market businesses and for commercial real estate loans Evidence also surfaced in that survey of some, though less pronounced, firming of standards and terms for small businesses And large commercial banks on balance have seen an appreciable rise in their costs of funds in capital markets The staff does not foresee much further deterioration of credit availability through banks, but the Committee may consider this possibility as a nontrivial risk to the economic outlook Certainly, the episode of the early 1990s vividly demonstrated that a credit crunch can involve the banking sector and that aggressive easing can be a necessary monetary policy response However, I think some important differences between that earlier episode and the present situation suggest that this credit influence could easily be overstated in today's context Banks then were partly motivated to restrict their lending by impaired capital positions that needed rebuilding Today, banks are generally much better capitalized Then, actual loan growth was quite sluggish, while today it has been rapid And, finally, then the growth of the    11/17/98  broad monetary aggregates was anemic Now, although admittedly the velocity of M2 has been dropping since mid-1997, the quite rapid growth of this aggregate, especially of late, is at least worth a passing mention  The strong growth of the monetary aggregates, including M3, may be suggestive of upside risks more broadly to the staff forecast, emphasis on which would enhance the attractiveness of alternative B Even with an unchanged funds rate, financing conditions may normalize more promptly than in the staff forecast Moreover, the possibility that a policy easing could spur a further run-up of equity prices--in contrast to the Greenbook forecast of a decline--that could combine with the recent rebound in consumer confidence to impart added impetus to spending, may strengthen the case for staying the Fed's hand at this meeting Also, in light of the support package for Brazil and the recent narrowing of Brady spreads, the global financial crisis may mend more rapidly than we can reasonably assume now For these and other reasons, the extent of the output slowdown that is predicted by the staff is not a foregone conclusion Finally, the stronger-than-expected third-quarter employment cost index against the backdrop of still tight labor markets may be viewed as highlighting the risk of higher inflation If the Committee places much weight on these considerations, it may wish to adopt a "wait-and-see" posture--standing pat until more actual evidence of a slowing economy shows itself  But given the staff's prediction that such a slowdown is impending, if the Committee chooses not to act today, it may still wish to maintain an asymmetric tilt toward ease The Committee also may want to keep the tilt toward ease if it does decide to ease Alternatively, it may judge that a prompt further easing would bring the risks to the economic outlook into balance If so, the Committee may decide not to go on record as suggesting that further decreases in the funds rate are an especially likely prospect  Mr Chairman, that concludes my briefing  No, I would stick with the language we have been using, "some  moderation" That is the staff forecast for coming months    As indicated in the Bluebook, the issue today  would appear to be not whether to continue to tighten monetary policy at  this meeting but rather by how much  At the March meeting, the  Committee contemplated future firming, and its public statement  conveyed its sense that the balance of risks was pointed toward higher  inflation  Incoming data since that time have on balance strengthened the  impression of inflation risks  The most obvious contenders for policy  action today are increases of either 25 or 50 basis points     As Mike indicated, core inflation picks up further next year in the   staff forecast  That forecast essentially is consistent with continued  gradual increases in the funds rate target this year  For example, increases  of 25 basis points at this and each of the next four FOMC meetings,  followed by a constant 7-1/4 percent funds rate through next year, would  comport reasonably well with the policy assumption in the Greenbook   By our reading of term premiums, the 7-1/4 percent funds rate next year  would also be somewhat higher than the expected peak for that rate that  appears to be currently built into financial asset prices  The projected  result of these financial conditions would be a core PCE inflation over  next year of 24 percent, after an expected 22 percent over this year   Because labor markets would still be experiencing an unsustainable degree  of pressure late next year, the process of underlying price acceleration  would persist beyond that time         77  The case for the 25 basis point move at today’s meeting could rest  on the judgment that extending the previous series of quarter point moves  today, and perhaps continuing that pace at later meetings, would have a  reasonable chance of keeping core inflation contained, in contrast to the  staff view     A supporter of another gradual move might believe that the staff has   overestimated the ongoing strength of aggregate demand  In this view, as  a result of the recent greater stringency in credit markets and weaker  behavior of the stock market, economic growth may already be poised to  slow appreciably, perhaps by enough to match the expansion of potential  supply       Support for a 25 basis point move also might derive from the view   that the growth of potential supply itself probably will continue to pick up  next year, as structural productivity accelerates further  Another step-up  in trend productivity growth could temporarily hold down unit labor costs  even if wage gains are trending higher in response to taut labor markets   Other things equal, real private interest rates eventually would have to  reach still higher levels at some point, but the need to get there is not  urgent, given this near-term depressant to inflation  And, of course,  continuing even a gradual pace of tightening for an extended period would  eventually produce large increases in nominal short-term interest rates,  and in real short-term interest rates as well unless inflation expectations  rise appreciably     The Committee could also want added evidence on the level of   resource use that will provoke price acceleration  The staff may have  overestimated the extent to which the economy in the longer run is  inflation-prone  Especially if the long-run NAIRU is substantially lower  than the staff has estimated, continued gradualism may not be likely to  allow a continuing, underlying acceleration of prices  From a long-term  perspective, the surprisingly favorable inflation and output performance of  the US economy over the second half of the 1990s understandably has  fostered a greater sense of uncertainty about economic relationships  This  observation might well be interpreted as providing support for staying  with the gradual policy approach used by the Committee to date  Also,  this year’s generally stronger-than-expected data on real GDP,  employment, and inflation could be perceived as more noise than signal   But this result rests on a number of demand and supply forces evolving  favorably over coming months      A less optimistic view of the probable balance of supply and   demand--for example, as seen in the staff forecast--would support  adopting the 50 basis point option today  The Committee may be  particularly concerned about the potential for accelerating prices under      78  continued gradualism  A 50 basis point move could be motivated by the  view that the more restrictive financial conditions associated with  adopting the aggressive policy approach, at least at this meeting, would  offer a better chance of containing inflation, while still not seriously  risking an excessive degree of firming  The more aggressive strategy  would lessen the potential for policy being “too little, too late” and for  allowing a significant increase in inflation that would be hard to reverse   In this view, the perceived expectation in a statistical sense of the costs of  an inflationary outcome--that is, the probability of it occurring times the  welfare cost if it does--would be high enough to outweigh the smaller  perceived expectation of the costs of a tighter-than-needed policy inducing  unwanted economic weakness     The arguments for a 50 basis point move today might seem even   more compelling to the extent that the Committee was persuaded by the  discussion in the “Alternative Simulations” section of Part I of the  Greenbook, based on the FRB/US model, which Mike also alluded to   That section suggested that next year’s acceleration of core prices can only  be short-circuited by a substantial steepening of the trajectory of policy  tightening  For example, if the FOMC were to raise the funds rate in four  steps of 50 basis points each this year--and were to keep the resulting 8  percent level constant through next year--then in the simulation core PCE  inflation would be held to a little above 2 percent in both years  This  extent of policy tightening would succeed in capping core inflation in part  through its effects on the dollar and on longer-term inflation expectations   In addition, the slowdown of real GDP growth to only 3-1/4 percent next  year would raise unemployment to a 4-1/4 percent rate by the fourth  quarter  Labor markets would be on a path to reach sustainable conditions  later on     The Committee’s choice of the balance of risk statement with a 50   basis point move would be somewhat less clear-cut than with a 25 basis  point move  In the latter case, a continued tilt toward inflation would  seem to be the obvious choice  But as I just indicated, even with a 50  basis point rate hike, the staff believes that further substantial funds rate  increases would be needed to prevent inflationary pressures from  emerging  Thus, even with a half point action today, in our view inflation  risks would still dominate  The Committee may agree with this judgment,  although you no doubt depart in various ways from the point estimates of  the Greenbook’s projections  If the Committee instead believes that the  sizable 50 basis point move has an excellent chance of balancing the risks,  it should indicate that  The new language does not reference the future  course of policy, so if the Committee still suspects that the risks are  unbalanced but wants to pause for a while to weigh the effects of  accelerated tightening, it would need to indicate this intent in a separate  sentence in the announcement         79    The current funds market futures quote for May of 623 percent   implies that the odds that market participants put on a 1/2 percentage point  move today have moved somewhat below yesterday’s odds of about two- thirds  Anecdotal reports suggest that they also expect the FOMC  statement to maintain a sense of unbalanced risks toward inflation  Thus,  the rate move part of this combination might be enough of a surprise to  raise interest rates a little across the maturity spectrum  Combining a 1/2  point hike with a balanced statement about the risks would represent two  surprises in offsetting directions  And the difficulty of predicting the  reaction of puzzled market participants makes the direction of the  immediate interest rate adjustments uncertain, although the change in  market rates would probably be muted     Thank you  That concludes my prepared remarks      I have the May figure; I do not have the June figure  Does   someone have that?    The May figure as of about 11 o'clock this morning was 6225 for   the futures rate    Let me give you yesterday's  We had 623 for May, although that   was rounded    We have 6225 now  A significant change that also affects the   calculation of odds is not just this futures rate but, believe it or not, today's spot rate  That rate   is 64375, or 6-7/16 percent  So those are the two relevant new pieces of information that we   got today that affect these odds      80   I’m not sure that the sentence on the balance of risks refers to the   month ahead or even the next few months    Exactly  In the case you cited, that really is an issue the   Committee would have to confront  That is, the Committee may expect inflation rates for the   next three months to continue on the high side at least, though maybe not rising, and then ebb   down  The question the Committee would then face is what to indicate with respect to the   balance of risks  If I were a member of the Committee, I guess I would tend to say that the   risks would be balanced  So, even if I thought we might have some disappointing readings for   a few months, I would be tempted to look even further ahead into the foreseeable future,   which is longer than three months, and make a statement that the risks were generally   balanced  But I admit it would be a temptation not to say that      81   I may actually wish to turn to other members of the Committee to   answer that!  [Laughter]    If I could just interject to answer the Chairman's earlier question, the   June federal funds futures rate fell a basis point today  It is now at 6475
