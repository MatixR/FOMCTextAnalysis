 That hasn't been a factor during this most recent period, in part because so many people in the market are trying to put together estimates about how reserves are going to behave--very much the same way we are Data on reserves are released with a lag, but it's a relatively brief lag, so people are able to speculate as to what factors are influencing reserve behavior That brief lag may cause people to wonder momentarily in a transition period about the impact on the funds rate But I think over just a relatively short length of time they've been able to perceive that For example, in the recent period, people have been watching the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and have seen a rise in other assets and have concluded from that rise that while there are many components in it, the foreign exchange component has probably been a fairly large one; and therefore, our needs to add reserves going forward would be smaller than they had thought heretofore So it seems as though it has worked out in this past period Any sort of disturbance on the funds market has been fairly brief   I think it was only temporary   One other part of that--whenever there is central bank intervention, the financial markets have been quite    8/16/88  sensitive to listen to that Each morning one hears what the rumors are as to whether central banks are in or not in, so that when they take a look at what they think might be affecting reserves, that would be one thing they tuck in the back of their minds to some degree   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Initially this morning, when the trade numbers first came out, the long bond was down about a point It seemed that for a brief juncture it would be holding, and I don't know whether it changed further since   Well, I think, during part of the period there was an effort to let the market know that if expectations had carried the rate beyond what the Committee had voted, that seemed to be a way of letting them know that The reason, of course, was that these expectations could become embedded; and we were trying to signal that they were really moving faster than the Committee had instructed The longer those things persist, the more people begin to feel that--if these expectations really get imbedded in the structure of rates--when the Committee meets again, we may have taken the decisions from it So we felt it necessary to give a signal when rates seemed to be ratcheting higher That was particularly true when funds seemed to be getting sticky at the 7/8ths level   Right Well, we got the borrowings   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]    7/5-6/89   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, in the six weeks since you met last, it has been the case that market forces have shown through by the time the maintenance period has come to an end So, we ended up with federal funds either being quite comfortable on the settlement day or quite tight on the settlement day Some of that has been reflected in banks' behavior, based on their expectations of what the funds rate was going to be In the first couple of periods they were quite convinced it was going to be a soft settlement day, and so it was As we got into the June 13th period they were so sure it was going to be comfortable that they waited until the very end even though there was a real need for reserves Some market [participants] chance this; they put off [action] until there is no more room    7/2-3/90   Presumably having a nice time! Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   They are looking at an array of options I believe their thinking at this point is not to try to change the whole    7/2-3/91  structure, because it's a process that has worked very well, but to make some adjustments around the margin It's possible that if they do decide to make a change, they would probably want to make that change known before we get into the August refunding and conceivably even before the next round of two- and five-year note sales   Yes, some people feel that the move up to 8-5/8 percent or toward that level--it didn't really stay there--was reflecting an awful lot all at once And, therefore, the yield has come back to the 8-1/2 percent trading range and it is sort of being held in that range because the views on both sides in terms of the [likely] extent of this recovery seem to be somewhat offsetting There is a concern that even if the rate of inflation does come down, as analysts say they think it will, there are going to be sufficient pressures elsewhere in the long run that may keep that particular part of the yield curve from moving down much more In that connection they keep looking at the yield environment in Germany and other countries and feel that it just may be a factor inhibiting any possible downward move in long rates even if inflation comes in better, as they think it will   Well, there have been a lot of reports about demands for credit abroad I think right now, as far as people can see, the major source of credit demand is in the US government and perhaps the state and local entities What the corporate issuers are doing isn't being seen as an important part of the demand for credit but as restructuring their own balance sheets   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Even though they didn't want to have to do that!   It's one of the foibles of having a federal funds rate objective that gets narrower and narrower That did happen on a couple of occasions and we didn't want to have to drain the reserves if we could avoid it So, the fact that the perception out there was that at certain rate levels and at certain times we didn't have a tolerance [for actions] that would cause people to bid the rate up is part of what one has to call the "market dynamics"   Well, we have a little more flexibility on one side of the rate depending on the state of market expectations There isn't anyone out there who expects that the Committee is going to be firming policy, so there's more tolerance for a funds rate that deviates to the high side of the expected level than there would be for a funds rate that deviates to the low side So, actually, we have throughout this period felt somewhat more comfortable with having our operations be a little loose on the up side--that is, letting funds trade at higher levels without necessarily going in and offsetting it Whereas on the low side we wouldn't feel as comfortable because if there were any direction to policy in this period, that's the way the market thinking has been  MRJORDAN That asymmetry, though, is due to market perceptions that we are conditioned by real magnitudes; they think we're responding to things we can't control anyway But the follow-up question is this Over this last week the market tried to [interpret] that failure to cut the funds rate, in a reserve supplying sense, as a relative tightening of policy From the Desk perspective, would you view it as tighter?   The market has built in a good amount of the 25 basis points    6/30-7/1/92   In fed funds terms, the market--   No, I don't think so   But the market does   We may have to drain   You're right that there has been a better tone underlying the long end of the market And the barrier, which seemed to be 8 percent for the longest period of time, now seems to be 7-3/4 percent The long rate doesn't seem to be able to get through that barrier; it has been at about the 780 percent level, which is where it was at the time of the last meeting also So, there hasn't been too much net change over the full intermeeting period, even with the decline--    6/30-7/1/92   Yes, and then it came back down   It's hard to say The fact that the recovery doesn't look robust certainly has been a factor in any improvement in the long end of the market But in discussing what the long end will do [in response to] Fed policy, it usually turns on whether or not the long rate is going to back up, not so much whether there's a chance for sustained improvement Most people in the market don't [consider it likely] that there is room for a sustained improvement in the long end for quite a while There's at least a sense that people have to wait to see whether or not this improvement in prices is sustained, and there's a lot of skepticism about that Some people don't think the progress has been all that it should have been And then we have these deficits The market also frequently makes reference to the global demands for capital Finally, our own statements may not be adequate, and there are all these political uncertainties So, people don't seem to have a lot of high hopes for the long end of the market doing a lot better It's really a question of [rates] moving back up if the Fed were to ease   Right   Right, and I do think the fact that the recovery doesn't look like it's rolling ahead has been a help for the long end   Thank you, Mr Chairman; thank you, Bill [Statement--see Appendix]   This morning?   The early read we got was that a technical adjustment had been taking place in the market yesterday afternoon as the stock market recovered from its lows And with the world stock market this morning also tending to recover from the lows seen yesterday, there is just what one would call normal, technical position adjustments taking place There didn't seem to be anything more fundamental than that at work   We were somewhat surprised The quarter had finished on a firm note We really thought that we had put in [enough] reserves and made an allowance for even higher-than-normal excess reserves for the quarter-end, but we had a very large miss Therefore, the next morning, which was the beginning of this maintenance period, the funds market started out on the firm side; and sometimes that carries over But I have to say we were surprised by the carryover firmness because it was the first day of the maintenance period and the banks had the whole remainder [of the period to adjust] and it was also prior to the time when there were widespread expectations that the Fed would be cutting the rate So, we're having a very difficult time trying to understand why people would pay these higher rates so early on The rates aren't consistent with the reserve numbers either Reserves don't show [a need for us] to put in that volume of reserves So, we've been surprised by it The market hasn't been as surprised because they think the need is bigger than we are saying This is one of those periods where right after the quarter-end the Treasury balances plummet because they have to pay out these social security [checks] And the market, even though it knows that, thinks the need is bigger So, the market hasn't been as surprised about the firmness of the funds rate as we have been The firmness that we're hearing about is coming more or less from regional sources, and we just don't have a satisfactory explanation for it   The fact that the funds rate hasn't behaved quite the way it should has been largely ignored by the market thus far It is seen as something that's technically driven at this point   I guess I could answer that in two ways They look at those kinds of aggregates broadly in terms of their impact on policy, but I think they see that impact as being somewhat removed They look more closely at their estimates of reserve requirements as an operating factor that we have to contend with And I think that's as close as their focus would go on that   Well, the market looks at what it thinks the Federal Reserve acts on; they feel reasonably confident that that is the thing to do They don't see the monetary aggregates as being the driving force to policy right now They find it very difficult to read what the aggregates are saying, and everything they read says the Committee does too So, they don't tend to look at them that closely   They don't ignore the money numbers by any stretch of the imagination; they do look at them Some people are commenting a lot about the rapid growth of M1 being a harbinger of trouble, but others aren't Some say one can't look at that because the Fed is looking at the broader aggregates Nobody understands fully or positively what is going on here If they thought we were going to be acting on it or if they thought we should be because the growth rates are out of historical experience, then they would respond to it   Right   Right   I don't know what that means! [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   It's worth noting that Jerry Powell told everyone yesterday that as an outgoing Treasury official for debt management he would advise the transition team not to make that change   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think it's what the future reductions in the deficit portend going forward rather than the reductions themselves But, as you know, the general likelihood of an economy that performs reasonably well with low prices is probably more the key point than, say, overseas rate cuts would be in the markets going forward   Yes   I guess it [depends on] the point from which they're all starting Some of the people in the market are looking at the near-term weakness as being somewhat mitigated by the drop in interest rates that has occurred already So, if expectations before all this [centered on] worry that the economy's recovery was going to produce growth rates in the 4 percent plus range early on, which reflected some of the estimates toward the end of last year, those estimates are being scaled down to something that's--   I do get some sense that there is or has been-- and maybe it's taking a long time--some underlying shift in expectations about future price performance than had been the case before I think that has been ratcheting down   Yes   One thing that has been interesting on a day-to- day basis in the market is that there has been [less] day-to-day volatility by a fair amount And sometimes people are at a loss to    3/23/93  explain the movements in prices on any given day to the next Many of the dealers in the market are not expecting to see this kind of movement take place and are constantly expecting to see it give back its ground That's why I mentioned the climate being a little skittish Not everyone was a believer in the full degree of the rally   Oddly enough, at this juncture I think the information that the market expects on the real side is favorable inflation on prices People generally have tended to feel that while the reports for January and February were sobering, they were really not indicative of the trend in prices They believe that there is slack, particularly on the labor side, that is going to keep inflation reasonably well contained, even if it's not on a downward trend, and that the employment report perhaps overstated things They think the recovery is here and will continue, but the sense of where it's vulnerable is in [the process of] going through the Congressional passage of the budget [There are concerns] that some compromises are going to be made to get the package through and that some of these compromises are going to mean the death knell for the intent of the package, if you will, and that we're going to end up with perhaps half a loaf   That's how we got the 302 percent fed funds rate!   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Thank you, Mr Chairman I hope you can hear me down at that end also [Statement--see Appendix]   A predisposition  -32-    8/17/93   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the interest of time I'm going to dispense with some incredibly interesting statistics on the Treasury's fund-raising operations in the market over the intermeeting period and the reception of the refunding and composition of the debt unless someone has questions about it [Secretary's note Statement in its entirety is shown in the Appendix]  I'd just conclude, Mr Chairman, with a request for a temporary increase in the intermeeting leeway from $8 billion to $11 billion As I noted earlier, upcoming reserve needs at this juncture are expected to be sufficiently large and persistent as to warrant a cushion beyond the normal limit   [Statement--see Appendix]   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   For the entire period that begins today--which is the first day of the maintenance period--both the New York and Board staffs estimate a need to add something under $1 billion for the full period The distribution of those reserves in the first couple days of the period is such that today is sort of straddling "flat" if you will Tomorrow is flat to a modest deficiency, although I have to say there's some difference of opinion about the estimates of the Treasury balance, and that difference of opinion is $3 billion between us and the Treasury If we are right, there will be a modest deficiency tomorrow; and if the Treasury is right, there will be a more considerable surplus   In the market it will depend on where the federal funds rate is I guess people will assume that if the funds rate were firm we would signal something through inaction--by not providing reserves However, I think most of them feel that our preference would be to signal something through an assertive action and therefore a funds rate anywhere in the range of 3 or 3-1/8 percent would evoke a draining action on our part I think that is how people would see something like that conveyed We are coming off a period where there has been some uncertainty in the reserve numbers About a week or two ago, the market might even have viewed this maintenance period that we are going into today as a drain period But given all the variabilities, they might see this as what I would call a modest add So, for us to drain reserves within the right federal funds context would get the message across, presuming funds are trading at the appropriate level for us to do that   I think that's correct as far as the technical condition of the money market in terms of getting the right constellation of rates Yes, I think that's correct   Well, it certainly would remove any ambiguity about the move [Laughter] People don't have to guess about the size of the move and that kind of thing; I guess if there's a pro, that's the positive outcome In terms of setting a precedent, I think it very much depends on the wording that's used   I think that it can't be harmful   No, it tells everybody what's happening and it leaves no room for ambiguity, and if it's phrased the way you are suggesting, it's not setting a stage for people to have expectations of an announcement every time there is a policy change going forward   Yes   It's very risky sometimes to try to time things down to the wire and hope that people pick up the press releases   Initially, the market moved up by almost a point at the long end--at the 30-year mark--as the headline news on the nonfarm number came across the wire There has been some backing away from that The market is still up; it was up about 3/8 to 1/2 when we came in here It may be that market participants are trying to read through some of the underlying data in terms of hours and so forth So, it's lost some of its initial gain, but it is still up   When the market was anticipating the move, I think most of the expectations were for 25 basis points Some of that got built into the rate structure yesterday; I think by the time the day was over about 80 percent reflected that a 1/4 point move might occur today This morning's numbers on the January employment situation may have moved some of that pricing back out of the market So, certainly a move of 50 basis points would have to be reflected in the market Since 25 basis points is not fully in there now, the next 25 basis points would clearly result in some rate back up; rates would have to adjust much more than they have   [Statement--see Appendix]   It's over   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think that what really is at stake is that while we have announced the changes that we have made, the market still sees itself as always looking for when we're going to make a change in the future On occasions when they think we will or we should, they move the funds rate up immediately in the morning well before any kind of an announcement by the Committee would be likely And the rate sits there until we demonstrate something to the contrary And so on a couple of occasions where the market thought the data were such that perhaps there was going to be an action in coming days, they moved the funds rate up to reflect that possibility Part of the theory that seems to be at work there is that if people really believe that the Fed will move, for some it means buying cheap funds relative to what they will be later Moving the funds rate also is a way of testing the Fed to see what its stance is And so even though we recently have announced our policy actions, what we respond to is the market moving ahead of our announcement of Fed policy actions I think that's always going to happen   Yes, there are some people who still think that's a possibility; it hasn't been ruled out because we have mentioned that these announcements have not necessarily been for all time I think the market tends to set up for itself a series of time points It looks for announcements on the discount rate now within a certain period of time in the morning, policy announcements any time after that, but always the possibility of something being signaled ahead of the announcement Even if that is not forthcoming, there are circumstances when they move the funds rate ahead of the Fed For example, on the day of the employment data release on Friday, May 6, most people didn't think that the Fed would take action that day, but they still moved the funds rate up on the theory that perhaps the Federal Reserve would do something on the following Monday And thus the constellation of where the funds rate would be over the balance of the period suggested that it was worth pushing the rate up  -5-    5/17/94   Well, I guess it's really their anticipatory moves that we're talking about; it's not the actual Fed moves; it's the market anticipating the Fed moves before they occur   Perhaps with the passage of time, as people become accustomed to our new disclosure practices, those anticipatory moves will not require our protest actions But we're always going to have anticipatory moves; I think that's a given How the market would view our absence from protesting I think would require more experience with our new disclosure practices I don't think there's enough experience with them now for the market to be confident that, had we stayed out when they pushed the funds rate a point higher, we were not paving the way for the Committee We're not in the position to pave the way for the Committee   Right   Or that we were trying to get the market ready for it--to pave the way for a decision I think that there just has not been enough experience with the announcements for people to feel comfortable in terms of what the timing of those announcements is and so forth   Yes   Well, relative to our expectations on the April tax collection themselves, we fell short by $12 billion And if we take April and May combined there was a big catchup in early May   They only fell short by about $9 billion We had forecast an increase in the April tax take of something in the neighborhood of 25 percent over the level a year ago and it appears to be coming in between 5 and 10 percent above Everyone seems to have had those same kinds of overestimates, so people are still trying to find out if there will be some offsets in June or whether in fact all these adjustments were made last year and people really did get ahead of the change in their tax liabilities   How the bond market is going to respond will depend on the circumstances that caused such an abrupt change and what that does to the expectations and how long it persists   I feel I am starting on an uneventful note here, and I am I was going to comment that reserve management was relatively uneventful over the intermeeting period [Laughter] And I was going to go on to say that that occurred notwithstanding the huge flows in reserve markets [Statement--see Appendix]   Of the System's portfolio?   Let me start out by saying that when we make additions to the portfolio on a permanent basis, we usually do so when we see a protracted need to supply reserves If we really don't see that, if it looks as if there are going to be short-term swings, we will address most of that reserve need with repurchase agreements and the like I don't know what page of the report you have in front of you, but during the intermeeting--   The New York Desk report?   Okay On an outright basis, the portfolio went up by $4-1/4 billion during the period That increase reflected $3-3/4 billion of bill purchases in the market and securities purchased directly from foreign accounts that were essentially all bills The data you see in the middle of that table partly reflect the exchange that took place at the end of last week when the refunding settled, so it's a wash; it doesn't count as an increase It's just an exchange of notes and bonds that matured in May, not new purchases Most of the increase in the portfolio over the intermeeting period came in Treasury bills, virtually all of it For the year to date our holdings are up $16 billion and that has been, in some sense, almost evenly distributed between coupons and bills We have been looking to keep the average maturity of the portfolio pretty close to the level where it was last year We are not aiming to shorten it or to lengthen it very much There was a view in earlier years that the portfolio should be somewhat shorter, but we reached a conclusion about a year or so ago that the amount of liquidity in the portfolio is probably appropriate for current circumstances Basically, we try to keep it pretty much at about the 38-month average reached last year The reason for doing the acquisitions in the bill market during this particular six-week intermeeting period was that we already had made some additions on the coupon side earlier   Yes, I think there is something to be said for letting the market know that the meeting has concluded In terms of  -65-    7/5-6/94  what announcements the market is looking for out of this Committee when there is no action, I have to say they haven't got a clue They know that decisions on how to handle these announcements have not been made and they know the Committee hasn't addressed the issue, so most of them think that the Committee wants to maintain as much flexibility as it can until it has made a decision on that For now, I think some of them are hoping there will be at least an announcement that the meeting is over, so they can go about their business If we said that we have nothing to announce, that would be helpful   It's to buy time until the Committee has had a longer discussion on this That is what they are thinking   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   We spent a lot of time talking to people in the repo markets as we proceeded, and we learned some hard lessons in that market here I think there has been some concern that as these repo markets are developing in Europe market participants have not quite learned from our mistakes So we have been trying, both at the central bank level and with US dealers who have a presence in these markets overseas, to let them know how important it is to maintain margin and all of the other good practices As they are evolving, they are taking a look at some of the early history here and learning from it   Thank you, Mr Chairman   I answer to either [Laughter] [Statement--See Appendix]   The part of the statement that was released in August that has captured a lot of attention--and some people have likened it to the sort of attention that Talmudic scholars give--is the "for a time" phraseology The rest of the announcement followed the format of earlier announcements It has not had an impact on our operations; it has not affected us in any way that differs from the earlier announcements That is to say, people see that the Committee has been announcing its policy moves and that has tended perhaps to give us a little more flexibility in our day-to-day operations I'd say more than a little flexibility until we come right up to a Committee meeting What we have noticed is that each time we come up to a Committee meeting, there is still this question about whether we are paving the way for a policy change That has not dissipated The "for a time" concept immediately after the August meeting was taken by most people in the market to mean until November 15 That was the "nuance" that they put on the statement But as you can see from the data that have come out since the August meeting and the market's reaction to it, I don't think they feel that the Committee is hard- bound by it It has been a factor in that people perhaps have responded more slowly to the data on the theory that, having said this, the Committee would like a longer period of time to review information as it comes in So, the response to the numbers, say the PPI number, was muted because (a) it was the first number like this and (b) since it was the first, the Committee presumably would want more evidence But I don't think the market thinks that the Committee would overlook the data if it were overwhelmingly conclusive    9/27/94   I don't want to use a technical argument here because I don't think technical arguments carry weight for long periods of time, but I will say that an awful lot of money has been kept in the short end of the market because people are very cautious; most people feel that rates are going higher still, and the short end has been a beneficiary of that The 2-year rate in particular has been the subject of some debate in the market A lot of people look at the spread of the 2-year note over the funds rate as being too narrow to be sustained, but that abstracts from the fact that there has been a fair amount of interest in staying short That perhaps is what has kept that segment of the curve relatively low Bill rates were so low that the segment that you point to between one and two years may have been depressed beyond what fundamentals would call for People are questioning the spread of the 2-year rate over the federal funds rate at this stage of the cycle, given the prospect of further Fed moves And I think some people feel it's hovering around the low end because of defensive moves   We see, as I mentioned, that people have ratcheted up somewhat further their views about prospective tightening We see that in the futures contracts for December and in market commentaries We see it through early next year Not everyone, as I mentioned, is completely sure about where prices are going to be There is still a fairly wide discrepancy in that   At the time I first wrote this earlier, I would have described it as a narrow majority, but over the past week or so I would say it probably has become a more comfortable majority I think that's the way things have shifted over the past week People really got caught up in the numbers released last week They were a big surprise   Do you mean me?  -18-    9/27/94   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]  -3-    11/15/94   That's right   For the month of November?   I don't know the precise average, but it is on the high side, because after its rise at the end of the quarter the rate never really went back down The last statement week ended on a firm note and it was a holiday on Friday With expectations of a rate move at this meeting today, the funds rate has been persistently above that average   Yes   For November   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   It has been a disappointing year for a lot of people in the financial markets We have had some sense since Thanksgiving that many people are just hanging on in the hope of getting through December 31 If they have done well or have managed to do all right, they want to finish the year in that position If they haven't done well, they don't want to add to their losses As a result, there has been a general tendency for people to try to take cover This gives us a hint as to why we have had abrupt moves when securities have come into the market in clumps, because people don't feel they necessarily have the wherewithal to take them on If they do buy them, they have to re-route them right away or hedge them with something equivalent   I think that in the Orange County case there probably are several influences at work It was helpful that people eventually were able to get a handle on just what the county has In    12/20/94  the first day or so, people couldn't get any information from Orange County on almost anything, and I think that is what caused the biggest market backup Since that time, the markets have come back in many cases to where they were prior to the break of the news or maybe just 5 or 10 basis points past that, even with some of the securities being liquidated So I think the initial move occurred because of the lack of knowledge of exactly what was going on and what was going to happen By the same token, markets are in an atmosphere where there is an FOMC meeting and people view interest rates as being on an upward trend If you could have picked a time for Orange County to sell, maybe this would not have been the time you would have picked
