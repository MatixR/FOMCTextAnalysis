 On the point of the rationale for these things that Lee mentioned, it seems ironic that the world's primary reserve currency country might be trying to measure its own international clout in terms of its holdings of foreign countries' currencies It just seems a bit inconsistent and ironic   Springtime has come to the Eleventh District, and I have a good bit of it in my sinuses right now, as you can tell! At the last meeting I reported that economic activity in the Eleventh District was either stronger or less weak than in the nation That continues to be the case, and perhaps even more so One measure is total employment, and employment is continuing to increase in all three states of the District and in most major sectors of the economy It is slow growth but it is growth Anecdotal information from directors and other community people we've talked to does not sound quite as positive as the numbers seem to look They emphasize the fact that the economy is not so strong that it can stand up against the national recession, but they also emphasize continuing credit availability problems The reluctance of banks to lend is cited by all of our people out there as the key factor that they believe is going to keep the recovery fairly mild But one of the members of our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Committee a few weeks ago reported that if you went into a bank four years ago and asked for a loan the answer was "Hell no!" and if you do it now the answer is merely "No"  Given that circumstances in our area are more favorable than they are in most of the country, we don't find the Greenbook forecast to be implausible We think it's pretty much on the mark, although we probably would push the recovery from the second to the third quarter and would not be quite as optimistic about the abrupt decline in the consumer price index as the Greenbook forecast   I will support "B" symmetric   With regard to the national economy, we have no quarrel with the Greenbook forecast  For the Eleventh District, we have been right at the top of the Districts in terms of maintenance of employment levels As a matter of fact, we were probably number one until a couple of months ago; I believe about a month ago the Kansas City District overtook us But now we're beginning to experience a decline in employment and a rise in unemployment rates Many of our local unemployment rates are now at or above the national average The strongest data in our District are in Texas, particularly the Houston and the Gulf Coast areas Petrochemicals and energy seem to be helping them a little The impression we get from our directors is that growth is positive but barely so  Borrowers in our District believe that the credit crunch is very real; they always have and still do Generally, bankers have been telling us that there is just not good credit demand The Texas Bankers Association did a poll the other day and the majority of them said there was a credit crunch and that it was all the regulators' fault that it existed State finances are tight, too, and Texas is beginning to talk about an income tax   The Eleventh District continues to lag the national economy Therefore, it has weakened since the last meeting and is probably a drag on the national recovery at this point except that one source of Eleventh District weakness, which is low natural gas prices, is probably helping the national economy somewhat Another source of weakness locally is the slowing in the building of petro-chemical plants in the Gulf Coast region Geographically, the Houston area has accounted for 40 to 50 percent of the job growth in the last year or so and that has now stagnated somewhat  Turning to our view of the national economy, the staff is not too worried about a double-dip, based on their review of past double- dips and the characteristics they had They find that inventory explanations are largely present that are not relevant now Also, they expect net exports to gain strength and there have been five consecutive months now of a rising index of leading economic indicators Recession in that context is fairly unprecedented The staff is not as worried as I am about the recent decline in the broader measures of the money supply They tend to view it as a fairly benign disintermediation process away from depositories into stocks, bonds, and other types of instruments But I do believe it's important to get money back on track, regardless of the explanation  -21-    8/20/91  for the slowdown and the decline And in the context of the previous discussion, I believe that the will to do so is more important than the way or the method to do it   I have no problem with your recommendation I would have a slight preference for alternative A and version II, primarily because I think the economy could use some lower interest rates And if we can believe the menu that has been presented before us, we have an opportunity here to get some lower interest rates with very little acceleration of money growth rates If we have a choice like that, I don't think we ought to turn it down But your  -40-    8/20/91  recommendation would be fine and I would urge you to use your asymmetry quickly   The economy in the Dallas District, Mr Chairman, has improved somewhat since the last FOMC meeting Over the summer we experienced some employment gains, after about five months of no gains District manufacturing activity has gone along with the nation in being stronger than the services areas The strongest part of manufacturing has been in chemicals, petroleum refining, plastics, and also some construction-related manufacturing Construction has picked up slightly in residential areas but not in nonresidential areas The energy sector remains weak primarily because of the prolonged decline in natural gas prices Rig counts in the District are down about 5 percent in the last month and down 21 percent over the past year Retail sales have languished in recent weeks and remain well below year-ago levels Our directors and other people we  -17-    10/1/91  talk to and get anecdotal information from have the feeling that we're stuck in the mud--that forward progress is not necessarily being sustained They're still very concerned with what is going on with bank lending and they're concerned about the sectors of the economy-- the small business and medium size business sectors--that are still relying heavily on the banking industry as opposed to someone else for their financing   I don't think there's a lot of activity there   "B" asymmetric   Mr Chairman, the Eleventh District remains sluggish--"stuck in the mud" is a phrase one hears, or phrases similar to that--although in the third quarter we actually experienced employment increases That's primarily the result of state and local government employment increases We have the same fiscal problems as everybody else, but a number of our areas are under court mandate to expand and to raise taxes to do that The Dallas Fed's index of coincident indicators has been declining fairly steadily but our leading indicators have been fairly flat I don't have an explanation for that Low natural gas prices continue to depress drilling activity in the District A national retail chain headquartered in Dallas expects a weak Christmas, following a weak Christmas last year Prospects for defense industry spending are adding to the uncertainty in our area, given all the concentration that we have [in that area] Our directors and other local business people perceive the economy to be weak, but we don't hear as much as we used to about the need for an easier monetary policy A typical comment is that it's not the level of interest rates that is causing the problem; it's the inability to borrow any money from banks at any interest rate I believe Bob Forrestal mentioned that Texas, of course, has had a credit crunch longer than the rest of the economy and, therefore, just about everybody you meet knows someone personally whom they consider a worthy and dependable borrower who cannot get credit And some of our directors have had fairly close experiences with that So, they're very preoccupied with the fact that banks are not making [any] loans We actually, at their request, have scheduled a special meeting at the time of our November board meeting in which we're going to deal with the credit crunch--and possibly solve it We'll be sure to notify you if we do! In that regard, I do think that since the business community is absolutely convinced that there is a credit crunch, they don't have a lot of patience with trying to define it or to talk about the nuances of that And I think it behooves Federal Reserve policymakers to go ahead and accept that terminology I don't think it does us any good to poke around it and act as if it's not there if everybody out there really believes it is  On the national scene, our research people agree generally with the staff here They see further weakness and they're about  -13-    11/5/91  evenly divided as to whether that has any implications at all for monetary policy   I think your recommendation of a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate is appropriate And in the context of more frequent discussions in the coming weeks, I would prefer the symmetric language   Mr Chairman, there has been very little net change in the economy in Texas and in the Eleventh District since our last meeting It remains essentially flat with perceptions somewhat worse than the numbers A lot of those perceptions are not based on local developments but on the continued drumbeat of national announcements of closings and layoffs This past week we got two local jolts to confidence One of Dallas' two newspapers, which was 112 years old, closed; then just the other day [unintelligible] The prime candidate is one that's in the Dallas area  We've done a lot of surveying in the last few days on retail sales, trying to pin down what has been going on during this Christmas season It's very hard to pin down, but on balance the conclusion is that retail sales have not been too bad in the context of diminished expectations Most of the strength is in discount stores such as Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target; their sales seem to be up about 8 to 10 percent over last year The conventional department stores and the chain stores such as Penney's and Sears are not doing as well, although their sales are up from last year, nominally at least, about 5 percent Penney's, which is headquartered in Dallas, says its store sales are up about 53 percent over last year, but they report very weak catalogue sales And the reason they give is very interesting, I think; it's because when they print a catalogue they can't take account of price declines, so it becomes outdated and nobody uses it  Let me give you a quick year-end report on Eleventh District banking, because I'm pleased to report that in 1991 for the first time in several years we have not led the nation in bank failures We are going to conclude the year with only 33 bank failures; that compares to 105 last year and 144 the year before   I might say that someone mentioned the timing of these banks' charters A third of those that failed in '91 were chartered in the '80s The failing banks are getting much smaller The 33 in '91 had $14 billion [in assets] and the 105 in '90 accounted for $6 billion, whereas the year before it was $24 billion and it gets bigger as you go back After four years of aggregate losses, 1990 was the first year of aggregate profitability for the District banks, and that has continued into this year But Eleventh District bank lending has continued to decline on net, and the bankers say that's because loan demand just isn't there Property values are beginning to stabilize after about six years of deflation I mention that because property values and banking trends still appear to be moving in the other direction in many parts of the country, and I  -24-    12/17/91  guess the message from the Eleventh District is that that does not augur well for a quick recovery  On policy, I would just say that whenever we decide to take the next step, I believe it's important that we do all that we think is going to be necessary in the foreseeable future Someone mentioned a moment ago that discussions of the investment tax credit can freeze capital spending By the same token, I think expectations of still lower interest rates in the future can cause a postponement of big ticket spending as well So, when we do decide to ease interest rates further, I think we ought to ease enough so that the directive becomes symmetrical and the probability of going one way is the same as the probability of going the other way the next time a move is made And I would just comment that I would not consider lowering short-term interest rates a little more to be a major easing move because of the long period of very slow growth in M2 I think our current de facto procedure of targeting the fed funds rate and our pattern of small frequent changes may have given us the impression that we were doing more than we actually were on fundamental monetary policy So, I think there is room for a further reduction without derailing our long-run objective of price stability   Mr Chairman, my view doesn't change the tally but I would have preferred alternative A I think we all are very confused about the current stance of monetary policy, including me If it's narrow money that's important, it's too easy If it's short- term interest rates that are important, policy is not as easy as it seems; we have in this recession reduced the fed funds rate by a smaller percentage than in previous recessions And if broad money is what is important, policy is too tight This is the first recession in the last 30 years, I believe, where the rate of growth of M2 has not increased during the recession If we believe M2 is the right M, we need to be more aggressive I believe the next move ought to be a 1/2 point move because I think it's important that people stop perceiving that every time we do something we're going to do something else a week or two later The next time we move the perception ought to be that we have done our thing and people should stop waiting for the next shoe to drop People are out there trying to make decisions --they want to buy a house or a car--and as long as they think there's a little more [reduction in rates] to go they're going to be postponing those decisions When we do make a move, if it's correct to do so, it's important that we emphasize the slow growth in M2 because I think that's the best way to set the stage for the time when we're going to have to reverse the course and [raise rates] And I think M2 will be our most consistent explanation for changing course   Yes I don't have a question on these specific transactions but as another sort of newcomer here I've been listening to these reports and I'm never quite sure exactly what the role of the FOMC is in exchange market intervention and what our goal really is in a world of flexible exchange rates That's not necessarily a question for now, but sometime I'd like to hear a discussion of precisely what we are trying to accomplish in these kinds of transactions   Well, we have three new presidents and two new governors this year, so I think it might be helpful I know it would be to me   I don't really question our authority I'm just not sure what we're trying to use that authority in pursuit of I'm just not really clear on that   The Eleventh District economy has held up throughout the recession and slow recovery better than most Districts, I think Our total employment is almost 2 percent higher than it was in July of 1990, just before the recession started Initially, our economy was supported by improvement in the energy sector, resulting from the temporary spike in oil prices But since about the middle of 1991, the energy sector has become a major drag rather than a source of impetus Bob Forrestal already referred to the low gas prices and  -16-    3/31/92  the effect that is having on the gas industry And the oil exploration and production business is rapidly disappearing in our District through layoffs and moves abroad That's a long-run decline that people are very gloomy about, particularly with the Clean Air Act having just passed; that's going to have an impact on refineries as well as exploration The gap, though, since the middle of '91 has been largely made up in our District by the reaction of residential construction, single-family housing, to the lower interest rates We've also benefited throughout this past year and a half from a fairly strong Mexican economy and fairly robust exports from the Eleventh District to Mexico The mood in the District seemed to improve dramatically when we first started hearing reports on retail sales in January and February, before the data were announced So, things have picked up optimism-wise and that's reflected in our Beigebook survey as well   Mr Chairman, all this discussion about the difference between symmetric and asymmetric makes me think I probably don't understand the difference well enough It seems to me that the main difference between the two is a telephone call And if I'm right in that, it would seem to me that we ought to prefer symmetric language and talk about it if developments warrant   Relatively speaking, the Eleventh District economy remains one of the stronger District economies, at least in terms of employment From the bottom of the recession in April of 1991, employment has grown about 1-1/2 percent in our District Within the District the weakest, and the declining, sector is energy and the main source of strength is exports, especially exports to Mexico, which account for a third of Texas exports to foreign countries Between 1990 and 1991, Texas exports to Mexico were up 16-1/2 percent; and exports to Canada, which is our second largest internationaltrading partner, were up almost 8 percent The number of businesses requesting information on assistance with exporting from the international marketing division of the Texas Department of Commerce was as great through April as they had expected for the entire year So, there's a lot of activity gearing up for the prospective North American Free Trade Agreement, which is very important to our part of the country And given the present economic environment and political climate, freer trade--even though we would all agree that it's desirable--is becoming a harder sell politically That's not so much true in our area because our business people expect to benefit disproportionately from NAFTA, but I hope that all of you throughout the country will give it a plug in your speeches and in your publications and your economic education efforts I think it's  -20-    5/19/92  very important to the near-term and long-term health of the economy Prospects are pretty good for continued growth in our District based on the confidence that we hear increasingly expressed in the business community and based on our leading indicator indexes   On the question of resumed bank lending, have you taken much account of the risk-based deposit insurance as well as the risk-based capital coming into view?   I would support your recommendation, Mr Chairman   Governor Angell says that exchange rate policy is part of the context of monetary policy and obviously it is I'm not clear to what extent we're in agreement on whether exchange rate policy comes under the jurisdiction of this Committee Do we have a clear idea of who's in charge of exchange rate policy--the FOMC or the Treasury--or who's the junior partner and who's the senior partner?   There was a definite shift in the Eleventh District economy between the first and the second quarters, both in terms of economic activity and of mood Measuring economic activity in terms of employment growth, in the first quarter of this year our employment was growing faster than the national average and in the second quarter employment was shrinking and not keeping up with the national average We have shifted from being a source of strength to the national economy to being a source of weakness As for mood, in conversations with directors, bankers, and business people there is the definite sense that all is not well with the economy, although most people are not urging further ease of monetary policy I believe the view is that monetary policy has done its thing; it hasn't been very effective but we don't find many people thinking that further reductions in short-term interest rates will help very much That's their view on the one hand, but in addition to that there is increasingly the cry from those who are aware of lower interest income and the impact that is having on a significant segment of the  -23-    8/18/92  population On the question of mood, let me say that I've been around a number of bankers recently, more than usual, and I'd just like to report that they are a very unhappy, mad bunch of people They feel beleaguered--especially the small banks They recognize the FDICIA legislation as punitive legislation and they are really dreading the regulations that are going to come out of that And they don't see any light at the end of the tunnel; they feel that they're in a business that is going down the toilet and nobody cares Their numbers in the context of measures of health of banks are improving in the District But after all these years of recovering they still aren't lending; they're still shrinking their lending [activity] And I guess they're turning into bond funds; they're riding the yield curve right now   I support your recommendation   Well, speaking of what might or might not inhibit our activity, we've had several references this morning to the fact that expectations of further ease already seem to be built into both interest rates and foreign exchange rates Yet we're within a month of the election and I thought it was conventional wisdom that we weren't expected to act so close to an election But I never see any references to that anymore Whatever happened to that?   Well, tightening doesn't affect our credibility the same way that easing might We're usually accused of doing things to help the incumbent, I believe  -17-    10/6/92   We haven't detected much difference in the Eleventh District economy from the last time I reported We still  -29-    10/6/92  have a positive but very flat growth trend I believe it would put us in the top half of the Districts, though, or maybe even in the top third Employment is still growing, largely because of government employment growth Private sector employment growth is essentially flat; the employment growth we get is in fits and starts The weakest sectors of the economy are energy and durable goods manufacturing Residential construction has flattened a bit in recent months as well The strong part of the economy, of course, is along the Mexican border, especially in retail sales Governor Lindsey mentioned that this country may be in the process of becoming the world's Wal-Mart; ironically enough, that may apply to the Third World as well as the rest of the world I learned this past week that McAllen, Texas, along the border, supposedly has the two most profitable Wal-Mart stores in the country It has a mall with reportedly the highest sales per square foot of any mall in the United States All along the border retail sales are higher than personal income So, we are doing a lot of retailing to the Mexican customer there Symbolically, although it's of no relevance to monetary policy, we just gained the headquarters of Southwestern Bell from St Louis They are moving their headquarters to San Antonio One of the main reasons they gave for that move was to be closer to Mexico because of a joint venture they have going with the Mexican telephone company  I've been engaged in a series of eight meetings with bankers around the District to talk about various issues and see what is on their minds Tomorrow will be the eighth of those It was scheduled for a room in a hotel in San Antonio We're being bumped from our room so that Presidents Bush and Salinas and Mr Mulroney can sign the NAFTA agreement; we're going to be pushed down the hall from that little exercise The mood of the bankers is very negative; they're focused almost exclusively on the regulatory burden and what is coming at them with this new FDICIA legislation When you talk about a credit crunch with them, they associate that with supply constraints and they deny that there is any credit crunch when they [look at] it that way They attribute the flatness in lending almost exclusively to weak demand for quality loans On the other hand, in other conversations with them when we are talking about the regulatory burden, they seem to be saying that lending is flat in part because it has become much riskier to lend and a lot easier, and just as profitable these days, to invest in government securities So, lending is still very flat in the Eleventh District after all this time of healing I guess the lesson from that is that even after measures of bank health improve, and have been improving for a long time, it's still a long time before that results in additional lending Most measures of health in banking in the Eleventh District have been improving for quite some time and now stand significantly above those in the rest of the country If you look at the bank loan situation from the point of view of potential borrowers rather than from bankers, up until a few months ago they did believe that the credit crunch was more than weak quality-loan demand; they believed it was supply constraints from the banks But there have been reports now for two or three months that that is changing They are reporting that bankers are out there soliciting loan business to a much greater degree than they were previously  From the tone of meetings of our directors and small business advisory councils and others I'd say that the mood has deteriorated a little over the period since the last FOMC meeting And based on what    10/6/92  we all read in the press more than anything that has been happening locally, our reading of the national economy is that it is much worse off than the local economy Also, we have no disagreement with the Greenbook forecast   Mr Chairman, I agree with the number of people who have argued for us to take the initiative back [from] the markets I think the FOMC is the place to make these decisions and generally I would prefer to make them during the meetings I have a continuing preference for symmetric directives And given the turmoil in the world right now and the low level of interest rates that we already have, I think our best contribution could be to act as a force for stability So, my preference, if I were a voting member, would be for "B" with a symmetric directive   He won't own a fax!   Eleventh District business conditions and prospects appear to be stronger this time than at the time of our last meeting I base that on discussions with our directors and other business people in the community, our Beigebook respondents, my own visits to local malls, and my inability to get a parking place at the airport yesterday [Laughter]   We had a flat second quarter and the third quarter seems much improved Most of the indicators show that; the leading indicators are even stronger than the coincident indicators We have a Texas leading index It was flat in the second quarter and much stronger in the third quarter Texas and New Mexico seem to be doing better in terms of employment than Louisiana despite some recent improvement in the natural gas industry Natural gas prices are about 30 percent higher than they were this time last year  I probably should mention something on Eleventh District banking since it has been in the news recently As you all know, First City expired a couple of weeks ago That organization had 20 banks; they were closed in what was referred to locally as a "Hollywood ambush" That raised the District's bank failures year-to- date from 9 to 29 The First City organization had shrunk down to about $88 billion It's probably the first major bank and perhaps    11/17/92  the first bank of any size to require a second assisted resolution; the FDIC assisted it in 1988 It never fully recovered and the person who took it over made some new errors, so it has been crippled since then It's the largest bank, I believe, to involve a significant haircut to non-insured depositors Among the twenty banks, the four largest took a 20 percent haircut on their uninsured deposits Those were in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin The feeling in the community over this development is one of sadness because First City was making a valiant effort to deal with the problems on its own And there's a great deal of resentment toward the regulators first for the timing, which was the weekend before the election in the President's home town, and for the feeling that bank management was misled into thinking they had the support of the regulators in the bank's efforts to deal with the problem and effect a resolution without help Incidentally, none of the First City banks was borrowing at the discount window and they all expired with positive reserve balances I guess the economic implications of this are that it takes a long time to recover from a banking collapse As you know, we've lost local control of 9 of the 10 largest banks in Texas But as someone said yesterday, the pig is now through the python That was the last major problem bank left in the Eleventh District Measures of banking health are now good in Texas and in the Eleventh District Banks still are not making net new loans; there remain too many incentives against lending as opposed to investing in Treasury securities  On the national economy, I read the same newspapers and Greenbook as the rest of you and I don't really have any new insights to add I have noticed that the press seems less eager to put a negative spin on the good news than before So, one gets the impression from listening to the news that the economy and the prospects for the economy are now better than they've been in quite a while and considerably more positive than at the time of our last meeting   Well, they were at all time lows and with hurricane Andrew natural gas prices went up; the price for natural gas is about 30 percent above what it was before So there has been some renewed activity there It's helpful, but the long-term prospects are very negative, I think   I don't think so, although the feeling is that oil prices also will rise in the coming few months, especially if we have a cold winter   I agree with Governor Kelley on all those points On the question of headlines, currently markets are no longer expecting an easing as they were at the time of our last meeting And rather than mixing sin and virtue or sugar and vinegar, I'd suggest that we avoid either right now I'd take a "B" symmetric directive and wait until later to decide how much to lower the ranges, and I'd wait until February to go public with it   The sharp improvement in tone since the last meeting that Bob Forrestal reported for the Southeast occurred one meeting earlier in the Southwest The District economy has remained very positive during the past few weeks, but it hasn't continued to improve We continue to do a little better in the Southwest than the  -16-    12/22/92  country as a whole During the past year our employment has grown a little over a percent and a half At the last meeting, I reported that one of the sources of strength in our District has been Mexican shoppers along the border area I should mention this time that the Mexican authorities have imposed a $50 limit on what may be brought back duty free in cars and on foot across the bridges   There was a riot in Nuevo Laredo over that It's good to see people rioting because of limits on their imports rather than consumer exports! This has happened before at Christmas time when the outflow of cash has been extreme, but it is causing some very sharp cutbacks in a lot of our border towns Some of the Kmart and Wal-Mart stores are showing a drop in sales of up to 30 percent over these past few weeks because of that  It seems that things are going well nationally with the 34 percent growth in the third quarter and prospects for about the same in the fourth quarter The risks do seem to have balanced out on the up and down sides I think policy is in a good position, and the only thing I'm still a little concerned about is the very slow growth in M2 It would have been nice if we could have ended this year at least touching the lower bounds [of the ranges] for M2 and M3 That gives me some concern for the future, but for right now I think we're in good shape   The Eleventh District economy continues to be among the stronger in the country in terms of employment growth We estimate that total employment was up a little less than 2 percent last year There was an article on revised employment numbers by city in Friday's local paper; it listed the ten top cities for employment growth in the nation The Eleventh District had three cities on that list; the Sixth District had four out of the ten But while the numbers continue to come in reasonably strong, the mood seems to have shifted a bit negatively since the Clinton program came out, from optimism to uncertainty And that does have real impact in some sectors For example, in Houston they have a number of things to worry about the BTU tax, NASA and the space station, and health care In particular, the Houston Medical Center had been the source of a lot of construction and planned construction; we hear that a lot of it is being put on hold until they determine what is going to happen with health care There are scattered reports that some businesses are finally beginning to have to hire some people They have been resisting mightily because our workweek in manufacturing in Texas has been over 43 hours recently, which I believe is over an hour longer than the national average So, that's beginning to give and we do believe we're going to be getting some employment growth [in manufacturing] now I haven't talked to a lot of people about it but, given the optimism over NAFTA that has been prevalent in our District for some time now, it seems to me that all this negative press we've been getting--the NAFTA bashing and the signs of disarray in the Administration's trade policy--can only suppress activity And that's a source of great concern for the nation I wish there were some way we could weigh in with a little economic education promoting both NAFTA and GATT  Just an observation I believe that the Fed and the Fed's ability to conduct policy in the near future have benefited from some luck recently In particular, I think we've been lucky to have had this clear demonstration that the bond markets are responding to expectations First, we had the rise in the bond market based on the prospects for the lower deficit and/or lower inflation And then we had a decline in the bond market when the price indexes looked a bit unfavorable I think the world knew that Fed policy was not involved -- it was steady-as-you-go--and that longer-term interest rates were responding to these things We've been telling people that, but this was a clearer demonstration of it than people have had in a long time I think that will serve us well and give us a little more flexibility in the future  Anticipating our policy discussion, I can't resist commenting on Paul Samuelson's statement in the academic report This is not a direct quote but about what he said was that no change in monetary  -18-    3/23/93  policy is currently required Given the source of that, I think we might as well just stop the meeting and move on!   May I ask a follow-up question to that? For some time now I have wondered if we pushed harder on the fed funds rate to reduce it whether that might just accelerate the disintermediation around the banking system and result in smaller values for the Ms rather than higher But according to this, if we have a 3 percent fed funds rate, we will get a certain set of growth rates for the monetary aggregates; if we lower the fed funds rate 1/2 point we will get a faster rate of growth in the aggregates, and if we raise the fed funds rate by 1/2 point we will get a slower rate of growth in them I question that, but my question is Was this taken into account in the Feinman/Porter work, which I interpreted in part to cast doubt on this?   I agree with Bob Forrestal's desire for symmetric vigilance Maybe another way of putting it is that we now have a policy equivalent of a kinked demand curve We're not necessarily happy with the price that we have--that is, the fed funds rate--but there are great disadvantages in moving it in either direction So, we're sort of stuck with it for a while I was moved by the Mullins-Angell argument I didn't expect us to be seriously considering tightening because of accelerating inflation, and that argument did make an impression on me But for the time being I would prefer to follow Governor LaWare's admonition to remain on red alert in that regard So, I support "B" symmetric with the alternative paragraph   One thing that would account for both higher inflation and a weaker real sector would be weather, and we know we have had some bad weather To what extent have you analyzed that and figured out how many points could be attributed to that?   I was under the impression that the food component was a pretty good chunk of it, though   In case some of you missed it, I'm pleased to report some good news from south of the border The government of Mexico has submitted a constitutional amendment to give independence to the central bank, the Bank of Mexico, and to make price stability its overriding objective The way they worded it was that the main mandate of the Bank of Mexico over any other objective will be to preserve the purchasing power of the national currency  In the Eleventh District we've seen some modest weakening in the numbers and some deterioration in the tone of the anecdotal information It's somewhat more negative, primarily surrounding uncertainty over the future Projects are being put on hold because people are waiting to see what the tax situation is going to be and [what happens regarding] certain government spending situations and also health care reform And probably somewhat unique to our area, we also have some slowdown related to the diminished prospects for the passage of NAFTA  On the national economy, I really don't have any helpful insights to offer I don't understand this recent split in the economy with the real sector seeming to turn down and inflation seeming to pick up at the same time It's a mystery to me On the nontraditional source of the inflation, however, and not being able to find the pulse of money and credit growth, it's probably because we're still trying to find that pulse on the balance sheet of banks When we talk about the money numbers and what's going on, I think it's fairly clear that there is liquidity out there and there is money out there; it's just not where we used to measure it I think we haven't quite made the adjustment when we're talking about inflation to realize that it's probably there in that context as well That's all   My preference would be for no change today but with an asymmetric directive toward tightening I think having that  -49-    5/18/93  on the record in the future is more likely to be in our favor than against us for reasons that Jerry Corrigan and Governor Mullins mentioned For psychology, I think we ought to get Governor Phillips to dump her bracelet on the gold market at some point!   Last month I said that the Eleventh District economy had weakened a little relative to the national economy, but that appears to have been temporary Recent statistics in the District appear to be somewhat stronger, particularly employment growth, and the anecdotal information is somewhat more positive We seem to be benefiting in some cases from weaknesses elsewhere in the country For example, the Austin area seems to be gaining a good bit  -15-    8/17/93  of employment from firms either expanding out of or moving out of California We hear a lot about mortgage refinancing; just about everybody in Texas who didn't buy a house in the mid '80s and is therefore still under water seems to be refinancing their mortgages, including myself I was doing that several weeks ago but I had to drop out of the market following your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony; it brought my rate up a little bit   So if you'll hold off until next Monday I'll be grateful! [Laughter] Since I haven't taken much time, I thought you might like to hear about a couple of comments from our Beigebook respondents California seems to be on the mind of a number of them One told our research people that a company wanting to plant a tree in Los Angeles County has to get permission from 8 different agencies; to chop it down requires 47 permits And in Dallas County you can do either one of those things without a permit A local banker told one of our people that a client of his in north Los Angeles was so frustrated with water quality standards at his plant that he submitted plain tap water to be tested, and the water quality agency judged that the water was not fit to be dumped into the sewer system Finally, we would appreciate your support of NAFTA--all of you; it's going to be close   Mr Chairman, I think you're right that the shelf life of an asymmetric directive has been reached It's clear that the previous bias has been beneficial to our credibility The red alert served us well We may have stared down inflation with that bias But we've now had three consecutive months of favorable inflation news, and the information for two of those months has come in since our last meeting It's time to restore a symmetrical stance We have a large retroactive tax increase that has a lot of people scrambling The thing that I disagree with Governor Lindsey on his  -38-    8/17/93  arithmetic is his view that people are going to wait until April 15th to act I think they're out there doing it right now and it's going to weaken the economy, and it's going to do it before next April 15th If we wait and keep our asymmetric directive, we're going to get more political pressure And we won't want to appear to be caving in to it We're better off to move back to a symmetric directive in this window of opportunity when, as you say, we come down on the basis of [unintelligible] as well as the tax hikes That bites the economy hard   Most indicators in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District remain positive Our District economy seems to be  -19-    9/23/93  accelerating a bit from a level that was already above the national average NAFTA dominates the conversation in Texas when we talk to directors, Beigebook respondents, members of the Small Business Advisory Council, which met last week, and banking groups, although the small business people are very afraid of mandated health benefits coming out of the health reform effort Commercial real estate still hasn't done much but home and apartment construction are beginning to be very strong in a lot of our markets, particularly Austin and San Antonio, and even in Dallas to some extent; within a five mile radius of where I live there are, I believe, 8,000 to 10,000 apartments under construction Austin has more under construction than Los Angeles, Chicago, or New York, and Dallas is third behind Chicago and Atlanta New construction appears to be putting downward pressure on existing home prices I refinanced about three weeks ago And while I got some rate relief, my appraisal came in considerably below what I paid for the house, which is somewhat discouraging because I thought I moved to Texas at the bottom of the real estate cycle and it turns out I didn't We don't hear a lot about upward pressure on prices in the District but we do hear about it in building materials Retail sales in the District seem to be holding up rather well, but  who has interests in real estate, specialty real estate stores across the nation, and showed us a chart indicating that in the three weeks following the passage of the new tax law, retail sales in those stores just collapsed after having been growing rather nicely   Not necessarily, it involves things like high- volume office supplies, [unintelligible], that kind of thing Some of them are specialty and higher priced I guess that's all I want to say   "B" symmetric   Just a follow-up for Virgil along the lines of Governor LaWare's question Does a subpoena imply wrongdoing and, if so, what wrongdoing are we being accused of?   Why would they investigate us?   Looking backward, I could live with your suggestion for lightly edited transcripts But I think it's important for us to be as forthcoming as possible and I believe providing raw transcripts with some notation on the side that there are some obvious difficulties here and there and so forth might be perceived as a bit more forthcoming   Yes Let people see the garbled stuff; let them see how incomplete the raw transcripts are   One   Raw, annotated would be my preference Primarily because Chairman Gonzalez asked for it, I'd be inclined to go back only three years for protection rather than five, although I would personally prefer five I think we've got to be as forthcoming as we can be And looking forward, I rather agree with what Governor Kelley said I don't think there's a lot of substantive difference between a Memorandum of Discussion and an edited transcript, but I think the edited transcript would be perceived as an improvement over past practices and as more forthcoming And I think it could be advertised as more forthcoming than pre-1976 [practices] And in order to diffuse the other issue, I still believe that it would be helpful to combine whatever we do with an early announcement of the decision of the outcome of the meetings These are shadings of preference; I'd be willing to go along with your recommendation in the spirit of consensus   First choice is annotated raw transcripts; second choice is lightly edited   Three and five   May I make a comment or raise a question before you call for that?   Earlier someone said that the Memorandum of Discussion looking back hadn't been mentioned, but you do recall that that's one of the proposals in Mr Gonzalez's letter It seems as though we might be passing up something that's more beneficial to us than what we're really going for   I guess I was assuming that we really would prefer a Memorandum of Discussion but are voting otherwise because we think it's not acceptable  SEVERAL No, no   Okay  -47-    11/16/93   Lightly edited transcript first; MOD second   I'm not sure that a study of the swaps per se is necessary; but since I've been attending these meetings, over 2-1/2 years, we really haven't had a discussion of our views on intervention versus nonintervention I don't know what the FOMC's opinion is on that subject and I do think it would be worthwhile at some point when the crises are over to review the whole subject   Yes, I don't think it's the top item on the agenda   In the Eleventh District the mood has been more upbeat and the numbers seem to be following it up Within the District, New Mexico is somewhat stronger and our part of Louisiana somewhat weaker than Texas New Mexico is benefitting from an influx of a good many new industries Louisiana has been hurt by weak chemical demand from Europe and Japan and weakness in the energy extraction business recently The state has lost 6,600 energy extraction jobs since January of '92 Louisiana is still about 20,000 jobs shy of regaining its peak levels of employment way back in 1981 A bright spot there is river boat gambling, primarily in the Shreveport area Within Texas most major metropolitan areas are strengthening and are fairly strong Houston is the major exception At least temporarily energy seems to be a plus rather than a minus The rig count, after reaching a 50-year low last spring, is up about 25 percent from that The main employment strength we have is in the area of construction--single-family homes and apartments In some areas in the state that's up 50 percent compared to a year ago In our board meeting last Friday, Amarillo was referred to as [wild] and Victoria as having a mini boom So things are really getting lively in the construction area Several bankers noted an improvement in loan demand, but all admitted that too many banks were aggressively seeking to fill that demand There is not much talk of a credit crunch anymore Clouds on the horizon include the depressing effect of health care reform, weakness in the Mexican economy, the prospects that NAFTA may not pass, and at least from a local point of view, the fear that Iraqi oil production will resume   "B" symmetric   A small comment and a couple of questions I also was wondering if maybe three people to do this might not be too small a number and I'd urge you to consider a way to make it a larger number   Right And have you given thought to releasing it to the press?   Well, that leads me to another question and that is When this is made available to them, shouldn't we get a copy of the transcript ourselves? We'll be making available to them something that we haven't had made available to us   I know that you might want to talk more about this next month than now but what happens if between now and the next scheduled meeting we get a fax from that Committee that asks for something and also asks us not to communicate with each other That has happened and we were left totally isolated, not knowing who was doing what, afraid to call anybody--   I wish somebody had called and said that--had said "Feel free to talk to your colleagues" I feel there was a breakdown   I declined to make notes available and I worried that I was the only person who was going to decline   Growth in economic activity in the Eleventh District has slowed a little since the last FOMC meeting There was an actual decline in employment in October but that was primarily due to some special circumstances, including an early retirement program for the state which eliminated 6,000 government jobs and some earlier than usual hiring of seasonal employees which meant that October registered as a decline seasonally adjusted Construction activity is strong and it's expected to remain on an upward trend Single-family building was a major source of strength throughout 1993 Next year we expect that to slow a bit but multifamily and nonresidential activity should pick up the slack Apartment occupancy rates are very high And since June nonresidential contract values have risen at an annual rate of almost 100 percent, driven by the start of a couple of $2 billion refinery projects and a large increase in shopping center construction Manufacturing employment has been growing at a 2 percent rate And with weekly hours having gone back up to their high of 43, which I think is about the highest in the nation, manufacturing jobs should continue to gain Most of the strength is in durables, electrical and non-electrical machinery, instruments, and construction-related products Energy markets have taken on a gloomy tone in the District recently for obvious reasons In real terms oil prices are almost as low as they were in 1973 There's widespread fear that the recent drop in oil prices could be sustained for some time This would hurt our District; our people estimate that we would have job losses of about 50,000 over the next two years if oil prices remain at or below $15 The impact would be much less than it was in 1982 and 1986 since oil and gas extraction has declined to about 7 percent of the District's economy from about 23 percent back in 1981 However, what's bad for the Southwest would be good for the country Our people estimate that if $15 oil prices lasted for two years, it would take about 1/2 percentage point off the inflation rate and add about 3/4 of a percentage point to the real GDP rate nationally   I came into the meeting, Mr Chairman, thinking that the time was coming soon to ease off the accelerator a bit but that it probably wasn't here yet Then I was influenced very much by the statements of Messrs Broaddus, Angell, Lindsey, and Mullins I think Mr Mullins gave a good argument for doing something now, although I don't think that was his conclusion It's a close call whether to wait or to go ahead and do something now However, I'm glad, for three reasons, that you did not try to split the difference with no change now but [to adopt] an asymmetric directive One is that I tend to be against the frequent use of asymmetric directives on principle, primarily because it's the main thing that is inhibiting our moving to a prompter release of our decisions I think we need to move to that and the use of an asymmetric directive complicates that in general Number two, I don't want us to appear to be responding to strong growth statistics; and I think the statistics are all going to be strong in the next few weeks and [if we move] it's going to appear that we're anti-growth And I think the public ought to understand that being against inflation is not the same thing as being against growth And the third reason is one that someone has mentioned and  -35-    12/21/93  that is that this is likely to be the beginning of a series of moves and is important enough for us to do at a meeting when we all [participate in the decision] I would rather tighten slightly now than have no change now with an asymmetric directive, but I'm prepared to follow your suggestion   I would support the proposal I think I heard Al Broaddus saying that since the line wouldn't be used to peg the exchange rate then it is likely to be used for some other purpose that would be less legitimate and outside of our scope However, a crawling peg is a peg when you reach the limit of the crawling peg And at that point it does become an exchange rate stabilization tool Also, I would like to associate myself with Jerry Jordan's introductory comments where he pointed out that if we have problems    3/22/94  with swaps, we ought to deal with that as a generic matter and not deal just with the case of Mexico   I have just a fairly narrow question This says we are considering a substantial enlargement of the Federal Reserve and Treasury swap lines with Mexico We are the central bank, the Treasury is the finance ministry, and Mexico is a country I see in the footnote, though, that the swap line is with the Bank of Mexico and with the Mexicans Is it central bank to central bank--   Along the lines Larry was getting at, I think it's reassuring that we are dealing with the central bank rather than the government or the treasury   One of the benefits of an immediate announcement is that it eliminates any perception of leaks, so I would suggest that we always do it at the end of the meeting rather than have a hiatus   Eleventh District employment growth has been greater than the national average for some time, but so far this year it has been below the national average I suspect that that's because much of the country is recovering from recession while the Eleventh District is just recovering from sluggish growth On the other hand, hours worked in manufacturing in the District continue to be at record levels; the weekly figure is 432 right now In addition to a weaker rubber band effect in the Eleventh District, low energy prices and the absence of a major automobile manufacturing sector probably have something to do with our relative weakness We apparently don't benefit from manufacturing of automobiles and we don't have a parts industry like the Boston District does  The actual pickup in major economic activity from NAFTA still seems to be in the future, although there is a lot of activity going on with companies positioning themselves to do more trade and new entrepreneurial start-ups trying to figure out how to trade There is some confusion on just how to do it and some lag in the ability of public authorities to teach people about the proper paperwork and so forth All indications are that NAFTA trade is going to be a very big deal soon You probably heard that Dallas was chosen as the Labor Secretariat location for NAFTA, a good right-to-work state getting that honor  -31-    3/22/94  Construction of homes has been fairly strong in the District, creating some shortages of building materials, particularly bricks but also glass and other materials, and some shortages of skilled construction workers; we have reports of some upward pressure on building materials prices and on blue collar wages relative to white collar wages As for news from board meetings, I guess the most significant news I'll admit is that the Houston Board, which perennially is our most negative board in terms of its assessment of local economic activity, reportedly had a very upbeat board meeting last week They are talking about a lot of new strengths in the Houston economy, which has been the weakest major metropolitan area in the District Loan demand has picked up considerably and the larger banks are reportedly seeking loans very aggressively A couple of weeks ago we had a meeting of our Advisory Council on Small Business and Agriculture and  --used to report that when he tried to get a loan from a bank it was not "no," it was "hell no" He now reports that it's not "yes," it's "hell yes" [Laughter] If you're looking for potential weaknesses in the economy, I would just offer the possibility that a lot of people refinanced their house in 1992 and 1993 and when income tax time comes there may be some negative surprises for them in the next month  With respect to the national economy, I have no comment on the Greenbook except that it contains more "blue" than usual   Recently, growth rates of the narrow measures of money have slowed and the broad measures, if you adjust them for stock  -38-    3/22/94  and bond flows, have slowed The only measure that has accelerated has been the monetary base and that's entirely in currency Where is the currency going?   In the last couple of months, interest rates have risen a good bit and all the monetary aggregates that count in this country have slowed Would you say we have had a significant tightening already?   It sounds as if you're saying the signals are jammed   I favor 25 basis points, prefer symmetric, and would urge you to consider announcing our decision   The economy in the Eleventh District continues to grow moderately, about in line with the national growth rate, possibly a little weaker Our expansion is broadly based, with the exception of energy and defense-related sectors Construction in particular is very strong; it moves from strong to booming in some areas that are benefiting from relocations from other parts of the country Median prices of existing houses are up 6 to 10 percent depending on what market one is talking about Construction is going on all around me, and my house is the only one that I know of that has not gone up in estimated value I just got that in the mail  SPEAKER(?) Maybe it's because of the residents!   It's a big mystery The gains in nonresidential construction are also significant, matching those in housing Retail, warehouse, and industrial buildings are strong throughout the District Even commercial property is beginning to rise in price, although there is still a lot of excess commercial property in the  -19-    5/17/94  major metropolitan areas, including an old Reserve Bank building in Dallas that is still on the market  As I've indicated, we are benefiting a good bit from relocations We are benefiting from being in what we refer to as the low-wage, low-cost center of the North American free trade area now We've been asking our directors and Beigebook contacts questions about pressures on prices and wages for some time We are getting some indications that price pressures are beginning to appear, and some wage pressures have been mentioned This is the first time since 1985 that people in our area are mentioning upward pressure on wages  I don't really have anything of value to add about the national economy except that it seems a lot stronger than the first- quarter GDP numbers would indicate, especially the real final sales number Then the April retail sales number brings to mind a Richard Pryor comment, "Who are you going to believe, me or your own lying eyes?" There seems to be a conflict between those numbers and the feel of the economy out there  When I talk to people about policy, there seems to be a difference of opinion on whether we're ahead of the curve, too far ahead of the curve, or behind the curve There's more uniformity of opinion, though, that we need to do what we're going to do quickly and get it behind us I often hear that we're creating uncertainty with small steps, and they urge us to do what we need to do As a matter of fact, last week we had a vote in our board meeting on a discount rate recommendation dissented from the vote, but even he said whatever you do don't do it piecemeal Thank you   I support your recommendation   The Eleventh District economy is essentially unchanged from my last few reports The tone in our directors' meetings is essentially unchanged The tone of our Beigebook respondents is slightly stronger this time than it has been recently Price pressures in the District seem to be concentrated in construction-related materials, paper and packaging products, and very little price pressure is noticeable in retail stores  On important national issues, our economists tell me that we are at full employment, that the inventory buildup is largely voluntary, that the slow growth in the monetary aggregates that we have been having is largely benign, and that the risk in the forecast is on the upside rather than the down side both for real growth and for inflation On the weakness in retail sales that we have had in the past few months, I might mention that one national retailer based in Dallas reports that in the last few weeks, particularly in the pre- school season, their sales have been excellent; they have been above expectations They also report that price increases are hard to come by I give you an early warning, at a couple of our board meetings, our banker directors, who all tend to be representatives of smaller banks in our District--[Laughter] Well, it's a long story, and hopefully the story is not repeating, but what they are reporting is that competition for loans is getting very aggressive and the large banks are so aggressive on pricing and credit standards, that they wonder if they aren't making some loans that should not be made   I support your proposal   Peter, you said a good bit more than usual about the Mexican peso this time Is that just because they had an election in August or is this a reflection of the prospect that we are going to be paying more attention as they increase their role as our trading partner?   I understand that in May Mexico replaced Japan as our second largest export market, but in July Japan took second place back again    9/27/94   Mike, this is a follow-up to Bob Parry's earlier question to Joan In Part II of the Greenbook, Section III-1, there is a sentence that says "The press release announcing the August policy moves was widely interpreted as indicating that subsequent action was on hold, at least for a few months, and longer-term rates initially fell somewhat" Is that saying that you think the rates fell because of the "on hold" phrase as opposed to the action itself?   It's sort of interesting that we seem to be in a situation where we could get a positive market reaction either by tightening or announcing we are not going to tighten   Eleventh District business conditions remain good and essentially unchanged from my last several reports There are no significant new straws in the wind except perhaps on the fashion front where I understand that mohair is gaining in popularity I'm told that the Eleventh District produces 90 percent of the country's mohair We have a lot of "mos" [Laughter]   There's a lot of dust being raised by companies getting ready to do business in Mexico under NAFTA, and unfortunately there are some signs of non-tariff restrictions replacing tariffs as a barrier to trade  In August, I reported complaints by some small banks of very aggressive competition in lending from larger banks We have had people examining that more carefully and their early reports are that that is more a matter of price and spreads than standards  I can't really add to anything that has been provided to us or reported here today on the national economy except my caution that we should keep an eye on the further slowing of all of the monetary aggregates and bank reserves, especially in the context of a fiscal policy that's not as expansive as we used to see it I understand that that has not been a problem today, but we shouldn't forget about the aggregates; we should see what is going on there and keep them in mind  -26-    9/27/94   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I do trust your judgment on timing, although I would like to associate myself with Jerry Jordan on my general feelings toward asymmetric directives   The economy in the Dallas District continues to show moderate to strong growth across the board Virtually every sector seems to be expanding with the exception of livestock production At our board of directors meeting last Thursday, the reports were uniformly upbeat Every region within the District reported positive news The only negative reports were scattered slowdowns in single-family housing construction, but even these reports noted strong gains in other construction activity such as apartment, shopping center, and industrial construction Our Beigebook contacts and numerous other reports from around the District noted a significant boost in both price and wage pressures over the last several weeks This represents a sea change from previous reports, and if this is a start of a new trend, it implies serious consequences for monetary policy More and more industries are reporting reaching or approaching capacity limitations as well as a newfound ability to pass on some of their higher input costs to the next stage of production or consumption  The national economy, as best as we can tell, is showing the same early signs of overheating as the Eleventh District Various resource constraints rather than demand conditions seem to be the major factor determining the growth of output Although the statistical measures of price and wage inflation have yet to show an upward trend, we can't help but notice that the Beigebook reports from around the nation indicate a pickup in price and wage pressures that may suggest a red alert for the Federal Reserve As I look at the  -18-    11/15/94  national economy, the Greenbook seems to have the current state of affairs about right, but I expect that the staff forecast may have underestimated the strong forward momentum in the economy as we go into 1995 The risks to the forecast both with respect to growth and to inflationary pressures seem to be that we have underestimated the underlying strength of the economy   Mr Chairman, in my opinion strong action is warranted today, but I don't think we should prejudge future actions I, for one, particularly don't want to commit today to a series of increases that add up to 150 basis points and that will result in a hard landing as depicted in the Greenbook So, I would support your recommendation for 75 basis points I also believe that part of the justification for such an increase has to do with the weakness of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets, and I think it would be helpful if that is cited as one of the reasons for the action today  As we go forward from today, I would bear some cautions in mind One is that we shouldn't forget the lag When we started tightening in February we were doing it for anticipated inflation reasons, not for current reasons and that still applies today We can't fight today's inflation with today's policy Another point to keep in mind is that policy already has tightened considerably more than the 1-3/4 point increase in the fed funds rate, both in terms of long-term interest rates and particularly in terms of the sharp slowdown in all the monetary aggregates so far this year; even the aggregates adjusted for stock fund increases have slowed considerably I just think we should keep that in mind   Mike, how much additional fed funds increase is built into your forecast?   Mr Chairman, it seems though that that would be easier to do if the Greenbook based its projections on where policy is currently What we have here is a Greenbook that assumes a further tightening, the amount of which is unspecified So that makes it very difficult for us to--  Bluebook  I must have missed it when I read the Greenbook, but just now you said a 6-1/2 to 7 percent funds rate Surely, it was one or the other or 6-3/4 It seems sort of vague   The economy in the Eleventh District continues to show the same healthy rate of growth that has been in place throughout 1994 We have been looking intensively for signs of slowing activity in response to tighter monetary policy So far the only perceptible slowdown has been in single-family construction, which peaked in April, but this decline has been more than offset by strong activity in multifamily and nonresidential construction There has been no slowing in the rate of expansion of the most interest- rate-sensitive sectors of our manufacturing industries--rubber, plastics, lumber, nonelectrical and electrical machinery, primary and fabricated metals, furniture, paper, stone, clay, glass, all of those Defense-related and energy-related manufacturing are the only areas other than single-family construction that show signs of weakness I continue to hear scattered reports of price and wage pressures, but the number of these reports seems to have dissipated since the last FOMC meeting Nonetheless, capacity constraints are strong and possibly intensifying for electronics, petrochemicals, and paper products Wage pressures are reported in the electronics,  -17-    12/20/94  telecommunications, fabricated metals, and trucking industries Firms in the temporary help industry expect even greater difficulty recruiting skilled workers next year, which could put even more pressure on wages and prices In spite of growing pressures on wages in several industries and rising materials prices in a number of others, we have seen little evidence of price rises on final goods and services, especially at the retail level In fact, our Beigebook contacts in the retailing sector tell us that intensified competition in recent months has brought the average of their selling prices below those of a year ago  As the Greenbook points out, we have all consistently underestimated the strength of the economy throughout this year All the risks seem to be on the up side at this stage with respect to real growth as well as inflationary pressures The improvement of job prospects, consumer confidence, and credit availability are propelling strong growth in the consumer sector The need to add to capacity is putting upward pressure on investment spending Stronger economies in Europe and Latin America will be increasing our export demand There is nothing in the new fiscal policy proposals that would stifle these demand pressures Quite the contrary, the anticipation of tax cuts will likely add to demand pressures, capacity constraints, and price and wage pressures in the coming months Mr Chairman, I'll defer the next sentence!   I agree with your proposal   Peter, I understand that some Fed watchers, in trying to decide whether to blame the Federal Reserve for the weakness of the dollar, have pointed to the fact that the dollar price of gold has not gone up very much while the mark and yen prices of gold have gone down On that basis they pretty much absolve us from blame and say it's more of a mark and yen problem than it is a dollar problem Do you take any comfort in that view?   To what degree do you think we have a dollar problem as opposed to a mark and yen problem?   The Eleventh District has slowed somewhat over the past few months, and most of the slowing seems to be in Texas rather than in our parts of New Mexico and Louisiana A member of our Advisory Council on Small Business and Agriculture said with respect to New Mexico that they had "hit the three cherries" there this past year I am not familiar with that terminology, [Laughter] but it probably would apply to Louisiana whose rebound last year seems to have a lot to do with the gaming industry The picture in Texas is mixed; employment declined in January for the first time in thirty months, but it rebounded in February The biggest negative for Texas, of course, is the situation in Mexico, both actual and prospective Our staff has conducted three special Beigebook surveys on expectations about the impact of Mexico's problems on Texas businesses, and each of those surveys has gotten more pessimistic about the overall impact on Texas Dozens of retail establishments have closed in most of our border towns Unemployment is up all along the border With respect to Mexico itself, given that their economic policies in recent years have been fundamentally sound, the austerity program that this country apparently has been pushing on them seems unnecessarily harsh to me and may prove to be counterproductive in the long run  As for the national economy, about the only straw in the wind that I have picked up that others may not have picked up has to do with retail sales JC Penney, which I regard as the retailer to the  -20-    3/28/95  middle class, is having in March its second consecutive decline in sales   I agree with your recommendation for no change in the federal funds rate I agree with your recommendation for an asymmetric directive, although I normally prefer symmetry, not only to signal our leaning in regard to inflation fighting but also in regard to the dollar   I wonder if Peter would comment on whether he is holding the fed funds rate up to 6 percent or down to 6 percent  -4-    5/23/95   Employment growth in the Eleventh District has slowed somewhat in recent months Beginning in the second quarter of 1989, the Eleventh District had 22 consecutive quarters of faster employment growth than the United States as a whole In the past two quarters, our employment growth has converged with the US rate and it is now only about average The impact of the peso crisis in Mexico is no doubt an important factor in the relative slowing in the Eleventh District, as trade with Mexico is roughly four times as important for us as it is for the country as a whole The index of leading indicators for Texas peaked last August and has been fairly weak since then The weakest component of that index is the Texas value of the dollar because the peso is so important in the Southwest We are, however, encouraged by the rapid adjustment in the Mexican trade balance and the fact that it has come more from increasing Mexican exports than from declining Mexican imports On the inflation side, we are not getting new reports of accelerating wages and price pressures in District surveys and in our discussions  On the national scene, the slowdown has been fairly sharp, even sharper than is reflected in the fourth- and first-quarter GDP numbers Growth in real final sales went from 57 percent to 18 percent, a fairly sharp decline Of course, this has been accompanied by sharp reductions in intermediate- and long-term interest rates The yield curve is getting considerably flatter If one looks at a graph of the slope of the yield curve plotted against business cycle dates, it tends to make one a little bit nervous Generally when the yield curve becomes negative, when short-term interest rates are being increased relative to long-term rates, a recession follows However, I think, as Al Broaddus indicated, that a natural correction occurs in the economy when interest rates can weaken as a result of weakening economic activity We have to be cautious not to stand in the way of that for too long The yield curve is not negative yet, but it is getting closer and that puts us in a more precarious position, given  -19-    5/23/95  the game of chicken that the Administration is playing with Japan over trade policies So, the conditions for some unstable financial market activities, both domestic and foreign, are there We should be cautious in the months ahead   I think the risks are somewhat unbalanced to the down side, and I think the recent performance of the economy would argue for some easing today, but the markets have already done that, both interest rates and the exchange market I think they already are providing some support for the economy I agree with your recommendation   The Eleventh District continues to show modest overall growth with a noticeable flattening of employment growth in New Mexico and Louisiana being offset by slightly improving employment in Texas High-tech industries like electronics, semiconductors, computers, and communications services, which are increasingly important in the Eleventh District, continue to be an important source of regional growth Our contacts in real estate are voicing a renewed sense of optimism particularly in single-family construction, which is believed to finally have hit bottom However, we are beginning to hear of some fears of overbuilding of apartments, particularly in the Dallas area, and banks in the District have indicated that concerns about apartment overbuilding have led them to tighten standards for apartment construction loans Retail sales have improved somewhat in most parts of the Eleventh District in recent months, with the notable exception of the cities along the Mexican border where conditions continue to deteriorate Most of our peso-sensitive manufacturing industries have been showing flat or declining employment, with electronics and electronic equipment as I previously mentioned being the exception Electronics have benefitted from strong worldwide demand, and our contacts have indicated that prices have been falling at a slower rate than previously, which has added somewhat to inflationary pressures We continue to hear scattered reports of tight labor markets but little about wage pressures  On the national scene, we really have no significant quibbles with the Greenbook The only bit of inside information I have to share with you is that up through the middle of August, sales of  nationwide have been weaker than expected They have maintained unit sales, but have done so only by cutting prices The weakest areas are in the Northeast and the Southwest   I support the Mack Bill   Over the past few meetings I have been reporting that the Eleventh District economy has slowed from its very strong growth in 1994 to something a little less strong this year This month's Beigebook singled out Dallas and New York as the two Districts whose economies have slowed I should emphasize that the slowing is from growth at a very strong pace to a more moderate pace and not a decline For example, in Texas which makes up the bulk of the Eleventh District economy, employment growth is running at 34 percent, only slightly weaker than the 38 percent posted over the preceding months Industrial production increased at a 21 percent  -21-    9/26/95  annual rate in July, as manufacturing output rebounded from four months of weakness The housing picture has improved Single-family permits are 7 percent above last year's level, and last year was a very good year Gross state product increased at an annual rate of 53 percent in the first quarter according to our estimate, and we expect a pretty good number for the current quarter but probably not as high as in the first quarter Mexico continues to exert a significant drag on the District economy, but not enough to turn the overall picture sour And in fact, lost exports to Mexico have been largely made up by a surge in exports to other parts of the world  Last Thursday, we had a joint meeting of our Houston board and our small business and agricultural advisory council, and the members generally supported the view that overall business activity is in pretty good shape, although they reflected diminished confidence about the future They seem to be in somewhat of a funk about the future All the signs are indicating that we are having a huge turn in the Eleventh District in that our economy is remaking itself very significantly We are moving from cow chips to computer chips! [Laughter] To give you some anecdotal indications of what is going on, AMD and Motorola have each just finished billion dollar semiconductor plants in Austin Applied Materials, which manufactures equipment used in chip production, has added 1,000 jobs in Austin Texas Instruments is speeding up construction of its new microchip factory in Dallas National Semiconductor is doubling the capacity of its Arlington plant and will spend $600 million annually over the next five years to expand capacity Dell, Compaq, and Hitachi are all seeing strong growth This is all computer-related activity, but we also are seeing big advances in other high-tech areas such as telecommunications Ikea is building a second plant in Fort Worth Ericsson was just awarded a $300 million contract to build an advanced wireless communications technology facility and will be hiring 800 people within the year PCS Prime, a telecommunications company, is putting its national headquarters in Dallas These are some of the "biggies" and there also are a number of small companies expanding or moving into the area Very strong global demand for high-tech products continues to stimulate demand for Eleventh District exports Thanks to the remake of the District over the past decade, we not only are relying less on cows than we were but also less on oil and gas The share of the oil and gas sector in the Texas economy has declined from roughly 18 percent in 1982 to about 6 percent today Our health services industry is now almost as large as the oil and gas industry In short, a lot of activity is going on that is adding a lot of stimulus to our regional economy, and all that is in addition to the stimulative impact we expect to get from Deion Sanders when he arrives [Laughter]  On the national economy, the slowing of inflation has been very welcome, and I think the probability of a recession has receded significantly The economy probably could take some stimulus without an acceleration of inflation On the other hand, the situation is right for a further ratcheting down of inflation I believe that policy decisions at this juncture probably depend more on the priority we give our goals than on the state of the economy   Another part of the monetary base's behavior, of course, is that currency and bank reserves have been declining for a good while Currency was growing very rapidly earlier, but now something is happening to it Can you tell us what it is and whether it has any implications for anything?   Just for your information, a little arithmetic exercise I did--if we have CPI increases that average two-tenths of a percent each month through December, the December-to-December rate would be 28 percent I support your recommendation   Not very much has changed in the Eleventh District since the last FOMC meeting Employment growth remains strong; it is weaker than it was in 1994, but it is stronger than that of the nation At the margin, the expansion of high-tech industries is accounting for a large portion of our employment growth To give you some longer-term statistics, over the last six years high-tech employment has grown four times as fast as total non-agricultural employment in Texas and more than twice as fast as high-tech employment in the nation The growth of high-tech industries has been tightening the market for office space and other nonresidential real estate in our major cities This is primarily in the outer edges of the cities, though, rather than the inner cities Single-family home construction has picked up Single-family permits rose at a 10 percent annual rate in the third quarter, and many homebuilders are raising their forecasts for 1995 This strength has been driven at least as much by business relocations as it has by lower mortgage rates Many Austin and Dallas firms are recruiting heavily from out-  -34-    11/15/95  of-state because of tight labor markets for certain skilled workers, engineers and programmers primarily The Mexican border area remains a weak spot At our board of directors meeting last Thursday, all of our directors' reports were up except for El Paso and Brownsville Earlier in the year, we kept hearing reports that businesses have been through and have survived other peso crises But there seems to be a lot less bravado these days than there was in the early months of that crisis Retail merchants continue to shut down The limit on how much Mexican citizens can buy in the United States without paying a duty when they cross the bridge back into Mexico has been raised back up from $50 to $400 on November 1st But given the cut of about 50 percent in the purchasing power of the peso on the other side of the border, it is probably going to be irrelevant at this point  On the national economy, I am pleased to see the less binding view of supply-side constraints in the potential rate of growth contained in the staff forecast This accords well with my own views and recent economic results The broad outlines of the Greenbook forecast seem to me to be about right and reflect the fact that growth momentum has been stronger than we suspected and inflationary pressures a touch weaker than we had thought earlier I differ from the Greenbook in that I think the rates of real growth forecast for 1996 and 1997 do not appear to call for an upward revision to the inflation forecast in those years Mike started off his briefing by talking about retail sales I might just mention that although  had a terrible October, they report that nationally the first two weeks of November have been very strong   Ditto   The economy in the Eleventh District continues to be healthy Throughout 1995, we kept hearing that employment growth had slowed in our District and that we were converging toward the slower rate of growth in the nation as a whole These District estimates kept being revised up Through October, employment growth has been about 3 percent for the year, about double the rate of the country as a whole Reports from our directors and Beigebook contacts suggest moderate to strong growth across virtually all the Dallas District We had a joint board meeting last week of all of our offices, and the reports were quite upbeat The directors from the major cities in Texas were competing with each other in claiming that their local economies were stronger and that they were more on the leading edge of high tech It's been quite a while since there has been that sort of competition and optimism in our District There were some exceptions, though Retail is doing poorly Agriculture has been hurt by low beef prices, especially low beef prices relative to grain prices, and by boll weevils in the cotton fields Our areas along the Mexican border are flat overall, with weak retail results being offset by strong construction activities related to the maquiladora operations on the Mexican side of the border These factories continue to expand as they benefit from the weak peso and the resulting low wages in dollar terms Our friends at tell us that sales in recent weeks have been absolutely terrible, with general merchandise and apparel sales being at recession levels My concern is that this weak performance will pass through to reduced orders, a rundown of bloated inventories, production cutbacks, and all the rest  I fear that without some reduction of monetary restraint, the economy at the national level could run out of momentum before very long I think our research economists would almost without exception  -20-    12/19/95  agree with Mike Prell's five points My instinct is that the downside risks are somewhat greater than that   I agree with the proposal   For the most part, the Eleventh District's economy is showing reasonably healthy overall growth, but as always there are a few pockets of weakness In the last ten days, we have met with our board of directors, our Financial Institutions Advisory Council, and our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council The messages we got are pretty much the same Our urban areas-- particularly Dallas, Houston, and Austin--are doing quite well, but the rural areas are hurting Cattle ranchers and cattle feeders are having a disastrous year so far Conditions are expected to get worse, and the fallout is affecting our smaller communities  Once we get to the rest of the economy, conditions look a lot brighter The stabilization of the Mexican economy has given an additional boost to our export demand Retail sales along the border area have improved a little lately Demand for computer chips and semiconductors remains strong, and five out of the six large chip plants under construction in the Eleventh District will produce    3/26/96  customized chips Whether we are in the early stages of an overexpansion and excess capacity remains an open question, but more and more people are beginning to express the view that when the next big shoe drops and affects the economy, it will be a boot filled with computer chips  Our construction sector is quite strong and some markets are beginning to heat up, particularly the industrial warehouse market where there is talk of 6 million square feet of speculative warehouse space coming on line in Dallas alone We also are hearing discussions indicating that the office market is back to where money is chasing office buildings While this may be a little exaggeration, we have been hearing for nearly a year that the office market has changed from a tenants' market to a landlords' market  The picture for the energy industry has been mixed Oil and gas extraction continues its downward trend in spite of the high-tech drilling activity that I referred to at the last meeting But the oil field machinery industry is expanding thanks to drilling demand The petrochemical industry has been adding to capacity in spite of recent soft demand and low prices Labor shortages continue to be mentioned as a constraint on further growth in a few industries Wage and price pressures seem to be contained Overall, the District shows moderate growth that probably is well above national growth rates  On the national economy, it seems that we are getting the soft landing we have been striving for, though perhaps the runway may be a little shorter than we like The risks seem reasonably well balanced, but that would not have been the case in my opinion had we not reduced the fed funds rate at our last meeting With respect to the Greenbook, I remain somewhat more optimistic than the staff with regard to the outlook for both real growth and inflation   I agree with your recommendation   I'll use my turn to compliment the chef on these cookies! [Laughter]   On balance, the Eleventh District economy has been experiencing moderate growth and the near-term prospects look reasonably good Employment growth in the first quarter was about the  -10-    5/21/96  same as nationally, but growth accelerated throughout the quarter Real estate and construction have tended to be among the strongest segments of the District economy Single-family construction is doing particularly well, with levels of starts and new permits in a few of our cities reaching levels not seen in about a decade Although this is still the exception, leasing activity in a few of our hotter commercial and office markets is being limited by a shortage of supply for the first time in about 15 years Manufacturing activity remains strong overall, corrugated box demand is on the rise, and we have seen shortages and rationing of cement Even in the semiconductor industry, where inventory has been growing and prices that had been falling are now flattening, the bad news is that output growth will slow dramatically from the rates of the last few years The good news is that the semiconductor demand is likely to grow by only 10 percent in the year ahead The oil price hike was temporary, and oil prices are now back to more sustainable levels Whatever boost the Dallas District gained from higher energy prices is behind us, and the industry is back on a long-term downtrend  While I have just emphasized areas of strength, there are two negatives that are worth mentioning First, the impact of drought conditions in much of our District has spread from hearing complaints from ranchers to hearing complaints also from farmers Beef cattle prices are at a 20-year low Grain prices are high, but District farmers have lost much of their crop and cotton producers are getting hurt as well Our agricultural bankers are reporting rising debt loads and delinquent payments The second cloud on the horizon is the prospect of an increase in the minimum wage to $515 The data from the establishment survey of wage and salary employment indicate that nearly one-fourth of Eleventh District employment consists of workers earning less than the proposed minimum wage, compared to about one- sixth in the nation as a whole Using the household survey narrows the gap considerably Either way, the Eleventh District states would bear a disproportionate burden of the negative employment impact of higher minimum wages  On the national economy, I am encouraged by the signs of strength, although the uptick in inflationary pressures, while having a number of transitory components, has worsened the inflation outlook On the other hand, bond and foreign exchange markets have already tightened and will be countering inflationary pressures as we go forward   Long-term rates are up substantially and the dollar is up a little, so we already have had some tightening in a sense Don and, I believe, Al Broaddus said that a tightening of the fed funds target right now is unlikely to affect long-term rates the way such a tightening did in early 1994 I agree with that, but we didn't expect the impact in 1994 either Also, there is a big difference between the present 5-1/4 percent funds rate target and the 3 percent target that existed then Our policy stance is not so clearly easy now in my opinion Also, it would bother me somewhat to base a tightening move on output and employment growth developments Inflation is up overall, but its rise has been mainly in measures that include energy and not in core inflation I think inflation is what we ought to be looking at more than the real sector I agree with your proposal for no change with a symmetric directive   The economy in the Eleventh District has remained on a firm uptrend throughout the summer Conversations with our directors and other contacts suggest continuation of more of the same, with some minor slowing during the remainder of the year There are two and possibly three areas of weakness in the District economy First, the drought is still a factor, but overall it's not exerting a material impact on the regional economy The semiconductor industry has continued to weaken since the last FOMC meeting; unit orders for semiconductors continue to fall Some types like microprocessors and digital signal processors have been in strong demand, but this has not been sufficient to overcome the weak demand for memory chips Several Texas semiconductor firms have announced layoffs or hiring freezes, with the result that employment at firms manufacturing electronic equipment fell at a 6 percent annual rate in June This industry represents about 12 percent of Texas manufacturing employment and 1-1/2 percent of Texas nonagricultural employment Construction of single-family housing is still strong but most builders and real estate contacts expect a noticeable slowing in the coming months as the impact of higher mortgage rates begins to take hold  Several sectors of the District economy have continued to improve Improvements in the Mexican economy have spurred retail sales gains along the border, and we hear that affluent Mexican shoppers are back in large numbers in the Houston Galleria area The energy sector continues to expand, with every available rig in the Gulf of Mexico reported to be under contract The anticipated softening of housing construction may be a good thing because it will free up badly needed resources for the construction of industrial warehouse space, commercial real estate, and maybe a year from now a rebirth of office building construction, which has been almost dormant in our area for a decade Vacancy rates in suburban markets have fallen considerably in the last year or so, and office rents are  -20-    8/20/96  beginning to reflect the shortages of available space A similar churning in resource allocation is occurring in electronics manufacturing Falling chip prices have helped Texas computing manufacturers Advances in technology are beginning to reduce the demand for paging devices and to boost that for personal communications services devices This has shifted the demand for a wide range of workers to businesses located only a few miles away  Overall, the national economy seems to be performing quite well I agree with the broad outlines of the Greenbook forecast The rate of economic growth will likely slow somewhat in the months ahead, but inflationary pressures could begin to accelerate, although I don't think that is guaranteed  On the question of the inflation outlook, it is somewhat surprising to me to see all the emphasis that people in this room place on wage-push inflation, which I recall learning in school was dependent on an accommodative monetary policy The first line of defense is productivity improvements and the second is Clint Eastwood's "don't even think about it" monetary restraint   I support your recommendation   Economic growth in the Eleventh District has continued to run a little faster than the national average In recent months, we have benefited from higher energy prices, the rebound in the Mexican economy, and strong warehouse construction activity following the deregulation of trucking The Texas rig count has risen 22 percent so far this year, with the result that business and consumer sentiment is quite high in Houston and Midland With the rebound in the Mexican economy, exports from Texas to Mexico were up 17 percent in real terms in the first half of 1996 and are back to levels that prevailed prior to the peso devaluation Rail and truck traffic also has returned to predevaluation levels Optimism along the border is slowly returning Three months ago, only 10 percent of El Paso employers planned to hire additional workers; in a recent survey, more than 26 percent planned to hire new workers Construction activity in the District is expected to remain strong, as falling vacancy rates and rising rents improve the anticipated returns on offices, warehouses, and retail space Office and retail rents have been rising in recent months In some markets, first class office space is about fully absorbed Warehouse construction continues to be strong particularly in Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, and El Paso This construction activity has more than offset a very mild slowing in residential construction  We continue to hear increased anecdotes about tight labor markets and rising pressure on wages, and we hear more rumblings that the higher labor costs will have to be passed on in higher prices at some point in the future But so far, there is little anecdotal evidence of widespread price increases At both our board of directors meeting and the meeting of our advisory council on small business and agriculture, there were frequent mentions of shortages of a wide variety of workers and of wage boosts that were considerable in some instances In some but not all cases, prices have been increased, with rising wages as the justification    9/24/96 -5-  Regarding the national economy, I agree with the broad outline of the near-term outlook in the Greenbook Some signs of slowing have begun to show up and growth more in line with the economy's long-run potential seems more likely than was the case at the time of our August meeting The risks, however, appear to be on the up side for both growth and inflationary pressures If anything, the risks have risen over the past several weeks, but I continue to feel that we may be worrying too much about sizable employment growth and low unemployment rates when prices themselves and leading indicators of final prices, such as prices of commodities and metals, including gold, are behaving so well   I support the Chairman and his recommendation   I would like to congratulate Peter on his record period of nonintervention   The expansion of the Eleventh District economy has slowed a little from its rapid pace earlier, but it is still fairly strong The strengths certainly outweigh the weaknesses On the up side, higher oil and gas prices are a positive for us at least, boosting activity in the energy industry in the Southwest The Mexican economy is rebounding, adding to the demand for District goods and services Nonhousing construction activity is strong in the District, particularly office buildings, warehouses, and industrial space Call centers are hiring all the people they can get, and there are many reports of labor market tightness On the down side, the electronics industry is weaker than a year ago We have seen about a 3 percent decline in electronics-related jobs as compared with 5 percent growth over the previous two years Homebuilding has dropped off a bit Employment in motor vehicles manufacturing is down and more layoffs are expected in coming months On the whole, it is fairly clear that growth remains strong in the District, though it is moderating a little from its earlier pace  Turning to the question of upward price pressures, the bottom line, as other people also have indicated, is that we do not see much evidence of such pressures yet There has been a lot of evidence both statistical and anecdotal that the labor market is tight in our part of the country On the other hand, there is little evidence that the tightness is translating into upward pressures on prices The labor picture is interesting I have heard a lot of stories recently and have seen some of the problems that companies increasingly are experiencing in their efforts to find enough help at the lower end of the wage spectrum We hear of restaurants offering signing bonuses for new employees People are going into 7-Elevens and getting a job offer when they are not even looking for work [Laughter]   Well, I am not getting any respect as a result of that offer! [Laughter] My own evidence of the tightness in the labor markets came just before the elections For the first time in my life, I was polled about my political views, and the interviewer had trouble reading the questions to me She never could pronounce the word "conservative"   I don't know where she was from  SPEAKER(?) Massachusetts! [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for no change, and I can vote for your recommendation to stay with asymmetry toward tightening It would be embarrassing to go to a symmetric directive and then rapidly have to go back to asymmetry On the other hand, if the economy weakens further and more sharply than we expect, it could also be embarrassing to go into a downturn with a tilt toward tightening So, like Governor Rivlin, I do not feel nearly as "asymmetric" as I did at the last two or three meetings   The Eleventh District economy has continued its reduced, modest pace of expansion over the recent period The typical situation in our District is for employment growth to be higher than the national average, but with the unemployment rate higher as well because of net in-migration That pattern was reversed in the course of 1996, with employment growth slowing but the unemployment rate also falling The latter fell to slightly below the national average, its lowest level in fifteen years The unemployment rate in Texas is 52 percent, and if we took away the counties along the Mexican border it would be 47 percent Of course, on the basis of the commentaries so far this morning, at least before Jack Guynn spoke, it appears that we all have unemployment rates below the national average, [laughter] suggesting a Lake Wobegon economy The recovery in the Mexican and Californian economies has apparently slowed our labor force growth and the growth of anecdotal evidence of tight labor markets, but the upward pressure on wages has not abated The slow expansion of employable labor apparently is constraining output growth  Factors contributing to strength in our area are higher oil prices, which are stimulating our shrunken energy sector, capacity limits, which are limiting the rig count right now, and the rebound in the Mexican economy In the first half of 1996, Texas exports to Mexico increased 17 percent--that is, at a 34 percent annual rate--and such exports have now surpassed their pre peso devaluation levels Based on the period since 1986, Texas exports to Mexico normally would grow at a rate of about 14 percent compared to a 34 percent rate this year Our construction sector, both residential and commercial, also has been a strong factor for us in 1996 Home prices are rising again after a long dry period, as are office rents, and announcements of new commercial projects are increasing Contributing to weakness in Texas this year are the drought, the downturn in the semiconductor industry worldwide, and the slower labor force growth  On the national economy we have no major quarrel with the Greenbook Our estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter is somewhat below the Greenbook estimate of 23 percent, although our estimate was made before the strong industrial production number came in for November I am not sure what to make of it, but I am struck by the fact that in both 1995 and 1996 we have had only one strong quarter in each of those years, with growth in the other six quarters being very unimpressive I am sorry to see the overall CPI in 1996 break the string of years below 3 percent, but the reason is primarily energy-related The opposite occurred in 1986 when sharply declining    12/17/96  energy prices brought the overall CPI well below the core CPI It seems to me that the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, the price of gold, commodity prices, and the growth of the monetary aggregates are all fairly reassuring on the inflation front   I support your recommendation   The economy in the Eleventh District remains healthy While  data for January showed an actual decline in District employment levels, I am inclined to  discount those figures because of weather-related factors and because they are inconsistent  with the anecdotal evidence that we have been getting from all our boards of directors and  advisory councils The composition of growth in the Eleventh District has shifted somewhat  Last year's downturn in the computer chip industry seems to be behind us, and the industry  is once again announcing expansion plans Job gains in our District's semiconductor  industry are expected to be about 10 percent this year, offsetting the losses of last year    3/25/97  As both Tom Hoenig and Jack Guynn mentioned for their Districts, oil and gas  drilling continues to move forward at all-out, full capacity The rig count in Texas is 20  percent above a year ago Shortages of rigs and crews continue to be reported There is a  widespread feeling that the drop in oil prices over the last few months will not result in any  drilling slowdown because it is the use of new technology that is making drilling profitable at  prices anywhere above $18 The use of 3-D seismic techniques has drastically reduced the  number of dry holes, both on land and at sea, if you can imagine a dry hole at sea  [Laughter]  The construction sector showed signs of slowing over the last few months in  single-family and multifamily homes, industrial and warehouse space, and retail shopping  centers Office construction continues to rebound from fairly low levels, and a large number  of medium-size projects have been announced recently, especially in far north Dallas I  might add that when I moved to Dallas six years ago, this was the very region that had the  greatest concentration of RTC properties in Texas Obviously, the glut is over This has  been reflected in rising commercial rents in the suburban areas There are even scattered  reports that prices of prime shopping center property have doubled over the last year or so  We continue to see signs that the Mexican economy is coming back, although there  apparently is still more slack in Mexico than in Utah [Laughter] Warehouse space in  Laredo is fully leased, and reports are coming in from both our border and inland cities that  Mexican shoppers are returning However, retail sales to Mexicans remain below  pre-devaluation levels, partly because Wal-Mart and other US retailers have opened outlets  on the Mexican side of the border    3/25/97  As for wage and price pressures in the District, it seems like the same song,  seventh verse Wages overall appear to be increasing on a slowly rising gradient, but  exceptions to this generalization have been reported with increasing frequency Still, they  are sporadic exceptions against the backdrop of a steady trend As for pressures on final  prices of goods and services, we hear an unending story that competitive pressures negate the  ability of business firms to pass cost increases forward  Turning to the national economy, it is difficult to find signs of weakness or  imbalances The inflation picture in the Eleventh District is a reflection of the trends I see  nationally Consumer and producer price increases have been subdued The broader  inflation measures look even better As for inflation in the pipeline, gold and commodity  prices do not suggest too many reasons to be concerned M2 growth does, however, remain  on the high side, perhaps as a result of the pegging problem that Ed Boehne mentioned  earlier   Ditto [Laughter]    3/25/97   I agree with your recommendation, and I also agree with  Governor Rivlin and Ed Boehne on the pro-growth rhetoric   If you want, I will tell you an Aggie joke! [Laughter]   Me?   Mr Chairman, the Republic of Texas and the Eleventh District  are much the same for all practical purposes, and they both continue to do as well as the  national economy Our job growth has been converging on the national mean for about a  year, after several years of stronger growth Positive factors contributing to the performance  of the Eleventh District include the continued recovery of the Mexican economy, the more  recent recovery in semiconductors, and technology-driven gains in oil and gas exploration  Based on my careful monitoring of cocktail party conversations--which I consider  an important part of my job description--I can report that Texas is experiencing a mild but    5/20/97  discernible mood shift having to do with the incipient recovery in commercial real estate  There have been several recent sightings of the construction crane, which had been the  national bird of Texas [laughter] but which has hardly been seen in the past 10 years and was  thought by many people to be extinct The emerging mood is one of exuberance, although  tempered and made more rational by the long memories of the people with whom I hang  around But even rational exuberance makes many Texans nervous given the bust that  followed the previous boom That sort of caution, of course, is to be expected and  welcomed  However, I hope the crowd around this table does not become overly nervous  about the recent show of strength of the national economy If the first quarter's 56 percent  real growth rate is too much for comfort, I suggest that we focus on the real final sales  number of only 38 percent That is still a high number, but we are already down the road  from the first quarter and have some "reassuringly" weak recent monthly numbers Let the  record show quotations marks around the word "reassuringly"  Industrial production was flat in April Payroll employment growth slowed in  March and April Retail sales declined slightly in April after being flat in March Producer  prices have declined for 4 consecutive months, down 6 percent in April CPI increases also  have moderated as energy prices have reversed last year's buildup The Greenbook has real  GDP rising only at a 18 percent rate in the second quarter and for the next 6 quarters it  projects growth rates of 25, 23, 21, 20, 19 and 19 percent As I understand it, these  projections assume no fed funds target rate increase until mid-1998 Even if strong real  growth were something to fear, those numbers would hardly seem frightening Actual  measured inflation also has declined in recent months The Greenbook has the first-quarter    5/20/97  CPI rate at 23 percent; its CPI forecast for the second quarter is 12-percent; then it rises to 3  percent in the second half of 1998 So, the Greenbook is forecasting rather slow real growth  as well as rather low CPI inflation While I do not remember past Greenbooks as well as  Jerry Jordan, I do recall that in recent times the Greenbook has underestimated real growth  and overestimated inflation more often than the other way around If that pattern is repeated,  it would make the outlook even better than the Greenbook anticipates  In terms of guides to monetary policy as it is currently practiced, I do not know  what is the precisely correct federal funds target rate Apparently a lot of people, including  Gail Cincotta, thought the correct rate was precisely 525 percent and that 55 percent is a  travesty I do not know, but I will note that when the recently lower inflation rate is taken  into account, the funds rate probably has increased by more than 25 basis points in real terms  Also, the recently reduced need for federal deficit financing seems to make the current target  rate tighter in some sense than it otherwise would be  If we look to market-based indicators as guidelines, they are fairly reassuring  Despite the recent backup in the yen, the dollar remains on the strong side and is probably  putting direct downward pressure on import prices and indirect downward pressure on the  prices of exportable goods Commodity and metals prices, including gold, also reveal little  buildup of inflationary pressures in the pipeline Unfortunately, money growth has picked up  recently to levels that used to be inflationary I hope the Greenbook is right in attributing that  money growth to the April surge in tax receipts, which should indicate a near-term reversal  In any case, money growth is about the only evidence that suggests to me the need for some  urgency to counter a potential rise in inflation Otherwise, warning signs are conspicuous by  their absence    5/20/97   I support your recommendation   Ted, in the Mexican bailout, we gave them money to refinance their  tesobonos, their dollar-guaranteed debt What is the money being loaned to Thailand to be used  for?   Mr Chairman, the Eleventh District economy, like the national  economy, has been exceptional I guess most of you saw the notice from the Shadow Open Market  Committee For the first time since 1974, they are going to skip a meeting, and the reason they  gave was that policy and the results of policy have been so good that there was nothing for them to  talk about    8/19/97  In our District, there is not much new to report We continue to have faster employment  growth than the nation Since the beginning of 1995, if we use January 1995 as the base, Eleventh  District growth is second only to that of the Twelfth District The fall in energy prices that we have  had in our neck of the woods has not been a problem; it was anticipated Drilling is being  constrained by an 18-month backlog in deliveries of drilling pipe; energy firms cannot get enough  pipe to do the amount of drilling that they would like Our labor markets remain tight, and the job  churning seems to have picked up It may seem tighter to me because our Bank has been  experiencing some of the turnover We have lost several key professional people recently to  expanding firms in the Dallas area But surveys indicate that workers are being found somewhere,  and there is no inordinate upward pressure on wages, at least in the statistics, even though  anecdotally we hear a lot of stories I would not be surprised under these conditions of prolonged  labor market tightness to see our labor force participation rates hit new highs soon  Prices appear to be constrained House price inflation in our area is about a third of what  it is in the nation Computer chip prices have fallen more than the high-tech firms had expected,  and recent attempts to raise petrochemical prices have failed An exception to this price picture in  our area is commercial real estate Office rents in Dallas rose 9 percent in the first half of the year,  and prices for Dallas office buildings are up about 50 percent from a year ago Warehouse prices  are up about 40 percent, but there is a lot of building going on to provide new supply So, we do  not expect those kinds of numbers to last all that long  Turning to the national economy, as everybody knows, the string of consecutive PPI  declines is now up to 7 months I understand that the 07 percent increase in the deflator for gross  domestic purchases in the second quarter is the smallest since 1961 The core CPI increase at a rate  of 24 percent in the first 7 months of this year is the lowest since 1965 The 48 percent    8/19/97  unemployment rate is a 24-year low, and some measures of consumer confidence are at about their  highest level since 1952 Now that the UPS strike is apparently over, there is nothing obvious on  the horizon to spoil the party, although I suspect we will find that the strike has done a good deal of  damage in the past couple of weeks The settlement may go a long way toward undermining the  wage flexibility that we started to get in labor markets with the air traffic controllers' strike back in  the early 1980s Even before this strike, it appeared that the secular decline in real wages was over,  although productivity gains appeared to be sufficient to keep unit labor costs under good control  To summarize my views, I would say that I consider myself a new paradigm optimist [Laughter]   Me too   Mike said a moment ago that he did not think that manufacturers could  produce without workers I have heard that the factory of the future will only have a man and a  dog The man is there to feed the dog The dog is there to keep the man from touching the  equipment [Laughter]   The Eleventh District economy continues to do very well, which I  regard as a good thing The Dallas District was cited in the Beigebook summary as having  increased retail sales and some modest upward pressure on prices and wages in the services and  retail sectors Manufacturing activity has picked up in our District since the last meeting Oil  refineries are operating at record capacity levels Rig counts are at their highest level since 1991,  and even so their number is being constrained by a shortage of crews Existing home sales have  increased modestly, while commercial and office vacancy rates have continued to decline, leading  to rising commercial construction in our area and a shortage of construction workers Moderate  gains in bank lending and continued competition between bank and nonbank lenders have been  putting some downward pressure on rates but mostly on terms As for shortages and bottlenecks,  there have been some rail shipment disruptions related to railroad mergers, and anecdotal reports  from our Small Business Advisory Committee suggest that, at least in our part of the country, UPS  operations have not yet recovered fully from the strike There is still a good bit of confusion there  Most farm crops in our area are in better shape than they have been in quite a while, but our  farmers are almost obsessed with El Nino They do not know what its impact is going to be on    9/30/97  them An economist at Exxon, who is also a meteorologist, has asked us if we could get a  combination economic/weather forecast for them Perhaps we will be looking into that!  Texas traditionally has faster employment growth than the nation as a whole but at the  same time a somewhat higher unemployment rate That is the result of two factors, net strong in-  migration of workers into Texas and the poverty and high levels of unemployment in the southern  tier of Texas counties along the Mexican border That area is now benefiting from the recent strong  recovery of the Mexican economy, which is export-led and concentrated in northern Mexico  especially among the maquiladora plants on the Mexican side of the Tex-Mex border That is  beginning to improve business noticeably in South Texas I might just mention that the peso  devaluation gave a boost to the already strong and rapidly growing maquiladora industry It is my  understanding that US manufacturing employment has increased by only about 33,000 workers  since the end of 1994 while manufacturing employment in the maquiladoras has increased 300,000,  about ten times as much Only seven US states, if they are ranked in terms of manufacturing  employment, rank higher than the maquiladora industry   The 33,000 is the increase in US manufacturing employment since the  end of 1994   No, I think it is for the nation   And the 300,000 is the increase in maquiladora manufacturing  employment over the same period If we rank the states in terms of manufacturing employment,    9/30/97  California is first, Ohio is next, then Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York The  maquiladoras would rank eighth, coming in ahead of North Carolina and Florida, for example,  which I find to be something of a surprise They are supplementing the US manufacturing  capacity, and I think a lot of that supplemented capacity is in the industrial Midwest The point  there is that the maquiladora manufacturing capacity is helping to alleviate the pressure on US  capacity utilization  I might also mention with respect to Mexico that since the last FOMC meeting Harvey  Rosenblum and I spent a day with the Board of Governors of the Bank of Mexico and we also met  with the Minister of Finance Some of my impressions are as follows The smoothness of the  Mexican election should not encourage us too much There is a mood of "get even" and "pay  back" that threatens to take economic policymaking out of the control of the technocrats in Mexico  The parties of the left and the right seem more willing to get together to oppose the center than to  get with the center to oppose the other extreme So far, the economic argument is focused on  whether and how much to roll back the value-added tax that was increased during the peso crisis  While the macro numbers describing the Mexican economic recovery are strong--their real GDP  increased almost 9 percent over the past year--it is concentrated in the export sector, which is also  concentrated geographically in the northern part of Mexico This recovery is missing a lot of the  people who were harmed by the initial downturn and by the devaluation The point is that the vast  majority of the people have not felt much of the benefit of the rebound, and this is limiting the  political credit that might have been given for the good macroeconomic performance While the  Mexicans have stopped the hemorrhaging of their banking system, the latter's return to health has  barely begun and it remains vulnerable In addition, the cost of the government's rescue efforts is a  double-digit percentage of GDP, another factor contributing to the lowering of standards of living    9/30/97  The Mexican authorities understand the dilemmas and the dangers of having their exchange rate  held up in real terms by capital inflows, but their desire to maintain an open economy leaves them  with not much they can do about it, and they may be a little nervous about being in somewhat the  same position now as they were in 1994 From our side of the border, their strong peso is boosting  our exports A favorite way of measuring exports to Mexico is to measure the length of the line of  trucks in Laredo going toward Monterey on 1-35, and it is typically backed up 5 to 7 miles these  days  Turning to the US economy, what can I say except "the beat goes on" It is good to see  the near-term Greenbook forecast taking on more of an optimistic, new paradigm tone I did note  that the Greenbook soul searching over the new era rhetoric was, in Mike Prell's words, "tortuous,"  but it was appreciated nevertheless As for Greenbook details, the only thing I would quibble with  a little is that we see the real third-quarter growth rate to be considerably stronger than the  Greenbook has it now   I agree with your recommendation today I would keep an open mind  about the next meeting and wait and see what the data show and not be praying for bad news so we  have an excuse to do something  With regard to 1994, I do think it was a very successful preemptive strike experience  Two fundamental differences between now and 1994 are that we went into 1994 with a 3 percent  federal funds rate, zero in real terms, and had been there 1-1/2 years Also, throughout 1994, we    9/30/97  had pipeline inflation going straight up Commodity prices peaked in mid-1995 and have not gone  up since then Those are two important things to keep in mind   I just have a few comments that I'm not sure will be all that helpful  and a question On the balance of payments arithmetic and the worst case not appearing all that  bad, I think we should not get too complacent It seems that we are thinking of the transmission  mechanism as being through the trade and the current accounts when it may be that the Asian flu  spreads more through the capital account On the arithmetic, while the net of the two tends to be  the same, the gross of the capital account has gotten much larger in recent years than the gross on  the current account So, I think the fact that we have small trading relationships is probably less  important than it was before capital became so notable and so large relative to trade We should  be careful about that  My other comment is on the stock market I thought, when we had the big stock  market decline a couple of weeks ago, that there was a silver lining to it I thought it would  provide at least part of what Mike Prell was expecting for next year so that he would give us  some relief in his forecast for stock market adjustments in 1998 But it seems as if it didn't  make a dent at all   In line with Mike Moskow's question earlier, I gather the stock  market is going to fall because you expect higher interest rates and lower profits I believe you  have profits coming down from a growth rate of 11 percent in the third quarter to only 1 percent  in the fourth quarter That seems rather abrupt   I was traveling on the day that the stock market went down over 500  points I heard about it after it had already happened I did not get to build up to it gradually  What I heard on the car radio was that it was because of the Hong Kong stock market So, it  was stock market to stock market and had nothing to do with anything rational   The Eleventh District economy continues to expand rapidly  Recently, we have had some upward revisions in Texas employment, which have put the state's  employment growth at over 4-1/2 percent for the last 12 months This is about twice the national  rate and the strongest we have seen in Texas since before the 1986 oil price bust Employment  growth in the third quarter averaged a slightly more moderate 37 percent, but it appears to have  accelerated as the quarter progressed Even 37 percent is remarkably robust, given the very tight  regional and national labor markets We are not sure that we know where all the new labor is    11/12/97 62  coming from Relevant to its sustainability, growth has been evenly balanced across different  metropolitan areas and across different industries This balance has allowed growth to continue  longer, at a stronger pace, and with fewer wage and price pressures than we might have thought  possible when this expansion began about six years ago Also relevant to sustainability, some of  the sectors that were showing symptoms of overindulgence--construction, electronic equipment,  and instrument manufacturing--have seen growth decelerate in recent months, and sectors that  were lagging have begun to pick up The border region, which was hit hard by the peso  devaluation in late 1994, has benefited greatly from the turnaround in the Mexican economy  Meanwhile, strong worldwide energy demand and Mideast tensions have brought  boom times to the oil and gas exploration industry, placing the Houston economy on the same  growth track as the rest of Texas Oil and gas well drilling was operating near 70 percent  capacity as recently as late 1996 It surged to over 108 percent of capacity this summer  Although it was back down to 93 percent in September, the high level of drilling activity has  been putting substantial upward pressure on labor and equipment costs in that industry Oil  exploration is a much more sophisticated and high-tech business than it was 15 years ago  Consequently, the industry can remain profitable with oil prices as low as $17 a barrel, and some  would say lower than that But the technological sophistication of the industry means that it is  also subject to bottlenecks when demand for oil rises The supply of labor with the skills needed  to work with the new technology is not very elastic  If we look hard enough, though, we can find some things to worry about Hiring  problems are now widespread, and reports of wage increases are common in retail trade, business  services, and among skilled workers in construction In the retail trade sector, markdowns and    11/12/97 63  discounting have become rarer Business services firms find that they are able to pass on more  of their rising costs to their customers However, these upward wage and price pressures have  not yet shown up much in the aggregate statistics I have an anecdote that I think will win as the  most unbelievable anecdote of the day, [laughter] but I hesitate to give it to you because you  will not believe it   We double-checked this one One Dallas real estate concern has not  increased its secretaries' base pay in seven years, but business is so good that each secretary now  receives $5,000 per month in incentive bonuses See, I told you!   Just don't tell my secretary! The point is that some of these  profit-sharing bonuses do not end up in the wage data  I was going to say that some of you know about "the little engine that could" and tell  you that in Texas we have the "big railroad that could not" [Laughter] I did mention last time  that this problem was creating some fairly serious bottlenecks in the Southwest, and Tom  Hoenig, Jerry Jordan, and Mike Moskow have already mentioned it here today Those problems  are rooted in the botched merger between the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific railroads  They have been exacerbated by strong shipping demand Southern Pacific stopped basic  maintenance and cut workers in anticipation of the merger, and Union Pacific was slow to  recognize the situation Production at Eleventh District manufacturing firms has not been  significantly disrupted, but costs have risen due to late, diverted, and lost shipments Accidents    11/12/97 64  have become a concern too, as long hours have caused railway workers to quite literally fall  asleep at the switch So far, rail customers have absorbed increased shipping costs However,  recent reports suggest that companies plan to begin passing these costs along to their customers  Strains are expected to ease early next year  Disruptions to coal shipments, caused in large part by these railroad shipping  problems, have contributed to the extraordinarily high natural gas prices, as have temporary  operational problems at one producer's offshore wells in the Gulf The bad news is that natural  gas prices may remain high and volatile over the winter The good news is that gas prices are  expected to come down as the rail snafu unwinds and operational problems in the Gulf of  Mexico are resolved Over the long term, the news on natural gas prices becomes very good  As many as a dozen natural gas pipelines are under construction or being planned to bring  Canadian natural gas into the Chicago and New England markets This gas will begin to enter  the United States by the end of 1998 and will mean lower gas prices in the United States for  several years That is bad news for Texas for these years ahead but good news for the US  economy  Mideast uncertainties cloud the outlook for crude oil prices Crude oil accounts for a  much larger fraction of the energy market than does natural gas The collapse of several  Southeast Asian currencies will reduce the cost of electricity to high-tech manufacturing firms in  the Eleventh District On the other hand, it may have a significantly adverse effect on our  chemical industry, which before the crisis had already found itself facing increasing competition  from chemical producers in Southeast Asia Moreover, the downward pressure on Latin    11/12/97 65  American currencies generally, and the Mexican peso in particular, may cut into future growth of  the District's exports We don't expect this effect to be large, but the level of uncertainty is high  As for the national economy, I have no unique information to impart All my  comments on that are more in the area of interpretation and probably should best be left for later   I agree with your recommendation   The economy in the Dallas District continues to grow considerably  faster than the nation's Growth has remained broad-based through all segments of the private  sector The strongest employment growth has been in oil and gas extraction, followed by the  finance, insurance, and real estate sectors The only industry running at or beyond full capacity  is oil and gas drilling, where supplies of all key inputs have constrained activity A few meetings  ago, I mentioned that some oil companies were going as far as Great Britain to find machinists  More recently, we have heard reports of a company recruiting welders from India In spite of the  somewhat bearish outlook for oil prices over the next year or two, most companies expect to  remain profitable and are trying to expand exploration and production  All sectors of the real estate market remain quite strong, especially the industrial and  office markets Both the Dallas and Houston office markets have had falling vacancy rates and  steeply rising rents throughout 1997 In Dallas, it is expected that over 11 million square feet of  office space will become available next year That is the equivalent of about 15 Dallas Fed  buildings In Houston, plans for the construction of the first downtown office tower since 1986  have just been announced Class A space in Houston's central business district is now about 90  percent occupied Prices of existing homes in Texas are up 3 percent year over year, with some  metropolitan markets such as Dallas showing gains of more than double that The president of    12/16/97 37  the largest single-family real estate agency in Dallas told us that October and November were the  two best months in the firm's history, and she expects December to be the same Normally, they  would be practically shut down at the end of the year for the holidays, but demand has been  making that impossible this year  Not all sectors are this robust Employment has been weak in the apparel industry,  and the announcement by Levi Strauss that it will close three El Paso plants has increased the  level of concern in that community More recently, Hasbro also announced a plant closing in El  Paso that, together with the big decline in wages in Southeast Asia, has begun to undermine  some of the confidence that had been returning to the border economy The last year has not  been such a good one for our manufacturers of semiconductors, electronic equipment, and  instruments While they are anticipating a better year in 1998, recent financial turmoil in Asia  has damped near-term prospects  At our board meeting last week, our director from the retailing industry reported that  Christmas sales were about on track so far this season and that retailers were expecting a "ho-ho"  year rather than a "ho-hum" or a "bah-humbug" year Labor markets remain extremely tight  Sizable wage increases are reported for highly skilled technical workers Salaries have soared as  much as $20,000 in the last year for workers such as software engineers, though the more typical  increases have been in the $7,000 to $10,000 range The greater the shortage, the more  extraordinary are the measures taken to find workers For example, Intel is building a chip  factory in Fort Worth and is reported to have mailed letters to 14,000 engineers working at  competing companies with offers of a week-long trip to Hawaii for two if they joined Intel One  telecommunications company has been helping Asian students to get visas after graduate school    12/16/97 38  Consequently, 11 percent of their workforce of 2,500 is Asian The company also has begun  recruiting in Canada Another large Dallas-based firm offers telecommuting to engineers who  wish to live in Austin and work in Dallas To increase the future supply of engineers, a number  of leading telecommunications companies including Motorola, Southwestern Bell, AT&T, and  Texas Instruments have joined forces with several leading Texas universities to form the Texas  Telecommunications Consortium, which will fund research and educational programs  Turning to the national economic outlook, it is clear that the risks have shifted  considerably since the November meeting The Greenbook does a good job of reflecting this  increased uncertainty, both on the downside and the upside The so-called "worse case" scenario  is a highly plausible and unnerving one We must be concerned that a serious slowing of world  economic growth would imperil the ability and willingness of countries in Latin America,  Eastern Europe, and Asia to continue their transition to more democratic, market-based  economies  This seems to be a time that calls for economic diplomacy on our part and an excellent  time not to "rock the boat" Against the backdrop of continued disinflation stemming from lower  energy prices, a stronger dollar, and plenty of domestic and worldwide industrial capacity, the  inflation risks seem small indeed and may be shifting rapidly toward the other end of the  spectrum   I will not insist on doing it before the break unless you want to do  that I want to follow up on the Vice Chairman's parable of the meadow and the precipice   Okay He did not mention the role of the IMF, and I thought I would  ask him about that and you, Mr Chairman, as well I know that the IMF does a lot to promote  movement toward market mechanisms in command economies, and they do a lot to bring  government policymakers out of an attitude of denial But it also seems that IMF officials    12/16/97 61  promote a lot of austerity wherever they go They have a root canal theory of the way to get out  of difficult situations by canceling projects and so forth If one watches CNN frequently, one  sees a lot of Asian people on the street talking about how they are going to do their patriotic duty  and stop spending money It seems to me that there is a psychology that presupposes that the  way out of this problem situation is to stop spending It is hard to save your way to prosperity in  an environment of collapsing aggregate demand I wonder what we really think about the role of  the IMF in all of this   Thank you   I supported a symmetric directive before Governor Kelley talked  about the relative timing of the various risks, and I support such a directive even more after  hearing his comments It is doubtful that we will have to ease in the near future, but it certainly  would be embarrassing to ease with an asymmetric directive toward tightening So, I support  your recommendation   After a year of exceptionally strong economic performance in 1997  and into 1998, the economy of the Dallas region has recently begun to show some signs of  softening, or at least expectations and early hints of softening Lower oil prices, the effects of  the Asian crisis, and continued labor market tightness are key factors responsible for the  spreading expectation of slower growth The recent sharp drop in oil prices, which was partially  reversed last week, has done a lot to shake business confidence in Texas As of just over a week  ago, real oil prices had slipped by over $8 per barrel since October and were at their lowest level  since 1933 If that 20 percent reduction had not been reversed, research at the Dallas Fed  suggests that there would have been long-term employment losses of between 1/2 and 1 percent of  the workforces in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico While this is probably only about one-  third of the impact that would have resulted from similar oil price declines in the mid-1980s, it  nonetheless would represent an inflection point of the District's growth trajectory of recent years  Combined with the weakness in petrochemicals, semiconductors, and agricultural commodities  stemming from reduced Asian demand, the weakness in oil prices has the potential to set the  growth trend in the Eleventh District on a divergent path from the nation  Lower financing costs have added to the construction boom in Texas Commercial  construction remains strong and large new projects are announced almost daily At our small  business advisory council meeting two weeks ago, one of the members commented that several  of his law firm's clients have decided in recent months to become real estate developers,  probably a sign of trouble [Laughter] I don't know if that included Jerry Jordan's guy or not  With the increased uncertainty about energy prices and the impact on growth trends in Texas,  some of this building activity might be looked back on as irrational exuberance a couple of years  from now if oil prices stabilize around $14 We are encouraged somewhat by recent reports    3/31/98  from Houston that oil companies have begun to cut back on office expansion plans that were  developed earlier Additional evidence on market sensitivity to the changing situation comes  from anecdotes that lenders in Houston are becoming more conservative about construction loans  for speculative building  Mexico adds to the downside risks facing the Texas economy I suppose you saw the  "Salt and Pepper" cartoon in the Wall Street Journal the other day that said, "You can live the  American dream working for a Japanese company in Mexico" So far, the Mexican economy  has held up well, given its reduced competitiveness with Asian countries and its reduced revenue  from oil production We continue to get reports that Mexican shoppers are back in force in  Texas retail stores along the border and at upscale stores in Houston and San Antonio Whether  this reflects an overvalued currency or just a strong recovery in Mexico is an open question  My tight labor market anecdote of the month from the Eleventh District is that a  competitor of Texas Instruments put up a billboard across the freeway from the Texas  Instruments headquarters in Dallas On the billboard it said, "Why did the engineer cross the  road? To get a better job" [Laughter]  The national economy seems more like two economies these days, with the foreign  trade goods sector showing signs of weakness while activity in the nontrade goods sector has  accelerated of late Price pressures remain subdued, but the core CPI statistics are beginning to  be a source of concern I am not inclined, however, to react to labor market tightness as long as  businesses continue to be innovative and creative in holding down labor costs in the face of stiff  competitive pressures in the markets for goods and services M2 is growing too fast for comfort,  but I do take comfort from market-based indicators of monetary policy, such as a strong dollar  and weak commodity prices, as well as the prospective impact of Asia    3/31/98   I support your recommendation   I want to call your attention to the third paragraph on the first page  of the Greenbook I'm going to read two sentences and ask a question about the second one "Our  forecasts of moderating growth of demand have long been premised on an assumption that some  reversal of stock prices would be precipitated by a failure of corporate earnings to meet unrealistic  expectations However, we have also warned repeatedly that, given the prevailing psychology of  investors, a greater shock--perhaps a significant tightening in monetary policy--might be required  to put a damper on the market's uptrend" Does that sentence mean to suggest that we have a goal  of putting a damper on the market?   Cathy ended with smoking guns The main thing that has been  going on in Texas for the last week and a half is second-hand smoke from forest fires in Mexico  and central America It has put a heavy haze over all our major cities    5/19/98  The Eleventh District economy remains strong, but we believe our strong rate of  growth has slowed a little since the March FOMC meeting The primary factors that have  contributed to this slowing are weaker demand from Asia, the general softness of oil prices,  shortages of construction workers and cement, which have put a cap on the level of construction  activity, and some early signs of slowing in the Mexican economy  Demands for three of the Dallas District's major products--semiconductors,  chemicals, and energy products--have weakened slightly over the past couple of months Intel  Corporation recently halted construction of its $13 billion Fort Worth plant, and numerous chip  manufacturers have announced small layoffs at their plants in our region One of our directors  reported at last week's board meeting that the global market for semiconductors is expected to  shrink 2 percent this year, with the strongest demand coming from Europe for the first time in 20  years Demand from Asia overall is expected to be flat, but that from Japan is expected to decline  by 14 percent, and demand in the United States is anticipated to shrink slightly These forecasts are  in value terms Physical output is growing in the District, but it is not keeping up with the price  declines  Oil drilling activity has slowed, and the rental price of rigs has begun to reflect that  slowing Several large oil producers have announced cuts in their capital budgets for the coming  year after reporting sizable declines in profits for the first quarter Residential and commercial  construction activity remains strong Dallas recently passed a number of bond issues that increased  the demand for construction resources Many projects are being slowed by a shortage of cement,  which has been put on allocation for the last few months and is expected to remain so for months to  come To give you an idea of the seriousness of the cement shortage, Texas A&M may not be able    5/19/98  to complete their football stadium in time for the season, and they have some alumni in the cement  business [Laughter]  Overall inflationary pressures remain subdued in the Eleventh District Office rents  continue to rise, but the rate of increase has slowed New office buildings are coming on stream,  but demand for them remains strong Labor markets are tight, but firms are becoming increasingly  innovative and flexible in their search for workers and in the way they deal with them  The health of the Mexican economy represents an important downside risk for the  Eleventh District Mexico has been affected to a much greater extent than Texas by the Asian crisis  and by the decline in oil prices Oil exports fund roughly 40 percent of Mexico's federal budget  The budget has been cut twice because of falling oil revenues, and Mexican officials have warned  that a third cut may be on the way Mexico's consumption industry could be hard hit by budget  cutbacks because it is heavily dependent on government contracts The Dallas Fed produces a  Mexico leading economic index, and it has been on a downward trend since last October The fall  in real oil prices has been the largest component pulling down the index, but over the last three  months, five of the seven indicators have been negative  Turning to the national economy, I am pleased to see the Greenbook forecast of 1/4  percentage point increases in productivity growth and potential output We believe, however, that  the Greenbook remains a bit too pessimistic on the inflation numbers While it is reasonable to  agonize and fret over future inflation risks, we need to recognize our accomplishments The GDP  deflator in 1997 was the lowest since 1964 The first quarter's annualized change of 09 percent in  the deflator was a 43-year low This year's CPI has grown at the slowest rate since 1986 and  before that since 1964 In 13 of the last 16 months, the PPI has been zero or negative This run of  nonincreases is unprecedented, and the rate of deflation shown in the PPI is comparable to that in    5/19/98  1952 - 1953 Against this backdrop, I am pleased rather than displeased by the 43 percent  unemployment rate reported for April I would be more concerned about losing ground in our  constant battle against the forces of inflation if there was some compelling evidence that  stimulative monetary policy was behind the economy's output growth realizations It seems to me  that our recent robust real growth is more of a supply-driven phenomenon and is thus  disinflationary rather than inflationary Given the upward creep in short- and intermediate-term  real interest rates and given the strong dollar, the flat yield curve, and soft commodity prices, it  appears that monetary policy is not doing anything that would add to the virtual lack of inflationary  pressures This seems like a good environment for us to remain watchful and patient   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman We have  unexpectedly low inflation in large part because a strong supply side has accommodated  unexpectedly rapid real growth I'm not sure that locking in the low inflation now requires  weakening the economy to slow down real growth It may or it may not I guess this uncertainty is  an argument, as Don Kohn put it "on the one hand" in his statement, for being less preemptive and  relying more on actual experience and less on forecasts   The Eleventh District economy has continued to grow at a healthy but  steadily moderating pace The summer's heat and drought combined with the unending financial  and economic troubles in Asia are the two most important factors contributing to the slower  expansion of the Texas economy Unless the weather changes soon, this year's drought losses  could exceed the $5 billion of agriculture-related losses that occurred in Texas in 1996 Cotton is  the number one cash crop in Texas, and cotton farmers' losses currently are greater than during  the 1996 drought The impact of the drought also has been severe on the corn crop and on cattle  ranchers Although the drought is causing enormous financial strains on the agricultural sector, its  effect on the Texas economy is fairly modest because agriculture is less than 1-1/2 percent of gross  state product  The impact of the worsening Asian situation is being seen in the Eleventh District  through reduced demand for semiconductors, lower energy prices, the stronger dollar, and  growing strains in Mexico Worldwide chip sales have continued to decline As a result, a  couple of manufacturers have shut down their factories three times this summer to ease the glut of  memory chips Sales of more sophisticated chips, such as digital signal processors, have been  hurt to a much lesser extent by the situation in Asia In spite of all this, we are seeing a  considerable expansion of the resources going into the research and design of new chip  technologies, particularly in Austin and Dallas  Oil and gas prices are very weak and my industry contacts expect them to remain so A  lot of new supply from non-OPEC producers is scheduled to come on stream in the near term  With the expectation that low oil prices are here to stay, a number of companies, particularly in    8/18/98  Houston, are beginning to announce layoffs and other belt-tightening measures As the dollar has  strengthened, it has made energy cheaper in dollar terms but increasingly expensive in currencies  that have weakened relative to the dollar This currency value effect has reinforced the downward  price effect from weaker Asian demand Low oil prices continue to adversely affect the Mexican  economy, and if this situation were to continue, it would place considerable financial strain on  Mexico  The construction and service sectors remain strong in our region Residential  construction, especially apartment construction, has been robust A shortage of labor seems to be  as important or more important than the shortage of concrete, which I have mentioned before, in  limiting the supply of new housing units Office vacancy rates have begun to edge up slightly and  rent increases have slowed Employment gains in the private service sector remain strong, and  wage pressures, if anything, have increased slightly  Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook is full of crosscurrents and, like the  Bible, can support many different points of view [Laughter] Real GDP growth slowed  dramatically in the second quarter, but inventories were largely responsible Wage inflation has  picked up, but price inflation has not Money growth has been excessive by historical standards,  but market measures of monetary policy reflect a restrictive stance Perhaps we should back away  from the trees and try to see the forest the way historians might do so several years from now  What historians are likely to focus on looking back to 1997 and 1998 is the international crisis  that began in Asia last summer and spread to several countries Currencies and stock markets  collapsed in one country after another Financial conditions appeared to be stabilizing for a while,  but they subsequently relapsed and a second round of turmoil ensued that included additional  countries During this period of growing deflationary pressures, with gold and oil and other    8/18/98  commodity prices falling in dollar terms, the dollar rising against most currencies, the yield curve  flattening, import prices falling, and most measures of price inflation declining, the FOMC  adopted and then in my opinion held on too long to a bias toward tightening monetary policy  whose implementation would have exacerbated these trends In my opinion, the risks were pretty  well balanced at our last meeting, and in my opinion the downside risks are greater today and the  consequences of policy mistakes are greater as well In terms of the global context and our  nation's position in the world, I think it is time to talk about getting ahead of the curve by easing  monetary policy   We never really suspected it! [Laughter]   I have a strong preference for symmetry for the reasons already stated   Just to play devil's advocate, I would like to suggest that we'd be  better off not formally voting on a tilt Therefore, we wouldn't have the decision to make on  how to release that vote I understand that having the tilt as an option may help with consensus  building and arriving at a decision during any given meeting, but we can get the sense of where  we as a group are leaning without necessarily voting on it We would run fewer risks of creating  embarrassing situations where we were getting ready to zig but had said at the previous meeting  that we were more likely to zag I think there would be a greater degree of freedom for the  Committee if we did not have a formal tilt but just listened to each other and knew which way  we were leaning without having to take a vote   The Eleventh District economy continues to perform at a healthy  level, although it is retreating from the strong growth we saw earlier in the year District  employment picked up slightly in the first two months of the third quarter after a weak second  quarter The pickup is masking a tale of two economies a strong service sector and a softening  goods sector  Southeast Asia effects continue to accumulate, especially in the energy and  semiconductor industries Low oil and product prices are harming the energy industry Lower  demand from Asia has worsened the excess supply problems in the oil market, keeping prices  below $15 per barrel for much of the summer Drilling has declined dramatically, especially for  oil Our directors report that wells are being shut in and rigs stacked Not many new pickup  trucks are being bought in West Texas these days! We haven't seen too many layoffs yet  because companies are reluctant to part with the skilled workers they worked hard to recruit in a  very tight labor market However, if oil prices stay at or below $15 too long, we will begin to  see the layoffs accelerating Our directors in the energy industry expect the supply overhang to  continue and oil prices to remain weak for the foreseeable future Petrochemicals felt the fallout  from the Asian crisis early, and the inability to export to Asia has placed substantial downward  pressure on chemical prices all year in spite of strong domestic demand    9/29/98  The semiconductor industry continues to feel the effects of Asia Some semiconductor  plants are closed in our area, and we continue to hear intermittent layoff announcements All  segments of the semiconductor business show declines except for digital switch signal  processors, which have seen 5 percent growth year over year However, some people in the  semiconductor industry feel that it may be at or near the bottom of its recession right now Most  regional high-tech firms were battered in the stock market decline Some smaller Austin firms  have put off going public because of the gyrations in the stock market and have scaled back their  expansion plans  Texas exports have felt the pains of a weak Asia and a strong dollar Exports have  been falling throughout the year, but the decline accelerated in July The current Beigebook also  suggests continued weakness in exports of petrochemicals, primary metals, liner board and other  commodity paper, plastics, and semiconductors  The construction industry has been one of the bright spots in our District, propelling  our high employment growth But it, too, is showing some signs of softening lately Single-  family housing has been the hottest sector, but we are seeing a slowing in sales of new homes  Housing inventories are still slim, though On the office side, industry contacts are wondering  whether the market has reached its peak They note that although absorption remains good, rents  are not rising as rapidly as earlier Financing has dried up recently for a variety of commercial  projects REITs and insurance companies have scaled back their operations, citing the stock  market slump and the flattening of the yield curve Contacts tell us that some banks are not  lending because of tougher lending standards even though they have the money  Our most recent Beigebook report shows that the price picture has turned deflationary  in several sectors Weak international demand has continued to add to growing supplies and  falling prices We see price declines in gasoline, petrochemicals, oil and gas services,    9/29/98  semiconductors, computers, primary metals, paper and paper products, and softwood lumber  Although wage pressures remain prevalent, they are not being passed forward to consumers  because low input costs are offsetting any increases in wage costs  On the national and international fronts, the risks have risen sharply in emerging  market economies, and the exposure of the United States to these risks has increased The  United States is increasingly vulnerable to the effects of trade deterioration because the stock  market is no longer driving US consumption and investment The real economy shows  continued moderate growth, but the downside risks are increasing Manufacturing is showing  increasing signs of weakness in the face of falling foreign demand and increasing competition  from imports The manufacturing sector has lost 53,000 jobs per month so far in the third  quarter Employment growth in the payroll survey slowed slightly in July and August  Employment growth in the household survey is much weaker There are signs that consumer and  business spending will weaken from here on out Consumer confidence has fallen off The most  recent Purchasing Managers' survey painted a weakening picture for manufacturing Export  orders were the main source of weakness The Michigan survey of future business conditions  has deteriorated markedly since the spring The attitudes expressed by our boards of directors  were very consistent with the survey's depressed outlook The El Paso board was especially  gloomy, reflecting a region hit by lower oil prices, drought, and a softening outlook for Mexico  On the financial side, the stock market is down roughly 15 percent since the record  highs posted in July The yield curve is now inverted These indicators are telling us that real  economic weakness lies ahead While most risks are on the downside, there are some upside  risks as well Medical and housing costs are on the rise, and M2 growth has accelerated and is  well above FOMC bounds for the year However, the downside risks far outweigh the upside  risks primarily because of the international problems A monetary policy that is effectively tight    9/29/98  is detrimental to both domestic and global economies The risks of Asian contagion are real  Low commodity prices and a strong dollar continue to batter the Latin American economies  Asian contagion to Brazil is the most worrisome for us in part because it has the potential to spill  over to the rest of Latin America including Mexico Recent history suggests that small or  moderate devaluations, as was discussed earlier for Brazil, are very difficult to implement these  days  I concluded my statement at the last meeting by saying that in terms of the global  context and our position in the world, I thought it was time to get ahead of the curve by easing  monetary policy I still think so, although it's probably too late to get ahead of the curve  [Laughter] Much additional damage has been done in the world's financial system during the  last six weeks I'm afraid history will blame us for too little too late I hope we deal with both of  those issues today and not just one--the too little as well as the too late To paraphrase a quote  coming out of Washington last January in another context, "we need sooner rather than later, and  we need more rather than less"   Mr Chairman, I think I have done my colleagues a real service today  in suggesting that we may be behind the curve I gave them all a chance to say we were not, and  an opportunity to vote to ease monetary policy while still sounding hawkish! [Laughter] Just to  clarify my views on that--    9/29/98   I'm willing to quit! I do not believe we are behind the curve on the  real economy On the other hand, I do think that had we lowered the fed funds target by 1/4  percentage point prior to the Jackson Hole conference, we might have avoided some of the  financial market turmoil that we have seen since then But starting from here and now, I would  just point out that at 5-1/4 percent the federal funds target rate will still be above 30-year bond  rates The yield curve will remain inverted As the earnings reports for the third quarter come in  below current expectations, I think that having a lower interest rate at that point and a lower  discount factor would help cushion some of the further stock market deterioration If you wanted  to approve a larger reduction and make it look mild and involving all deliberate speed, you could  put periods rather than exclamation points in the announcement! But I realize that I'm not going  to win this argument, so I defer to your better judgment, Mr Chairman, and that of all my  colleagues on that  I don't care much about the tilt either, but going back to my earlier comment, our  discussion today does illustrate how convenient it would be not to have to vote on the tilt and  therefore not to have to announce a decision on the tilt We would still know how we feel  without having to take the risk of publicizing it   It would make a wonderful column by Alan Abelson   For Mike Prell, in Part 2 of the Greenbook, page III-19, there is a  sentence that says "Growth of retail money market mutual funds and of currency outstanding,  both domestically and overseas, was strong over the most recent two months" Do we have any  indication of overseas holdings of currency, whether they have increased significantly, and  whether we ought to be taking that into account when we look at the growth rate of M2?   That seems kind of intuitive to me, given what is going on overseas   The Eleventh District economy is showing increasing signs of slower  growth especially in the goods-producing sectors including energy, petrochemicals,  semiconductors, and now commercial construction as well; the latter had been quite robust until  recently Commercial construction is being held back by financing considerations, higher credit  standards, reduced REIT activity, and so forth, but there is some feeling that that is not altogether  bad It may be a timely constraint on a new round of overbuilding Employment growth in the  goods-producing sectors has decelerated from vigorous in the first quarter to barely positive in  the third Employment has declined in oil and gas extraction and in oil service industries Our  Texas index of leading indicators has declined for the past five months The declines have been  broad-based, with seven of the eight components declining Our forecasting model of Texas  employment growth, which has been very accurate over the past three years, forecasts  employment growth of 03 percent in 1999 Our leading index for the Mexican economy also  signals more slowing there in 1999 than we have seen thus far, with negative implications for the  Eleventh District This is consistent with a reduction of spending by Mexican nationals in Texas  border cities, which we have noticed, and with a reduction of US currency flowing into our San    11/17/98  Antonio branch from border areas and from Mexico itself; this probably reflects Mexican fears  of further peso depreciation more than an actual decline in activity so far  On the national front, I have no unique insights to offer Risk and liquidity premiums  have declined since October 15 but remain high Financial markets around the world continue to  be vulnerable There have been arguments on both sides of the policy question I guess where I  come out is that the fire department has only a limited amount of water to deliver to a fire It is  better to get there earlier rather than later [Laughter]   Me, too! [Laughter]   You do not have to sacrifice a baby in this process    12/22/98 86   I support your recommendation   Texas employment growth has decelerated from fast to moderate  during the course of 1998--from about 46 percent in 1997 down to about 2 percent lately Three  head winds or drags are causing this growth to moderate One is tight labor markets They have  been tight for a long time, but we have less and less ability to attract workers into Texas from the  rest of the country because the markets are tight everywhere now  The low oil prices that Jack Guynn mentioned have hit us very hard Incidentally, our  contacts expect oil prices to remain very low for longer than the futures markets are suggesting  In our District, extraction employment has declined by about 5,000 and the rig count has  declined around 37 percent Of course, low oil prices are not nearly as harmful to our region of  the country now as they were back in 1986 Not only are we more diversified, but we have more  energy-using industries that benefit from low oil prices than we did then  Another factor slowing our economy is the weakened state of foreign markets for  Texas exporters Earlier, in late 1997 and early 1998, there was a sharp decline in exports to  Asia That decline is pretty much over; there is still a slight movement down in the trend line,  but it's almost flat now Added to it, however, have been some declines in our exports to Canada  and to Mexico and Latin America more generally    12/22/98  On the national economic scene, I don't really have any new or unique insights to  offer The main point I would make is that while some risks are associated with the strong  momentum in the real economy at year-end--as evidenced by the possible reversal of the net  export drag, the continued tight labor markets, and rapid money growth--those developments  continue to occur in the context of worldwide deflationary pressures and in particular a  continuing decline in commodity prices, even since our last meeting   I agree with your recommendation   I'd go with option 3 and remove "in coming months" for the reasons  Governor Kelley gave I'd keep the last sentence for the reasons Al Broaddus gave   The economy in the Eleventh District appears to be   maintaining its overall health and positive growth trend Recent revisions to Texas   employment data suggest that Texas employment grew 2½ percent at an annual rate in   the fourth quarter of last year, which is a bit higher than indicated in the original   numbers The data also show that employment was growing at a rate of around 3½   percent during the first two months of this year Signs of stabilization in some Asian   economies and a rebounding of prospects in Mexico have turned around the export   picture for the Texas economy, boosting the electronics industry in particular Total   exports from Texas grew modestly in the fourth quarter after falling for the first three   quarters of 1998 The electronics industry in Texas experienced employment gains in   January and February after eight consecutive months of decline Due to growing Asian   demand and above average computer replacement demands stemming from Y2K, we   have seen a marked increase in chip sales This has been accompanied by increases in   DRAM prices of over 20 percent as inventories have declined   Oil prices have increased about 20 percent over the last couple of weeks,   following the OPEC agreement to cut output; the permanency of this increase is     3/30/99 17   debatable, but it may slow some of the hemorrhaging in the Eleventh District energy   industry Our directors still believe that the problems in the oil and gas industry are   structural in nature and that the trend in oil prices is more likely down than up They also   believe that OPEC is no more likely to hold down output this time than it did the last   several times   Characteristic of the pessimism in the energy industry was a remark made by   one of the members of our Small Business and Agricultural Advisory Committee last   week He said that he was just as likely to see a working oil rig in the Texas panhandle   as he was to see a dinosaur crossing the road [Laughter] I also learned in that meeting   that for a lot of the operators of small oil wells, the price they actually get at the wellhead   is significantly below the benchmark of West Texas Intermediate   Construction activity remains strong, but signs are beginning to emerge that   activity is at or near a peak Contract values have already edged down In Dallas,   builders completed 6,000 more apartments than they leased in 1998 In Houston, the   supply of apartments expected to be brought on stream this year is generally thought to   be excessive unless the energy industry turns around A year ago I was reporting   commercial and office rent increases of 20 to 30 percent but, as expected, market signals   worked and now the completions of new office space have begun to outpace new leasing   activities Office rent concessions of up to 4 months have already been reported in Dallas   and Houston early this year The abundance of real estate capacity should reduce   inflationary pressures in that sector Low capacity utilization levels in manufacturing   promise to do the same   As for agriculture, the outlook for a continuation of weak commodity prices is   decimating our rural communities as depopulation accelerates And while labor markets   remain tight in most of our large urban areas, wage increases have been in line with   national productivity trends That allows me to be comfortable with the Greenbook   forecast, which does not see wage acceleration as a source of inflationary pressures   At the national level, a long period has elapsed since our last meeting, so we   have had two complete rounds of statistical reports and they show mostly more of the     3/30/99 18   same Output and employment growth remain strong and unemployment continues   favorable Contemporary measures of inflation remain flat The CPI rose 01 percent in   both January and February; inflation in the pipeline and leading indicators of inflation   continue to be favorable; and most commodity price indexes are down further The   dollar is somewhat stronger Capacity utilization remains low in the United States and is   even lower globally Oil prices are the exception, although in my part of the country it is   dangerous to complain about the rebound in oil prices In any case, money growth has   slowed, which is good news everywhere    I support your recommendation and I agree with it in both   respects At our last meeting we voted for no change and a symmetric directive As I   indicated earlier, two months of statistics have come in since then They continue to   show employment growth, a low unemployment rate, very strong output growth, and   contemporary measures of inflation that are flat, with no inflation in the pipeline So I   agree with Bill McDonough that if we were either to tighten or adopt an asymmetric   directive toward tightening, we would be interpreted as being antigrowth and probably   rightfully so I don’t think that is the way we should be perceived So I agree with your   recommendation     3/30/99 68    Little has changed in the Eleventh District economy since our   March meeting Overall, the economy in our region continues to show healthy growth   Over the last six months employment growth has averaged about 3 percent, and the near-  term outlook is for more of the same Activity in both commercial and residential   construction has been robust In recent weeks concerns about commercial overbuilding   have become more common as the credit strains that developers faced last September and   October have eased Just in the last month or two the residential market, particularly in   the Dallas area, has heated up For the first time in many years used homes have been   selling the day they are listed, sometimes above the listed prices Were it not for the   continued shortage of cement and some other building materials, building activity would   be even stronger, and perhaps we would see less upward pressure on existing home   prices To some extent the shortages will get worse in the coming months as crews and   materials are diverted to Oklahoma to rebuild areas destroyed by tornadoes a few weeks   ago Efforts to relieve some of the short-term capacity constraints are in the works US   Brick completed a new and entirely automated plant adjacent to its existing facility; the   $17 million plant will produce 60 million bricks a year, tripling output at the site Fifteen   new jobs will be created, a testament to productivity increases Texas Industries, a firm   on whose board Governor Kelley used to serve I believe, is also expanding capacity that   will make its facility the largest cement plant in the United States That $200 million     5/18/99 35   project will increase cement capacity from 13 to 28 million tons per year by the fall of   the year 2000   The energy industry continues to consolidate and contract in spite of the higher   oil prices in the last few months The Texas rig count is at a 30-year low and our   projections are that Texas drilling activity and oil and gas employment may not have   bottomed out yet The rebound in oil prices has surprised our industry contacts and they   remain skeptical that these prices will last   The computer and telecommunications industries have rebounded slightly   However, we are beginning to hear complaints that more and more sectors of the business   are becoming commodities with falling prices and shrinking, razor-thin margins A few   years ago it was DRAM chips; more recently it’s pagers Now there is talk of saturation   in the market for inexpensive computers   The higher oil prices together with a stronger peso have boosted consumer and   business confidence in Mexico Our border cities have been seeing very strong retail   demand from Mexican shoppers In spite of ever-tighter labor markets, we are hearing   less and less discussion of upward pressure on wages With capital becoming   increasingly substitutable for labor, tight labor markets are less likely to add to   inflationary pressures unless the cost of capital rises significantly   The main development in the national economy was the giant mood swing in   financial markets in April Suddenly everyone decided that the crisis countries had   bottomed out and that, given the flattening in commodity prices and the rebound in oil   prices, the best days on the inflation front were behind us Interestingly, the bad news on   oil prices for the country has not been celebrated as particularly good news in our area   As I said, our industry contacts didn’t expect the rebound and they question its durability   The blockbuster, of course, was Friday’s CPI report I will have to concede that it was   only one month’s data; however, the risks have shifted upward    I support your recommendation, although I still hope we   won’t have to follow through anytime soon Also, I don’t see why we couldn’t make a   modest change in the directive to refer to the “coming months” rather than to the   “intermeeting period”     5/18/99 64    The Eleventh District is apparently doing better than the Fourth   District, where schoolteachers are moving into industry and bankers are beginning to teach     8/24/99 60   school! Growth is still very strong in the District, but it has slowed just a little   Construction has been flat, net, due to concerns about overbuilding, rising interest rates, and   shortages of personnel and materials Energy producers are responding to higher prices, but   very cautiously The rig count is up only a bit; it’s still below the level of last December   when oil was $11 a barrel The outlook for Mexico is cautiously improved All of   Mexico’s leading indicators were positive in the second quarter, suggesting a strong second   half But the peso and the stock market have given back some gains this quarter, tempering   the outlook for early 2000 And, of course, as Bill McDonough mentioned, an election is   coming up   Labor markets are extremely tight in Texas At the last San Antonio board meeting I   attended, the director from Brownsville mentioned that a milestone had been reached in   Brownsville The unemployment rate had fallen into single-digits for the first time anyone   there could remember We looked it up and the last time it was below 10 percent was in   1981 While unemployment is still high in the border areas, only the town of McAllen had   an unemployment rate well above 10 percent; it is around 13 percent or so In El Paso it is   right at 10 percent, but the other border towns now report rates of slightly below 10 percent   Most of the larger non-border cities in Texas and in the Eleventh District more generally   have unemployment rates below 4 percent And labor participation rates in our major cities   are far above the national average  I am told that in Austin and Dallas there are almost 9   jobs for every 10 residents between the ages of 16 and 65 However, to paraphrase   Professor Tobin, higher labor costs are everywhere but in the data District employers tell   us that they are paying more for everyone from programmers and engineers to temporary   workers, truckers, and legal staff We have not seen these increases in our wage statistics,   but the statistics have limited industry coverage and they don’t count stock options and other   fringe benefits   The anecdotal evidence relating to the price picture is mixed Our Beigebook contacts   reported more increases in prices than reductions However, house prices rose more slowly   than in the past Energy prices were up and there was a slight price increase in the retail   sector, but prices were down for timber, concrete, and memory chips And, of course, the   Chairman has pushed down farm prices all by himself!     8/24/99 61   On the national front, I believe that inflation remains under control, even while the   economy remains very strong If one were worried about inflation, the most important   statistics to look at would be the various measures of inflation These statistics offer little   reason for concern Core inflation is about as low as it was last year--significantly lower by   some measures, a little higher by some The core CPI increased at a 17 percent annual rate   during the first seven months of 1999, compared to a 24 percent increase in all of 1998   The core PCE deflator increased at a 14 percent annual rate during the first two quarters,   compared to a 12 percent rise in all of 1998 Is higher inflation in the pipeline?  The core   PPI is down 02 percent for the first seven months of the year The ECI signals little threat,   either, if one considers the low first-quarter increase along with the larger second-quarter   rise The index rose at a 29 percent annual rate during the first two quarters, compared to   an increase of 33 percent in all of 1998   Looking beyond the inflation numbers, we will get shortly a revised second-quarter   GDP number, which will probably be below 2 percent If it is below 18 percent, it will be   the lowest quarterly increase in real GDP in at least a couple of years Employment growth   remains vigorous Even manufacturing employment has increased The decline in   unemployment has not only reached into the border areas of Texas, but it has reduced   minority unemployment nationwide With inflation low and with the economy strong, I am   concerned that any tightening today would be interpreted as a vote against prosperity    Mr Chairman, like Governor Meyer, I look forward to the debate on   the new economy and to seeing how the actual new economy will play out But the test of     8/24/99 81   the new economy will be marred if we burden it with interest rate increases based only on   demand side considerations without equal consideration given to supply side factors We   had a productivity growth rate of only 13 percent, or even lower, in the second quarter--a   period of rapid growth in hours worked--after it averaged almost 4 percent in the previous   two quarters I expect to see the higher productivity growth trend show through as labor   supply growth slows My guess is that the true productivity growth trend will turn out to be   much closer to 3 percent than to 1 percent Wages may in fact rise even faster than that and   unit labor costs may rise, but after years of a profit boom and after years of an investment   boom that has raised capacity faster than output, it seems to me that higher wages are   appropriate I was taught that wage-push inflation does not occur through higher wages   alone without validation from monetary expansion While we never know what the   appropriate rate of monetary expansion is, it is heartening that money growth has   decelerated in recent months So I would prefer no rate increase at this meeting    We keep hearing that the yen’s appreciation is a result of expectations of a   stronger Japanese economy You just indicated sort of the opposite as far as the United States is   concerned--that the change in relative cyclical positions is expected to cause the dollar to   depreciate Why the difference? Why is Japanese strength supposed to strengthen the yen and   relative US weakness weaken the dollar?    Capital accounts are becoming more important than current accounts?    Economic growth in the Eleventh District continues to expand at a brisk   pace Employment growth in recent months has been running over 3 percent, well above the   national average The improved condition of our trading partners, especially Mexico, has been an   important factor The purchasing power of the Mexican peso is up by more than 10 percent since   the beginning of the year And other leading indicators of future Mexican economic activity,   especially real oil prices and inventories, suggest that the expansion will continue   Rising oil prices are beginning to provide a slight boost to the District economy However,   I need to emphasize that the Texas economy was growing strongly in late 1998 and early 1999,   when oil prices were hovering around $12 a barrel and were anticipated to fall still further Texas   is only about one-fourth as sensitive to changing energy prices as it was a little more than a decade   ago Rising oil prices have triggered a modest increase in drilling activity, although most industry   insiders continue to believe, along with the futures market, that today’s high prices are not   sustainable The Texas rig count has increased 43 percent since June but would need to increase   another 45 percent to reach the level that prevailed the last time prices were above $20 a barrel   Most other sectors of the regional economy are doing well Construction activity remains   steady and retailers report good sales growth The growth in demand for both computers and   semiconductors has been stronger than anticipated a few months ago   The wage data in our region continue to appear benign, while the anecdotal information   signals some upward pressure on labor costs Some firms are hiring workers with fewer skills than   usual One contact reported that “the unemployable are now being employed” The rising tide   appears to be raising more boats We see this dramatically along the Texas-Mexico border where   unemployment rates have fallen to single-digit levels in three of the four major metro areas that   typically experience unemployment rates above 12 percent The pull of a strong labor market in   other parts of Texas and elsewhere in the United States has been working wonders on boosting   economic opportunity for those at the bottom  We must not forget that this has taken place in   recent years against the backdrop of declining inflation   Turning to the national economy, I’m looking for growth over the forecast horizon to   remain in the 3½ percent range that we’ve experienced so far this year This may be on the   optimistic side given the condition of financial markets Most major stock market indexes have     10/5/99 32   fallen by about 10 percent since our last meeting and there has been a noticeable pickup in yield   spreads, both of which should restrain spending behavior by households and businesses Perhaps   our growing current account deficit is already acting to restrain future capital inflows, thereby   reinforcing the tightened stance of monetary policy I’m not foreseeing any significant pickup in   inflation in the next year or so Most broad measures of inflation, including the core CPI, the PCE   deflator, and the GDP deflator, are running below 2 percent The core PPI for finished goods has   declined at a 04 percent annual rate over the last eight months, suggesting mild deflationary   pressure Commodity prices other than oil have stabilized or risen only slightly from their lows   Indeed, it is surprising how little the uptick in commodity prices has been, given the pickup in   demand from Asia and Europe combined with the need to build inventories to deal with Y2K   concerns To me this suggests a continued relative absence of inflation in the pipeline    Mr Chairman, I truly enjoyed your lecture a moment ago and when you   publish it I recommend the title “The Rediscovery of Say’s Law” I think it is important for us to   give Say’s Law at least equal billing with Keynes’s Law in these discussions   During the go-around there was a lot of talk about favorable but temporary factors that   have helped us out on inflation and how a lot of those are petering out That is true, but I still   believe the fundamental factor that has been helping us is the high-tech boom, which is not petering   out and is not likely to peter out any time soon That’s the general phenomenon And the specific   phenomenon is the Internet, which is changing the whole world as we speak When I refer to the   high-tech boom, I’m talking about high-tech electronics, which is helping the GDP numbers But   high-biotech is also raising our standard of living in ways that probably don’t improve those   numbers It may even have a perverse effect on the numbers Cures of diseases, the prevention of   diseases, and shorter hospital stays all may generate less GDP than diseases would   Another huge development that is not over yet, even though it has been going on for almost   a decade, is the collapse of communism and hard core socialism around the world The fact is that   many more countries and many more workers are now part of the world market economy than   before And even where it hasn’t involved a lowering of the iron curtain, there has been a lowering   of the protectionist curtain--in Latin America, for example So we have a big, new, world out there   with lots of new people There’s a lot of catching up to do, a lot of consolidations are going on,   and a lot of privatization And there is still excess capacity in many places around the world,   including the United States We’ve been adding to capacity faster than we’ve been using it So I   feel good about the prospects for further progress on inflation   I know that the current account deficit is large and that we don’t want to rely forever on   capital inflows to augment domestic savings But if it is true that a strong country leads to a strong   currency, we are the premier country in this revolution I think it’s not unreasonable to expect the   dollar generally to remain strong and to continue to give us the benefits of a strong currency in our   inflation battle     10/5/99 64   On the policy decision today, I suspect it’s no surprise that I like the “B” alternative of no   change In my view we’ve had three tightenings already The first was the announcement of the   asymmetric directive, which probably did more harm to the markets than the two other tightening   moves we’ve had I do think we created a monster with our new disclosure policy and the way we   worded that policy But it is still very new, and everybody--especially market participants--knows   it’s not working well So it would seem very reasonable to me for us to announce that because it’s   not working as we had expected, we are going to reassess it--we have formed a subcommittee to   reassess it--and that until that subcommittee reports, we’re not going to be releasing any   information about the symmetry in the directive I would go even further and suggest that the   Committee decide to bury it later on As Ed Boehne said and I believe Bob Parry said, we can still   use words to communicate anything we want But if we could use the opportunity to get out of the   box we’re in on announcing the directive, it would be a very good thing    I’m for the third--to suspend our use and thus announcements of symmetry   or asymmetry I think it’s a tie between the first and the second options I’ll go along with   whatever you decide to do on that question But I think we will miss a great opportunity to get rid   of that bogeyman if we don’t do it now It would be a great time to say this is not working the way   we intended and we’re going to study it And all we have to announce today is no change in the   target fed funds rate    Well, that was before they heard my eloquent argument! [Laughter]    I don’t want to vote next time for a tightening of monetary policy because   the unemployment rate went down    My colleagues won’t want to either    This says that “the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has   been drawn down further, a trend that must eventually be contained…” I don’t think we ought   to say that I think it ought to be drawn down until there’s no one left    I understand the practical problem of achieving that, but it seems to   me that we just shouldn’t be saying that    Mr Chairman, may I?  [Laughter] My objection has more to do with   saying that the trend must be contained If we just referred to it as an unsustainable trend, I think   it would serve your purpose and be a little milder    The sentence as it is now implies that we’re going to stop this decline   in the pool of available workers    Well, it’s not the market that is issuing this press release    I do, too And we know it’s going to come to an end The process   has limits    I continue to think that the best thing for us to do is not to vote on a   bias at the meeting and, therefore, there won’t be one to report on I think it creates too many   opportunities for us to be wrong, to come up with a bias and then not follow through on it   Sometimes I worry that we might follow through on it because we had the bias in the first place   But the argument to so away with the bias statement is obviously not going to go anywhere   So given the choice presented by the Working Group, I find it a very close call I   guess I would go along with alternative I, but would urge some more thinking about the   appropriate words to use On the execution of the Committee’s policy decisions between   meetings, if Al Broaddus and Virgil Mattingly could get together and keep it legal I would hope   that Al’s points could be taken into account I agree with Jack Guynn on the desirability of   consultation with the Committee    Economic activity in the Eleventh District advanced at a healthy rate   in the third quarter, and employment growth continued to run at rates about twice the national   average In retrospect, it appears that the District was more adversely affected by the Asian   crisis than we initially thought and we are now benefiting from the rebound For example,   exports are posting solid gains, the oil business is up, the chemical industry had an excellent third   quarter, and District high-tech companies continue to do well At least one chemical producer is   expecting the best quarter in his company’s history due to the rebound in Asian demand   The construction sector, which played an important role in sustaining employment   growth for the first half of the year, has softened somewhat in recent months, in line with   national trends The single-family segment has softened Houston homebuilders are reporting   that they are beginning to catch up on past backlogs and that materials shortages are   disappearing Infrastructure projects, such as new sports stadiums in Dallas and Houston and   expansion at Houston’s airports and the port, are helping to sustain the construction sector in the   face of a weakening in the housing component   The oil and gas sector also is recovering but cautiously Many producers remain   uncertain about how committed OPEC is to the round of production cuts announced earlier this   year and are unwilling to make big bets that the recent increases in oil prices will stick Thus,     11/16/99 22   most of the increase in US drilling activity since April has been directed to natural gas Also,   recent merger activity has immobilized some of the larger players And if you would like a pun,   one might say that Mobil has immobilized since they reorganized All of the increase in recent   activity is concentrated among the independents, although many of them are finding themselves   financially constrained for having violated bank loan covenants during the period of low oil   prices   On Mexico, there is little new to report on the macro front GDP growth remains   strong along with the peso The main developments since the last FOMC meeting center on   issues regarding the taxation of the maquilladoras and the possibility of tighter restrictions on   cross-border movements of people and vehicles   Turning to national conditions, it is clear despite the broad-based--and likely to be   upwardly revised--expansion of GDP in the third quarter that economic growth is slowing   somewhat The residential construction sector has clearly peaked and consumer spending has   been decelerating over the course of the year There are some signs that manufacturing slowed   as we moved from the third quarter into the fourth However, the pickup in global activity will   provide a boost to growth as we move forward   On the inflation front, most of the deterioration in recent months has been in energy   prices or other transitory phenomena such as the spike in cigarette prices and possibly distorted   seasonals in auto prices When stripped of the food and energy categories, our broadest   measures of inflation, the deflators for personal consumption expenditures and gross domestic   purchases, have been stable in the 1 to 1½ percent range all of this year We do not expect   significant acceleration any time soon I believe there are a number of reasons for optimism   about the inflation outlook While labor markets remain tight, or if anything have gotten tighter,   we still don’t see a significant acceleration in wage pressures The evidence that there has been   an increase in productivity growth is stronger now than it was early this summer The pickup in   productivity growth can account for a lot of the favorable developments we have seen at the   national level recently, and to me there is no reason to believe that it will be reversed any time   soon Finally, other leading indicators of inflation such as commodity prices are giving mixed   signals at best Having said that, it must be acknowledged that a number of the inflation   indicators are flashing red and warrant close monitoring I am thinking in particular of the   September PPI numbers, including the core rate     11/16/99 23   We’ve seen recent movements in the supplier deliveries and prices paid components   of the National Association of Purchasing Managers’ report on manufacturing, both of which   have exceeded 50 percent for six consecutive months The crude goods and intermediate goods   PPI indexes, ex-food and energy, have accelerated steadily over the course of the year and we’ve   seen a recent acceleration in non-oil import prices However, on closer examination some of   these trends are less disturbing than they appear While non-oil import prices have posted   increases in recent months, the fact remains that they are still down from where they were this   time last year Secondly, despite the recent adverse trends, the core crude and intermediate   goods components of the PPI seem to have stabilized somewhat, looking at the 3-month moving   average of the annualized monthly changes, which leaves only the Purchasing Managers’ report   as a real source of concern While these indicators suggest the need for continued vigilance, in   the absence of corroborating evidence of accelerating inflation these data in and of themselves do   not constitute a clear and present danger    I agree with your recommendation for a 25 basis point increase and   for symmetric directive language both because I think it’s better to take the cloud off the markets   and also because I’m not sure that move won’t be the last in a series of tightening actions I feel   rather symmetric myself about where things will be around the middle or end of January   We had an estimated GDP number in the last quarter of 48 percent and we had an   unemployment rate of 41 percent and a labor productivity number of 42 percent In view of   those strong numbers on the real economy, I would hope that in conveying our policy decision to   the public we will focus on inflation, inflation in the pipeline, and leading indicators of inflation   I would not want us to give the impression that we’re trying to slow the economy down or that   we don’t like these strong real growth rates A lot of our critics really don’t mind much what we   do so long as they don’t think we’re doing it for the wrong reasons And I tend to agree with   that So I would urge that the rhetoric be given some consideration    I’m persuaded by Bill Poole’s arguments The argument he made   that is most significant to me is point 2, having to do with the Phillips curve In the   language of Option 1, the opposite of economic weakness is inflation That’s a built-in   Phillips curve, and for that reason I would go with Option 2    Economic growth in the Eleventh District has accelerated slightly   over the last couple of months Thanks to higher oil and natural gas prices, the energy   sector has picked up somewhat, with the result that overall economic activity and optimism   in Houston and the Gulf Coast area more generally have improved significantly Houston   had been the only spot of softness among our major metropolitan areas Growth in our   manufacturing industries has been robust of late Higher interest rates combined with some   overbuilding have acted to put a dent in the pace of new home and commercial construction   activity In spite of continued widespread talk about tight labor markets, retailers in the   District report that, surprisingly, they were able to find a good supply of workers for the   holiday season, contrary to Cathy Minehan’s report on New England Employers in the   high-tech field continue to innovate in their practice of boosting non-base pay so that their   overall increases in compensation are held within the boundaries necessary to maintain   profit margins   The national economy, if anything, seems stronger--and uniformly stronger--than   even the most optimistic forecasters had anticipated I understand that the variance in state   employment growth rates is at its lowest level ever recorded, which reflects a national   economy without any significant regional shocks and an economy with very low frictional   unemployment associated with the need for labor mobility   As forecasts are revised upward so, too, is the outlook for productivity gains and   reduced unit labor costs We seem to remain in the virtuous cycle of supply expanding in   tandem with increased demand or vice versa The improved growth prospects around the   world do not seem to alter the situation The Blue Chip median forecasts for the fifteen   largest economies are uniformly positive--and significantly in all of them economic activity   increased between March and November--consistent with Karen Johnson’s report earlier   regarding the staff’s forecast for the rest of the world But the strong performance of world     12/21/99 30   equity markets suggests that growing world demand can be accommodated without higher   inflation   In the coming weeks, the Fed should do nothing that will alter the markets’   confidence that we stand ready to provide liquidity and stability to financial markets After   Y2K events are clearly behind us, we can address the longer-term policy issues at our   February meeting In my judgment, any public discussion of a bias in our thinking at this   time can only cause disruption and should be avoided    Symmetric     We need to get that chair reupholstered!     Referring to Cathy Minehan’s remarks about CEOs spending a lot   more time worrying about the stock market and their stock prices and to Jerry Jordan's   conversation with one of his contacts about having excellent performance and falling stock   prices at the same time  I recently spoke to a national manufacturers’ association and heard a lot   of similar comments  In particular, the CEO of a corporation headquartered in Toledo, who may   be the same fellow Jerry talked to, said that the last two years have been his company’s two best   years and yet their stock price has gone down by, I think, about 50 percent  And all their   employee stock options are under water--not worth anything   The Eleventh District economy continues to chug along, with employment growth in   January and February matching last year's healthy pace  At meetings of our board of directors   and our small business and agriculture advisory council held in the last two weeks, the overall   sentiment was upbeat on economic prospects for the near-term future, although the farmers and   agricultural bankers in those groups were discouraged about the prospects for agriculture     The Texas economy still generally benefits from higher energy prices, but we are not   seeing a significant impact this time around  Oil producers continue to view current prices as   temporary and we see only a modest increase in drilling activity, tilted more toward gas than oil    I would say that the industry agrees with the trajectory of oil prices shown in the Greenbook    The higher oil prices are hurting the profit margins of refiners and chemical producers  In              - 57 -     response, they have sharply reduced their capacity utilization rates  That is keeping upward   pressure on gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil prices  Many independent oil producers are using   today's high prices to pay down debt and perform maintenance that was deferred a year ago when   oil prices were in the $10 to $11 range  One of our economists commented recently during a   briefing that for oil producers the misery of uncertainty may be worse than the certainty of   misery!  [Laughter]   The construction sector is a mixed picture  Office and hotel construction has slowed   in response to potential overbuilding  In Austin, where the high-tech sector is booming, housing   supply is having difficulty keeping up with the demand, which has prompted one Austin builder   to joke that his firm’s new motto is “We will build your home within your lifetime"  [Laughter]   Throughout the rest of the District, housing construction is strong but considerably below the   peak level of activity last year  In contrast to the materials shortages cited by Jerry a moment   ago, shortages of materials such as cement and sheetrock have ended in our region  The main   constraint on construction activity is a shortage of workers rather than a shortage of any   materials     Export demand has gained strength, especially from our NAFTA partners, Mexico and   Canada, which account for more than half of Texas’ exports to foreign countries  Computer and   semiconductor manufacturers report that demand has stabilized at quite strong levels after   rebounding from a Y2K slowdown at the end of last year  And the demand for computer chips   of all types has been growing strongly, especially as demand from Asia continues to improve    Labor markets remain tight across the District  The Texas unemployment rate, which was 44   percent in February, has been running at or near its lowest rate in 20 years  Wage increases have              - 58 -     accelerated slightly from recent trends but seem to be in line with productivity growth  Signing   bonuses seem to be spreading to an ever-widening range of workers   Turning to the national economy, I agree with the Greenbook's optimism for near-term   economic growth  That is probably because I believe in the faster productivity growth scenario   shown in the simulations on page I-17  Outside of energy and tobacco, consumer prices remain   well behaved and the core CPI remains on its long-term downward trajectory  Technology,   immigration, and global competition are still making a difference   Fiscal policy is beginning to add to the drag of tighter monetary policy  Government   spending at 187 percent of GDP is the lowest it has been since 1974, while tax revenues at 20   percent of GDP are at their highest since 1945  It seems to me that this growing fiscal drag has   reduced somewhat the need for further monetary restraint--or at least further monetary restraint   as far as the eye can see  As for inflation in the pipeline, there seems to be no clear trend in non-  energy commodity prices, and they remain well below the peak reached back in 1997   The dollar remains strong  Core inflation remains moderate  Productivity growth   continues to accelerate and to restrain unit labor costs  And money growth remains within   bounds  With the boost we've already seen in real short-term interest rates, it is hard for me   under these circumstances to develop enthusiasm for a long string of further rate hikes     Are we starting the go-around?      A while ago leaning against the wind was mentioned  I noted earlier   that we recently had a meeting of our Advisory Council on Small Business and Agriculture, and   I learned at that meeting that on the plains of the Texas Panhandle a fairly constant and fairly   strong wind prevails most of the time  All of the chickens have gotten used to leaning against   that wind to remain upright  And one day last month the wind quit blowing and all the chickens   fell over!  [Laughter]   I agree with your recommendation for a 1/4 point increase in the funds rate with   asymmetry  I think that is the correct move for now  I just hope that we will take it one step at a   time and not say too much publicly between meetings, scaring little children and the financial   markets     I think we ought to grow our balance sheet with real estate!    [Laughter]     We could build buildings and ease Peter’s problem!     On page 9 in Part I of the Greenbook is a paragraph labeled   “Prospects for the supply side of the economy and inflation”  It’s nice to see the supply side   covered there  The first sentence says  “The expansion of aggregate supply has been   substantial, but nowhere near enough to match the advance of demand”  I'm not sure what   that means  Presumably when you look at the economy you are sort of observing the   intersection of supply and demand and both are advancing  Does your sentence just mean that   as they have advanced inflation has gone up a little?  Is that the evidence on which you base   that statement?     It looks to me as if you've said that the growth was the same but   we are just running out of potential for further growth in supply or something like that      Overall economic growth in the Eleventh District remains quite   healthy   However, a few signs of slower growth in response to higher interest rates are just   beginning to appear  At our board of directors meeting last Thursday, we heard more of a   mixed picture on the economy than we have in quite some time  In the Dallas area the   demand for large custom homes has slowed noticeably in the last month, probably in response   to the lower and more volatile stock market  In Houston the housing market is said to be   doing well but much less so than a few months ago  Throughout Texas, with the possible   exception of Austin, nonresidential construction of all types--offices, commercial space,      68  roads, and other infrastructure--has continued the slide that began in January  On the other   hand, one of our directors from the                            industry noted that she is seeing the   strongest growth in electronics in four years  Purchases of PCs by businesses have begun to   pick up     Labor shortages are still the most common anecdote  It has even spread to   academia where “raiding” parties are trying to recruit away faculty members  In Austin,   where shortages of high-tech labor have persisted for a longer time than in other parts of   Texas, some employers have been giving quarterly rather than annual salary increases, as Bill   Poole reported for his District  In spite of the pressures on wages, there are few examples of   businesses passing on higher input prices unless the increases are related to higher energy   costs  In that regard, during my cab ride here yesterday I noticed a little sign in the cab that   said a 50-cent surcharge was being added because of higher fuel costs, with dates indicating   the time period during which the surcharge would be applicable  Nevertheless, there are   exceptions  In Texas competitive pressures are keeping a lid on chemical prices   Texas oil and gas employment is finally responding to the now fairly sustained   higher prices we have had  Oil and gas employment increased in March at a rate of 64   percent, the rig count is rising, and well permits increased in the first quarter in Texas from   793 to 1,121     On the subject of automobiles that Mike Moskow was talking about earlier, let me   pass on a comment of one of                                                                  who owns some car   dealerships  He was telling me how remarkable it is that when one part of the country   experiences a shift in purchasing, the pattern is almost identical all over the country; it’s      69  uncanny the way the country moves together on that  And he reported that in early May sales   dropped off quite considerably in those dealerships with which he is familiar   At the national level, it is a little harder to find consistent responses to the Fed's rate   hikes  Last month's weakness in retail sales could be the start of a new trend, but it is too   early to judge  Housing demand probably has begun to deteriorate, but a rush to buy in   anticipation of further increases in interest rates may have masked the underlying   deterioration  April’s down-drift in the stock market could produce a notable reverse wealth   effect for the remainder of the year  This morning's CPI number serves as a hopeful   suggestion that we may not be guilty of doing too little too late or be behind the curve  Our   gradualist approach has served us well and I see no compelling reasons to depart from that   strategy  An upcreep in inflation pressures calls for a measured response and continued   vigilance  Or, as Tom Hoenig put it, let's not get “sweaty hands"      While I would have preferred 1/4 point, I can also agree to 1/2    Looking forward, I would just remind us that this afternoon the prime will go to 9-1/2 percent,   and that's getting close to that psychologically important double-digit level     First, regarding the Greenbook forecast, the Board’s staff is appropriately   euphoric about productivity  [Laughter]  Second, productivity growth is a good thing and recent   productivity growth certainly has not produced a wealth effect through the stock market   As for our regional economy, growth in the Eleventh District has slackened somewhat   over the last few months, but it continues at a healthy and sustainable rate  Labor market tightness,   the impact of past interest rate hikes, and a stalled stock market are factors frequently cited for the   slower pace  Reduced growth in the interest-sensitive sectors has been partially offset by the   recovery of the oil and gas industry, which is still in its early stages  In spite of growth having   slowed from its breakneck pace of late 1999 and early 2000, the Texas unemployment rate at 41   percent is now at its lowest level since 1974  I might reiterate that in the major metropolitan areas of   Texas the unemployment rate is considerably below 4 percent  The rate for the State of Texas is   held up primarily by the border counties, but even in those areas the unemployment rates have come   down significantly     The value of construction contracts in Texas has been on a downward trend since early in   the year, having fallen 14 percent year-to-date  Residential construction is off slightly but   commercial construction is down sharply  We are beginning to see some diverging views on future   growth in construction activity  Several developers are very optimistic about future demand growth   but they have begun to complain that lenders are “unjustly restraining construction because they fear   overbuilding"  A quick look at office vacancy rates in an historical context suggests that the real   estate developers may have a case  Houston downtown vacancies are at an 18-year low, and in       45  Austin rents and occupancy rates of 98 percent are at their highest levels on record  The tighter   lending standards that banks are reporting in our lending officer surveys seem to be reinforcing the   impact of higher interest rates   Another area of slower activity is retail sales  In addition, continued drought has added to   the troubles of farmers and ranchers  High-tech industries, especially semiconductors, have been   enjoying steady sales growth internationally since the end of the Asian crisis  Salary increases in the   high-tech sector--notably in the Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin areas--are running at a 16 percent   annual rate in the second quarter  And recruiters are saying that IT professionals can name their own   salaries  With H(1)B visa legislation stalled in Congress, the shortage of IT workers is not expected   to end anytime soon  Before we jump to the conclusion that double-digit wage gains translate into   price inflation, let's remember that prices of products such as semiconductors, computers, and   peripherals have been declining at a 15 to 25 percent rate for years on end   At the national level, the economy appears to reflect the same factors that are affecting the   Eleventh District, except that higher oil and gas prices impact it differently  The more interest-  sensitive sectors of the economy have slowed  The slower growth of demand, in tandem with   constant competitive pressures, has kept inflationary pressures in check  In fact, outside of the   inflation numbers in February and March, there has not been a major inflation breakout this year    Productivity growth has kept pace with compensation gains, yielding a decline in unit labor costs in   the last four quarters  Most commodity prices have been contained  Gold has hovered around a low   $270 level and the dollar remains strong  We still hear as many complaints about the lack of pricing   power as we do about labor scarcity  I read this as evidence that our monetary policy is appropriate   and that we can afford to await evidence to the contrary before feeling compelled to raise rates again     I support your recommendation          84     I have a couple of questions, but first I want to say that I think we have a   good chance of making a profit on this one     Going back to the Chairman’s earlier question about how much did the taxpayers lose by   our buying euros at the price we bought them, I assume that was in contrast to the price at which we   could have bought them  What exactly are the mechanics of determining the price?     I’m an innocent, so you may have to explain this in more detail to me    You are saying that                                                                                             ?     Another question is on the definition of sterilization  How do we know   this intervention is sterilized on their part?  I take it the definition of unsterilized intervention in this   case would be that fewer euros and more dollars are created in the near future than would otherwise   have been created  On our side, we are going to do what we are going to do without taking that   intervention into consideration, but do we know that our counterparts at the ECB aren’t going to take   some actions that would keep the intervention from being entirely sterilized?     It is conceivable that their target for the interest rate will be different   than it would have been had they not intervened, isn’t it?     I understand that, but--      I’m saying that we’re all talking as if this has been sterilized      The seigniorage is good!     The economy in the Eleventh District has begun to strengthen modestly   in recent months, with employment growth expanding at an annual rate of just over 3 percent  While   the national economy has been slowed by the head winds of higher interest rates, higher energy   prices, a stronger dollar, and a sputtering stock market, Texas and the rest of the Eleventh District   have been steering into cross winds instead  Higher oil and natural gas prices have provided some   lift to the District economy at the same time as a strong Mexican economy and strong peso have   boosted demand for exports from Texas  While we often think of the United States as a has-been in   the energy business, it does remain the largest oil and gas producer in the Western Hemisphere,   trailing only Saudi Arabia and the former Soviet Union in oil production and the former Soviet   Union in gas production  Texas produces almost a fourth of US oil and about a third of its natural   gas  The Texas rig count, about 80 percent of which involves drilling for natural gas, has continued   its strong upward trend that began in the spring  At our last board meeting one of our banking   directors noted that he had just made his first loan on a rig in many years after having sworn he   would never do so again!  Low oil inventories and high product prices are helping both oil producers   and refiners  But petrochemical companies are caught in a squeeze between record high prices for   natural gas feed stocks and excessive inventories stemming from new capacity brought on line in      47  recent years  This has resulted in a sharp drop in construction of new plants in the Houston/Gulf   Coast area   While the value of heavy construction has declined sharply, residential construction has   leveled off at a high plateau  Shortages of some home construction materials seem to have ended,   though products requiring major energy inputs such as roofing, cement, and brick, are rising in price    This is being offset by declines in prices of lumber and sheet rock  A sharp slowdown in apartment   construction in Dallas and Houston has freed up a sufficient number of skilled construction workers   to relieve the shortages that were a problem earlier in the year  Some suburban markets are   beginning to show signs of apartment overbuilding, and one month's free rent and other incentives   are now being offered  The resurgence in high-tech has helped to boost the Texas economy but   disquieting signs are beginning to emerge  Semiconductor sales growth remains strong but has   slowed recently  Inventories have risen modestly and large increases in capacity are due to come on   line soon  Fears of falling prices and shrinking profit margins have begun to spread through the   industry and among its investors  Export demand for Texas products continues to rise sharply    Nearly half of all of Texas exports go to Mexico, so the strong dollar has mattered less for the   Eleventh District economy than for the rest of the country  Mexico has been helped by higher oil   prices, a strong economy, large capital inflows, and a political situation that has been more stable   than many anticipated a few months ago     Turning to the national economy, I must say that I agree with the broad outline of the   Greenbook forecast  Growth will remain healthy and could moderate a bit next year  The modest   inflation reprieve we have experienced this year is likely to subside over the next couple of years  I   applaud the writers of the Greenbook for raising their estimates of structural productivity growth and   potential output expansion to be more in keeping with the economy's experience in recent years       48  And I agree with Al Broaddus and others that the Greenbook writers are on a roll, but I don't share   Al’s worry that productivity growth might be inflationary in the next few months   As for inflation risks looking forward, I remain encouraged by longer-term productivity   trends, which have allowed supply and demand growth to remain well balanced  While the short-  term inflation risks remain on the up side, I take encouragement from the continued strength of the   dollar, the steadiness of gold prices, and the softness in non-energy commodity prices  My   inclination is for monetary policy to remain on hold for the time being     I agree     Like that for the nation, the economy in the Eleventh District has   begun to show signs of slower growth during the past couple of months  Both the energy and   high-tech sectors have been positive factors recently but growth in the computer, electronics, and   communications equipment industries has tapered off in recent months  Labor shortages   continue to restrain growth in many sectors  For example, in October the oil and gas rig count in   Texas was 368, up 35 percent since the beginning of the year, but employment in that sector is   up less than 2 percent over the same period  For months now, energy industry contacts have   reported difficulty in hiring workers who have plenty of opportunity in other safer and more   stable industries  To cite an anecdote that may be indicative of hiring pressures in the industry    More than 10 rigs were shut down in the Midland/Odessa area in recent raids by the Immigration   and Naturalization Service  If the INS policy of benign neglect were to end, employment growth   in Texas and many other regions could slow or reverse significantly, especially in construction,   hotels, and restaurants   All sectors of the economy that are sensitive to interest rates, oil and gas prices, and   tech stocks are showing signs of slowing  Moreover, we have noticed a fairly sharp mood shift   to the down side  The mood has deteriorated much more than the economic data  That shift in   mood was noticeable between our September and October board meetings and then again   between our October and November meetings  Several directors mentioned that retailers are   expecting a weak holiday season and thus have been holding back on inventory accumulation  It   seems likely under these circumstances that weak December sales could become a self-fulfilling   prophecy               42      Signs of slowing at the national level are becoming more widespread  Pipeline   inflation has cooled in recent months  The price of gold has fallen to the mid-260s; the prices of   many key commodities have fallen  The dollar remains strong  And the PPI for crude and   intermediate goods remains well below the PPI for finished goods  Tighter credit standards by   banks and tighter conditions in the capital markets are reinforcing the already slower growth of   demand  In these circumstances, the risks have shifted significantly and are at least as large, if   not larger, on the down side as on the up side  It's getting to the time when we as a Committee   need to recognize and prepare ourselves as well as the markets for the possibility that the   downside risks in the economy have escalated and may need to be addressed in the near future  I   say that for a lot of the reasons that Tom Hoenig put on his list   So, I favor moving to balance in   the risk statement of the press release  And for the record, my guess is that our next move will   be an easing move     I would strongly prefer a statement of balanced risks, not   because I think the inflation risk has diminished, but because the risk on the down side   has increased substantially  And as Bill Poole said, that assessment could be   communicated in the press release so as not to give the market the wrong idea  I happen   to believe that rapid growth in productivity and output has been holding inflation down in   recent years  If I'm right about that, the unfortunate corollary is that less strength in those   supply-side factors could lead to higher inflation even as demand weakens  A more   extreme version of that used to be called stagflation  We need to be in a position to move   in either direction and not be caught leaning in one direction and suddenly have to move   in another We have an oil price problem, which may be with us longer than we expect    Given that, along with the decline and volatility in the stock market, the increased strains   in financial markets, the decline in profit growth, and the volatility in the Middle East and   Florida [Laughter], I think a move to a balanced risk statement would reassure markets   that we are living in the real world  Otherwise, I think we're going to appear to be out of   touch with what's going on     In the Eleventh District the slowing economic growth that I've reported   at the last two FOMC meetings has continued and has become more widespread  Weaker growth is   apparent nearly everywhere  At last Thursday's board of directors meeting there was considerable   discussion of anemic retail sales and the enormous discounting of merchandise--to a degree not seen      24  in many years  Construction activity has been declining throughout much of this year and the   softening in that sector has spread to construction-related manufacturers   New capacity coming on line in a number of industries is exacerbating the effects of   slowing demand  Manufacturers of petrochemicals, metals, and cement indicate that they have   stopped hiring and have laid off workers  These industries also report rising inventories and falling   prices  The widely reported softening of sales and profits in computers, semiconductors, and   telecommunications equipment has muted the growth outlook in Texas due to the concentrated   presence of these industries  Even in the services sector, employment growth is half what it was   earlier this year  Law firms seem to be unaffected  They just shift their specialty from new   incorporations and IPOs to bankruptcies!   Parenthetically, there's an ad on the radio that I hear every   morning when I’m driving to work  A law firm advertises itself as a small boutique for taking care   of your intellectual property and class action needs  [Laughter]  They're straddling the old economy   and the new economy   At last month's FOMC meeting, I noted the deteriorating mood of the Dallas Fed's   directors at recent meetings  Their negative view of the current economic environment and the   outlook showed further deterioration at last Thursday's meeting   Turning to the national economy, let me raise this question What do we know now that   we didn't know at the time of our November meeting?  For one we know that the political   uncertainties we faced then were not a short-term phenomenon  The uncertainties go well beyond   vote counting and constitutional interpretations and will be of longer duration  Second, we know   that the economy is much weaker now than anticipated a month ago  The "R" word is now used   openly just about everywhere, and even the Greenbook authors felt obliged to include a hard landing   scenario  Third, inflation risks are somewhat lower than contemplated a month ago  Virtually every      25  projected measure of inflation on page I-11 of the Greenbook is lower this time than last  And   fourth, the psychological mood of the country has deteriorated in some cases and nose-dived in   others  We see it in consumer confidence measures and we hear it in the media and in our own   boardrooms   When I put all this together, I see a cumulative, compounding, downside risk to the   economic outlook  Adding to our difficulty is the reality that the Fed is the only economic policy   game in town for at least the next several months and maybe longer  Discretionary fiscal policy is   likely to be on hold for months to come  Still worse, the debates that we will be hearing about   dozens of tax and spending plans will lead businesses and households to postpone important   investment and spending decisions until a clearer picture emerges on what will actually pass the   political process  Adding to the psychologically based economic pulling back that we've already   seen, the international risks to our economy have also shifted  Estimates of growth abroad have been   scaled back  Several important countries are facing a downshifting in their rate of growth, adding to   their already serious financial strains  Evidence of new financial strains in the United States has   been appearing daily  Tighter credit conditions for all but the most exemplary credit risks are adding   to expectations of inventory price reductions     As the Bluebook points out on page 8, there is considerable cost in policy inaction  We   could wait and see what new information we get between now and our meeting at the end of   January, but I sense that the deterioration in the economic situation will likely accelerate in the   weeks ahead  If we wait, I think we will find ourselves at our January meeting wishing that we had   adopted the Bluebook's alternative A  While a 4 to 4-1/2 percent real funds rate may have been   appropriate earlier this year when the economy and productivity growth were much stronger and   credit conditions were much easier, a lower rate is called for currently  Easing today would be      26  awkward if not embarrassing because of our current bias  However, making an awkward right   decision for the economy is preferable to making a face-saving wrong one     Predictably, let me say that a quarter point is not much, and I really think   we need to get started earlier rather than later  I agree with most of what Bill Poole said about the   current situation  One thing he said was that we are not going to learn much in early January except   the employment-unemployment numbers  We actually had a decline in employment last month on   the household measure  You once said, Mr Chairman, that we always make one move too many  If   we lowered the funds rate a quarter point now, we’d remove just half of our last increase  If we   expect to act by telephone, I'm afraid it will look as if we decided at that point that we made a      83  mistake today  On the other hand, I came into this meeting expecting the outcome to be a balanced   risk statement and this is better than that!  [Laughter]     At our last meeting I said that the Beige Book was the most   negative I had seen--most negative in the sense of the most rapid deterioration of   conditions--in both the summary of national developments and the report on the Eleventh   District  I understand that it reflected conditions in early January  The current Beige   Book, reflecting late February, depicted a somewhat better picture  The Eleventh District   economy is softening but labor markets remain fairly tight despite high profile layoff   announcements  Since the start of the year, Dell, Motorola, Nokia, and Texas   Instruments have all announced major layoffs or early retirement programs in Texas    Overall our job growth has slowed to about half of the long-run average but has remained   positive so far despite the spreading of contractions in manufacturing to service sectors   such as transportation and retail trade  Not long ago the Texas economy had three   positives going for it higher energy prices, strong high-tech manufacturing, and a strong   Mexican economy supporting Texas exports  High-tech manufacturing is now hurting     3/20/01 47  and the Mexican economy has slowed significantly  Of the three, only high energy prices   remain, which is unfortunate for the country at large and for most of Texas as well     Mexican real GDP, industrial production, and hours worked in manufacturing   declined in the fourth quarter of 2000  Our leading economic index for Mexico has   declined since September and is signaling sluggish growth this year  Texas exports,   which are predominantly to Mexico, declined in the fourth quarter  The maquiladoras   along the border are concentrated in industries like autos and high-tech that are   experiencing sharply lower US demand  Press reports forecast maquila layoffs of 1 to 2   percent  That has negative implications for US border towns whose unemployment   rates had finally fallen below 10 percent over the past couple of years  On the positive   side, lower mortgage rates have helped to support our housing sector, and Beige Book   contacts report a modest improvement in construction-related manufacturing   Turning to the national economy, the dramatic decline in stock prices, even   since our last meeting and including Dow Blue Chip stocks as well as NASDAQ tech   stocks, is dominating discussion and making recession seem inevitable to most of the   people with whom I talk  Opinion is about evenly divided between those who think we   are about to be in a recession and those who think we already are  It seems as if January   31st was a long time ago and talk of the Fed’s aggressive action in January has turned to   talk of the Fed being behind the curve  Fifty basis points, which seemed hefty in January,   is now regarded by many commentators as inadequate today and likely to disappoint   financial markets  Frankly, I don't see an easy way out of the box we seem to be in  I   agree that we don’t want to appear to be easing policy to support the stock market--but I   do believe the stock market is leading the economy down--nor do I want to be in a     3/20/01 48  position of having policy dictated by talking heads on Wall Street and in the press  The   problem is that I think they’re probably right  Not taking a particular action because they   seem to be dictating it is reacting to them just as much as taking an action because of   them  I believe the arguments for front-loading policy easing are just as valid today as   they were at the last meeting  A 1/2 point cut today has been expected and priced into the   markets for quite a while now, and even so equity markets have tanked and longer-term   rates have fallen relative to short rates  It will take a bolder move to reverse the negative   psychology, including the widespread feeling that we’re behind the curve  We need to do   more rather than less, sooner rather than later     I support your recommendation and I hope we will be flexible   and willing to have an intermeeting discussion if the data suggest the need for that  But I   share the reservations of those who would rather leave the reference to that possibility out   of the language of our press statement     When I look across the Eleventh District economy for signs that the   economy is picking up, I’m hard pressed to find any  The bulk of the statistics and anecdotes   suggest an economy whose growth rate is barely perceptible and not changing  To be sure, there     5/15/01     62   are pockets of strength, notably housing and energy  But the rest of the picture that emerges is   far less encouraging  The unemployment rate has been edging up  And initial unemployment   claims, together with an almost constant drone of layoff announcements, portend additional   increases in unemployment in the months to come  Until recently, most laid-off workers were   being absorbed, but the layoffs are currently swamping the demand for hiring  The rise of job   search engines has probably reduced somewhat the impact of the job turn in this cycle in   comparison with previous downturns in labor demand  So, even during a recession in the high-  tech sector, information technology advances of recent years may be helping to cushion the   impact     For Texas and the rest of the Eleventh District, the first couple of sentences of our   Beige Book report summarize the situation  Our January Beige Book was the most pessimistic   report ever written by the economist who has been working on that document for the last dozen   years  This time she reported that economic activity decelerated in March and early April and   that contacts in most industries expect activity to remain sluggish throughout the year  Cutting   through all the code words, our analysis suggests a no-growth regional economy in the second,   third, and fourth quarters  She also noted that “there were more reports of price declines than   price increases,” suggesting that the inflationary risks in the months ahead are somewhat   minimal  The reports from many other Districts reflect a similar tone, so the Dallas District is   not an isolated example   Turning to the national economy, I’m struck by the reversal in Greenbook forecasts    The staff has been revising down its forecasts of economic growth in much the same manner as it   was revising them up just a few years ago  I’m also struck by how the progressively worse   outlook as reflected in the Greenbook is following the same pattern--with a lag--that appeared in     5/15/01     63   the anecdotal information in the Beige Book  As I look to the rest of the economy going   forward, I don’t see a lot of room for policy error, given the current state of the economy  We   need more ease, and the question is only one of degree     The international outlook continues to soften  Business investment continues to   weaken  And personnel managers have been standing in the hallways in order to get the pink   slips out faster  Under the circumstances, consumer spending is holding up reasonably well    The housing market is steady and refinancings have helped to offset some other negative factors   for households and for investment grade corporations  The impact of our four previous easings   should begin to kick in soon, together with an expansionary fiscal package     Over the last week or two I had thought that lowering rates by another 1/2 point at this   meeting would be going 1/4 point too far, given what we had already done and the way   consumption spending was holding up  But the Greenbook commentary suggesting that   consumption activity might already have started to weaken has caused me to reconsider my   reconsideration  Perhaps my strong certainty as to the need and direction of a policy move and   my less strong certainty as to the appropriate degree of easing suggest a different type of action   this time  After what we’ve already done, maybe we can have a compromise that would reduce   the fed funds rate by more than the discount rate, thus narrowing the spread and taking a small   first step toward making the discount rate a penalty rate     As Mark Anthony said when he burst into Cleopatra’s bedroom, I’m   not here to make a speech  So I agree with both of your recommendations       You’re not going to let my comment discourage you, though!     5/15/01     91    At each of our recent meetings I’ve expected better news next time,   and each time the news has been disappointing  The slowdown is now a year old and shows few   signs of coming to an end Monetary policy easing began almost eight months ago  Fiscal   policy has now eased and tax rebate checks are in the mail  More recently, we seem to have   escaped a worsening of the energy crunch  These three major factors--monetary stimulus in the   pipeline, checks in the mail, and improvement in the energy outlook--should help to produce a   turnaround but there is scant evidence that they have started to do so yet  Monetary policy   probably has helped to cushion the decline, which has proven to be worse than expected     Three special sources of strength in the Eleventh District used to be high-tech   manufacturing, trade with a booming Mexico, and energy  High-tech manufacturing is in a   serious recession The Mexican economy is declining  And the energy boost seems to have   peaked out, luckily Texas employment growth, which had exceeded the national average in   nine of the past ten years, has weakened sharply in every region and sector of the state, but most     8/21/01 16   sharply in the technology centers of Austin and North Dallas  Because of energy there is   continued moderate growth in the Houston area, however  The decline in Mexican   manufacturing, especially along the border in the maquiladora plants, is being felt in Texas   border towns   In the energy area, rig counts both in Texas and the nation are below their July peaks    About 80 percent of drilling is for natural gas, for which the price has declined below $4 per   thousand to around $3 now That is still somewhat high by recent historical standards but it is   back close to its more usual relationship to the price of crude oil  The mood remains dark in   most technology sectors, but some anecdotal comments are beginning to be more positive in the   semiconductor industry  The US semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio has risen   modestly since hitting an all time low of 036 in April   At the national level, the Greenbook forecast and the GDP revisions tell us that not   only is the current economy getting worse but so has the past  Neither the past nor the future is   what it used to be [Laughter] And the risks to the forecast seem mostly to be on the downside    The main positive in the Greenbook was the slightly improved outlook for inflation over the   forecast period, and I’m not very confident about that  One way to look at the situation is that   more slack in the economy will produce less pressure on prices  But another way to look at it   includes the possibility that supply may be cut back faster than demand, a reversal of the   disinflationary consequences of rapid output growth in the late 1990s   Based only on the state of the economy and its near-term prospects, a large policy   action is called for today But it’s a closer call when we consider the lags and the degree of   stimulus already in the pipeline  As for the directive and the bias statement, I don’t know   whether it’s better to speak softly and carry a big stick or to be more diplomatic and say “nice     8/21/01 17   doggy” while looking for an even bigger stick If the bias statement and the press release   weren’t already written, I’d say it’s going to be difficult to write them this time  [Laughter]    I think your proposal is just right    Excellent    One of the minor casualties of September 11th was our   educated and informed views and knowledge regarding the state of the economy  That   knowledge, such as it was, is now obsolete and there’s very little with which to replace it    I agree that our economy will probably be okay in the long run once we get past this   unsettlement  And I’m fairly confident that the consequences in the very short term will   be seriously negative  The economy was already teetering on the brink of recession and   this event has surely pushed it over that brink  What I don’t know is how deep and how   long the recession will be--that is, the outlook for the medium term  No one can know   that now because it hasn’t been determined yet  The length and depth of the recession   will depend more on how everyone reacts to what happened on September 11th than on   the event itself  It’s hard to imagine that the great uncertainty on all fronts won’t cause   consumers and businesses alike to withdraw from new commitments and to hunker down   We deal here in spending and income as measured by GDP and its   components, but we should not forget that we are now poorer in ways beyond any   estimates of GDP measures  We will be poorer at each level of GDP than we were before   September 11th To buy a level of security at or even below what we were already used   to or thought we had will require more of our scarce resources to be devoted to security    More policemen, firemen, airport security, border security, and air marshals will be   needed They will generate measured income or GDP, but their opportunity costs will be   large     10/2/01 35   We will also be poorer as a result of longer lines and longer waits at airports,   sporting events, concerts, and simply getting in and out of public buildings  We will miss   out on a lot of good immigrants who won’t get into our country as we try to screen out   the undesirable ones  We will probably have to reintroduce some redundancies and   inefficiencies that had been wrung out of the economy  As Ed Yardeni put it, “just-in­  time inventories may become just-in-case inventories”  Backup and relocation sites that   will sit idle most of the time will become more important, even essential  Much of this   will contribute to GDP but will represent a downgrading of living standards  Poorer will   be the workers who will have to postpone retirement because their 401ks have tanked and   the potential students who will have to enter the labor force rather than college  I don’t   know how to add all these factors, along with the decline in the stock market, into an   estimate of the size of the negative wealth effect  But I believe they will be important   factors   As to the specific impact on the Eleventh District, I don’t know much beyond   the obvious Most sectors and regions have weakened  American, Continental, and   Southwest Airlines are headquartered in Texas, so we will feel the decline in air travel   and related industries more than most areas Our exports, especially to Mexico and Asia,   are off The decline in energy prices will remove a local positive, thank goodness    Natural gas is back down to $250 per million BTUs, half of last year’s price  We   probably do have some firms that will benefit from beefed up defense spending, but we   should not forget that that will represent a diversion of spending and not necessarily new   spending I’m told that Texas has about 500 manufacturing firms involved in the   manufacture of instruments relating to research, detection, navigation, guidance,     10/2/01 36   aeronautical and nautical systems, as well as measuring and controlling systems  We also   have a significant regional presence of high-tech defense companies, such as Northrop   Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Bell Textron  The stock prices of the first   three have risen since the market reopened  Bell Textron’s has not  It is still suffering   from setbacks to the Osprey--the airplane that is supposed to land and take off like a   helicopter and not require airports or flat terrain  If they could just get that plane to work,   I know some places with bad terrain where they might be able to use it!     As for the national economy and the policy question, I had been thinking that   this year’s reduction in the funds rate from 6-1/2 to 3 percent plus all the extra liquidity   that has been provided would probably be enough  But the psychology of the financial   markets and their fragility might require a tad more easing  I’m somewhat surprised,   however, by the near unanimity in the markets that we will reduce the funds rate by   another 50 basis points today The markets seem insatiable as well as fragile!  I tend to   think something less would be sufficient, but it is an awkward time to disappoint the   markets in an effort to reclaim the Committee’s authority over monetary policy  A fed   funds rate of 3 percent was the low point of the nominal rate during the ’90-’91 recession    But as the staff points out, the lower inflation rate today makes the current fed funds rate   about a percentage point higher in real terms  Aside from the potential consequences of   disappointing the market, I believe the amount of weight that we give to that distinction   between the nominal and the real rate is probably the key to today’s policy decision    I support your recommendation     Economic activity in the Eleventh District continued to weaken over the   past six weeks Although the District economy had probably begun to slump even before our last   meeting, output declines now appear to be more pronounced and widespread  Four of the District’s   usual economic drivers--air transportation, energy, border trade, and worker migration--have turned   from plus to minus  As I mentioned last time, we certainly are sharing in the national economic     11/6/01 29   slowdown related to air travel, with Dallas a hub for American Airlines and Southwest, and Houston   a hub for Continental Activity in our energy industry has slowed too, responding to a decline in oil   and gas demand   Tighter security at the border also is having a significant negative effect on District   economic activity  On the demand side, far fewer Mexican consumers are willing to bear the   increased hassle of getting across the border to shop in our stores  They also have less money to   spend owing to a decline in Mexican maquiladora output and US tourism in Mexico  Our directors   from border towns report a drop of 15 to 50 percent in retail sales in their areas  On the supply side,   Mexican commuters who work in the District face rush hour wait times of two to four hours to cross   the border, whether they come by car or by foot  Some have even taken to riding bikes so they don’t   have to stop to open the trunks of their vehicles   With all these drags on Eleventh District output, virtually every economic statistic is   signaling weakness September’s announced layoffs in the District jumped to three times the norm   for the year and October’s layoffs remain well above earlier levels as well  For the first time since   we began constructing the Texas leading economic indicator index, every one of its components   turned negative in September and overall the index showed the largest decline in its history     About the only good news is that auto demand and construction activity so far appear to   be holding up fairly well As reported in the Beige Book, some of the District’s industries most   impacted by the terrorist attacks did see activity bounce back a bit during October  But overall we’re   not expecting District employment levels to regain their previous highs until sometime in the middle   of 2002 The ripple effect has visibly spread out from air travel and mail service to hurt other   businesses such as hotels, recreation, aircraft production, travel services, and retail trade, and those   effects are leveraged even further through big declines in consumer confidence  Resources cannot     11/6/01 30   be allocated fast enough from areas of excess supply, such as the air transporters, to those of excess   demand--security for example--to prevent large dislocations  And the newly unemployed high-tech   workers are not likely candidates for airport security jobs  The adjustment is going to be very   sluggish   It comforts me somewhat that the stock market is back up to roughly where it was before   September 11 and that it has withstood a lot of bad news subsequent to the attacks  That I interpret   as the markets’ best opinion about our economy’s resilience and its ability to bounce back  Still,   there is a long list of discouraging current statistics industrial production, capacity utilization,   durable goods orders, retail sales, existing home sales, initial jobless claims, consumer confidence,   and more  Those statistics set the overall tone for today  The Greenbook increased its estimate of   the contraction in GDP in the fourth quarter and I suspect that last quarter’s numbers also are going   to be revised down Even so, we question whether the rebound is going to be as prompt or as strong   as is shown in the Greenbook   Given the unique nature of our situation, where an unseen enemy is working accurately to   undermine our confidence, I wonder if the forecast that we have for next year may be wishful   thinking as well Hunches and hopes are somewhat sick  The risks are clearly on the downside for   now and for the foreseeable future, and I’m not sure monetary policy can do much more than it is   already doing Market participants are insisting on further easing while suggesting that it won’t help   much We keep saying the bias is for further weakness, which is obviously true  The markets keep   taking that as a promise of more ease to come and we seem to be afraid to disappoint them  With a    2-1/2 percent fed funds rate and a 2 percent discount rate, this may be a good time to begin the   transition to a penalty discount rate, with a larger cut in the fed funds rate than in the discount rate     11/6/01 31   I’m told that the defenders of the Alamo at least used up all their powder  I suppose we   should too But the Alamo story had a rather discouraging ending  [Laughter]  However, it would   have played even less well in history had the Alamo’s defenders been found with dry powder    Mr Chairman, first I’d like to correct the record regarding Al and I   swapping hats The point of my remembering the Alamo was that even though the defenders lost the   battle it was not because they were keeping their powder dry  So basically, he came around to my   point of view! [Laughter] I agree with your recommendation    It appears that the economy in the Dallas District has finally joined the   national recession Growth has been slowing since the fall of 2000, but employment continued to rise   until this past September  The widespread layoffs in the travel and entertainment industry, combined   with reductions in high-tech employment and a slowing in the energy sector recently, have brought   about the first employment declines in the Eleventh District since 1986  Mexico’s recession and the   increased difficulty of crossing the border are making matters worse, as retail spending along the   border has declined significantly from a year ago       12/11/01 32    Two other sources of strength in the Texas economy in recent years have been construction   activity and export demand  Both have turned into sources of weakness recently and are expected to   remain so  Construction activity has been declining since early this year and reports of over-capacity   in some office and expensive home markets suggest that construction investment will continue to   slow When oil and gas prices are low, as they are now, expansion of petrochemical facilities usually   offsets some of the local slowdown  However, that is not happening this time around because of   extreme over-capacity in the chemicals business     Exports in a wide range of product categories and to all parts of the world have been   declining for more than a year and our contacts expect little change in these trends  Defense-related   spending seems to be one of the few areas of strength  Semiconductor demand may have reached a   bottom, but our contacts concur with the Greenbook analysis that it will be a long bottom and that the   demand from the telecommunications sector likely will not pick up until the second half of 2002 at the   earliest  This is a significant negative for the telecom corridor just north of Dallas   I concur with the broad outlines of the Greenbook forecast, though I’m a touch more   optimistic that GDP growth will resume in the first quarter  But I agree that on a fourth-quarter-over-  fourth-quarter basis growth in 2002 will probably be around 3 percent  I think it’s notable that the   Greenbook suggests that most of the weakness in current-quarter GDP will be accounted for by   inventory reductions and that final sales are holding up surprisingly well   On the inflation front, I concur with the respondents to the University of Michigan survey   who seem to have bought into our rhetoric a few years ago that we were only one recession away from   price stability We now seem to be getting the disinflation we wished for, but in my opinion we’re   still a long way from deflation     12/11/01 33    On the policy side, I see the economy stabilizing or at least not getting worse  If economic   conditions do deteriorate, I’m confident that we will get plenty of fiscal stimulus  In fact, it’s possible   that we’ll get plenty of fiscal stimulus whether the economy needs it or not  With about two-thirds of   our monetary policy stimulus still in the pipeline and lower energy prices likely to be with us for   months to come, it would appear that there is no shortage of policy stimulus at this stage of the game    And with the world economy continuing to show signs of weakness, I’m not particularly concerned   about a potential outbreak of inflation in 2002   Overall, I see the balance of risks we face as having shifted significantly and to such an   extent that I think we should pause in our policy easing  I believe the balance of risks is still tilted   toward weakness, but not so much that the easing in the pipeline shouldn’t be sufficient to deal with it    Perhaps the best Christmas present we could give the financial markets at this stage would be a   message in our statement that the Fed sees some signs of stabilization and is taking a wait-and-see   posture before acting again When I first came into my job and inherited Harvey Rosenblum as the   Bank’s Director of Research I asked him if he had any rules of thumb concerning monetary policy    He said, “Yes, when in doubt, don’t ease” And I think that’s about where we are now  In my view,   any additional benefit of further easing now is likely to be more than offset by the disadvantage down   the road of having to reverse that easing earlier than otherwise  Thank you    I can support your recommendation, although I’d like to associate myself   with the comments of Gary, Jerry, Jack, and Tom  I think this would have been a good time to pause   and no real harm would have come from it  It seems to me that it would be a good time to signal to   the markets that they can’t get a cut every time they build one into the fed funds futures  On the risk   statement, since we put it out we have to say that the risks are biased toward the downside because   they clearly are Nevertheless, I continue to feel that having such a risk statement at every meeting is   not serving us all that well because I think it’s almost always interpreted as one more easing move to   go So, eventually I think we ought to take another look at that practice  One additional way we   might signal that we’re winding down other than the language of the statement and the fact that the cut   is 25 rather than 50 basis points, is to consider not reducing the discount rate    Well, I’ve suggested it at the last two meetings as well     It seems to me that our long-run plan is to reverse the positioning of those   two rates and that we’re missing a good opportunity to get a head start on doing that    I would associate myself with Presidents Santomero, McDonough, and   others in wanting to complete the contingency work first and preferring GNMAs over foreign   debt I doubt that we’re ever going to need to do this, but maybe we could also buy time by   lowering reserve requirements at some point so that the amount of securities in the portfolio will   be reduced    I agree with your recommendation    What if there’s a dissent in this vote?  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, at the last meeting I reported on Texas billboards, and I   wish Jerry Jordan had alerted me that he was going to raise the issue of Texas bumper stickers   today One of my favorites is good advice for the FOMC  It says “Be alert Texas needs more   lerts” [Laughter]   SPEAKER(?)  I like that    We know that the future keeps changing, but so does the past  The BLS   has lopped 215,000 jobs off the estimate for Texas for the end of December, and that revision   converted what we thought was an employment gain of 1 percent into an employment reduction   of 1 percent If I’m not mistaken, it changed the Dallas area from being characterized as one of   the strongest metropolitan areas in the country in terms of employment growth to one with an   actual employment decline  We had thought that employment in Texas had turned down about   six months later than in the nation, but now it seems to have turned down at about the same time,   around April So we are in close correlation to the national economy in that regard   In the latest Beige Book, the report from the Dallas District was one of the most negative,   if not the most negative, of the twelve Districts  I asked for a report at last Thursday’s board   meeting on whether our contacts had seen signs of a pickup in the few weeks since the Beige        March 19, 2002 Page 50 of 117  Book reports were compiled  The reports were mixed  A few noted some signs of strength, but   most commented that they were seeing a continuation of sluggish conditions  The report from    the semiconductor industry was downbeat  The pickup in demand is not as robust as was thought   a month ago  And there’s an expectation that much of the new capacity in the 300 millimeter   wafer fabs will go offshore to Taiwan     It may be too soon to say that the Texas recession has ended, but the stronger-than­  expected performance of the US economy raises the prospect of a quick turnaround  After   declining for most of 2001, on a re-benchmarked basis Texas employment surged in January    Our leading indicators have been climbing for the last few months, and I’m becoming   increasingly confident that growth will begin this spring   One reason for concern has to do with the potential downside risks for the Mexican   economy  I’m hoping that the Greenbook analysis of the Mexican economy, which suggests that   the worst is over, is correct However, the strong peso is pricing the maquiladoras out of the   market, transforming them from a source of strength to a source of weakness  Maquiladora   employment fell an unprecedented 17 percent in 2001  And Mexico’s goal of getting its inflation   rate to converge with that of the United States will continue to support a strong peso, which may   not bode well for a vigorous turnaround in Mexican manufacturing as the US economy   continues to rebound Leading indicators for the Mexican economy do not point to an upturn any   time soon, and most forecasters anticipate growth in 2002 that is too weak to generate growth in   output per capita If the maquiladoras continue to be priced out of the labor market, a US   recovery may not translate into job gains along the border or increases in Mexican imports from   Texas, as we might otherwise expect     March 19, 2002 Page 51 of 117  I’d like to compliment Dave Stockton for his excellent presentation and Karen for her   earlier discussion of Argentina, which I thought was very good  Turning to the national   economy, is this a great country or what?  [Laughter]  I must say that I find the persistent   strength in the economic data to be very encouraging, and like everybody else, I’ve been revising   up my forecasts over the last few weeks  The growth in productivity increases my optimism that   any increase in inflation pressures will be delayed and subdued and that growth beyond the   recovery will be more vigorous than we might have expected before, looking perhaps more like   the later ’90s than the earlier ’90s  While we now have greater fiscal policy stimulus in the   pipeline than was the case at our January meeting, the bulk of that stimulus is not likely to be felt   for some time  Given the consistently improved economic data, the risks to the forecast seem    more evenly balanced than they have been in quite a while  The only thing that concerns me a   bit is the upward creep in oil prices in recent weeks; that could become a wild card going   forward    In view of the clock, I will agree with your recommendation without   further editorial comments    Mr Chairman, earlier you had a dialogue with Karen about what was   the best way to get across the street Since my prepared remarks are very brief this morning, let   me tell you a joke about that  I heard it as a blond joke, but in deference to Cathy I’m going to             May 7, 2002 47 of 81  change it to an Aggie joke Aggie number one saw his buddy across the street and he yelled   over, “How do you get across the street?”  Aggie number two said, “Why do you want to know?   You’re already across the street!”  [Laughter]    The Eleventh District economy is showing more signs of strength than   were apparent at the last meeting  In March growth was tepid and tentative; now business   conditions overall are a little stronger There are fewer signs of backtracking, and prospects for a   sustainable recovery seem to have improved The tone of our Beige Book respondents has   definitely improved, which gives me encouragement that the employment gains we’ve seen over   the last three months will not get revised away  As I mentioned last time, we thought   employment in our region was much better than it turned out to be; the preliminary reports were   wrong because of major reporting errors  We had declining employment for three quarters, but   in the latest quarter, employment has turned up   Having said all this, I must admit that there is no sector in our District economy that is   showing substantial strength Manufacturing has not completely turned the corner  Energy price   increases are deemed to be temporary, so they have not stimulated increased drilling activity    Mexico seems to be ready to resume positive growth  Outside of the telecom industry, the high-  tech sector has likely bottomed out  Most other sectors, notably construction and services, are   stable or growing All in all the movement is in the right direction, but there’s not a lot of   momentum   Turning to the national economy, I’m inclined to believe the Greenbook forecast, and I   hope it turns out to be correct I’ve been saying for a long time now that we can get the kind of         May 7, 2002 48 of 81  growth contained in the staff forecast with low and stable or even falling inflation  The staff   forecast is aligned with ours, and the risks to the forecast seem to be fairly evenly balanced in my   opinion Down the road we may have an ironic dilemma regarding our bias statement  If greater   inflationary pressure is the risk on the other end of the bias seesaw from the risk of economic   weakness, we could well come to the point of needing to tighten policy a bit before we reach the   stage where an inflationary bias statement is justified  While the recovery will likely be   sustained, it does appear to me to be more fragile at this time than it seemed at the last meeting    That pushes our likely bias dilemma into the future  In my opinion, we don’t have it today    Agree    Economic growth appears to be slow right now, whether we look at it   regionally, nationally, or internationally  The latest data from the Eleventh District point to   widespread weakness across the region and across industries  A modest recovery appears to be   under way, but it lacks the economic drivers—energy, high-tech, and trade—that usually provide   boosts to economic activity in our region  Sluggish growth and continued productivity gains   place the District in pretty much the same position as the United States, with a jobless recovery   similar to the one following the 1990-91 recession   After losing hourly wage and salary jobs nearly every month from April to December   2001, Texas seemed to turn the corner in January with a solid gain in employment  However, the   advances of early this year have slowly evaporated, and private employment levels for the   second quarter of 2002 have fallen back to those of the fourth quarter of 2001  The three-month   rate of job loss has been greatest in mining, manufacturing, transportation, communications, and   trade, all of which saw job losses accelerate in June  Some offsets came in government   employment and in services to consumers and businesses but not enough to stop the overall   decline     Whether we look along the border, in the oil patch, at the farm belt, at the high-tech   electronics-based economies of Austin and Dallas, or in the District’s largest economy, Houston,         August 13, 2002 33 of 92  we see few encouraging signs of strength Our leading indicators index for Texas has been flat   since January and continues to point toward sluggish growth ahead  There is little reason to   expect any of the key drivers of regional growth in the 1990s to return soon  We still have a   substantial overhang of regional high-tech capacity, and Mexico is yet to pull decisively out of   recession And travel reductions and war rumors plus the slow pace of industrial recovery have   kept oil and gas reserves relatively high  In sum, District economic activity is still weak and is   expected to remain so for some time  We likely won’t be helping to lead the national economy   into expansion We’ll probably be following this time, as we’ve become more reliant on the   nation for good news   Turning to the nation, I find it difficult to be sure that a solid recovery has taken hold   when so much of the growth we thought we had achieved vanished with the GDP revisions    Moreover, as in the Eleventh District economy, the drivers for growth in the national economy   appear to have weakened as well The recent recession was marked by two distinctive elements    a dramatic decline in investment with a hard hit high-tech sector yet consumers who kept on   spending Recent data suggest that investment has hit bottom and has begun to rebound  But   this rebound can’t continue apart from consumer uptake of the products firms are offering  In   the last expansion, my sense is that firms got a little ahead of consumers in terms of their vision   for the future Firms were able to offer tons of new and better products, from faster computers to   videophones, at a rate beyond what consumers could absorb  So they inevitably had to pull back,   and investors’ cash got burned With such a recent experience, I don’t expect investment to   return to anywhere near the levels of the late 1990s—nor should it  Consumer spending is not as   strong as it was in the mid-to-late 1990s, and it is not likely to return to that pace in view of a   more cautious consumer  Stock market declines, extremely volatile financial markets, recent         August 13, 2002 34 of 92  accounting scandals, and corporate ethics problems plus continued concerns over war and   terrorism have made consumers more reticent, and that is likely to continue for some time     I’d also feel better about the national economy if I saw a brighter international one  But I   don’t Across Europe the pace of recovery seems to have slowed in recent months  Argentina is   stuck in a crisis Brazil may be headed for a double-dip recession or worse  And the strength of   Mexico’s recovery is in question as is the condition of most Latin American economies  The   economies of Japan and Taiwan have stabilized but remain sluggish  About the only robust   economies internationally are those of China and Korea     Overall, coming back to my opening statement, growth appears to be slow now and for   the foreseeable future almost no matter where we look  The currently slow expansion needs   something new to drive it forward  And the risks have clearly shifted downward toward   economic weakness      I support both parts of your recommendation  Nevertheless, I do believe   that the bias statement is not serving us well and that we would be better off not having it  But   we do have it, so we have to tell the truth about it  And the balance of risks has clearly shifted   downward, so we have no choice but to acknowledge that    Mr Chairman, you and President Poole partially answered the question   I wanted to ask I was going to ask Dino what his answer would be if his second cousin from   Texas called him and asked why people in Japan were willing to go to the trouble to buy a bond   with zero interest I can see that there may be a patriotic reason to keep the funds in Japan or an   exchange rate risk reason not to invest in assets of other countries  But what about the   alternatives of keeping the money in a suitcase or a safe deposit box?    But why bonds rather than literally hold cash in Japan?        September 24, 2002 13 of 115   Karen, I was going to ask you why Canada has done so well in terms of   economic growth and if you thought that the relatively long term decline in the Canadian dollar   rate was a primary factor  I don’t believe you mentioned that in responding to Jerry earlier    Does this lead you to believe that we could use a little more currency   depreciation ourselves?    Thank you    Growth in the Eleventh District’s economy seems to have stalled since   the August FOMC meeting  A sense of drift comes through from our Beige Book contacts, our   recent board and advisory council meetings, and many of the latest available statistics  In terms   of employment, Texas showed signs of recovery in the first quarter but has been slipping since   then This would suggest a double-dip recession  But if we use broader measures of economic   activity, Texas has yet to emerge from the recession  Either way, the District economy seems to   be lagging the nation so far this year, in part because we have a larger concentration of industries   that declined during the recession  These include transportation, which is still suffering from the   effects of September 11; high-tech, which in our region is still suffering from the telecom bust;   energy, which is still feeling the effects of last year’s drop in oil and gas prices; and Mexico,   which is only beginning to overcome the impact of the US manufacturing recession  Mexico’s   special burden is that it is linked to the United States at the point of our worst performing sector,   the manufacturing area   Overall conditions in the high-tech industry remain bleak, and high-tech employment   continues to decline As one of our directors put it about ten days ago, the outlook is “softer   rather than firmer”  Activity is not expected to improve in the next six months, and industry   observers don’t expect a recovery in the telecom sector to come until after 2003  If there is an   island of strength, it’s the wireless industry     September 24, 2002 54 of 115  Going forward, downside risks seem to predominate over any upside potential  First,   overcapacity continues to discourage investment in new equipment  Relatively new equipment   available through bankruptcies is being sold at fire sale prices, undermining the sale of new   equipment  Second, purchasing managers remain cautious about investment, and budgets for   spending on new technology are constrained This phenomenon has given rise to longer   replacement cycles and purchases in smaller increments  Finally, venture capital funding to   Texas firms is down 73 percent from year-ago levels, although that may be one of Jerry’s   misleading statistics  If there is any light at the end of the high-tech tunnel, it’s coming from    small and medium-sized firms that can now afford to absorb some of the workers laid off by   larger companies—people they could not compete for during the boom in stock options and   salaries This confirms what our directors and members of our small business advisory council   have been saying about declining compensation in high-tech industries   Another area of concern in our District is commercial real estate  Office vacancy rates   are running around 25 percent in Austin, up from only 8 percent in the first quarter of last year    In Dallas, vacancy rates are running at 26 percent, up from 18 percent early last year  The   vacancy rate is 16 percent in Houston but is expected to rise to the mid-20s within a year  Rent   concessions on commercial properties have persisted for months, and our Beige Book contacts   don’t expect a turnaround any time soon  Residential markets had been holding up pretty well   until a couple of weeks ago Even the lower end of the housing market has begun to show a   softer tone despite low mortgage rates   The resumption of growth in the Mexican economy and preliminary signs of   strengthening in the maquiladora industry are providing some encouragement to the Texas-  Mexico border region The latest export statistics show a sizable rebound in Texas exports to     September 24, 2002 55 of 115  Mexico, Canada, Europe, and Asia However, the 15 percent decline in the Mexican peso since   the beginning of August does not bode well for the future  The general consensus seems to be   that the nation came out of recession at the end of 2001  It is difficult to come to the same    conclusion for the Eleventh District Looking ahead, our own internal forecast is for Texas   employment to decline slightly over the remainder of this year     On the national economy, I find developments to be a bit, but only a bit, more   encouraging than in the Dallas District  Signals of strength in autos and housing are routinely   offset by stumbling and sluggishness elsewhere  And the deteriorating condition of the   economies of most other countries gives me pause  Last month’s tepid employment growth, half   of which is accounted for by hiring by the Transportation Security Administration, underscores   the continued weakness in the labor market    As I read through the Greenbook I kept wanting to believe the staff forecast  I agree that   expansionary monetary and fiscal policy together with reasonably strong productivity gains   could offset the headwinds coming from the stock market, excess capacity, and the lack of   business confidence, all of which are leading to a deferral of hiring and investment  But I get   sweaty palms when I think about the downside risks  What if business investment doesn’t   continue to strengthen as expected?  What happens to productivity growth if investment   spending continues to decline and we get, for lack of a better term, “capital shallowing” instead   of “capital deepening”?  What if foreign growth continues to slow over the remainder of this year   and next year instead of improving as projected in the forecast?  What if deflation in durable   goods and disinflation in the rest of the economy continue to gather momentum?  Will we have   to deal with deflation and a zero bound at the same time?  And with overall inflation trending        September 24, 2002 56 of 115  down since we last lowered rates this past December, how much has the real federal funds rate   moved up recently?  Are we as accommodative as we think we are?    GDP deflation has moved from the low 2 percent area in the last two years to the low 1s   this year and over the forecast period  Seven or eight years ago we used to joke that we were   only one recession away from price stability  I think we’re just about there  In the Beige Book   reports we continue to find few signs of overall price or wage pressures  Normally I am not   comforted by rising commodity and gold prices, but the strength in these indicators gives me   some comfort now because they appear inconsistent with a deflation story     Perhaps the mildness of the recovery together with its movement in fits and starts is due   to the mildness of the recession  And maybe consumer and business confidence have been   driven down by event risks that are now behind us and both will recover soon  As I weigh the   downside risks against the upside potential, I’m moving toward support of a move to lower   interest rates The risks of setting off a new wave of inflationary pressures seem minimal right   now The main question to me is whether at current levels lower short-term interest rates would   do any good    Mr Chairman, I thought you gave an eloquent case for easing today,   and I really thought that’s what you were recommending right up until the end of your remarks    I agree with Governor Gramlich that the time has come to go ahead and ease  I also tend to   agree with Governor Ferguson in that I doubt that we’re going to learn anything very definitive   by waiting a little while  And I agree with President Broaddus that when we do ease we need to   do so by at least 50 basis points    I agree with Tom Hoenig    David, over the past year of presumed recovery, employment as   measured by the establishment survey is down slightly, I believe  There’s been negative   employment growth over that year  Yet the household survey has employment up about a   million, at least enough to hold the unemployment rate fairly constant  This seems like an   unusually large divergence in those two series  Have you looked into what is going on?    I want to update a little story that I told you a meeting or two ago; I’ve   been wondering since Jerry Jordan spoke if this had any relevance to his comments  I had   mentioned that several maquiladoras along the Tex-Mex border on the Mexican side had left to   go to China to take advantage of lower wages there than in Mexico  Our staff has identified at    least eight that made that move who have since returned because they didn’t find the quality of   labor in China up to standards In one of those instances, the Chinese government kept the   equipment and machinery, took it apart to see how it worked, and couldn’t get it back together    [Laughter] That might curb the outflow in the future   In the Eleventh District economy there’s not much pumpkin [Laughter] At our meeting   in late September I reported that growth in the Eleventh District had stalled over the previous   two months  As indicated in the latest Beige Book and by recent economic data, the Texas   economy has shown signs of contracting over the last six weeks  Our regional economy had   exhibited tentative signs of improvement earlier in the year, but the information from the second   and third quarters suggests that we’re still in recession  Employment has declined for five   consecutive months, and the unemployment rate has been stuck at 61 percent for the last three   months The economic mood expressed at our board of directors meetings over the last two   months has been somber at best  Beige Book contacts indicate that all sectors of our economy   are moving backward with the exception of agriculture  More disturbing is the fact that our   contacts were virtually uniform in their description of current conditions and the outlook for the   remainder of the year  Usually we get a mixed picture, with some companies and industries   moving forward while others are regressing, but not this time     The Eleventh District has been weaker than the nation partly because of our   concentration in high-tech manufacturing industries and in energy, both of which have continued         November 6, 2002 51 of 122  to contract in recent months  Construction is more of a mixed picture  And like the rest of the   country, residential activity is holding up pretty well but commercial vacancy rates are rising   sharply   Turning to the nation, since our September meeting the national economy has also   weakened somewhat  Again, using the Beige Book as the source, three Districts reported firmer   economic conditions  Most of the remaining Districts characterized economic activity as   remaining soft or as having deteriorated  My own view of the national economy is captured in   New York’s summary “The economy shows further signs of slowing while prices of goods and   services were reported to be flat to down slightly”  The statistics reinforce this picture of an   economy on the ropes  Declines in retail sales and in capital goods orders and shipments stand   out But declines in industrial production and in the leading economic indicators, along with a   deep plunge in consumer confidence, are also worrisome  Last week’s job report—the   establishment survey is the one that we should be looking at—suggests that we’ve had negative   job growth so far during this past year of what presumably is a recovery   My economists tell me that in forecasting inflation a naive forecast does about as well on   average as more-sophisticated techniques  That being the case, I’ll assume that inflation over the   next six months will be close to what it has been over the last six months  And there seem to be   no recent developments in the economy that would suggest that inflation is likely to accelerate    If anything, a slowing economy together with the way that productivity has been holding up   suggests slightly lower inflationary pressures in the months ahead   At our last meeting I suggested that we needed to ease by 50 basis points  The evidence   that has become available since then reinforces that feeling  Some people, including some at our            November 6, 2002 52 of 122  Bank, are more concerned than I am that a negative demand shock could cause the disinflation   trends we’ve had lately to morph into deflation     The FOMC has avoided inflation targets being thrust upon it by political mandate  In   essence the Congress has given us the discretion to set our own inflation targets largely because   they’ve trusted us to do the right thing  If we were to allow a situation to develop in which the   US economy experienced deflation, the Congress would be likely to impose inflation targets on   us and they likely would be somewhat different from those we might impose on ourselves  We   can debate what we believe to be the current rate of inflation, but I think we would all agree that   we’re at or near the lower end of the range that we would set if we did have inflation targets    Our job right now seems to be to make sure that we don’t go below that floor     In summary, I think we should ease significantly, primarily to stimulate economic growth   and employment growth  The low and falling inflation rate, with some possibility of deflation,   makes the risk of that easing very small    I agree enthusiastically with your recommendation of 50 basis points  I   think the way the bias is usually interpreted the more honest thing to do is to keep the bias in a   downward direction But I agree with Governor Bies that, if we could make it clear that we’re   looking some distance out in the future, then it would be okay to go to a balanced risk statement                           November 6, 2002 96 of 122  And I do want to make it balanced because of the considerations that Bill McDonough   mentioned    Mr Chairman, I’m going to miss Jerry Jordan’s anecdotes and vignettes,   but I might note that in this case I think he’s behind the curve  We’ve already done the research   and found that forklifts are indeed a leading indicator, but backhoes are a lagging indicator    [Laughter]    The economy in the Eleventh District remains weak  It’s hard to tell   whether we’re treading water or continuing to sink  Our Beige Book contacts, though, have   become more optimistic about the outlook for next year than they had been  As in the rest of the   country, manufacturing continues to be the hardest hit sector in Texas, losing almost 100,000   jobs since the beginning of this year  It seems as if the worst may be over, but announcements         December 10, 2002 46 of 87  suggest that layoffs will continue into next year, particularly in the high-tech area  One notable   exception has been the growth in defense-related manufacturing activity That growth involves   some companies not usually thought of as defense-related  For example, Dell Computer just got   an order for 60,000 computers for the US Marine Corps   Our Beige Book contacts mentioned three factors that drove their medium-term outlook   from strongly pessimistic in early October to cautiously optimistic in early November getting   past the elections, a settlement of the West Coast dock strike, and our ½ point cut in the fed   funds rate Those developments have changed the mood out there  Most contacts now believe   the economy will strengthen  War concerns are more muted as well, as evidenced by the   removal of most if not all of the Iraq premium in oil prices     At recent meetings I’ve mentioned that employment growth in Texas is weak relative to   national trends One reason is our mix of industries, especially our greater concentration in high-  tech manufacturing  We recently took a look at the performance of some of the industries that   usually benefit from lower interest rates, and we found that many industries that have been the   most interest sensitive in the past actually have been losing jobs over the last year  Other factors   are outweighing the stimulative effect of lower interest rates  The apparel industry has been in a   secular decline, and lower rates are not likely to reverse that trend The air transportation and   hotel industries are still feeling the impact of September 11  And while lower interest rates have   stimulated the demand for housing, particularly at lower price points, an excess supply of   apartments, office space, and high-end homes has damped construction activity in spite of lower   interest rates Apparently, construction activity in Texas has not been damped enough because   one real estate analyst recently said that a moat should be built around several metropolitan                     December 10, 2002 47 of 87  markets in Texas to keep out developers for the several years it’s going to take to work off    excess inventory!   My anecdotes are not as interesting as Jerry Jordan’s, but I might mention that Fujitsu   Network Communications, which normally makes telecommunications gear, has begun to do   contract manufacturing  The company is based in Richardson, Texas, in the heart of the telecom   corridor, and it recently announced a contract to build automated teller machines  Work on that   contract begins this month  The company finally realized that the demand for telecom   equipment was going nowhere   As I look at the national economy, I’m encouraged by the generally brighter tone of the   data we’ve received over the last several weeks  The one exception is the employment numbers,   which still point to a basically jobless recovery  The last time we had a similar jobless   recovery—in the early 1990s—we had considerable disinflation  We don’t have that much room   for more disinflation this time around, but we do have some room left  I want to compliment   Dave Stockton and other Greenbook and Bluebook authors for including an analysis of deflation   scenarios in trying to assess the likelihood that the Committee might have to deal with such   matters  Also I’d like to compliment Governor Bernanke for his excellent speech a few weeks   ago dealing with deflation   I believe the Committee’s aggressive move at the last meeting was the needed preemptive   strike  Given the more-encouraging news recently and the stronger forecast for 2003 and 2004   contained in the Greenbook, with which I happen to agree, I think our policy stance remains the   right one We’ve done about as much good as we’re going to do  It’s now time to pause and   wait to see the impact of our last move  Given how low rates are and how little room there is to   go, it would be good to get some help from the fiscal side         December 10, 2002 48 of 87  [Secretary’s note  Chairman Greenspan was called to his office, and the Vice Chair ran   the meeting for a brief period]    I support your recommendation, applaud your brevity, and can say from   personal experience that you’ll get no credit for it  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Not much new and significant is going on in   the Eleventh District economy  Personal income is growing but not fast enough to raise living   standards  Employment finally is growing again but at rates so anemic that it feels like   contraction  Other indicators have crossed the threshold into expansion but not by much  I   would like to be able to conclude that the data signify the end of the downturn in our region and   might even be the start of a recovery, but I’m not convinced  Last Friday and Saturday I met   with the fine people from the Louisiana Bankers Association, and just before that I met with our   board of directors and our Advisory Council on Small Business and Agriculture  The views   expressed in the latter two groups were considerably more negative than the last time they met    The mood of both meetings can be summarized by the opening remarks of one of my directors,   to wit “With recoveries like this, who needs recessions!”     Single-family housing has been holding up, particularly at the lower and moderate price   points  One director felt that mortgage rates could rise by a percentage point or so, maybe even   2 points, from the current very low levels without having a strongly negative effect on housing   March 18, 2003 54 of 101    demand  In her words, “Mortgage rates provide the nicotine to the housing industry, but job   growth is the real source of nutrition”  Her point was that without some improvement in job   growth, the effect of lower interest rates likely will wear off     On the high-tech side, our director from a major semiconductor manufacturer indicated   that the order-to-shipment ratio in the chip industry had finally risen above 1 for the first time in   two years  Recovery has now hit every sector of the industry except wired telecom; but of all the   markets they serve, the United States is the weakest  Those in the industry are waiting on the   sidelines until they can get a better handle on market demand  In the meantime, prices are under   extreme downward pressure  She’s looking for single-digit growth in the next year or two  With   no increase in capital spending and therefore no pickup in supply, she hopes that some increased   pricing power will be restored in late 2004   We had several reports from directors who were quite knowledgeable about the energy   business  There was some discussion about how much of a war premium is built into current oil   prices  The uncertainty on the premium involves questions in at least two areas  First, is there   really surplus capacity in the Middle East?  It has never been tested  Second, how much   infrastructure damage will be done in Iraq?  One director noted that oil infrastructure is fairly   hard to destroy  The big question raised by a couple of directors was Venezuela, a country that   was characterized as being on the brink of disintegrating into civil war or anarchy  Venezuelan   oil has a big impact on US gasoline prices  The government has fired half the oil company’s   middle management and replaced them with cronies and military people reported to be not too   competent when it comes to the basic logistics of moving oil to market  Significant gasoline   shortages already exist within Venezuela, and it’s likely that oil production is running at less than   half the claimed rate  Both the country and its oil production could be on the verge of total   March 18, 2003 55 of 101    breakdown  Around Houston the talk is beginning to be about a return to $30 a barrel for oil   after Iraq is settled rather than the $24 price that had been anticipated a couple of months ago     Concerns were also expressed about natural gas  If prices were to remain in the area of   $6 it would suggest that we have a shortage bordering on scarcity  If businesses come to believe   that gas prices will remain at those elevated levels, they will shut their plants and sell the gas   they’ve contracted for  Our petrochemical plants are aging facilities that were built on the basis   of $50 gas not $5 plus gas  These plants could shut down, and their output could go overseas     The tone of our small business council was similarly downbeat  I got the distinct   impression that many of these business people and their peers are just barely hanging in there   Also, there seems to be a lot of disguised unemployment and underemployment  Two of the   small business representatives on our council indicated that current conditions are the worst they   have ever seen, and both of them have been in business in the Dallas area for over thirty years    When we pressed them on whether things were really worse than during the Texas depression in   the late 1980s they both without hesitation said “yes”  They lived through those tough times, yet   they feel that today’s fundamentals are worse  I hope this view is a function of hazy memory    I’ve seen that before when the economy is going through the destruction phase of creative   destruction and when it’s too soon to discern the creative part   Turning to the national economy, I must say that, given the economic and non-economic   uncertainties we face, the staff baseline forecast seems plausible in its broad contours  I   especially appreciated the choice of alternative simulations  I count myself to be among those   who believe that the disinflation forces of the last decade will continue to prevail over the forces   acting to push up the rate of inflation  As a result, I found myself drawn toward the Greenbook   simulations involving a lower funds rate or the adoption of a market-based funds rate  While   March 18, 2003 56 of 101    being drawn in that direction, I’m not ready to support a reduction in the fed funds rate at this   meeting  Given all the fog and the dust out there and the sand being stirred up by the threat of   war, the public and the markets would have difficulty interpreting any change in our policy   stance at this time  While I believe that the downside risks prevail, this is probably not a good   time to try to do anything about it     Some of our contacts indicated that their production is closer to   13 million than to the stated 29 million      The actual number may be a little less than half that stated level     So do I     Let me begin by summarizing my broad view  The Eleventh District is   showing some signs of stabilizing with modest job growth recently, which is better than the   continued job losses at the national level  The real economy continues to soften at the national   level, but consumer sentiment has improved  Spreads have narrowed, profits have turned up, oil   prices have declined, and the stock market has rebounded  Looking only at the real economy,   further easing seems warranted, but the timing might be bad now with the financial markets   signaling that a rebound may be coming soon without additional stimulus  Moreover, the   markets are not expecting further easing today, so the reaction to a surprise could well be   perverse  Market participants might believe that the Fed knows something that they don’t   Turning back to the Eleventh District, the economy appears to have bottomed out and is   showing early and, I hope, sustainable signs of expanding at a sluggish pace  Texas has   experienced positive employment growth over the last two quarters, which is better than the   nation’s loss of jobs, as I indicated earlier  Job growth was at a 07 percent annual rate  Over the   last two quarters, job gains have been concentrated in construction, financial services, education   and health services and in the government sector  Despite very high energy prices over most of   that period, the energy sector has been shedding jobs at a rapid clip  Though Texas has had   positive job growth, our unemployment rate has risen sharply and is nearly a percentage point   above the national rate   May 6, 2003 41 of 115    A few bright spots are beginning to emerge, though  Our high-tech industry may finally   be showing signs of life  Job losses there have slowed as profitability and orders are showing   signs of improvement  On the positive side, drilling for natural gas has continued to register   gains now that the energy industry is more confident that strong natural gas prices are not going   to go away soon  On the bad news side, the demand for gas is outstripping the ability to bring on   new production, and gas prices now are expected to remain well above historical norms for   several years  Oil prices are expected to fall further, but energy prices overall will not fall   proportionately because natural gas and oil prices are expected to be decoupled over the next few   years  Another bright spot comes from the temporary employment industry in our area, which   has experienced a job surge at an annual rate just under 12 percent in the first quarter, in contrast   to what Michael just reported for the bigger picture  Finally, our Beige Book contacts report that   retail, auto, and restaurant sales have begun to revive after being depressed during the war with   Iraq     On the negative side, the downsizing of airline operations is continuing, and further   employment reductions are expected  The wage reductions of roughly 25 percent that airline   employees are experiencing are adding to deflationary pressures in the high-tech sector as is the   District     Turning to the national economy, I’m inclined to agree that the staff forecast for the   second half of the year is the most likely outcome  It has been six months since we’ve lowered   rates but the real fed funds rate is where it was before the last rate cut  Monetary policy is less   stimulative, and the economy is probably less sensitive to any Fed stimulus than it was a year   ago  Although federal government stimulus is expected to increase in the near future, the   political process may provide less stimulus than we’ve been anticipating  Further delayed clarity   May 6, 2003 42 of 115    on exactly what will be contained in the fiscal package means that any spending that is sensitive   to the tax code will likely continue to be deferred  In short, we may be getting a lot less stimulus   from both monetary and fiscal policy than we think  In addition, the state and local fiscal   situation only reinforces this conclusion     As I look at the other downside risks to the economy, I’m increasingly concerned about   the economy underperforming the Greenbook forecast  The outlook for economic growth in the   rest of the world has been continually revised down for months on end  Also, while business   balance sheets have undergone considerable repair, there’s a way to go before balance sheets are   in line with the economic realities of the last couple of years  That applies to the broad swath of   businesses, not just to the industries such as airlines and telecom that are undergoing enormous   structural adjustments    So overall I see the risks to the forecast as lying primarily on the downside  Given how   low inflation has fallen and the possibility of a shortfall from current economic forecasts, I could   support an easing in monetary policy at this meeting  But as I said earlier, financial markets are   signaling better times ahead, and an easing today could unsettle the markets  So I think waiting   is in order  I feel the risks are weighted to the downside, but I’d rather not say that by   reintroducing the bias statement at today’s meeting     Mr Chairman, I think the decision on policy today is a close call  I   could have easily supported an easing today  But as I said in my earlier remarks, I think the   fairly dramatic improvement in the financial sector offers us enough promise that it’s worthwhile   to wait and see for just a bit longer  As for the bias statement, I’ve been a long-time skeptic of   the benefits of having a bias statement  In that regard, I think Roger has been very generous in   accepting sole paternity!  But since he agrees it’s not the prettiest baby he’s ever seen, it seems to   me that we’re missing a very good opportunity, as you put it, to bury the whole concept and   forget it  I would take advantage of that opportunity, but failing that I think eliminating the   “taken together” sentence would be an improvement at this point     We do have some recovery in the Eleventh District, but it is   underwhelming  The high-tech, communications, and transportation sectors and the Mexican   economy are all drags on the local District, while the defense and energy sectors provide a mild   boost  There are some signs of growth in interest-sensitive sectors such as construction  Overall,   the recovery remains slow and mostly jobless  Private employment is up just a 01 percent over   the first half of the year  The sectors that helped remake the Texas economy from oil to high-  tech in the 1990s—namely, semiconductors, telecom, computers and computer-related   equipment—have turned on us, and now Texas has lost proportionately more of those jobs than   have other parts of the nation  Since its peak, the semiconductor industry has shed 32 percent of   its workforce in the Eleventh District  In the computer industry and the communications sector,   job losses have been 34 percent and 43 percent, respectively   Air transportation in the District has experienced a second sharp decline recently, with   employment in that sector falling nearly as much last quarter as in the fourth quarter of 2001    Surprisingly, though, the air transportation sector in our region has not suffered as big a decline   as in other parts of the nation  While American and Continental have made major staffing cuts,   Southwest Airlines has not had to lay off any workers  The District isn’t getting any help from   exports either  Monthly Texas exports have been drifting down over the past year, dipping   further recently  Export-related job losses are greatest in manufacturing, of course, which cut   August 12, 2003 46 of 110    6,000 jobs in June  To top it all off, the sugar industry has even moved out of Sugarland, Texas,   where it has operated for decades     There are some mildly positive signs, however  A few of our high-tech manufacturers   such as Texas Instruments and defense manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin have announced   expansion plans, sizable new contracts, or boosts in new orders  Job gains have picked up for the   past several months in construction, health and education services, and even a bit in the hotel   industry  The drilling part of the oil business is still fairly strong, and that’s mainly for natural   gas  The share of temporary workers has been increasing since early 2002 even though the   demand for temporary workers from large companies remains slow, as many undergo   restructuring and consolidation  The Texas unemployment rate dipped in June, and maquiladora   employment is slowly coming back, though it faces an increasing challenge from China  The big   concern just across the border is low wage competition from China  Overall, the Texas index of   coincident economic indicators picked up in June, increasing at an annualized rate of 12 percent     Turning to the nation, we’re in the midst of the slowest expansion in post-World War II   history, as measured by employment  In the previous nine expansions, it took an average of   eleven months for employment to regain its pre-recession peak; the high was twenty-three   months in the so-called jobless expansion that began in 1991  At twenty months into our current   expansion, jobs are still down 26 million from the level in February 2001  So we’re certain to   set a new high for the number of months it takes to get all the jobs back    If we look at the consumption and income data, it’s hard to see that a recession and slow   recovery ever took place  Another way of saying that is that, if we look at the behavior of   productivity, we’ve had the second strongest recession–expansion phase in the post–World War   II period  Average productivity growth in the twenty-eight months from peak to present has   August 12, 2003 47 of 110    been stronger than in nine out of the ten business cycles in postwar history   The GDP growth   process hinges on three factors  innovation, investment, and reorganization  Technological   progress appears to be doing a very good job in the innovation part of this process, raising   productivity enough to keep GDP growing despite the job cuts  The snafu seems to be in the   economy’s ability to muster up the investment funds and the confidence needed to invest and   reorganize  On that score there are reasons for cautious optimism  The second-quarter GDP   release shows that, for the first time in a long time, spending on nondefense capital goods is   adding some lift to the economy  Overall, I believe the situation looks a little more positive   nationally  Consumer spending has continued to hold up, tax cuts have come on line, and now   investment spending appears to be showing some signs of a turnaround  It’s getting easier to   believe that a solid recovery is beginning to take hold       I support both parts of your recommendation     Look at where it got us!     Mr Chairman, I’ve always been confused by Bayesian things because it   seems as if people still try to figure out the probability of something happening after it has   already happened, which I have some trouble with!  [Laughter]  Since many of you probably   would like to see the Dallas Cowboys get beaten up tonight, I’ll be very brief  I’m with Cathy   and Jamie, who basically said that they didn’t think we had a major problem and certainly not   one worth throwing out the baby with the bath water  In my view, misunderstandings—  especially big ones—about what we are trying to communicate are rare  Frankly, this recent one   is the first that I can recall  The market may learn from it just as we may learn from it, and the   market may come to the conclusion that ten pinks do not a red make  So this problem may not   surface again anytime soon   As you know from my position over the last couple of years, if we are going to make   changes in our communication practices, I would be in favor of letting the policy decisions speak   for themselves  Market participants and other observers understand the context and the   circumstances we’re in when we make those decisions  So I don’t think a lot of explanation as to   why we took a particular action is necessary  We should keep things as simple as possible and   have as few moving parts as possible  Ideally, I would like not to have to vote on a bias  Then   September 15, 2003 64 of 78    we would not have to report on it, and it would be one less thing we can get wrong  If that’s a   movement away from transparency, I think it can be offset by moving up the release of the   minutes to an earlier date       The economy in the Eleventh District is beginning to show more-  widespread signs of improvement  Employment data for June and July were on the weak side,   but the anecdotal reports from our Beige Book contacts and from last week’s meetings of our   board of directors and our Advisory Council on Small Business and Agriculture are becoming   more optimistic  Manufacturing, of course, remains the exception   September 16, 2003 67 of 106    The housing sector has strengthened as buyers have rushed to buy before mortgage rates   move higher  On the commercial side, leasing activity has improved, and vacancy rates have   stabilized instead of rising further  Even two of our weakest sectors, airlines and trucking, have   strengthened somewhat  The demand for computers and semiconductors has continued to   improve  Our director from a large specialty semiconductor manufacturer gave the most positive   report she has given in several years  Semiconductor prices have stabilized, and capacity   utilization is running at 86 percent  With inventories very low, she’s hoping that capacity   utilization will reach 90 percent soon, which is where pricing power can be regained  She’s   anticipating output growth of between 15 and 25 percent in 2004, depending on the type of chip    With no new capacity coming on stream before 2005, she’s optimistic about the improved   outlook  Her company recently announced plans for a new chip manufacturing plant in Dallas in   2006  Meanwhile, even though things are looking up, she reported that for her firm the United   States is still the weakest market in the world     Another anecdote is that the volume of diesel fuel being sold in Texas has risen about   6 percent over the last month, a sign that more goods are being moved to market  Each of the   members of our small business council provided a long and detailed analysis about how his or   her business was showing definite signs of turning up in the last several months, depending on   the industry  That was the good news  They were concerned, however, that the positive   direction might last for only six months or so  They all feared that larger companies would   remain cautious about capital spending and hiring and that a continued recovery was far from   certain  Their worries echoed the concerns I heard at a couple of CEO breakfasts that I’ve hosted   since our last meeting  From those meetings it was clear that CEO hesitancy regarding new   investment or hiring hasn’t abated very much, and a lot of those who did have expansion plans   September 16, 2003 68 of 106    mentioned that they were plans for expansion abroad  One of our newer El Paso directors, who   was at our board meeting last week, runs a maquiladora plant in Juarez  She lives in El Paso and   is very active in maquiladora and Mexican industry associations, and she has been worried about   the movement of jobs from Mexico to China  She announced last week that her firm was   moving operations to China as well!   On the national economy, I must say that my outlook is similar in broad outline to that   suggested in the Greenbook  At the June meeting I was a little skeptical about the strength of the   resurgence that was being forecast, but the data available since then seem to substantiate it  The   forecasted growth should begin to generate employment growth despite continued cautiousness   among CEOs  I’m optimistic that the productivity growth we have going and the substantial   slack we have in capacity utilization and in labor markets will give us the rapid growth with   diminished inflation over the next couple of years that is forecast in the Greenbook—I hope with   better progress toward reducing unemployment     I’m okay with your recommendation     If one thinks of the Japanese authorities as speculators, it’s generally   assumed that if speculation is stabilizing it’s profitable  If it’s not profitable, it’s destabilizing    Do we know anything about how much money the Japanese have earned or lost on these   interventions?     The minutes could say, “Following lunch, a vigorous discussion ensued   with respect to communications”  [Laughter]     Bill was talking about life in the trucking industry  There’s a fine song   that describes that  It says, “Peter built a truck for a man to drive  It’s a pretty good livin’ but it   ain’t no life”  [Laughter]    It appears that the tide has turned somewhat in the Eleventh District  The tentative   recovery, which was characterized by a few false starts, now seems to be a full-fledged   expansion  In the third quarter, employment growth turned in its best performance in three years,   October 28, 2003 41 of 126    and job growth was broad-based with most industries stable or growing  Our help-wanted index   also was up strongly in September, signaling a return to a hiring mode among some employers    Texas personal income growth, after lagging the nation for two years, surpassed the national rate   of income growth during the first and second quarters of this year  The housing boom continues,   with record sales; exports are growing again; the energy sector is benefiting from higher prices;   and job losses in manufacturing are slowing down  The weakness of the Mexican peso and the   pickup in US industrial production are boosting the maquiladora outlook, and observers on the   border say that help-wanted banners are hanging outside of maquiladora plants for the first time   in three years  However, I must say that I attended a maquiladora convention in Mexico a couple   of weeks ago, and the people in those companies are obsessed with China  As one fellow put it   to me, he’s mad at the United States for letting China get so far ahead!     Orders for goods to rebuild Iraq are coming in fairly strongly  A large fraction of our   near-term production of plywood and oil field equipment is reportedly going toward satisfying   the government’s efforts to rebuild Iraq  To sum up, we haven’t been this optimistic about the   Eleventh District outlook in a long time  I must qualify that just a little though  I’ve had several   breakfasts with CEOs in an effort to get their views, and they still are very hesitant to sound all   that optimistic They have some issues on their minds that temper their optimism  They worry a   lot about the costs of health care and pension plans, and they couldn’t emphasize enough that a   lot of the expansion that will be coming along will occur in other countries rather than in the   United States  That’s something they’re talking about doing themselves; it’s not that somebody   else is doing it   Turning to the national economy, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that the tide has   turned as well  I concur with the broad outlines of the Greenbook forecast  Growth has   October 28, 2003 42 of 126    accelerated and likely will remain robust into 2005  The international outlook has improved   considerably  I’m optimistic that inflationary pressures will remain subdued over the next year    Everybody mentions the remaining slack in the economy  I always want to add that the very   rapid productivity growth that has accompanied that slack is a reason to be optimistic on   inflation  I’m a little less confident about inflation as we get into 2005, however  As recently as   last May and June many of us were publicly expressing our concerns about the potential for   deflation  In that environment it made sense for us to commit to maintaining a very low fed   funds rate for a “considerable period”  As the tide shifts, the need for a clearly articulated exit   strategy from that commitment is becoming increasingly important  Our immediate concern is to   convey that at some point we will merely be taking our foot off the accelerator without that being   interpreted as an indication that we’re moving the foot over to the brake pedal  These dilemmas   reinforce my belief that in our press releases less is more  Thank you     So do I     I agree with Cathy that the statement should be shorter and simpler—  very much so  As I’ve long argued, I don’t think we did ourselves a favor when we started   announcing a bias vote  I would recommend not having a bias vote  If we don’t have it, then   we’re not being nontransparent by not releasing it  If it’s fairly obvious which way policy ought   to be going at a meeting, I think we ought to just go there rather than do nothing and promise,   through a bias vote, that we will likely do it next time  Whenever we act, people on the outside   know pretty much the same information we do; they don’t really need that much of an   explanation of why we voted the way we did  So I think we leave ourselves much more   flexibility if our announcements have fewer moving parts, and we have fewer ways to make a   mistake if we just leave out the bias  If doing that requires releasing the minutes earlier, fine    That’s all right with me  But I don’t think we even have to do that  I’d just say that we’ve found   recently that the lengthy press releases and announcements of various biases have not served us   very well and we preferred to go back to the old system   December 9, 2003 114 of 133      I think that’s a red herring  I don’t think anybody in the room would   argue that, if we choose one of these options, we will have short meetings  There’s no argument   about that     With both political parties in California proposing to borrow money to   get out of debt [laughter] and with UPS adding legs rather than wings to its planes, everything in   Texas is relatively good!  Our District economy has been showing signs of consistent but gradual   improvement with each successive snapshot throughout the year, and we’re now looking at a   pretty strong outlook for the region, mirroring that of the nation  We had been lagging behind   the nation   We believe that conditions are in place for strong employment growth in 2004    Corporate profits are much improved, as is business sentiment The airline shakeout appears to   be behind us  Texas cattle producers are back in the saddle again, with the price of beef rising   20 percent over the last few months—thanks in large part to the Atkins diet  The local defense   industry, notably Lockheed Martin and Bell Helicopter, is flush with new contracts  Productivity   and exports in the Texas high-tech sector are stronger than we had expected, which bodes well   for income produced in these industries  Aided by the continued boom in single-family housing,   construction employment remains strong  Also, there are increasing signs that the office sector   has bottomed  The medical services industry continues to expand at a rapid pace, with   employment growing at a 6 percent annual rate in October     The negatives for the District are manufacturing and Mexico, but the latter may be more   yesterday’s story than tomorrow’s  In the last few years, 500 Mexican maquiladora plants have   December 9, 2003 45 of 133    closed, with 177 of them moving their operations to China  Mexico—I think this applies to   officials in Mexico—has finally recognized that its comparative advantage no longer lies in low-  wage jobs but in moving up the food chain to a higher productivity product mix  However, I was   at a maquiladora convention in Guadalajara lately, and a lot of the owners of maquiladoras   seemed to be in denial about that  They’re just looking for the old ways to come back  Mexico   is still in the doldrums but should show improvement as the recovery in our manufacturing sector   takes hold  Although the District’s manufacturing sector continued to shed jobs in October,   signs of strength in orders are becoming more widespread, and exports have been growing as the   world economy continues to improve  Overall, the District outlook is for economic growth to   pick up steam in 2004 with employment to follow suit   Last Friday I met with a group of CEOs from San Antonio and South Texas, and for the   most part they concurred with this view  One of the interesting items to note from this meeting   is the increasingly bifurcated nature of the household sector  Two major auto dealers were in the   group, and both lamented that an increasing proportion of car buyers is having difficulty getting   credit  One of the dealers, who is a member of our San Antonio board, mentioned that one of his   dealerships had forty-four prospective deals the previous weekend but only four qualified for   credit  Both dealers expect that this situation will continue to put a crimp in car sales  I might   just say that many customers who come into the dealerships to trade are already under water with   the car they have to trade in  When they successfully trade, they walk out the door even more   under water  These dealer contacts also indicated that buyers of high-end cars are having no   trouble financing and that a lot of those buyers pay without any financing  This underscores   some of the information that Bill Poole has been reporting from his Wal-Mart contact about   December 9, 2003 46 of 133    liquidity-constrained households—or maybe they’re income-constrained households—barely   making it from paycheck to paycheck   Turning to the national economy, so much for the Greenbook staff being overly   optimistic about growth!  [Laughter]  It seems clear that virtually all of the economic data we’ve   seen since the last FOMC meeting both here and abroad has been positive to strongly positive    After the investment bust and the slowdown associated with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a   robust expansion is clearly under way  We now know that job growth has been under way for   four consecutive months, even on the establishment survey basis, with improving prospects for   continuing declines in the unemployment rate    The two issues that this Committee needs to address are (1) when and if this improved   economic outlook might translate into higher inflationary pressures, and (2) when monetary   policy will need to shift into a less easy posture  A third issue involves how to manage that   policy shift without unduly disrupting financial markets and thereby the recovery        As I look at the balance of risks going forward, it seems to me that the risks on both   growth and inflation have become much more evenly balanced or are approaching balance  As I   reviewed the alternative simulations in the Greenbook, the scenario I considered the most likely   was the one that assumed faster structural productivity growth  That scenario would get us to an   inflation rate of about ½ percent at the end of 2005, which would put us rather close to the zone   that Vincent has characterized as being on the edge of price stability and potential deflation  The   staff suggests that we’d also get faster GDP growth and possibly a higher unemployment rate   than in the baseline forecast, although I’m not so sure about that   In the late ’90s capital deepening was occurring as a means to deal with labor shortages    Over the last few years the next phase of the high-tech revolution kicked in with an   December 9, 2003 47 of 133    organizational revolution  Outsourcing, networking, and globalization are taking the benefits of   comparative advantage and specialization to a new level or dimension  This increased   specialization is one reason that productivity gains are spreading outside the manufacturing   sector  The greater ability to outsource some service-sector jobs to foreign workers is enabling   many companies to reduce costs and to increase the flexibility of their production process  To   the extent that globalization in IT has made many previously nontradable goods and services   imminently tradable, we should expect to see some significant changes in the relative inflation   rates of goods and services  I don’t think it is unreasonable to expect that services inflation could   end up a lot closer to goods inflation as a result of these developments  That is just one more   reason that I’m reluctantly thinking about raising interest rates at this time     Rapid GDP growth is not our enemy, though I am willing to concede that rapid growth   sustained primarily by substantially negative real interest rates may prove to be a problem  But   that problem is not imminent given the degree of productivity growth and slack in the economy   and our ability to capitalize on the slack in the economies of other countries  I believe that the   outlook for growth in real GDP is either balanced or biased toward more growth, and I think the   outlook for inflation is now balanced  With regard to the “considerable period” of   accommodative policy that we’ve mentioned in our press statement, I think we have to honor   that promise when it comes to policy changes in the next little while  But I believe it’s time to   withdraw that phrase, even though the initial market reaction will likely be negative  The clock   doesn’t even start until that phrase has been removed from our statement  That phrase has   become a liability to our credibility  Thank you     I support your recommendation  I would have preferred to eliminate the   “considerable period” phrase, get it over with, and start the New Year out with a clean slate; but I   support your recommendation     Recent data and reports from our board of directors and others confirm   that the economy in the Eleventh District is growing but somewhat more slowly than the national   economy  Home prices have softened a little in all of our major metropolitan areas  Apartment   rents have fallen, and landlords are offering a month or two of free rent as an incentive  One   member of our Small Business Advisory Council mentioned last Thursday that, if landlord   concessions keep growing at their current rate, tenants will be able to get one year’s free rent for   signing a one-year lease  [Laughter]  The office market, particularly in Dallas and to a lesser   extent in Austin, is equally overbuilt  Dallas has a six- to ten-year excess supply of office space,   and new projects are still being announced  Moreover, new money is flowing in to buy existing   properties The reason given is low interest rates  The reason is not just the low financing costs,   though, but the fact that few other good investment alternatives are available  When rates rise, as   they inevitably will, a wave of foreclosures and bankruptcies will likely follow     The agricultural members of our advisory council mentioned that one factor that has   sustained their industry through soaring energy and fertilizer costs is low rates of interest, thanks   to the Fed  Here, again, when rates begin to rise, a lot of marginal producers are going to have   some problems  The high-tech sector, particularly around Austin, seems to be in the early stages   of improving  Venture capital is beginning to flow, and IPOs have resumed  Unlike the   situation a few years ago, any company wanting to expand can cheaply acquire office space,   workers, and equipment  Another turnaround affecting the Eleventh District is the Mexican   economy, which is looking better than it has for a while  Mexico’s industrial production has   March 16, 2004 28 of 107    risen in response to improvements in the US economy, and employment and hours worked in   the maquila industry ended the year on a high note  After declining for three years, Texas   exports to Mexico climbed in the second half of 2003   For the past year or so, I’ve been reporting a virtual absence of pricing pressures in our   District  I regret to say that this is beginning to change, though I should add that it may be too   early to conclude that the overall inflation situation has reversed  Our January Beige Book   reported skyrocketing prices for primary and fabricated materials as well as shortages of steel   and scrap  There were downward price pressures as well, including for apparel,   telecommunications, and autos  Retail prices were declining, but at a slower rate than   previously  The February Beige Book reported a continuation of all the upward price pressures   seen in January and more  There were further pressures on energy and metals prices, but some   manufacturers were reporting upward price pressures as well—and with great enthusiasm    Several noted that for the first time in years they have been able to raise prices and increase   profits; hence the excitement  One of our contacts noted that in the last two months a basic shift   had taken place in the construction industry from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market—a shift   that, in his words “is unprecedented in its scope and staggering in its impact”  At both our board   meeting and our Small Business Advisory Council meeting, a good deal of discussion was   devoted to the spreading effects of higher steel and other building materials prices on the   industry  We are hearing the term “double ordering” for the first time in many years   As I look at the national economy, it looks as if the expansion continues to gain traction,   but I remain concerned that the employment situation has been so resistant to improvement  At   least the gains in productivity are restraining inflation; and weak job growth has restrained wage   growth, which makes me less worried about incipient inflationary pressures stemming from   March 16, 2004 29 of 107    sharply rising commodity prices  Nonetheless, I think we’ve crossed a tipping point in the   economy, where the prospects for increasing inflation far exceed the prospects for declining   inflation  I don’t think the situation calls for a shift in our policy stance just yet, but the situation   does bear careful watching     I agree with your recommendation for no change in policy  I would   prefer balanced risks on inflation  I think most of the weakness we’ve seen recently has been on   the real side rather than the inflation side  It’s just too much of a Phillips curve type of analysis   for me to view the two as a tradeoff in that way  I would even suggest changing the word   “patience” this time  I agree with Tony that there are a lot of words we can use, and I fear that if   we start using that one time after time, we'll get in the same bind we did with the “considerable   period” phrase So, I would be happier if you had found a word that was equally as strong as   “patience”; I think it would be helpful just to change that word so we don't get locked in  Back   when I played tennis, if you were about to receive a serve, you didn’t stand flatfooted  You   would keep moving your feet so you’d be able to go either way  And I think the word “patience”   leaves us flatfooted     Mr Chairman, at breakfast this morning, I was challenged to try to   describe the current economy in a haiku  By coincidence, that’s the way the briefing for this   May 4, 2004 28 of 112       meeting started out in Dallas a few days ago  And the haiku is, “The story today is about returning   growth and rising prices”  And I do think that fits pretty much both the District economy and the   national economy  Since Texas unemployment turned the corner last September, job growth has   been moderate and steady  There has been a notable improvement along the border, helped along   by recovery in Mexican maquiladoras, and border employment rates are back down to pre-recession   levels  Retail sales growth for the border area has fully recovered as well   High energy prices may be a negative to the country as a whole, but they remain a plus for   Texas—a smaller plus than they once were, to be sure, but a plus nevertheless  As the Chairman   discussed in a recent speech, natural gas prices have been elevated and are expected to remain so for   an extended period  In response, we’ve seen a gradual expansion of drilling activity in the District   over the past two years  The petrochemical industry, which has seen hard times for quite a while   because of high energy input prices and weak demand, is getting some relief now; that industry is   benefiting from strong demand from China and southern Asia, leaving the District in a pretty strong   position for a change   The high-tech sector has been a notable laggard but, after over three years of uninterrupted   month-to-month job losses, in March we saw a return of net employment gains in high-tech   manufacturing  The brighter jobs picture reflects rising orders and production  Contacts in the   semiconductor industry expect top-line sales to grow 19 percent this year, bringing sales back to   pre-recession levels  Gains are spread across consumer sectors, communications, and computer   sales  Equipment manufacturers are experiencing sales growth, too, and see signs that the corporate   upgrade cycle is shifting into higher gear   On the inflation front, cost pressures are now evident across the board, and more and more   producers are passing on higher costs to their consumers  Competition from overseas has slackened   May 4, 2004 29 of 112       because of the lower dollar and rising demand in China  Building materials, fabricated metals,   petrochemicals, and oil field equipment have all seen price increases at the consumer end    Increased orders for packaging from retailers have driven paper prices higher  Steel and galvanized   metal are in short supply, and railroads are operating at or near capacity  There’s a major road   project in Dallas that was a year ahead of schedule, but it has been held up now for several months   because of the inability to get a certain kind of steel  Among the handful of industries that have not   enjoyed increased pricing power are airlines and homebuilders  In the labor market, we still have a   large pool of unskilled workers seeking employment, and there’s very little upward pressure on   wages  However, rapid health care cost increases have discouraged firms from hiring new   permanent full-time employees   On the national economy, the latest CPI, PCE, and GDP statistics suggest that the price   pressures that Eleventh District contacts had been reporting earlier this year have become fairly   widespread  I’m hopeful that the uptick in inflation is a one-time adjustment that marks the end of   disinflation rather than the beginning of any significant upward threat  Nevertheless, I think we   need to be wary because the recent inflation rise cannot easily be dismissed as being due to special   factors  Core and median inflation measures are higher, too  And we need to be wary because   estimates of capacity utilization and the output gap are subject to large after-the-fact revisions  The   same is true of our measures of profit margins  While recent data suggest a strong inverse   relationship between profit margins and inflation pressures, the markup of prices over unit labor   costs has little or no predictive power for inflation in real time   And finally, we need to be wary because of the very large amount of policy   accommodation currently in place  Significantly, the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion   Survey shows a big swing toward easier C&I lending standards and terms over the past two   May 4, 2004 30 of 112       quarters  The net percentage of banks reporting increased C&I loan demand is strongly   positive and rising, too  The balance of risks has clearly shifted, and in my view it’s time we   cleared the decks by removing language from our press release that might delay action should   action become appropriate     I also would prefer just to drop “patience” without substituting anything   else, but I’ll concede that the argument is over  Just so Al can go out as the lonesome dove, though,   [laughter] I would like to point out that I don’t think any of us—well, maybe one or two of us—  really believes that the risks to our goal of price stability have moved into balance  To me, our   comments indicate that we really believe there’s a risk of rising inflation; and I think we feel that the   risk of unwanted disinflation or deflation is behind us  So, while we may not want to move that risk   assessment two whole notches in one meeting, if we were totally honest about it, I think we would     I understand the practical problem of going two steps, but I think we ought   to at least recognize that  “Like a fish” I think is the term we used in high school     The economy of the Eleventh District continues to improve, although the   pause that was apparent at the national level in June was also evident there  We also saw some   deceleration of price pressures that had built up  We still expect the Texas economy to expand over   the course of the year, and our regional economists are forecasting job growth of around 18 percent,   August 10, 2004 54 of 103          which is slightly below normal and much below normal for a recovery period  We’ve seen steady   employment growth in Texas since last December  However, the employment gains have been   unevenly distributed, and job growth did slow over the second quarter  Since the upturn began,   education and health services have seen the biggest employment gains  Our manufacturing sector   continues to shed jobs, and there has been no job growth in construction  Construction employment   fell in June, which was the wettest month on record in Texas    As we’ve discussed this morning, the persistence of high energy costs is an increasing   concern for many industries  And along the lines that Jack mentioned, in the trucking industry we,   too, have seen a few signs that higher energy prices are being passed on  Not so with airlines,   however  They are being squeezed by higher fuel costs offsetting the boost they’ve been getting   from solid summer traffic  American Airlines recently tried to recoup some of its higher fuel costs   with a modest fare increase but had to quickly withdraw it  The protracted bankruptcies of some   airlines appear to be delaying a much-needed restructuring of the industry  High energy prices have   not prompted any increase in drilling activity in Texas, primarily because of limited in-state   prospects  Texas, I think, may have been sucked dry by now  Nor has there been any increase in   international drilling, as most of the oil prospects at present seem to be concentrated in politically   unstable regions—and also probably because of Karen’s awful downward-sloping futures!    [Laughter]    Finally, the Mexican economy continues to show signs of strong growth  Exports to the   United States have risen as the recovery here gained momentum, but domestic consumption also has   been growing, helped by strong remittances from the United States   On the national economy, I was also surprised by last Friday’s employment report, and it   makes me wonder about the duration of the soft patch  I do take some comfort from the huge gains   August 10, 2004 55 of 103          of the household survey number—even if it is positive noise—from accelerating activity in the   economies of many of our trading partners, and from a continuation of the recent strength in   business spending on capital equipment  That said, what is going on in energy markets merits close   attention  All the attention that has been given to the recent volatility of spot prices may have   distracted us from the more worrisome long-term developments in the futures markets, with   disturbing implications for the possible duration of higher energy prices     Higher oil prices have already pushed headline inflation numbers to uncomfortable levels   and are having a detrimental effect on consumer spending  The recent string of disappointing   employment reports notwithstanding, monetary policy remains very accommodative  Inflation risks   remain skewed toward the upside in my opinion, and a modest increase in the funds rate today   seems warranted     I agree with your proposal, including no diddling with the language     The economy in the Eleventh District continues to expand at a modest,   or maybe even a measured, pace  At our Board of Directors meeting a little over a week ago,   one of our directors summarized it best by saying that the economy is going nicely—not great,   but nicely  Her theme was echoed by many other directors and by members of the Advisory   Council on Small Business and Agriculture  I also met with a number of CEOs for breakfast that   same week, and what was most interesting to me was that none of them had much to say about   the economy  It was neither so strong nor so weak that it deserved much in the way of comment    What they were almost obsessed about, though, were the rising costs of health care to their   businesses, with little hope for improvement, and related issues of tort reform   Even though most of my contacts are telling me that the economy is doing okay, I sense a   certain reluctance on the part of business people to make long-term economic commitments—a   point others have mentioned already this morning  One of our Houston directors, who is in the   petrochemicals business, has been raising prices for months  His company has been running   close to full capacity in several product lines  He raised the question of whether he should be   investing in new plants, given that his current plants are running full out  For a variety of   reasons, his answer was “absolutely not”  One of our agricultural advisory council members   made a similar point regarding cattle ranches when he said, “Just like in chemicals, no one wants   to build new plants”  It’s my view that these remarks reflect an underlying caution—call it lack   of business confidence, if you will—that may act as a brake on economic growth going forward    In the case of large publicly traded companies, we can blame some of this caution on Sarbanes–  Oxley  But this reduced appetite for risk-taking and long-term investment has spilled over to   smaller, more entrepreneurial, privately held businesses as well   September 21, 2004 41 of 100          Having said all this, I should point out that the Texas economy has continued to improve   throughout 2004  Job growth has picked up steadily, and the gains are fairly widespread across   most industries  After three years of massive declines in high-tech employment, reasonably   steady gains have taken place thus far in 2004  One of our advisory council members from   Austin’s high-tech sector noted that Austin is finally off the bottom  It is a “feeling better”   economy but not yet a “feeling good” economy   The national economy seems to reflect the same pattern of slow, modest growth and   decelerating inflation that has emerged in the Dallas District in recent months  I have no reason   to differ in any significant way from the staff’s GDP outlook  I think we’d all be pleased to have   the baseline scenario unfold  Average real GDP growth of just under 4 percent in the fourth and   fifth years of expansion is pretty good   If the staff’s inflation outlook for 2005 and 2006 is correct, or even just in the right   ballpark, the US economy will remain in the zone of price stability in the near future  As I look   at the staff’s inflation projections under the alternative simulations, I can’t help but notice that all   of the inflation projections are for core PCE to come in under 2 percent, with many of the   projections centered closer to 1 percent  It was not that long ago that this Committee was   agonizing over the threat of deflation when our inflation measures were pointing to core inflation   around 1 percent  I’m not recommending that we agonize again, but the similarities are striking    As I looked at the table on page 2 of the Greenbook supplement, I was struck by the three-  month change in the annualized rate of various measures of inflation for the period ending in   August  CPI inflation is running at 13 percent, core CPI at 1 percent, PCE inflation at 09   percent, core PCE at 07 percent, finished goods PPI inflation at minus 11 percent, and core PPI   September 21, 2004 42 of 100          for finished goods at 05 percent Were this pattern to continue, the Committee would be facing   an inflation pattern not very dissimilar from the one we were looking at in the spring of 2003    For many months now, the Committee has been saying that its policy stance is   accommodative  I won’t dispute that conclusion; I’ve been saying it myself  If we’re measuring   the degree of how accommodative we are by the real federal funds rate, then it’s critical to get   the right measure of anticipated inflation into the equation  If the staff’s inflation projections are   correct, then policy is much less accommodative than it would be if we assume inflation   expectations are well anchored in the 2½ to 3 percent range as in the University of Michigan   survey  If the last few months of inflation data reflect a return to the inflation patterns and trends   of the last few years, there may be less policy accommodation to be removed than the Committee   has been assuming, and there may soon be room for a pause in the measured pace of policy   changes  I think our current policy of measured withdrawal of policy accommodation is correct   for now  But with inflation low again and falling again, I have to remind myself why I think so    The reason seems to have changed from “to contain inflation” to “because the economy is strong   enough to tolerate it”  In other words made famous recently, we may be doing it because we   can  After today, we may want to reassess that     I support it
