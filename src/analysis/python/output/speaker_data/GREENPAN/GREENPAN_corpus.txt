  That’s the best way to look at it in terms of Al   Broaddus’ suggestion  Let’s take just two examples of RPs on the asset side RPs limited   to private RP securities or RPs involving only government securities  What we’d really   be doing, if we leave fiscal policy alone, is shifting the assets from one government   sector to the other  In other words, we would be swapping our RPs with the Social   Security Administration or the US Treasury--it doesn’t matter which one--and in doing   that effectively we would end up with US Treasuries on the asset side of our balance   sheet and they would end up with the private securities     I second that     Maybe I’ll ask somebody the question  I won’t have to ask   you, though I may have gotten a clearer answer out of you than I will from them!  [Laughter]   I find this correlation between the 10-year Treasury yield and duration in the mortgage-  backed securities market bizarre  It’s not a correlation that one normally sees; it’s one we see only   when one of the variables departs from the other I look at these weekly jiggles or daily jiggles that   are occurring and I wonder what this correlation would look like if you went back to before September   4--the first observation on your chart    And presumably that’s suboptimal from a market point of   view, but the question basically is whether the effect is big enough to make a difference    I think we all know what’s happening here  Let me see if I can   rephrase my question in defense of my position that the constraint undercuts part of the point of this   exercise You have a set of fixed coefficients here  In any econometric model there is a rigidity that   probably does not exist in the real world, and there are second-order and third-order coefficients that   tend to stabilize instead of producing distinct, exact effects; they smooth everything out  And that I   presume is what you’re doing       I think the issue is not about our feelings or our tastes; this is a   question of fact If you have a perfect foresight model that is wholly deterministic, then any action   you take should exactly replicate what is going to happen in the real world  That’s the presumption    But if you are putting additional constraints into the model, of necessity you must be overriding the   deterministic nature of the model because the model solves in the sense that you have as many   unknowns as you have basic inputs  Consequently, you’re over-determining the model on the basis of   judgments that essentially say that you don’t want an optimum conclusion or, which is more likely and   is obviously a fact of life, that the model itself is not a true replication of reality in all respects       Exactly So I conclude, merely as a fallback explanation—   having examined à la Sherlock Holmes all of the alternatives and found them wanting—that   therefore the missing alternative must be the true one  But that is the type of reasoning that the   logic courses will tell you is very, very fragile  President Jordan      President Pianalto
