 I would just point out that I used the term "reserve target" pretty loosely in my letter What I really had in mind is total reserve targeting--alternative 6 in Dave's memo--not nonborrowed reserve targeting, which I think is under 4 and 5 We're not saying that we think the case for using total reserve targeting as a [policy] instrument has been made yet We're simply saying we think there's a strong case for additional research on it   Well, I don't disagree with that It seems to me that there is enough room for long-term improvement in the way we do things to at least do a substantial research project on this I don't think we really know how a total reserves operating procedure would work We would have to study that in the context of the overall strategy and situation We'd have to ask questions like what would we tie that instrument to in the way of the longer-term goal and whether we should still have intermediate targets But it seems to me there's enough out there that we need to understand to justify a fairly focused research effort within the System And I think we have the resources in the System as a whole to do that   Could I just--   There is some evidence that that might not be the case We may well wind up there, Dave But there are at least some models that suggest that long-run price stability simply may not be consistent with the procedure we're using now   I'm happy to say, Mr Chairman, that the latest information on conditions in our District is quite favorable and actually more optimistic than some of the information underlying our report for the Beigebook It seems clear that economic activity in our region is advancing at a faster pace than we had thought to be the case earlier There are a number of indications of this One indicator that we are looking at now with respect to the District's overall performance is the states' withholding tax collections They have been running ahead of projections in several different states now through the month of October We don't have full data for November, but in Virginia at least that's continuing through November Sector- by-sector we're getting very strong reports on Christmas sales in every District state There also are signs of greater strength in housing and manufacturing And perhaps of more than passing interest, we are beginning to hear at least a few slightly good things about commercial real estate markets in our area Specifically, we're told that markets for both retail space and office space are beginning to stabilize We have some evidence that office vacancy rates have actually declined in a few areas in our District and rents appear to be bottoming out, all of which strikes us as hopeful and broadly consistent with the Greenbook projection of some improvement in nonresidential investment in the quarters ahead  As far as the national economy is concerned, we think the Greenbook forecast is certainly plausible While the growth of GDP shown in the projections for '93 and '94 is pretty subdued and the unemployment rate remains quite high at the end of the projection    12/22/92  period, there is a further decline in inflation So, all in all, the Greenbook projection strikes us as a reasonably favorable near-term outcome if we can get it We could definitely do a lot better, but we could also do a lot worse We think there are risks on both sides of the projection We think the biggest downside risk is the possibility that both the Japanese and European economies could turn out to be weaker than projected But there also are upside risks as we see it, both externally and on the domestic side As Ted Truman mentioned, fiscal stimulus is already in the process of being put in place in Japan There is certainly a possibility that the Bank of Japan will ease monetary policy further in the near term There is a widespread expectation that if conditions in Germany remain weak, we also will see some easing by the Bundesbank at some point So, it seems to us that there is at least a possibility that the external picture may be somewhat brighter than the Greenbook projections as we move into the second half of next year and the first part of 1994  On the domestic side, we in Richmond sense a much more solid and more permanent increase in aggregate demand and in both household and business confidence now than in the other several episodes of accelerated growth so far in this recovery Netting it all out, we think the overall risk in the outlook has shifted rather decidedly toward the up side in the last several weeks, and we think it would be appropriate for the Committee to take account of this in reaching its policy decision this morning   We favor "B," and we have a strong preference for a symmetric directive, Mr Chairman We think it would be a mistake not to move to symmetry now because that might send a message to those who look at these things that we're not going to be vigilant going forward if we run into unexpected strength in the economy So, we would strongly support symmetric language   I would recommend that we make some brief announcement about the change because inevitably there are going to be questions Of course, we can answer them when we get them, but if we write the answer out to begin with, it might be clearer I also had a question Will the subcommittee continue to exist? Will some of the issues we discussed at the last meeting, such as the release date and    3/23/93  the possibility of doing something like the Memorandum of Discussion, still be on the table?   Joan, how sensitive is the market? You said the market is skittish; how vulnerable is it to a reversal of this recent rally? In other words, if we get another strong employment report, let's say, and maybe another month of unfavorable inflation data, do you think the market is going to react strongly to that or is there enough in the deficit reduction program to prevent that?   Well, economic conditions in our District have continued to improve in recent weeks, continuing the trend we had seen earlier in the year Most of our contacts are at least reasonably optimistic about the outlook for their respective local economies and industries going forward despite the potential contractionary impact of at least some of the elements of the Clinton economic package The most recent information we have comes from our various board meetings; both our Charlotte and Baltimore boards met last week The comments at both of those meetings were generally upbeat, especially those of the Baltimore directors That was encouraging because that area has been the part of the District that has experienced the weakest recovery to date The Richmond board met about 10 days ago, at the end of the previous week The comments at that meeting were less optimistic than either those of the branch directors or their own comments at their previous meeting In particular they seemed to sense some reduction in both business and consumer confidence over the last several weeks But generally they're still reasonably optimistic, and I think the picture in our District is quite strong  With regard to the national economy, the Greenbook projection is certainly reasonable It is close to other projections we've seen and close to many of our projections But my instinct, and my staff shares this view, is that the risk of error in these forecasts is still generally on the up side and that we'll get at least somewhat greater growth in real GDP if not in the current quarter at least over the balance of the year Recent increases in unfilled factory orders and lengthening delivery times are one reason for thinking this I believe we may have a greater rate of inventory accumulation and perhaps [more] growth in employment than the staff is projecting But from my standpoint the main reason for this view is the broad-based and rising confidence about both the near-term and the longer-term outlook for the national economy on the part of a vast majority of our business contacts People are concerned about the tax increases in the Clinton program They are critical of them, to put it gently But they don't seem to think that the program is going to derail the recovery or even slow it appreciably going forward This optimism pretty clearly is related to the good performance we've had with respect to long-term interest rates recently, which has enabled many of these businesses to significantly improve their balance sheets, finance some new projects at lower rates, and reduce debt service--not to mention what lower mortgage rates have done to the household sector  With this in mind we certainly think that one of the Committee's principal objectives in the near-term future if not the principal objective ought to be to do all we can to foster a continuation of these favorable longer-term interest rate tendencies Because of the recent upturn in inflation statistics, the upward revisions in inflation projections in the Greenbook bother me I  -17-    3/23/93  recognize that the signs are still pretty [limited] and that the revisions are still pretty slight at this point But both the reports and the revisions suggest to me that the risk of an uptick in inflation at some point in the projection period is now somewhat higher than it was earlier I don't think that's inconsistent with your comments, Mike And I simply hope that the Committee will be ready to take whatever actions are necessary earlier rather than later if we need to take such actions to arrest these developments   Mr Chairman, I certainly accept your proposal Let me just say, though, that I think the next several months are going to be a really critical period for monetary policy as you suggested in your comments It seems to me that what's happening is that we are now moving from a somewhat tentative recovery into a period of mature expansion; certainly the chances are that that is happening And this has been the period in the business cycle in the past when inflation pressures often and quietly have begun to build, even though there was some slack in the economy As Jerry and others have suggested, I think the markets are going to be watching us very closely in this period to see whether we act to resist those pressures, if in fact they do arise More specifically, they're going to be watching to see how we react to the increased risks of inflation even before we see undeniable evidence of it And in that context  -42-    3/23/93  Governor Angell's comments about the way we ran monetary policy back in 1984 and again in the 1987-88 period were right on the money I don't want to overdramatize, but I don't think it's an exaggeration to suggest that the credibility we have fought so hard to establish--and I think we've done so successfully--over the last 10 years could well be on the line in the next several months But again, as I said, I could certainly go with "B" and symmetric language I agree with Bob Forrestal and you and others who expressed the need for some caution But, frankly, if we get another month or two of crummy inflation data, I think we need to think about a change or at least a tilt toward tightening in the directive language   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll be brief and just give a quick background Members of the Committee will remember that about two years ago at the July 1991 meeting it seemed pretty clear that the economy was beginning to recover And I think most members of the Committee recognized that somewhere down the road the Committee was going to be faced with the prospect of rising inflation pressures and the possible need to change the direction of policy toward restraint In the environment as I remember it, Governor Angell asked a very reasonable and straightforward question, and that was If and when that time arrived, would such a move be facilitated by a change in our operating procedures away from the current procedure of conducting policy by controlling the funds rate very    5/18/93  tightly? Would we change perhaps in the direction of a more automatic adjustment of the funds rate in response to emerging inflation developments or other economic developments or perhaps along the lines of the nonborrowed reserve procedure we used between late 1979 and late 1982? In any case, we got a group of System economists together and we produced two volumes as your answer, Governor Angell It's a lengthy response but I think an interesting one   I think I may have to take an exam on it at some point! Actually, a shorter answer was delivered at the next meeting of the Committee in August of 1991 when Don Kohn summarized a memorandum that Dave Lindsey had prepared That memo reviewed several alternative procedures that might assist in the next change in the direction of policy Just very quickly One set of those alternatives would have deliberately caused somewhat greater movement in the funds rate in the short run in an effort perhaps to camouflage or disguise when an increase in the rate might be taken; this might soften or at least stretch out the market and public reaction to the move The second set of alternatives would have involved tying the funds rate, or perhaps a borrowed reserve instrument, in some way to deviations of M2 from its target The memo also noted that in an automatic procedure we might want to substitute total reserves or perhaps the monetary base for the funds rate as the operating instrument In any case, at that August 1991 meeting the Committee discussed all of these alternatives And, of course, the memorandum pointed out that there were disadvantages as well as advantages according to the tradeoffs involved The Committee I think also recognized that the current unpredictable behavior of M2 might cause some difficulties with some of these alternative procedures that would not have existed so much in the past  In any case, all of this was brought out and in this situation the Committee mandated a more broadly scoped study, similar to studies that had been done along these lines in the past We had one in the early 1980s and another in the early 1970s This broader project was carried out in the second half of 1991 and the first half of last year It culminated in a very interesting two-day conference at the St Louis Fed in which 16 papers on this topic, along with formal discussions, were presented Economists from the Board staff and all of the Reserve Banks participated in this conference We also invited two prominent outside monetary economists, Ben McCallum from Carnegie Mellon and John Taylor from Stanford, to participate in the conference--actually to comment on particular papers and in both cases to give an overview Both wrote papers giving their overview comments on the research and its implications All the papers prepared for the conference, including the discussion papers and the Taylor and McCallum papers reviewing the overall conference, are included in this two-volume study You should have received these volumes last week as well as a summary of those proceedings, which I hope you will have an opportunity to read if you haven't done so already  As the summary indicates, the study did not attempt to arrive at specific recommendations as to alternative procedures that the Committee should adopt I think we recognized rather quickly when we got into this that it would be unrealistic to try to do that in this    5/18/93  study What we tried to do was to lay a solid analytical foundation on which such a discussion and decisions could be based Frankly, we concluded that we have produced a very solid foundation for that kind of consideration if the Committee wants to take that next step; I think we've covered the subject comprehensively Many of the papers used state of the art research techniques in reaching their conclusions In any case, the summary document that you should have describes several of the more formal papers in some detail and it presents five broad conclusions I'm not going to go through those in any detail but let me just paraphrase them  First, we studied the operating procedures in a number of other major industrial countries We found that most of them employ procedures that are similar to those that this Committee uses but we also found that some differences of detail exist And if we take the next step, we might want to consider whether there are any significant advantages to adopting some of these procedures For example, I have in mind something like the Lombard facility that the Bundesbank has available  Second, in view of the current problems with the monetary aggregates as indicators of policy, in this study we looked at a large number of alternative indicators of the thrust of policy and future economic developments to see whether we might improve the execution of policy by, in some more systematic way, taking account of some of these variables in conducting policy I have in mind here variables like bond rates, yield curves, commodity prices, and a number of others Not surprisingly, no single indicator jumps out and says "I'm the one on which you should focus all of your attention" But we did learn that certain indicators do seem to do a better job over particular time horizons than others So, we did a bit of filtering that I think is useful there  The third and perhaps the most important conclusion we reached is that a case can be made that the Committee's current procedure of adjusting the funds rate in response to a variety of indicators can be used successfully over time to achieve the principal objectives of monetary policy I think a lot of people, like Dave Lindsey, suspected that before the study was done But the study provides very important and very solid analytical confirmation in support of that conclusion However, and I can't emphasize this enough, the effectiveness of our current policy regime depends critically on the maintenance of the credibility of the System's longer-term policy objectives  Fourth, some model simulations that were done for the study indicated that a feedback mechanism to guide policy might be of some assistance in improving our results without creating a lot of undue short-term instability Several papers in particular looked at feedback mechanisms where either a funds rate instrument or a monetary base instrument would be [varied] in some systematic way in response to deviations of nominal income from a target--for example, the Humphrey-Hawkins projections that we put forth twice a year--that might be set  Fifth and finally, research done for the project indicated that greater transitory deviations in the funds rate permit targeting that would characterize some of these alternative procedures but not    5/18/93  necessarily be transmitted to greater variability in longer-term interest rates So, that possibility should not prevent us from looking at some of these alternative procedures if we wished to In any case, Mr Chairman, those are the principal conclusions Again, I think this study positions the Committee to take the next step, and it would be a fairly straightforward step of looking at particular changes we might make Let me take this opportunity to thank everybody who was involved in the project but express particularly my appreciation to Marvin Goodfriend and to Dave Small of the Board's staff who did a tremendous amount of work in editing these papers   I'd be happy to try to answer any questions anybody has and I'm sure Marvin and Dave could help me with some of the more technical ones   Thank you very much, Mr Chairman, for the opportunity to summarize the study   The first-quarter data were quite disappointing and we have gotten mixed reports for the month of April so far in our District But, in some contrast to Tom Hoenig's report, I haven't really noticed any major change in attitudes about the economic outlook either among our directors or most of our other business contacts By and large, I think they still expect continued moderate growth both regionally and nationally through the forecast horizon  I personally subscribe to that view I was a little surprised by the size of the downward revision to the real GDP forecast in the Greenbook this time I'm inclined to put a little less weight on current fiscal developments in assessing economic prospects than the Greenbook It seems to me that the loss of the $12 billion stimulus in the President's package is not a really big deal in a $6 trillion economy And while uncertainty about fiscal policy certainly puts a drag on the economy, it seems to me that this effect is very difficult to quantify I don't have a sense that the uncertainty about fiscal policy is exerting any greater drag now than it was at the time of the March FOMC meeting So, all in all, I still think that growth of real GDP in 1993 will be somewhere around 3 percent, as forecast in the March Greenbook, rather than the 22 percent that is currently projected in this month's Greenbook And I believe I'm right in saying that most private forecasters are still somewhere around that number, although they may have revised their forecasts down a bit in some cases  For me, clearly the most relevant and most disturbing recent development is the uptick in the reported inflation rate The core CPI rate, as I calculate it, now has risen at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate over the first months of the year and that really bothers me I recognize, as everyone else does, that temporary factors may account for part of this; nonetheless, at a minimum the data strongly suggest    5/18/93  that inflation is no longer coming down So we're no longer clearly making progress toward our longer-term goal of restoring price stability and we may have regressed a bit And as Dave Lindsey and others have pointed out, I think it's fair to say that inflation expectations have probably been revised upward at least a little since the beginning of the year That's an interesting point because it implies that real short-term interest rates are lower than they were So, in a sense we've had a de facto easing of policy as a result of this development in recent months, and I would hope that we would take some account of that in our policy discussion later in the meeting   I had a question but it was answered earlier Thank you   Mr Chairman, I'd like to support action today As far as I'm concerned, the issue is credibility I think Governors Mullins and Angell made that point very eloquently In matters of credibility there is no substitute for action, so I think a good move today would be to raise the funds rate 1/4 point Yes, there are risks, but it's possible to exaggerate those risks The funds rate now in real terms is negative I think it's easy to overstate the risk to the economy of a small increase [in the funds rate] The other point I would make is that if we wait until we're absolutely certain and convinced that the inflation trend is upward-- we've been down that road before--we may well have waited too long That would reduce our credibility and it might be quite costly to regain it So, I would favor action today   Thank you, Mr Chairman Regarding our District, there really hasn't been much change in our region either, like many other regions in the reports so far Growth seems to be continuing at a relatively moderate pace overall We are experiencing the same strengthening in housing activity that, at least from the Beigebook reports, I take it may be occurring in some other parts of the country, although I guess it doesn't conform very well with the figure you reported earlier, Mike Also, tourist activity in our region has been very, very strong especially along the coast in recent weeks Despite this auto episode, Mr Chairman, the mood of most of our business contacts is less optimistic now than it was even as recently as the July meeting I think people are worried about the tax increase that now definitely will be coming If anything, they may even be more worried about what the health care reform package, when we get it, will do to them And I think these concerns are clearly having a negative impact on economic activity, especially on employment in our region; that has been happening for some time But it strikes me that, if anything, that negative may have intensified most recently  As far as the national economy is concerned, I wouldn't argue with the Greenbook's real GDP projections at this point Initially when I saw the 23 percent annual rate of growth in real GDP that you're projecting for the second half of the year, Mike, it struck me as a little on the low side in light of the strong final demand in the second quarter, the evidence of at least some strength in housing, and    8/17/93  the nice sharp decline in long-term interest rates But the negative attitudes that the budget package has fostered, as I said a minute ago, are very real; and I don't think there's any doubt that it could put a significant drag on the economy in the months ahead So, 23 percent growth strikes me as reasonable at this point If I had to guess, I would say the risks may be just slightly on the up side but not very much  Now, having said all of this about real economic activity, let me just say that I think the most important development since our last meeting has been on the inflation and interest rate fronts It may well be that the recent price data are overstating the progress we're making, but I'm at least somewhat encouraged by what I've seen Core CPI has risen at an annual rate of about 2-1/2 percent over the last five months, which is a pretty good hunk of time And with the July figure, the annualized rate of increase in the core CPI so far in 1993 for the first time has dropped a little below the 1992 rate Again, it may overstate the progress we're making but, as I think Bob Parry suggested, it strikes me that while we can't be sure yet we may finally be making some progress toward bringing the longer-term trend inflation rate down  The other positive, and I think clearly related, development is the nice decline we've had recently in long-term interest rates As I recall the projections that were made back at the beginning of the year, the consensus forecast for the 30-year bond rate was about 7-1/2 percent; and I don't believe anybody was looking for anything as low as 6-1/2 percent, where we are now Clearly, the budget package has played a role in this either because of its prospective deficit reduction or maybe because people think it's going to knock the heck out of the economy But whatever contribution the fiscal side has made in bringing long-term rates down, I think there's a good chance that our recent monetary policy actions and statements have also played at least an equal role, or perhaps even a greater role The news of a tilt toward tightness at the May meeting, and the overall tone or emphasis of your comments at the Humphrey-Hawkins meeting, Mr Chairman, I think have sent strong signals to the markets and to the public that, whatever may have happened in the past, this time around we are quite serious about keeping inflation under control as the recovery proceeds So, in short, I think we've bought some additional credibility recently, and I think that has contributed significantly to the rally in the bond market I would hope that with policy we won't do anything to reverse that progress because it strikes me that the improved financial conditions are probably the main thing the economy has going for it right now Thank you   Well, I may have a minority view here, Mr Chairman I agreed with everything you said until you got to the last part I would favor pretty strongly sticking with an asymmetric directive The latest inflation data are encouraging--no doubt about it--but I think it's possible to overstate the progress We always play a bit of the numbers game here with respect to [the base for] the calculation But if I've calculated it right, the core CPI rate on an annualized basis over the first seven or eight months of this year is 33 percent compared to 34 percent last year So, the progress has not been excessive, it seems to me, with respect to last year Also, as you pointed out in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, there is at least some evidence from survey data that inflation expectations in  -39-    8/17/93  some quarters may actually have worsened So, while I think we've made some gains on credibility, we still have some distance to go before we really convince the markets and the public generally that we are going to go all the way this time to price stability Also, I would make this point I think precisely because we have not moved the funds rate at all for a long period of time, the directive language is now a very big signal If we shift back to symmetry at this stage of the game, it's going to get a lot of attention and involve some risk So, from my own standpoint I'd rather stay with the asymmetric directive   Mike, your projection for real personal consumption expenditures for the third quarter, given the high July level, implies a decline on average in August and September, if I calculated it right Is that right?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, there hasn't been much change in our District over the period since the last meeting The information we're receiving from our business contacts, directors, and others indicates that the District's economy is growing at a moderate pace But, as Bob Forrestal said, we've been hit hard in agriculture by the drought; we're coming out of that now but outside of agriculture things are pretty much unchanged As elsewhere, people are frustrated by the slow pace of overall recovery; they are especially frustrated by the sluggishness in job growth But I don't think very many people in our region think the economy is  -15-    9/23/93  about to turn back down One sector where we do seem to be seeing pretty consistent signs of somewhat greater strength is housing Home sales, construction, and both new and existing home prices seem to be rising in most local areas in our region  As far as the national economy is concerned, the Greenbook's projection is certainly reasonable and plausible; and objectively speaking the risk of error is probably pretty evenly balanced on both the up side and the down side, given what we know now I've been more optimistic about the outlook in recent months than most people and I guess most people have been more optimistic than the actual outcome But I think I have been more optimistic than most people coming into this meeting, so I need to be a little humble in making any conjecture about future growth at this point Nevertheless, I would humbly submit that we may get somewhat stronger growth going forward than the staff expects I would make three points in this regard First, both the Greenbook and the Beigebook seem to suggest that the greater strength in housing, which as I said a minute ago we see in our District, is pretty general across the country As the Greenbook points out, the latest reports of builders, lenders, home buyers, and others in the market all seem to indicate that the housing outlook generally is better than some of the latest data seem to suggest That might to some extent be substantiated by the increase in housing in August that you announced a minute ago, Mike In light of these reports, and given the substantial further decline in mortgage rates, the pickup in housing that seems to be going on currently may turn out to be more robust and sharper than many people think Second, I think consumer spending is looking increasingly solid We had a good rate of increase in real personal consumption expenditures in the second quarter and, given a high level in July--if I calculated this correctly--the third-quarter rate conceivably could be close to 4 percent even if there are relatively small increases in the months of August and September And finally, as many people have pointed out, job market conditions are generally stronger than the weak August payroll figure would seem to suggest The lengthening workweek, the strength in the household survey data, the continued fairly healthy rise in help wanted advertising, all suggest to me that the labor market is at least holding steady and perhaps even improving a bit  So all in all, it seems to me that at least one can say that private domestic final demand is firming up noticeably Well, "noticeably" is too strong; I guess one has to exert a little effort to notice it, but I think it's there Activity undoubtedly will continue to be restrained going forward by the forthcoming tax increases, employer concern about the cost implications of health care reform, and the economic weakness in many of our major export markets But I still think on balance that there's a better than even chance that we will get a little more growth than the 23 percent rate projected by the Greenbook for the second half of the year  One final point, if I may In my view the most significant development by far since the last meeting is the further decline in long-term rates One of our major objectives in policy in recent years, as you all know, has been to help bring long-term interest rates down further by raising the credibility of our efforts to achieve price stability over time I think the much greater than expected declines in long rates recently are evidence that that strategy is working over time That may be evidence of other things  -16-    9/23/93  as well, but there's no doubt that our actions recently have aided the further decline in long rates And I hope we will do whatever we need to do going forward to maintain and extend that progress Thank you   "B" symmetric   Mr Chairman, I certainly agree with the general thrust of your recommendations Going forward I agree with you that an MOD is the best way to go with a three- to five-year lag I know there's not a huge difference between an MOD and an edited transcript but, frankly, I have a fairly strong preference for an MOD It would eliminate a lot of extraneous commentary and I think it would make the atmosphere here better And it would in that way minimize the negative impact on the deliberative process that an edited transcript might entail Going backward, for the past, I also agree with your recommendation I have the same very strong feeling you do about the privacy issue I think of my predecessor and his 20 years here But trying to avoid the release of these transcripts is going to make it look as if we're trying to hide something The fact is that we don't have anything to hide, or at least nothing to hide that is of lasting significance in my view The great advantage of releasing transcripts is that it makes that point very clearly and emphatically and puts us in a better position to deal with what I think is the real threat here, and that is the opportunity that this situation presents to people who want to paint us as secretive and manipulative and interested in issues of concern to the few rather than the many We need to act decisively to keep that kind of sentiment in check because I think that's the central threat and problem here  As far as the particulars are concerned, again I would release the transcripts Along the lines of Governor Angell's recommendation, I would release both the lightly edited version to make them intelligible and also the unedited version to make it clear that we're not using the editorial process to hide anything As far as the length of the lag time is concerned, I came to the meeting thinking that probably three years was the right amount of time Your argument for five years makes some sense to me but, frankly, I'm not sure we would buy that much additional privacy by going to five years and three years is a bit more forthcoming And finally, so far as the review process is concerned--I think you discussed that briefly in the memo, Don--it would be nice if we take this route to give the people who participated in these meetings an opportunity to make comments and review them But I think speed is of the essence; if we're going to be forthcoming, we need to move quickly And I don't think we can do that unless we restrict the review to the FOMC Secretariat, so I would go with that approach   My first choice would be [releasing] both; my second choice would be raw transcripts with annotation   Three and five   MOD first; edited second   Well, it seems clear in our District that economic activity is picking up, as seems to be the case in a number  -74-    11/16/93  of other parts of the country We have a substantial amount of manufacturing activity in the Fifth District, especially textiles and furniture but a lot of other things as well And for the first time since the beginning of the year we're seeing and getting information about increased orders and increased shipments A lot of this, especially again with furniture and textiles, is being driven by the apparent increase in housing activity--sales and construction--not only in our District but around the country And we are definitely seeing some significant strengthening in the housing sector in our region with a few local exceptions in places like Charleston, South Carolina and Norfolk, Virginia where the defense build-down is a problem I would just summarize [my comments] on the District by saying that over the years I've found that the general tone of comments at our directors meetings is a pretty good coincident or maybe slightly lagging indicator of overall conditions, and those comments have been decidedly more optimistic for the last couple of meetings  I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Bob Forrestal and the Sixth District for getting a Mercedes plant even if it was at our expense We're comforted somewhat, though, by news that Mickey Mouse is going to build a historic theme park about 30 miles down the road which may [deflect] some tourists from Orlando to northern Virginia We need a little more congestion!  With respect to the national picture, the upward revision in the Greenbook projection for the current quarter certainly seems reasonable, given the broad evidence now that aggregate demand may be heating up a bit Frankly, I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see something even in excess of 4 percent for one quarter I also continue to believe that the risk of error in the Greenbook projection for '94 is at least somewhat on the up side I recognize, as Mike and the Greenbook rightly point out, that the recent tendency for consumer spending to outrun income growth is not sustainable over the long haul But in the context of the permanent income model of consumer behavior, I think one can interpret the recent behavior as perhaps indicating that households have revised upward their thinking about future income prospects If that's a correct interpretation, then it's quite possible that the increase in demand will be sustained well into 1994 And I wouldn't be surprised to see real GDP growth next year at 3 percent or perhaps even a bit higher, compared to the 2-1/2 percent projection in the Greenbook In that regard, the recent backup in long-term interest rates is, for my money at least, the most discouraging development recently I think it's primarily due to a concern in the markets that the recent strengthening in economic activity is going to be allowed at some point to put upward pressure on inflation And my sense is that that perception is increasingly widespread As we all know, nothing could hurt this recovery more completely and quickly than a big jump in long-term interest rates So I think we need to remain vigilant   I have a lot of sympathy for what Tom just said but for now "B" symmetric   I support your suggestion strongly, Mr Chairman I think there's some risk There is some possibility that what is being proposed won't resolve it fully and we will ultimately have to release the entire tape for this one meeting And that's tough because it was a hard-hitting conversation But I think you're absolutely right that we've got to get this thing behind us because of the conspiracy [accusations] So, even if that happens, I would say to go ahead   I moved over to this table about a year ago and over most of the time since then I've been in general agreement with the Greenbook projections I've often thought the risk of error was a bit on the up side, but the staff projections have usually struck me as being generally reasonable and sort of within my own confidence interval But I can't really say that as strongly this time, at least when we get out beyond the current quarter A number of things make me think that the Greenbook forecast this time may be significantly underestimating the growth of the economy and economic activity as we get out into 1994  First, I think there's a good chance the projected sharp deceleration in consumer spending won't happen, especially for durable goods We may get some deceleration but I don't think it's going to be as sharp as the Greenbook is projecting Among other things the Greenbook expects fiscal restraint to exert a fairly considerable drag on consumer outlays next year And maybe it will, but it seems to me that the upper income people who are most likely to be affected by the tax increases could reasonably have seen these things coming as long as a year ago, certainly by the middle of last year So it seems quite likely to me that these taxes have already worked their effect and have already had whatever impact they're going to have on the path of spending going forward More broadly, nothing in the recent data suggests to me that the economy generally is about to pull back because of fiscal drag and fiscal restraint It seems to me that the current acceleration in activity, which is quite strong, is basically being driven by the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy housing, consumer spending on durable goods, and producer spending on durable equipment That suggests to me that the decline in real interest rates that has been going on now for some time is perhaps    12/21/93  finally showing through in a rather fundamental way to the economy generally And unless there's a very sharp backup in interest rates, especially long-term rates, I would expect these sectors to continue to bolster economic activity in the period ahead Also I'm less pessimistic than the Greenbook about the prospects for net exports, although I get from Ted's comments that maybe I read the Greenbook in this particular framework as more pessimistic than it actually is We have had significant reductions in interest rates in a number of other industrial countries and it seems to me that they could give us a somewhat stronger recovery in the G-6 countries than the Greenbook appears to expect  But from my standpoint the most compelling reason I would have for questioning the staff forecast this time is the anecdotal comments we're hearing in our own District, none of which suggests any real diminution in activity going forward On the contrary, the sense we're getting virtually from all of our directors and all of our business contacts is that the economy is gaining momentum pretty much across the board Just to give you a couple of examples Our Baltimore directors, a pretty good cross section of people, have been pessimistic until their last meeting In their last meeting they were positive about the outlook for the first time really since the recession in '90-'91 The same thing [is true] in Richmond and Charlotte; they've been somewhat more optimistic for several months, but at their last meeting they were much more positive about the current situation and the outlook than they had been for some time And we're getting much stronger comments from our business contacts We have a lot of manufacturing activity in our District and we're in contact with those people Many of them are telling us for the first time in a long time that they plan to bring on new workers within the next six months We haven't heard that to a significant and broad degree until recently Also declining vacancy rates for commercial property in a number of areas in the District have increased optimism among commercial builders and real estate developers A year ago these guys were all saying it would never get better I should add that the acceleration in general economic activity has begun to raise some concerns about inflation among at least some of our contacts, though it's not terribly widespread yet I think you mentioned something, Mike, about pricing power Several of our business contacts have told us that while they did not believe until recently that they could make price increases stick, they're beginning to think they can do that within the next six months  So, overall, I can't remember a time over the years that I've been here--maybe with one exception, in early 1983--when I've seen such a broad accumulation of positive information about the economy both nationally and in our District And I think that has important implications for our policy decision today I think--I hope--we've known all along that if the economy really began to gain some strength, we were going to have to let real short-term interest rates move up above zero For my money I believe we're there now And, frankly, if we defer action on the funds rate any longer, I think we could jeopardize the credibility of our commitment to price stability and all the good things that credibility does for the economy and long-term interest rates   Mr Chairman, I certainly respect your position but, as I said earlier, I think the accumulation of positive economic news that we're seeing now is really quite extraordinary And in this situation I think the time has come to let real short-term interest rates rise in order to make this expansion a sustainable one and keep it from getting out of hand on the up side And I really think we need to move now I recognize that there are certainly arguments for not moving yet, but the fact is that there are always such arguments And we know from long experience that we can get into a lot of trouble if we wait too long If we [wait] this time, we risk a significant deterioration in inflation expectations and we risk a further backup in long-term interest rates And my view is that the risks of that kind of outcome would harm the economy; [the cost in terms of] growth of jobs and production and the general health of the economy is significantly greater than a moderate tightening of monetary policy And when I say moderate tightening, I have in mind something like a 1/4 point on interest rates I know this is a turn in direction and I know that's important But a 1/4 point increase is not exactly a lethal weapon In this regard I think the 1/2 point backup in long-term interest rates we've seen recently is a warning We still have time to heed it I realize, of course, that this is a difficult time for the Fed; we are under attack on a number of fronts But in my view that makes it all the more imperative that we signal clearly and promptly that we're not going to be distracted from our principal longer-term objective So, I would favor a 1/4 point increase in the funds rate now   I didn't have a question, but a comment if that's appropriate now I have a lot of sympathy with what Jerry just said I think Ted has presented a number of plausible reasons for enlarging this swap I think the memo that he distributed was very helpful and it showed that this facility has been used constructively on a number of occasions in the past The drawings generally have been paid back promptly and US taxpayers have not lost anything So, from that kind of perspective I think we can make a case for increasing the line  But it seems to me that there are a number of broader issues here that Jerry has alluded to that urgently need attention The 1951 Treasury/Federal Reserve Accord established the principle that the Fed needs to be meaningfully independent within the government in order to conduct our monetary policy effectively I think we all know that that independence is indispensable if we are going to be able to discharge our fundamental responsibilities successfully We also know that this independence is granted only grudgingly and it's under constant scrutiny in the Congress and elsewhere Consequently, I think we ought to be very reluctant to take any action that might have even the appearance of abusing this independence lest we lose some or all of it  Now, with all of this in mind, enlarging the swap line with Mexico worries me a great deal As I understand it, the line was initially established back in 1967 to help deal with balance of payments issues and specifically to help support the then-fixed exchange rate between the peso and the dollar That rationale no longer exists; in fact, the materials that Ted distributed make it explicit that this facility would not be used for this purpose So, it seems clear to me that any loan to Mexico in the current circumstances in essence would be a fiscal action of the US government And fiscal actions--expenditures of the government--are    3/22/94  supposed to be authorized by Congress and Congress is supposed to appropriate the funds So, whatever the general merits may be of making loans to Mexico, I don't think we should be involved without explicit Congressional authorization, Mr Chairman So, I would oppose an increase in the swap line   Well, I was simply going to say that going forward we need to keep in mind that there is a tradeoff between the good we can do with a somewhat broader function and our independence I think we always need to have that in front of us But the other point is that as a Committee we need to take a fundamental look at  -12-    3/22/94  some of these basic philosophical issues The problem I have with the current proposal is that it's difficult to disentangle the proposal from the broader issues If we do this now, then it's going to be somewhat more difficult subsequently, at an early date, to look at the broader issues because the current proposal takes us down a particular path That bothers me   I would favor announcing it now   In our District, we certainly have not seen any significant weakening in business conditions recently, aside from some temporary setbacks which seem clearly to be related to the weather Business is basically good across all sectors and I think it's fair to say that most of the people we have contact with, our directors and others, are reasonably optimistic about their prospects for the remainder of the year So the overall picture generally is pretty good and I won't belabor that  In contrast to some of the other comments we have heard, I think the major, most striking development in our region has been the increasing number of reports of rising prices and increased concern about inflation generally We see that in our directors' meetings; we hear that from some of our other contacts  -22-    3/22/94  as some of you know, and consequently he has contact  with a number of industries that he rents to, in addition to his direct contacts with the construction industry He's a well informed and I think generally perceptive observer of short-run economic developments a couple of weeks ago, he emphasized the fact that suppliers that he has contact with across a broad range of industries are indicating that they are seeing price increases in a range of 3 to 5 percent for a number of industrial supplies and materials, and moreover that these price increases are now, for the first time in this cycle, really sticking Some other directors and some of our other business contacts are telling us that they are seeing increased prices for steel, plastics, and corrugated paper, and for the first time in a long time, some of our directors are telling us that they are raising their own prices in a broad range of industries from textiles to trucking So we see a little less favorable news on the inflation front in our region than some others have noted  With respect to the national picture, let me make just a couple of comments about the staff projections and analysis I have mainly two points First, I have some trouble with the downward revision in projected real GDP Projected real GDP growth for the first half has been reduced in this Greenbook from an annual rate of 35 percent to 28 percent, and for the year as a whole from 3 percent to 27 percent These are significant reductions I recognize that these reductions are predicated to some extent on a now more rapid tightening in policy than was assumed in some of the earlier projections But my feeling is that we are still more likely to get something like 3 percent growth for the year as a whole I was especially struck, Mike, by the projections for consumer spending, for which I think you have a projected growth rate for the first quarter of 2-1/2 percent and something like 2-1/4 percent for the year as a whole We just don't see that happening If I calculated correctly, even if we don't get any change in real consumer spending in February and March, we would still have a rate of growth in the first quarter of 36 percent at an annual rate  Second, and probably more fundamentally, we have some concerns about the Greenbook's discussion of the recent behavior of long-term interest rates and the interpretation of that movement Over the last five months, the 30-year bond rate has risen about 120 basis points, with corresponding increases in other long rates That's one of the largest movements in long rates in such a brief period since the end of the 1981-82 recession In my view it strongly suggests that inflation expectations have risen by more than a marginal amount And I think that interpretation is widely shared by financial market participants, as evidenced by their comments reported in the press and in market newsletters The Greenbook, in some contrast, at least in some of the sections of Part I seems to dismiss or at least de-emphasize this inflation expectations interpretation of the recent backup in long rates It seems to offer two alternative scenarios The first is that the rise in rates may reflect, at least in part, higher actual and expected real short-term rates down the road because of the stronger economy and the reaction to our action back in early February But over at least the last six weeks or so since we took that policy action, some long- and intermediate-term rates have risen significantly more than short rates I guess that  -23-    3/22/94  would imply on this explanation that expected real short rates way down the road have increased, and I just think it's unlikely that the economic news and policy developments have increased expected real short rates 20 or 30 years out in the future So I don't think that explanation can account for a great deal of the significant backup in the longest maturity rates The second explanation, if I understand it correctly, is that the rise in bond rates may have little to do with economic fundamentals such as inflation expectations and may have resulted primarily instead from what, for lack of a better term, I'd have to refer to as irrational market behavior--some kind of bandwagon effect with overshooting to use the term I think you used That may well be true; I wouldn't deny that But it's a hard argument to get your arms around because it's really more a psychological argument than an economic argument So it seems risky to me, to put it mildly, to dismiss or de-emphasize at least the possibility that the reason for one of the biggest backups in long rates in a long time has to do with inflation expectations or some worsening in those expectations In any event, I think this question of how to interpret this move in bond rates is one we need to give some weight to when we get to our policy discussion later in the meeting   Right   Well, that's fair The point I was addressing particularly in the Greenbook as distinct from what you said this morning--I think the emphasis was a little different--is that you had a statement saying "we are inclined to think that the emergence of a large inflation premium per se can explain relatively little of the recent surprise in bond yields" That's what struck me when I read the Greenbook and that's really what I was addressing   Let me just say that I agree 100 percent with Ed Boehne He said it very well; he really reflected my position completely I have just a couple of comments Again, as I suggested earlier, despite the good news on current inflation at this juncture, we can see clear signs that an inflationary psychology is building, and I think that's reflected most clearly in bond rates You mentioned historical perspective From an historical perspective, I would like to suggest that the hallmark of our monetary policy strategy in the 1980s was that when these kinds of episodes occurred  -46-    3/22/94  and we got into this type of situation, we reacted My own view is that maybe not all, but a significant part, of the substantial progress we made in that decade in bringing inflation rates down from close to 14 percent to close to 3 percent currently, reflects that strategy, and I would be reluctant to abandon it Moreover, if one looks at that period in some detail, when we were willing to move more aggressively--and I would say that included the spring and summer of '83 and the spring and summer of '84--we got pretty good results and rather quick results with respect to inflationary psychology and bond rates In contrast, when we have moved more slowly, such as in the early months of 1987, the results have not been as favorable So, against that background, I think we need to move aggressively now to deal with this growing inflationary psychology I have a very strong preference for alternative C Are there risks in doing that? Yes, there are But my own feeling is the same as Ed Boehne's--that the risks are at least as great in not taking this action; I think there is a good chance that we would be seen as too cautious and too tentative   Peter, you mentioned communication Most of the research I've seen suggests that intervention like this, if it has an effect, it's mainly by way of communicating future likely policy actions With that in mind, what do you think the prospects for the dollar would be if we did not follow through at this point with pretty strong policy actions?   Significant downside risk or--   Mike, in the same vein as Jerry's question, it seems to me that much of the overall profile of the projection depends on the idea that the recent run-up in long rates is going to restrain the economy in the future In that context--I know you think that most of the recent increase has been real--I would be interested in knowing particularly with regard to the 30-year Treasury bond rate, which is currently about 7-1/2 percent, roughly how much of that you think is real   I'm just trying to pin it down a little more   But would you say that currently, taking the 30-year bond rate, that maybe 4 percentage points of it is real? Am I doing my arithmetic right?   Wouldn't 4 percent be on the high side historically for the longest real rate? That's really what I'm trying to get at   But by longer-term standards, it would be quite high I think I tried to figure that out in the current--   I've been reporting for several meetings that the tone in our District is pretty positive and nothing has changed I've been in this business for about 20 years now, and I would have to say that I can't remember a time when the anecdotal information we hear in our District was any stronger than it is now There are very few weak spots--that we hear about anyway I think it's fair to say that most people that we talk to are broadly optimistic about prospects for the near term, at least for growth of jobs A lot of noteworthy things have happened but I guess the single most noteworthy development in our region recently has been the enormous improvement in commercial real estate activity Activity in this sector appears to be increasing sharply I don't think there has been a great deal of actual new construction yet, but vacancy rates are declining, prices are rising, rents are rising, and markets seem to be tightening in a number of our communities Just a couple of examples The Raleigh-Durham market in North Carolina was described at our last board meeting as being as tight as it has been in about a decade, and it has been a pretty good market through this whole period We also are hearing a number of reports that things are improving in this sector here around Washington We get reports that the northern Virginia, DC, and the Baltimore/Washington corridor markets are tightening, rents are up, prices are rising at least to some extent, and that of course was one of the worst situations in the country More broadly, we're told that there is substantial domestic and international investment demand for commercial real estate properties in our region despite the recent backup in long-term rates So the news on the real estate front is bullish in our area, and that's refreshing because it wasn't very long ago that people were talking about a 15-year real estate depression in this part of the country  Elsewhere, we are still hearing, as I reported earlier, a lot of anecdotal comments suggesting increased concern about the outlook for prices and inflation I think it's fair to say that these concerns are not restricted to bankers and financial people When our small business and agriculture advisory committee met a few weeks back, we polled them on their inflation expectations and the vast majority expect some worsening in that situation They see the economy strengthening; they see labor markets tightening; they didn't use the term shortages of skilled labor but they said there were shortages of "good" labor And they talked about tightening in a number of other markets So a clear majority of these people are expecting inflation pressures to rise, and I think that's the general  -16-    5/17/94  attitude not just in that group but across my region broadly So that's the District situation  As far as the national outlook is concerned, as I understand it, the staff is now assuming that the funds rate is going to rise to about the 4-1/2 percent level sometime around fall, and that an increase of that magnitude will be sufficient to hold the growth of real GDP to about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year and through 1995 and also keep the core rate of inflation at about 3 percent over that period Now, moderate GDP growth like this might not be a great outlook in all circumstances, but my feeling is that it wouldn't be a bad outcome right now, given where we are and what is happening After all, it would follow a year of solid growth in which we have moved much closer to full employment I think it would lay a nice foundation for sustained growth out beyond the projection period We don't talk about this too much at non-Humphrey- Hawkins meetings, but there may even be a little further progress toward our longer-term price stability goal But I have to say that I'm concerned about what I see as the generally accommodative policy we've followed up to this point I still think that may give us more thrust in both real GDP growth and nominal GDP growth, at least through the end of 1994, than the Greenbook envisions And I don't think it's by any means assured that a 4-1/2 percent funds rate is going to get us the relatively moderate inflation and real growth that the Greenbook is projecting for next year In short, it seems to me that there are substantial upside risks in these projections on both the real side and the inflation side, and we need to give the upside risks some careful weight when we discuss policy later in the meeting   Needless to say, I support your proposal enthusiastically, but I share Tom Melzer's feelings When I heard the statement I had the same kind of feelings that you had, Tom--that it may tend to suggest that we've reached a plateau or reached neutrality Maybe we can work on it a little bit Also, along those lines, I don't have really strong feelings about the language of the directive, but I think a symmetric directive would tend to create the impression that we have reached a plateau So, while I would accept a symmetric directive, I have a preference for an asymmetric directive   Mr Chairman, the reports we have been getting on the District suggest that overall economic activity in our region is still growing at a healthy pace My personal sense is that there may have been some moderation in the rate of expansion in our region from earlier this year, but not much and there may not have been any at all in some areas Some parts of the District, particularly central and western North Carolina and northwestern South Carolina can only be described as booming in my view Moreover, some of the recent commentary we are getting suggests that the northern part of the District and the West Virginia economy, which had been lagging behind the Carolinas earlier in the expansion, are now catching up At our board meeting last week, directors from both Maryland and West Virginia gave particularly bullish reports on conditions in their respective state economies In this regard, I might say that the adverse effects of cutbacks in defense spending, which of course are concentrated primarily in the northern part of the District, while not negligible by any means, seem to have been somewhat less severe than might have been expected earlier Residential construction is off somewhat in the District as elsewhere, although there are still areas of very robust growth in housing, again especially in North Carolina Offsetting at least some of the softening we are seeing in residential activity, there is a real surge in commercial real estate activity Leasing is strong and in many District markets vacancy rates are down and there are a number of sizable new construction projects under way Elsewhere, activity in manufacturing, retail, and the services sector continues to expand, according to the reports we have, although again perhaps at a somewhat more moderate pace than a few months ago On the baseball front, we have bad news and good news in our District The bad news is that somebody has estimated that the state of Maryland will lose about $3 million in business for every Orioles game that is not played The good news is that the Richmond Braves are still playing And if anybody needs tickets, let me know and I'll see what I can do!  Nationally, it seems to us that the economy is still quite strong and we don't think either the apparent softening in consumer spending in the second quarter or the recent slowing in residential construction poses a significant threat to the expansion at this point, given what we know now Deceleration in housing--I guess there is some question now with the data this morning as to how much deceleration is actually going on, but clearly there is some and that is not unusual I would argue for this stage of the business cycle and probably reflects the satisfaction of pent-up demand to some degree as well as the increase in mortgage rates And the slowing in growth of real consumer spending, after all, follows three consecutive quarters of very robust growth in consumer outlays; and it seems clear now, as Mike Prell said, that at least some of this weakness reflects supply constraints, especially with respect to domestic automobiles Moreover, the latest reports on consumer sentiment suggest that consumers are not backing off in any big way As Mike said, the continued strong gains in jobs presumably are going to support growth in income and spending in the period ahead  Against this background, the Greenbook forecast certainly seems reasonable to us Our guess is that nominal GDP may grow  -8-    8/16/94  somewhat more rapidly in the second half of this year than the 47 percent annual rate of increase that the staff is projecting Looking ahead to 1995, the key number as far as I'm concerned is the staff forecast of a 3 percent inflation rate next year As we all know that forecast is predicated on the assumption that the Committee will move short-term interest rates up on an order of magnitude of perhaps a point by early next year I think the staff is right in assuming that some additional restraint of this order is going to be necessary to contain inflation going forward, and personally I think it's important to begin that process now   I enthusiastically support your proposal, Mr Chairman--all the various elements of it   Peter, I have a question on the proposal in the memorandum The suggestion just struck me as unusual Central banks in these relationships normally deal with one another for strong reasons I was surprised that the Bundesbank wanted to move in this direction I guess I'm just wondering if there is anything deeper going on here that you can sense Are they perhaps signaling or does    9/27/94  this imply somewhat less cooperation or a less cooperative spirit on their part with us?   They are operating in our markets?   Joan, the two camps you mentioned at the end of your statement--is that majority 51 percent or 85 percent? Seriously, can you give any sense of what the majority is?   Thank you   In the latter weeks of summer through late August, there were some indications of a deceleration in overall activity in our District We saw some slowing in retail sales and some softening in manufacturing and service-sector activity That was reflected in our Beigebook summary this month But the more recent reports from business contacts, directors, and others now seem to suggest that this slowing, if it occurred at all, was transitory and that the expansion in our region is back on track At all three of our September board meetings--in Baltimore, Charlotte, and Richmond-- director comments were generally positive across industries and across regions within the District Consumer spending, including back-to- school sales, seems to be strong Manufacturing activity appears to have reaccelerated Tourist activity, Bill, also has been strong in our District Nonresidential construction activity is continuing to improve A few days ago, we got reports that a couple of large firms in Charlotte have committed to build 800,000 square feet of additional warehouse space in the next couple of months On the residential side, we are seeing a measurable increase in apartment construction We had not seen that for some time So, again, after a lull it looks to us as though the overall pace of activity in our region has moved back up  The apparently renewed strength in our District economy currently seems, to me at least, to be consistent with the strength of the most recent national data on production and sales Taken as a whole, this information suggests to me that the deceleration in the national economy that appeared in the summer was temporary and that the expansion overall still has a lot of momentum In this situation, I think the 3 percent projected growth rate of real GDP for the second half of the year is plausible, but as I think you said, Mike, it could be higher Of course, the full impact of our earlier policy actions  -17-    9/27/94  this year probably has not been felt yet The sense I get from our directors and other business contacts is that the interest rate increases that have accompanied these earlier actions are likely to be associated with, at most, a fairly modest decline in the growth of the national economy in the months ahead The strong recent growth in investment activity, both fixed and inventory investment, is certainly not suggestive of a business expansion that is about to run out of steam  Mr Chairman, let me just make a couple of comments with respect to the inflation outlook I don't disagree with the Greenbook's inflation projection, but it's a bit unsettling to me that the staff is now projecting a consumer price inflation rate of about 3-3/4 percent by the first quarter of next year I find it even more disturbing that for the first time we are beginning to see, not a lot, but a fair number of private forecasts of inflation rates of 4 percent or higher toward the end of 1995 Moreover, it seems clear that inflation expectations are rising at least in the financial markets The bond rate is now at its highest level since back in the 1990-1991 recession despite our August move I recognize that a lot of things can affect bond rates in the short run, but a bond rate that is persistently over 7-3/4 percent, as it has been now for some time, suggests to me that the longer-term inflation expectations of market participants is something closer to 4 percent than the 3 percent rate for the CPI that the staff is projecting for the second half of 1995 and on into 1996 That says to me that we still have a credibility gap Market participants do not yet seem to be convinced that we are going to take the actions we need to take to achieve our own internal inflation forecast So, I think it's essential that we find a way to reaffirm our commitment to price stability at an early date  Let me just say very briefly, Mr Chairman, that one way to deal with the credibility problem might be to consider announcing explicit multi-year inflation rate targets leading to price stability as has been done in some other countries--say 3 percent for 1995, 2-1/2 percent for 1996, and so forth Right now, it seems to me, we are between a rock and a hard place, between a lingering credibility problem, on the one hand, and the concerns that a lot of people understandably have about further tightening action on the other If we announced explicit inflation targets and committed ourselves clearly to achieving those targets, that might buy us a little more flexibility at least with respect to the timing of our short-term policy actions In the absence of something like this, though, I think we need seriously to consider some sort of policy action later in the meeting   Mr Chairman, I continue to think the economy has a lot of momentum In this situation, it seems to me that inflation expectations are rising The bond rate is now at its highest point since the 1990-1991 recession I don't know what the curve looks like--I've never seen it I'm not sure what its character is, but I think we are still behind it I think we are going to have to move further, and frankly I just don't see a compelling reason to delay that move On the contrary, there is at least some risk in not acting at this stage Aggregate demand is strong and in that kind of situation, especially if it strengthens further, inflation pressures inevitably are going to grow, and inflationary expectations will grow Against that background, if past experience is any guide at all, that could eventually put us in a situation where all the choices are bad We have been there before, and it's no fun So, I would prefer to move My choice would be alternative D   "D" as in David!   I would appreciate it if the swap vote could be delayed until later   I wonder if I could put another alternative on the table--that we not intervene at all I realize that there are many people on the Committee who would disagree with that because they think that, at least in a limited way, intervention may be useful from time to time, and I certainly respect those views But I have to tell you that I personally have very serious reservations about the wisdom of our continuing to intervene Whether we renew the swap lines is relevant to this discussion, because in many ways the swap lines facilitate these operations and make them more convenient I'll be brief here, but if I could just go through the way I see this at the risk of some repetition As you said, Mr Chairman, it is now widely agreed that sterilized intervention doesn't have any sustained impact on exchange rates unless it sends a signal that we are going to follow it up with a monetary policy action This implies, for me at least,  -49-    11/15/94  and this is really the heart of the matter, that it is not really possible for the Fed to maintain a truly independent monetary policy for an extended period of time while following the Treasury's lead on foreign exchange policy Now, of course, in reality the way I see this is that we have maintained our independence by not making a commitment to follow interventions with monetary policy actions But that's not a perfect situation either I think it is a problem because of the possibility that these operations will not be successful Of course, back in June we had an operation I think most people would agree was not successful That really bothers me from the standpoint of credibility because when we participate in an operation like this and it is not successful, we get associated with that result Specifically, we lose credibility It is adverse for us from the standpoint of public perceptions about the central bank and what we can do I think that can reduce our effectiveness over time in conducting monetary policy generally It is an important issue; it is a broad issue Again, I would respectfully submit that we ought to consider withdrawing from these kinds of operations, maybe not immediately but gradually in some way This is a side point If we did that, we would not need swap arrangements Frankly, I would oppose renewing the swap arrangements this morning Let me say that I am not opposed to or saying that the US Government should never intervene in foreign exchange markets I am simply saying that I don't think we should participate except perhaps as the Treasury's agent   Well, again, I just worry about the credibility effect I think there is a negative there and I guess I see the tradeoff differently Obviously, I have no personal experience in this and I respect your views But is it the case that we would have no influence whatever in these discussions if we were not participating directly?  -50-    11/15/94   I guess I think if we are out of these operations, there is less chance of disorderly markets [Laughter]   Can I just make one very quick final comment, and I appreciate you letting me make my other comments earlier, Mr Chairman Let me just say that I am not a Fortress America guy I don't want to be arrogant, but for me one of the highest priorities we have is always to protect our independence in the conduct of monetary policy My only concern here is that intervention activities threaten that at least to a degree, and it is very, very difficult to fine-tune it That's the key point from my standpoint I hope that that will be very much in our minds going forward with all these operations   Mr Chairman, my comments will be very similar to many of the others you have heard already With respect to the District, last week I attended a meeting of leading business people in Virginia who advise the governor on revenue estimates This group includes the CEOs of most of the state's large corporations--a couple of major railroads, a major aluminum producer with worldwide operations, some banks, a big shipbuilder, and a big trucking company I was really struck by the uniformly bullish commentary at that meeting, not only about the state economy but about regional and national economic prospects as well Several of these people said explicitly that they were planning major capital outlays in the near future based on these expectations A number of them said explicitly that they thought the consensus national economic forecast, which had been summarized for them at this meeting as calling for GDP growth of about 2-1/2 percent next year, might be too low It was a very bullish meeting  The tone of our board meeting in Richmond last Thursday was similar All of the directors were optimistic about conditions both in their local areas and in their respective businesses Consumer spending appears to be especially robust in our region Retailers are expecting a good Christmas There is what I would describe as a gradual revival of commercial construction in the District The main negative factor is still the reduction in defense expenditures But even places like Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, where there had been projections of a big negative impact, are not seeing that--I guess because of the strength of the general economy In spite of this strong growth, we have seen only scattered reports of actual price increases for final goods and services in recent weeks at least But a number of our directors at the meeting last week, especially those who have contacts in the manufacturing sector, said they expected a number of their suppliers to put price increases in place, perhaps fairly substantial increases, at the end of the year Several of them said they would expect to pass at least some of these increases along in their own prices  Nationally, I thought the staff did a very fine job of sizing up the current situation in this month's Greenbook I guess it is fair to say that Mike and his people are still calling for a fairly soft landing I think that's appropriate, but I would make three points First, I think it is worth noting that the landing in this Greenbook seems to me to be less soft than that in the September Greenbook, which if I remember correctly was slightly less soft than that in August I think there is a lesson for us somewhere in this pattern As I recall, the Greenbook states explicitly at one point that the risk of error is on the up side toward the situation where we move back into some kind of boom-bust pattern; that's something we have seen so often in earlier postwar cycles The second point I would make about the Greenbook is that, as you know, the current projection is predicated on a significant further move toward restraint in monetary policy over the next several months Finally, even with this further tightening, the Greenbook is still calling for  -21-    11/15/94  a 3 percent inflation rate; we are not really getting any reduction in inflation So even with this outcome, we are still going to be some distance from full price stability  On the inflation score, I think it is fair to say that many business people with whom I have contact and probably more financial market people now expect a moderate increase in the inflation rate next year to about 3-1/2 percent I've spoken to a number of people who are expecting something more I would say that this increase in inflation expectations is clearly at least part of the explanation of what is going on in bond markets and foreign exchange markets The behavior in these markets suggests to me that we probably have lost some additional credibility over the last several weeks I agree with Bill and Cathy and others who have said that we are in a position now where we need to make another decisive move in order to shore up our credibility and convince the public that we are still serious about our goals  In this regard, Mr Chairman, I would like to repeat something I said at the September meeting I think that inflation expectations currently are especially sensitive to incoming short-run economic data and to indications of monetary and other economic policy changes precisely because we don't really have a clear, step-by-step strategy to meet our longer-run goals I think we would be well served by explicit multiyear inflation targets that we would announce publicly If we took this approach, I think it would relieve some of the pressure on us, in a situation like the current one, to make a strong move to reinforce and shore up our credibility If we were to do something like this, we obviously would need to talk about it a bit But I think it would increase our operational flexibility in the short run, and it would reduce the risk that at some point we might do some damage to the economic expansion Thank you   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I would associate myself with both of Bob Parry's recommendations and yours   Our directors and other business contacts continue to report generally robust activity in our region with just a couple of exceptions that I'll mention in a minute I guess the most striking anecdotal information we have gotten lately has to do with labor market conditions, which as a number of other people have noted for their Districts appear to be tightening very noticeably throughout our region At our last board meeting about 10 days ago, we had several reports of shortages in both retail help and construction workers The shortage of construction labor is said to be pushing construction costs up in North Carolina Also in November, West Virginia posted the biggest monthly increase in jobs ever in that state, and it was quite broadly based across the West Virginia economy  Elsewhere, most of the information we have on holiday sales has been positive Also on the positive side of the ledger, we see increasingly clear signs of a firming of conditions in commercial real estate markets in a number of local areas Actual construction has not accelerated markedly yet, but commercial vacancy rates are declining, rents are beginning to increase in at least a few metropolitan areas, and there is talk about increases in other areas not too far down the road Prime space has become increasingly hard to come by, especially large blocks of it  Lest you think the only news we ever listen to in our Bank is good news, let me mention a couple of signs of possible moderation in activity in some sectors in our region We do a monthly survey of manufacturing activity in the Fifth District, as a number of other Reserve Banks do in their respective Districts Our November survey suggested fairly significant slowing in activity in that sector, which is very important in our District This slowing is in some contrast to the published national data Also, we see continuing signs of a flattening in residential real estate activity across the District At their meeting a few days ago, our Charlotte directors said that buyer traffic for single-family homes had hit a wall in the month of November We never know how much weight to give to that kind of anecdotal information, but it does seem a little at variance with some other things we have heard  Finally, with respect to prices in the District, our latest monthly survey suggests that both manufacturers and retailers are now expecting somewhat sharper price increases over the next six months than they were just a few weeks ago  Nationally, of course, the broad contour of the Greenbook forecast hasn't changed a great deal The thing that struck me is that--there has been some comment about it already--in spite of the strong projected growth near term, the bulge in the CPI predicted for the first quarter of next year is noticeably less pronounced than it was in the November Greenbook Inflation remains relatively steady over the whole two-year forecast horizon I think Mike's comments  -15-    12/20/94  suggested fairly that projections key off of the recent favorable actual inflation data rather than the apparent strength in real economic activity and the strong job growth and low unemployment rate  Let me just say that I don't envy the staff's task in developing this forecast I think developing any kind of reasonable and credible forecast in this situation is exceedingly difficult and the forecast we have is certainly plausible Still, I think we have to recognize that this projection can be described as relatively optimistic under the circumstances There are considerable risks in the forecast at this point, greater perhaps than we have seen earlier I think these risks are probably somewhat more balanced than they have been up to now, but there still are substantial upside risks As we all know, the economy is clearly very strong; it's really roaring I think; but there are quite a few signs of weakness here and there There is a lot of talk about passing intermediate-level price increases through to final prices at the beginning of the year So I think there is certainly a possibility, more than marginal, that we could begin to see the economy overheat as we move into next year and see an inflation rate significantly higher than the rate the Greenbook is projecting At the same time, I think the downside risk on the real side as we get out into late 1995 and early 1996 is greater now than it has been, especially given the further tightening of policy that may be needed to contain inflation going forward Because of this--and I'm going to step on your fence if I may here just briefly, Mr Chairman--while I think some additional restraint will almost certainly be required before this thing is over, I believe we need to be somewhat more cautious in applying it than was necessary earlier this year when we were further away from a cyclical peak and when we had a serious credibility problem  Speaking of credibility, I think the recent behavior of the bond rate suggests, to me at least, that we have acquired some of late In my view, that is the most encouraging development we have seen in some time The trick is going to be to maintain it going forward as we move into a situation where the risks are at least a little more balanced than they have been I might just note once again if I may that precisely in this kind of situation, something like an inflation target might be helpful   As we all know, the Greenbook is assuming that the funds rate has to be pushed up another percentage point or perhaps even more to keep inflation from breaking out Obviously, we can't know for sure at this stage whether that much tightening is going to be needed, and indeed as you suggested, Mr Chairman, things may work out so that nothing more is needed Still--   I would think so, and I think it is certainly a very high probability that we are going to have to do something more The question before us this morning is whether or not we need to do some of that tightening today or whether we can put it off a little longer I think it is a very close call My own preference at this meeting would be to move the funds rate up 1/4 percentage point to 5-3/4 percent I realize the 1/4 point funds rate moves earlier in the year had adverse reactions, and at that time some argued that those moves were made under sensitive circumstances However, the situation is very different now We only recently made a very strong move, so I don't think that kind of reaction would be a problem at this stage of the game I think the main argument for a relatively modest further move today is that it would reinforce and lock in the quite considerable credibility gains that the November tightening appears to have produced, as I believe John LaWare suggested I think some reinforcement at this stage would be desirable given the very strong recent data on both employment and spending At the same time, a 1/4 point move would be significantly more restrained than any of our last three moves, and it would indicate that we recognize the need for caution as we move closer to the cyclical peak So, my preference would be for a 1/4 percent increase I also would like to second Tom Melzer's comments about the need to consider some sort of inflation target, something to nail down our longer-term goals and objectives at the February meeting   Mr Chairman, is this the time to say something about warehousing if we have views on that?   I have just a few comments if I could make them briefly Ted Truman sent out a lot of background materials regarding warehousing and I reread most of it and reread the memorandum that Virgil and his colleagues did earlier I think the memo makes it clear that from a legal standpoint the Fed definitely has the authority--or certainly that we can make a strong case that the Fed has the authority--to warehouse foreign exchange for the Treasury, and I understand that But however defensible these operations may be from a legal perspective, I just don't think the case is very compelling when I look at the issue in a somewhat broader context that takes account of the Fed's role in the government generally and the independence we are supposed to have As I see it, warehousing is essentially a fiscal policy action or at least is fully equivalent in its effect to a fiscal policy action By that I mean that in the end the warehousing operation has exactly the same final effect as if Congress authorized the Treasury or the ESF to purchase the foreign exchange and fund the purchase by issuing additional debt in the market The only difference when the transaction is done via warehousing is that the usual Congressional appropriations process is circumvented, and the purchase does not show up in the budget I really worry about the risk that we are taking over the longer term with this practice   No, I mean the risk to the institutional position of the Federal Reserve That is really the issue I am trying to focus on, Mr Chairman I think we can get some sense of that in the public's reaction to the Mexican support package I don't want to go into that in any detail I just think it's an example that is very relevant here As we all know, the use of public funds to assist foreign governments, however sensible that may be in particular instances, is a highly charged political issue, especially when some people see good alternative uses for the funds at home The Congressional leadership apparently supported the package in this instance, but I don't believe Congress would have voted to authorize the funds I think a broad segment of the general public, rightly or wrongly, opposes assisting Mexico so generously The point here and the risk as I see it is that if things go badly in Mexico going forward, this could become an issue in the election next year In that event, our role would become more widely understood, and it is quite possible that people could begin to raise questions about our independence It could come under much more careful scrutiny  I would sum up the issue briefly this way Congress placed the Fed outside the regular appropriations process to protect our independence If we are perceived as abusing this sort of off-budget status, we run some serious risks over the longer run Now, I recognize the practical difficulty of trying to pull back immediately from these operations But I would hope that you, Mr Chairman, and  -4-    3/28/95  this Committee would at least consider conveying our concerns forcefully to the Treasury and then work with them hopefully to reach an accord whereby we could withdraw from these operations over a period of time, maybe by some defined target date Again, I recognize that there is a clear legal basis for doing these operations, but I think the broader argument against doing them is really quite persuasive   I appreciate that and I am sorry to keep raising these issues I do think that this is not a short-term risk; it's not the sort of thing that is likely to hit us in the face immediately But I worry that over time those who really would like to compromise the position of this institution in the government, if they are looking for an argument, this is I think the strongest argument they would find   Okay   When it's done with us, though, basically it does not show up in the budget, is that right?   My feeling is that if it can be done with private institutions and the market, we ought to see what we can do to push the Treasury to do that Whatever convenience the Treasury is gaining from doing it with us is, from our standpoint at least, offset by the longer-term risk of our continuing with these operations   I understand those points I just hope that we can continue that process and widen that gap a little further   Mr Chairman, reports coming out of our District, which I would remind you is the District where Michael Jordan came from originally-- [Laughter]   These reports continue to show some slowing in the regional economy We do, of course, conduct monthly manufacturing and service sector surveys, and for the latest two months both surveys are consistent with some general softening in activity in our region Our directors, while they are still broadly optimistic, are presenting more balanced comments now on local and regional conditions than earlier when almost all of their comments emphasized the strength in business activity Let me give you a couple of quick examples The central North Carolina area around the cities of Durham and Raleigh has been the strongest local economy in our District, probably about the strongest local area in the entire country Activity there is still strong, but we are seeing some signs of softening there Home  -24-    3/28/95  sales are weaker than they were; automobile sales and sales of other durables are also a bit weaker As another example,  is on the board of a large national apparel retailer In that role, she watches consumer trends not only in the apparel industry specifically but more generally, and she is not very optimistic about the outlook for consumer spending either regionally or nationally  To summarize by sector in our District Retail activity clearly has weakened since the beginning of the year; manufacturing also has moderated, although a good bit less; and both residential and commercial real estate activity have been flat over recent weeks, but some leasing agents have told us that the market for prime office space has become a good bit tighter over the last few months There is some closing of the gap there  The situation in our region, of course, is broadly consistent with developments at the national level Much of the national data since our last meeting, as we all know, clearly suggests that the expansion is beginning to moderate I think the most compelling evidence of that is in the retail sales data Further evidence is provided by some of the latest residential construction information, especially the decline in single-family starts to the lowest level in about two years In my view these developments clearly have been reflected in financial markets Despite the recent acceleration in core CPI, bond rates have come down I think that certainly can be an indication of some reduction in inflation expectations, presumably on the grounds that slower growth will reduce the pressures on resource utilization and hence on cost and prices going forward  Against that background, the downward revision in the Greenbook's projections for the first half of this year and, of course, the substantial downward revision for the first quarter, are reasonable One can support the revised projection analytically in a variety of ways In particular, it is consistent with the permanent income hypothesis, which is a model that many economists now find persuasive in thinking about consumer behavior As you know, even though consumer outlays have diminished lately, income growth has been well maintained The saving rate rose significantly in the final quarter of last year, and if current trends persist, we are going to get the same kind of increase in the current quarter The permanent income hypothesis implies that households will save more if they expect income to grow more slowly in the future, and of course, that is consistent with the Greenbook's scenario In that regard, I might just note that one of our economists, Peter Ireland, recently developed a projection for real disposable labor income for this year, 1995, using a VAR model that is really driven by the saving rate His projection is consistent with the Greenbook projection using a very different model of the economy So, again, I think the broad profile of the Greenbook's near-term projections is certainly plausible  Having said all of this, I think that the risks in the outlook, while certainly more balanced than they were earlier, are still skewed a bit to the up side I think we have to keep in mind that a lot of talk and focus has been on the softer data in some areas, but not all the recent data have been soft In particular, employment has expanded sharply over the last three months It is up 3/4 of a million jobs over that period That is an annual growth rate  -25-    3/28/95  of 2-1/2 percent, which clearly is significantly higher than what is consistent with longer-term noninflationary trend growth in employment Also, industrial production was strong enough in February to push the capacity utilization index back up again It is now at the highest level since 1979, if my figures are right on that And perhaps most importantly, I am impressed by the continued strength of business fixed investment, which is a forward-looking indicator, at least in some sense So, again, I think the upside risk is still there and we should not lose sight of that I just hope we keep that in the back of our minds going forward   I have a lot of sympathy with what you are saying, Don, about the need to move the funds rate more flexibly It gives me an opportunity to underline a point I have made before If we just had some kind of clear long-term anchor, it would be a lot easier to do that Certainly, one of the reasons we are reluctant to do that and one of the reasons the press focuses on it so much is that that is really the indicator that they can key on to see whether or not we are still moving in the long-term direction we say we are moving in If we could solve the longer-term question, I think it would feed right into this kind of operating issue  -41-    3/28/95   Let me first if I may, Mr Chairman, associate myself with Gary Stern's comments about the monetary base I think there is a lot to be gained by some additional research looking at the possibility of using the base or perhaps something similar to it in our operating procedures  As far as policy is concerned, I can certainly accept not changing the rate today, but I have a relatively strong preference for asymmetry As I said in my earlier statement, and I agree with a lot of folks here, I think that while the risks in the outlook are more balanced than they were earlier, they still are not fully balanced I believe there continues to be a significant upside risk, so I think as a substantive matter asymmetry is a better statement Also, I think Governor Blinder is right that the significance of our statement on symmetry as a signal can easily be over emphasized; I don't think it is zero We have already gotten some relatively high numbers on the core CPI, for example, in the first couple of months of this year If that continues, even if we were to move and certainly if we were not to move and let's say we were on the fence again at the next meeting, asymmetry would just be one additional piece of evidence as to the direction of our longer-term strategy and efforts I don't think the signal value is zero, and I think that is another reason for going asymmetric   Current economic conditions and near-term prospects in our District remain mixed, as they have been for the last couple of months Most of our business contacts confirm an ongoing moderation in economic activity In our region as elsewhere the softening in activity is most pronounced in consumer spending and in housing activity For example, with respect to housing in the Raleigh-Durham area, multiple listings have been running about 25 percent below their rate at this time last year and prices of residential lots have fallen a good bit recently This is a really striking change in a local area that has been booming for the last couple of years At the same time, we are seeing continuing growth and strength in at least some sectors and industries In particular, producers of chemical and paper products tell us that things are still going reasonably well, and they are optimistic about prospects for the remainder of the year--especially, interestingly enough, for exports Also, tourism, which is an increasingly important industry in our part of the country, is stronger now than it was at this time last year So, again, activity in our District is mixed I usually try to avoid using the word "mixed" in describing the economy since it is so vague, but I think that's essentially what it is in our region right now  Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook forecast is broadly in line with other forecasts that I have seen and it is certainly plausible But it is calling for an almost perfect landing,  -11-    5/23/95  a super soft landing, so one naturally has to wonder what might go wrong I see two distinct and somewhat sequential risks, if I can use that phrase, for the period ahead First, it seems to me that there is a clear, near-term downside risk The Greenbook, as everyone knows, is projecting a sharp reduction in GDP growth in the second and third quarters as producers work inventories down The risk, of course, is that the slow growth in jobs and incomes that presumably will accompany this inventory correction may frighten consumers and possibly precipitate a further reduction in spending In turn, that could induce producers to cut output further So, we could get a kind of snowballing effect such as we have had in the past, often in part because of the Fed's reluctance to allow interest rates to decline promptly enough when these kinds of conditions have arisen Historically, that has tended in at least some circumstances to short circuit the natural stabilizing properties of the price system  In any case, we all know this kind of cumulative downturn has happened before and conceivably it could happen this time and turn the inventory correction into something worse Clearly, we need to be sensitive to that risk If, however, we get through the next couple of quarters okay, including this quarter, and the expansion continues as the Greenbook projects--and frankly I think that is the more likely outcome--then as we move into the final quarter of this year and into 1996, we will face a quite different set of risks I think most people agree that the level of real GDP currently is above its longer- term potential level That might be a factor in the recent acceleration in the core inflation rate and in the continuing sharp increases in the prices of many key industrial materials The Greenbook is projecting, if I have calculated it right, that real GDP growth will average about 2-1/4 percent from now through the end of the projection horizon If that happens, actual real GDP will move down closer to its potential path As I see it, the risk is that if the average growth of GDP turns out to be higher than this projection, even moderately higher--say, because the inventory correction is milder or aggregate demand is somewhat stronger than we expect--actual GDP will approach its potential path more slowly and remain above it longer In that event we could see some considerable buildup in inflationary momentum Once that happens, it could be very difficult to break In my view, the latter scenario is still a very real possibility and it is important for us not to let the current moderation in activity and all the talk in the press and elsewhere about soft landings make us forget that risk   I certainly agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman When I made my economic statement, I pointed out that we face two risks currently--a continuing longer-term inflation risk but also a not inconsequential possibility that the current weakness in the economy may cumulate If the latter situation were in fact to materialize--again that is not what I think is going to happen but, who knows, it certainly could in the months ahead--it would be very nice for us to be in a position to react to that quickly and promptly That would be a preemptive move against recession which would be the flip side of the preemptive move we made against inflation, I think with some success, last year The problem, of course, is credibility If we were to take an action that was in any way seen as an aggressive easing move, that could do great damage to the credibility that we have built up over a long period of time at some cost That is why I think it would be very nice if we could find some longer-term nominal anchor for monetary policy in order to impress our longer-term strategic goal more firmly in the public mind We had a discussion of this a couple of meetings ago At that time I said that I thought it would be nice if we were to make an explicit announcement that we were adopting the language of the Neal Amendment as our longer-term objective I am less concerned, though, about what the form of the anchor would be than that we do something to tie that down precisely  -34-    5/23/95  so that we can deal with an increase in the downside risk--should that materialize--flexibly and effectively without giving up all of the gains we have made on the credibility side in recent years In any case, I would hope that when we get to the July meeting and we have our usual discussion of longer-term goals, we might give that point some attention   Whatever it is!   At our board meeting a couple of weeks ago, Mr Chairman, one of our directors summed up his comments on the local economic situation by saying that things were not as good as they had been, presumably back in 1994, but they were better than most people had expected when the economy began to slow earlier this year I think that remark fairly characterizes the general sentiment not only in his area but pretty much across our whole District I read that remark as offering some confirmation for your remark in your Humphrey- Hawkins testimony that we may be past the point of maximum risk in the slowdown I think it offers some support for the staff forecast-- maybe it raises the probability from zero to three or four percent or something like that! [Laughter]  There really has not been much change in conditions overall in our region since the last FOMC meeting The economy in the District continues to grow at a subdued pace, but it is growing As I have mentioned at previous meetings, we still have some pockets of very strong activity, especially in central North Carolina To a large extent that is because a number of businesses from other parts of the country have been relocating recently to that area In any  -16-    8/22/95  case, we have been told that the market for office space is extremely tight in places like Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte and that the supply of both skilled and unskilled labor is quite tight in that region The South Carolina and Virginia economies for the most part are also pretty strong, and even West Virginia is doing pretty well overall, I think in part because of some relocations from other parts of the country  The main problem in our District I guess is the opposite from your situation, Cathy The northern part of our area, the Maryland economy, is quite sluggish and, of course, the general economic situation here in the District of Columbia is very bleak because of current and prospective job losses One anecdotal comment we heard might be of some interest We are in touch with an automobile dealer in Maryland who is active not only in his own market but in one of the national dealers associations and he gets good information about the industry generally He told us recently that auto dealers had been surprised and burned three times so far this year--in January, April, and now July Because of that he thinks that dealers are going to approach the new model year with considerable caution and only order the minimum number of cars, what they need to represent the new models to the public If that turns out to be right, it could offer some confirmation to your projection, Dave, that the cutback in assemblies may extend through the third quarter and maybe shave a point or so off GDP growth in that period  More generally, the staff's near-term projections for the national economy are certainly reasonable They seem to me to be closely in line with the private consensus projections Like most other people, I think the risks are pretty balanced on the up side and the down side Back in the spring, as you may recall, we in Richmond were especially concerned about the downside risks in the outlook We are less concerned about them now, but I think we need to keep in mind that they are still there It seems to me the key is the automobile sector If the weakness we have seen in auto sales were to persist, that could extend the period of slow job growth, revive concerns about job security, and put a lid on aggregate demand But there are also upside risks, and I think they are more pronounced now than they were earlier this year with the strengthening in the economy that seems to be suggested by some of the recent data The main upside risk as I see it is that once we get past the inventory correction, assuming no unanticipated negative shocks, the economy could be operating at close to full capacity in a number of key industries and labor markets In that kind of situation with a recession having been dodged, people may have an enhanced view of job security If we were to get a situation like that, the favorable wage picture that we have been looking at in a period of relatively low unemployment could begin to dissipate The recent upward adjustment in bond rates may be reflecting that kind of concern at least to some extent and maybe to a considerable extent   Just a quick comment and a quick question The comment is that I noticed some changes in the way the Bluebook was constructed and the way you presented some of the information, which I thought was useful and constructive, Don The question I had We have had a significant backup in long-term interest rates over the intermeeting period, 35 basis points at the long end of the yield curve There wasn't a whole lot of discussion about that I interpret that backup as being in part, and maybe largely, a change in inflation expectations and psychology in the market, albeit a short- term one It's hard for me to see how real rates would move that quickly Much of this took place in a very short period of time-- shortly after the data began to come in stronger Do you see it that way?   Me, too   I have expressed my belief that we need something like this so often that I am sure you don't want to hear it all again, and I won't repeat my views in any detail today Briefly, I like this bill very much I like it both in general and with respect to its particulars, many of which Bob Parry just covered It certainly is true that we have made a lot of progress in reducing inflation over the last decade and have done so without a mandate like this I think we have every right to be proud of that achievement, but it has not been easy Basically, it has been a game of trying, by both our words and our actions to build and hold our credibility as we have gone through this period We have managed to build credibility, no doubt about it, but my own instinct is that our credibility is not  -40-    9/26/95  terribly deep and that it rests on a relatively fragile foundation through no particular fault of our own I believe Americans should think about these issues Certainly, financial market participants are well aware of the limits to the Fed's ability to pursue a price stability objective in the current institutional environment under current law Because of this, I am not sure we can ever achieve full credibility, or even reasonably full credibility, under current law The best evidence of that is what I often refer to as the periodic inflation scares in the bond markets This bill would help us to deal with this credibility problem, and I certainly hope the Committee and the System will vigorously support it  I would add just one other point, Mr Chairman Recognizing that the bill even with its current political support still faces uncertain prospects, I would not want to see us tie our own longer-run strategy too firmly to this particular bill In particular, we still need to be thinking about how we will deal with the Humphrey-Hawkins reporting problem that we are going to face whether this bill passes or not We discussed that problem a couple of meetings ago   Could I follow up on that last question? Mike, I would think that the impact on the economy of any particular budget would depend heavily on the degree of substitutability between government products and services and private-sector products and services Have you looked at that issue?   I think it's fair to say that we have not had any dramatic changes in business conditions in our District, but on balance my sense is that overall conditions in the District are a little stronger than they were at the time of our last meeting We conduct monthly surveys, as some of you may know, of activity in manufacturing, retailing, and the services sector Our manufacturing index--the last one went through August--showed a significant jump over July Shipments, orders, order backlogs, employment, and the workweek all rose appreciably according to that survey More broadly, I sense that general business confidence is increasing in our region I am not sure this greater confidence is very deep yet, but at least it's there for the time being If I were to highlight one feature of the District economic situation, I think it would be recent wage developments We have had comments on that already, and I think my comment might go a little in the other direction The manufacturing survey I just mentioned has a question about factory wages Our last survey--again for the month of August--clearly indicated significant upward pressure on wages over the last six months as a whole That survey result is reinforced by some of the anecdotal information we are hearing We had our small business council meeting last week, and typical comments came from a member from Charlotte who reported that nobody in that market was paying the minimum wage and that over the last six months entry-level wages had increased by anywhere from $50 to $100 per hour Several other members confirmed his comments I don't want to make too much of this Again, a majority of the comments along these lines were from people in the Carolinas where labor markets are exceptionally tight It appears that this phenomenon is mainly concentrated in the skilled and semi-skilled segments of the labor markets--the mechanics, construction workers, and others But the comments were very striking, and I think they are consistent with at least some of the national wage data that suggest that a gradual upward trend in the growth of wages may bear watching  With respect to the national picture, we certainly don't have any quarrel with the Greenbook forecast One of our people summed it up by saying that the economy had landed softly and the Greenbook was projecting a long runway I do believe, though, that the risk of error in the forecast has shifted perceptibly Earlier this year as you may recall, I was a bit concerned about the downside risk in the outlook Then, as we got into the late spring and early summer, it seemed to me that the risks were a little more balanced Now, I think the outlook has shifted again, and it seems to me that the risk is more on the up side than it has been for some time The economy looks pretty healthy to me right now I thought the rebound in automobile sales in August was impressive Overall consumer spending and consumer confidence, it seems to me, have been more firmly maintained in a sense than we might have anticipated a few months ago when we had lots of comments about the possibility of a recession Also, I think the recovery in housing has been exceptionally solid We got a lot of anecdotal comments to back up that view As was pointed out in the Greenbook, we may not yet have seen the full impact of earlier reductions in mortgage rates So, again, the economy looks quite solid to me at this stage It seems to me that the risks of error in  -16-    9/26/95  the forecast may have shifted a bit to the up side since our last meeting That makes me a little nervous since we are operating at close to full capacity in many industries and sectors  Finally, Mr Chairman, I'd like to make a quick comment on the fiscal situation and its bearing on the outlook I gather that anticipated fiscal restraint is a damping factor in the Greenbook's projections, and that's perfectly reasonable But I hope that we will not give this factor undue weight in our deliberations today and in the near-term future The final budget outcome is still uncertain The impact of any particular outcome on the behavior of the aggregate economy is very difficult to predict Moreover, as is often the case with monetary policy, I think there is a credibility issue here There is a real risk that if the public and especially the financial markets perceive that monetary policy is being driven to any significant degree by fiscal considerations, we could lose credibility So, I hope that we will continue to focus primarily on aggregate variables--GDP, employment, and the price level--which over time should reflect whatever impact fiscal developments are having on the aggregate economy   Mr Chairman, I support your proposal for the reasons that you mentioned, but also for some of the reasons that Tom Melzer and Bob Parry noted   I agree very much with Tom and I certainly endorse that position I wonder if I may ask a related question, Mr Chairman Is it possible that in some of our operations other than Desk operations, things like Fedwire, we might wind up inadvertently making loans to the Treasury? Has that kind of possibility been considered?   Yes In our Fedwire rules, as I understand it, we guarantee final payment at the end of the day If on the day the Treasury defaulted we guaranteed some of these payments, could we be caught at the end of the day in an overdraft position? It seems to me it is the same kind of issue I guess there is an array of possibilities   Mr Chairman, Part II of the Greenbook starts out with the statement that the recent news on the national economy is unusually "conflictive" I wasn't sure that was a word, so I looked it up and as always the staff was right It is a word and it is a good word! [Laughter] It is a good word to describe conditions in our District as well as in the country as a whole I will cite a couple of examples Furniture, as most of you probably know, is a major industry in our region, and each fall there is a so-called "furniture market" in High Point, North Carolina where all the major manufacturers and a number of major retailers come together That market was held a few weeks ago, and it was said to be the weakest in five years In sharp contrast, the CEO of a sizable chain of retail furniture stores said that his business had picked up significantly in recent weeks Elsewhere, textile and apparel manufacturers tell us that conditions in their industries have softened a great deal lately At the same time, there are pockets of substantial strength throughout the District in such diverse activities as chemical manufacturing in West Virginia, the expansion of high-tech facilities in Virginia and North Carolina, and tourism in South Carolina Commercial construction is said to be quite strong throughout the District Auto sales have softened in some places but are much stronger in other places So again, "conflictive" seems to be a good word to describe the kind of reports and information we have been getting recently  Boiling it all down, my sense is that in the aggregate conditions in our District have not really changed a great deal since the last FOMC meeting I think steady growth at a moderate pace continues to characterize our regional economy However, as Larry Lindsey reminded me at breakfast this morning, our District is more at risk than other parts of the country to any near-term shock stemming from the current fiscal situation; our region would bear a disproportionate share of such a shock One other point that might be worth mentioning about our region--it might extend beyond the region-- was brought up at a joint meeting of all three of our boards last  -29-    11/15/95  week Chairman Greenspan was there At that meeting, several bankers expressed the view that loan quality was deteriorating in our region and around the country and that loan margins generally had narrowed and competitive pressures had intensified Six or seven bankers made that sort of comment and only one took exception to it  With respect to the national economy, I have to admit that I was a bit surprised by the magnitude of the upward revision in the forecast I have been reading these Greenbooks for a long time, and this was a significant upward revision, especially if a comparison is made with the previous forecast in some of the out-quarters I think the level of real GDP at the end of 1996 is about a percent higher than it was in the September Greenbook I recognize that with the more recent retail sales figures you may revise your forecast down a bit, Mike, but I take it that on net it is going to be generally the same picture The Greenbook makes a good case for that revision Aggregate demand does appear to be significantly stronger than we thought it was not too many weeks ago Business investment, especially in computing equipment but in a lot of other things as well, is still quite robust There is still a lot of thrust in housing, and we certainly see that in much of our District The latest labor market reports, as the Greenbook mentions, suggest that income will be growing rapidly enough to sustain at least moderate growth in consumer spending in the period ahead Clearly, none of this negates the downside risks that are still there, and I think the retail sales report yesterday was a good reminder of that But it does suggest that the risks on the up side are also there and they should not be ignored  This brings me to what seems to be the main implication of the revision It moves the projected path of the economy away from one that might have seemed to be a bit below the economy's potential to a path that may be very close to potential and conceivably even a little above it This obviously has implications for the inflation outlook, and I think they show up in the projections They are not dramatic, but they are there if you look at the numbers closely In particular, as I recall, the September Greenbook showed the core CPI inflation rate gradually declining over the course of the projection period In this Greenbook, it stays almost exactly constant at 3 percent Some people might look on that as an optimistic forecast, but I think it is a move in a direction that we don't want to see Tom Hoenig and Bob Parry have made this point before I think we should be concerned if we see no further progress toward price stability until 1998 at the earliest And, obviously, with the revision in the projection, there is some risk that we could get into a situation where the inflation rate begins to drift slowly upward That prospect should be a concern and it is what struck me most in the projections   Mr Chairman, I certainly agree with your recommendation for "no change" I am not agnostic on the symmetry; I think we should have a symmetric directive The staff forecast and the revision in that forecast have made me more aware of and more sensitive to the upside risks in the outlook than perhaps I was before I think it's premature to take a position even through the symmetry of the directive as to what our next move might be I think we gained a huge amount of credibility in 1994 by preventing the strength in the economy that emerged really quite quickly in late 1993 and early 1994 from becoming a boom, and I would hate to do something now that might diminish that credibility or put it at risk  -47-    11/15/95   Under the current arrangement, we have an agreement with the Treasury that they will take us out if the Mexicans don't pay back the current drawing I may be mistaken, and this is just a point of clarification, but I seem to have read or heard somewhere that if we renew the swap line and if there is a drawing despite our current intentions, the Treasury could not make a comparable commitment to take us out in the future on such a drawing because of some piece of legislation Is that right?   I am focusing specifically on whether there could be a Treasury takeout if the current arrangement were continued and a further drawing were made   Mr Chairman, there really has not been a lot of change in the quite mixed situation in our region that I reported on at the November meeting I would have to say, however, that the broad tone of most of the anecdotal commentary we are getting is less optimistic than earlier Looking at the District's economy sector by sector, retail activity did rise somewhat in our latest monthly District survey But, anecdotally, it's described as quite sluggish Retailers express their usual concern about rising household debt and consumer reluctance to spend as a consequence of that Some of the sluggishness at the retail level is attributed to a lack of inventory, especially stocks of the more popular new model cars, but most of it  -14-    12/19/95  is attributed to diminishing demand Elsewhere, manufacturing activity, as indexed by shipments of new orders and so forth, has slipped somewhat lately The textile industry, which is a very important industry in our region, is particularly weak at the moment Finally, construction activity is very mixed in both the residential and commercial sectors in our region New construction activity in some areas like Raleigh and the Washington/Baltimore corridor is clearly strengthening, but it's very sluggish in other regions like West Virginia So, again, we see a very mixed, conflictive picture overall as I reported last month  With respect to the national economy, probably for me at least the most striking point in the Greenbook this time is its expectation that the third-quarter GDP growth rate will be revised up from the already pretty robust preliminary figure to maybe as much as 5-1/2 percent on a fixed-weight basis I guess we were supposed to get that figure this morning   I am still thinking of it in terms of those 1987 figures and that would be a much, much stronger performance than I think anyone was expecting back last summer Given that, I think a key question at this point is whether that much stronger quarterly gain will be followed by another stronger-than-anticipated performance in the current quarter Not many people seem to expect that Of course, the staff revised its 26 percent growth projection for the current quarter down to 19 percent in the current Greenbook But the Greenbook also suggests that there is plenty of upside risk in that projection, even though that risk is not getting much attention these days, and Mike underlined that very eloquently in his comments this morning In particular, as Mike said, production-worker hours have been growing at a healthy pace lately The staff is projecting hours to be up at over a 2-1/2 percent annual rate this quarter So, even a very small quarterly increase in productivity could on the old basis give us a growth rate in the current quarter of 3 percent at an annual rate or even higher We have the very real possibility, it seems to me, of two consecutive relatively strong quarters despite all the pessimistic economic commentary we read about With the economy already operating at least in the neighborhood of potential GDP, it seems to me that that should be a source of some concern  The bottom line is that there is considerable room for forecast error on either side of the staff's 19 percent projection for the current quarter From a policymaking perspective, the picture hopefully should become considerably clearer once we have some of the data for the month of December We will be getting that information not too many days down the road  One final comment It disturbs me a little that the staff is still projecting an essentially flat 3 percent inflation rate through the forecast horizon ending in 1997 I am not questioning the projection I am just stating that I don't like it very much Since 3 percent is such a mild rate compared to our experience over the last 15-20 years, I think a lot of people--not around this table--are probably fairly comfortable with that scenario But it's worth  -15-    12/19/95  remembering, if I have calculated this right, that at a 3 percent annual inflation rate the price level doubles in something like 23-1/2 or 24 years Moreover, a reasonable confidence interval around a 3 percent point forecast would certainly include at least a 3-1/2 percent rate of inflation, maybe something more than that That's not price stability I don't think we should be satisfied with it In that regard, Mr Chairman, we talked in July about the possibility of adding a longer-term inflation objective to our monetary aggregate targets to make our longer-term strategy more meaningful I would hope that we might have an opportunity to resume or reopen that discussion when we look at longer-term issues at the next meeting   Don, I just want to make sure that I understand the paradigm completely, not using the current policy issues so much as a bit of recent history I would be interested to know, within the context of this, how you would interpret our initial  -31-    12/19/95  tightening back in 1994 I would have thought of that intuitively as opportunistic As I recall, the inflation rate was not rising significantly What was happening was that bond rates were backing up Some of us at least had a sense that that indicated a rise in inflation expectations, and of course there was evidence of strength in the real economy   Mr Chairman, I won't say anything about the budget, but I might just mention the economy in passing I think your longer-term vision of what I would describe as a permanent or at least persistent positive supply shock is an appealing hypothesis and may well be a valid one But in talking about today's policy decision, I am taking a little shorter-run point of view Clearly, one can make a case for some easing this morning; I don't deny that But on the bottom line, I would come out with Cathy and Tom, as I am sure will not be surprising There are risks in taking this action now There is a risk that we may send a message, at least to some people, that we think the economy still has a good bit of room to run even though we had a very strong third quarter, and we may well find that we have a relatively strong fourth quarter when the figures come out I feel there is a risk that they could undermine our credibility at a time when we may well be on the verge of a breakthrough in our quest for price stability I mentioned in my economic statement that I think the current situation and the very short-term outlook are unusually uncertain I know one can always make the case, and sometimes it's made too frequently, to wait until the next number or the next batch of data, but to me that argument seems more compelling in this situation than normally Against that background, I think our best move today is no move The economy's strength in the third quarter, the likely possibility that we will get another strong quarter in the current quarter, and the economy's proximity to something like potential GDP all argue to me that it's better to wait at this point   The risks were definitely up   Mr Chairman, the information we are getting from our regional contacts has been decidedly more upbeat in recent weeks Both our latest District manufacturing survey and our retail service sector survey showed broad-based increases in activity for the first time in about five months Some of this news obviously reflects the rebound that occurred in February from the weather-related weakness in January, but not all of it was a rebound We have made some inquiries beyond our normal survey questions, and it seems likely    3/26/96  that at least some of the increase in the activity that we saw in February reflects a more fundamental strengthening of aggregate demand in our area This apparent firming also is evident in what I would describe as the noticeably more optimistic tone of the comments at our board meeting a couple weeks ago and at our Small Business and Agricultural Advisory Council meeting last week For example,  who is on the boards of a couple of large retail chains including one national retail chain, has been generally pessimistic about the outlook for this sector ever since  the beginning of last year a couple weeks ago, though, she said she was guardedly optimistic about the prospects for the retail sector That really got our attention since it was at variance with what she had been saying until now  who runs a multi-state building materials chain supported her assessment In fact, most with only one exception reported greater optimism in the retail sector at that meeting Elsewhere, real estate activity has been rising noticeably in most of the major urban areas of our District The housing market in Richmond is said to be the strongest in five years  Turning to the national picture, we would agree with the Greenbook's increased emphasis on the upside risk in the current outlook Obviously, we would not want to put too much store in one or two monthly economic reports The February employment report, in particular, could easily be revised downward somewhat But even if it is, I think the current situation is striking in that that report and most of the other recent monthly reports on industrial production, car sales, and other retail sales are stronger than we had anticipated That is, they are all speaking with one voice Although I would agree that we don't yet have unambiguous evidence that aggregate demand is now growing more rapidly than potential output, I think it is clear that we don't have a lot of upside headroom By all accounts, the economy has been operating for a while now somewhere in the neighborhood of nonaccelerating inflation capacity or whatever you want to call it  With respect to inflation, I am not unduly concerned yet about the uptick in the core CPI that we have seen so far this year, since it may reflect continuing seasonal adjustment problems that we have had with that series in the early months of several recent years Nor would I want to give too much weight to the recent increases in some measures of labor compensation, which were mentioned in the Greenbook But as Bob Parry just pointed out, these indicators are generally moving in the same direction That makes me nervous, especially against the background of the recent acceleration in money growth and even more especially against the background of the really spectacular rise in both intermediate- and long-term interest rates since the beginning of the year including, of course, the extraordinary 25 basis point jump in the 30-year bond rate on the day that the February employment report was released Of course, until we have an inflation-indexed bond, we are never going to know for sure, when we get a runup in rates like this, what part of it is real and what part is an increase in the inflation premium But with the economy currently operating near full capacity, that may well be a distinction without a practical difference because even if all or most of the increase were in real rates, if the economy is strong enough to push real long-term interest rates up this sharply in this brief period of time, it may not be long before that strength presses on    3/26/96  capacity with longer-term inflation consequences Indeed, if one were a pessimist on this, one could actually read the recent data as suggesting that something like this scenario may already be playing itself out Thank you   Mr Chairman, as others have said, we often evaluate the economy and the outlook in terms of risks and how they are balanced It would certainly seem that there has been some change in the balance of risks away from the downside risks toward upside risks I don't know whether we want to call it insurance or whatever, but at the last meeting I think there was a perception that the risks were more heavily balanced or tilted toward the down side than they are now That balance seems to have changed On those grounds I think we have to contemplate the possibility that we may need to reverse the move we made last month at some point in the not too distant future I certainly would not recommend doing that now I would agree with your proposal But if the data for the month of March that we will get at the beginning of next month--for example, retail sales or unemployment--show continuing strength, I think we will need to consider seriously the possibility of reversing our policy course at a fairly early date In that regard, I would point out that we have a long interval before the next FOMC meeting, which is on May 21 If we begin to get these numbers for March early in April and it appears that they are signaling continued strength, I would hope that we might have a conference call to consider how we might want to react to them   I agree with Gary Stern I think this is a nice initiative In my view, it's very important to start somewhere, and I am very glad that Don has suggested this and put it on the table I also agree with some of the other comments, though, in the sense that I think focusing in a fairly unstructured way on 1998 is not the way to go I believe we need to have a longer-term horizon I would also suggest, Don, that the staff needs to put some structure on this kind of policy discussion just as you do on our long-term policy deliberations The form that it usually takes is some set of alternatives You do that with simulations to a degree already, but I am thinking about something that would be more structured in terms of a goal That might beg some questions about what price stability is, but that's okay because we need to confront those one way or another in any case If I may be a little more specific, it might be useful, say, with a horizon that runs out to the year 2000, to flesh out how you might interpret an opportunistic strategy under certain kinds of assumptions and what that might mean in terms of some price measure like the CPI Perhaps as another alternative, you might add something that is a little more like our traditional inflation targeting with more specific numerical goals, year by year That kind of structure might allow us to get a little more quickly to some of the questions with which we really need to grapple   Thank you, Mr Chairman At the District level, the overall picture has not changed a lot since our last meeting Our regional economy is still growing at a moderate to moderate-plus pace, and I would say that growth is occurring pretty uniformly throughout the District Also, increasingly we see signs that the level of activity is high in relation to capacity levels In particular, several of our directors and other business contacts have told us about shortages of skilled labor We were getting some reports like this earlier in the year, but they are continuous now, especially with respect to skilled construction labor In that regard, we see considerable strength in both residential and commercial construction across much of the District, notably in commercial construction along the lines of Bob McTeer's comments I think a lot of the excess commercial space including office space, which was so apparent earlier in the expansion especially in the  -15-    5/21/96  northern part of our region, has now been absorbed Vacancy rates in Richmond, for example, are very low in a variety of categories of commercial space The same seems to be true in at least some parts of the Washington metropolitan area for the first time in a long time We are getting some reports of speculative construction, which we have not heard for a long time One other regional report that might be worth noting is that corporate recruiting at the three major universities in North Carolina--UNC, Duke, and North Carolina State-- was up about 20 percent this year I guess this is consistent with the view that economic activity in our region is reasonably firm  At the national level, let me first tell Mike Prell that I like the change in the format of the Greenbook I think it was a good product before and the changes make it an even better one But the content of this month's reported projection worries me a good bit The Greenbook paints a picture--and I think a generally accurate picture--of an economy that is in a mature stage of a business expansion and growing at a firm pace in the neighborhood of capacity levels with all of the inflationary risk that that entails Let me make just a couple of comments on this First, it seems clear as a number of people have already suggested that aggregate final demand is considerably stronger currently than one might have anticipated a few months ago The first-quarter GDP report was very revealing It showed remarkable strength across the board, and I think that was really the key feature Second, the numbers Cathy Minehan, Bob Parry, and a number of other people have already mentioned permit a very strong case to be made now that the risks in the outlook have shifted decidedly to the upside for both real growth and inflation The Greenbook is now projecting 3-1/2 percent real GDP growth in the current quarter About a percentage point of that, as I understand it, would be in productivity growth and about 2-1/2 percent in an increase in hours worked, which is well above a sustainable noninflationary pace Moreover, the stronger projected growth in GDP this quarter is predicated primarily on stronger inventory investment The projection for growth in final demand actually shows a deceleration from the first quarter If that does not happen, the current quarter could turn out to be very robust, with the implication of increasing tightness in an already tight labor market situation In addition, there are the current problems that have already been mentioned with respect to prospective energy and food prices and the possibility of an increase in the minimum wage  I think any one of these problems could be managed, but when they are all put together, that raises some real questions about the outlook The Greenbook scenario to a large extent is counting on the runup in long-term interest rates to moderate the growth in final demand as we move into the second half of the year The basis for this, as I understand it, is that real long-term rates are being driven up by the cyclical strength in the economy By pushing real long rates up, market forces can in that way be counted on to contain demand and bring it back to trend What worries me is that the discussion in the Greenbook gives the impression, maybe not intentionally, that all of this can happen without an increase in short-term rates But as the first chart in the Bluebook makes clear, the backup in long-term rates seems at this stage to be due to a rise in 1-year forward rates concentrated maybe 1 to 3 years out In other words, it looks like a significant part of the increase in long-term rates has been driven by the expectation in markets that the Fed is  -16-    5/21/96  going to raise short rates by at least a moderate amount either late this year or maybe early next year   Certainly, it is partly that, but if you look at the--   Well, I think both elements probably are involved If you look at the first chart in the Bluebook, the middle panel there, I am trying to draw an inference from that What it suggests to me at least is that expectations for short rates may be pretty flat through, say, the third quarter, but after that, if one looks at Treasury yield curves, I think they are showing an expectation of a tightening of policy late this year--   Well, I would certainly agree that it is always difficult to read the term structure and draw precise inferences from it We tried to look at this pretty carefully, and as I look at the entire structure, it seems to suggest that general expectations--and I think this has been confirmed in some of the documentation--are that we are going to hold policy pretty steady at least through the third quarter and move after that The only point I am trying to make is that the behavior of long rates--and in the overall scenario long rates are a major factor in containing demand in the future--may be more closely related to policy expectations than to fundamental economic conditions If that is the case, then it follows that we can't be sure whether the increase in bond rates that has occurred will necessarily contain demand and inflationary pressures to the degree that we want   I have a tough time in all debates, but I would still be willing to debate this! [Laughter] In any case, I think it raises some questions about whether holding short-term rates relatively constant over the remainder of the year is going to get us where we need to go, or whether we need to consider something stronger  -17-    5/21/96   I will try to help keep him awake as much as I can! [Laughter]   I agree strongly with Tom Melzer and Bob Parry and I am sure that will not surprise anybody I guess my views on policy at this stage are predicated on a couple of things, Mr Chairman First, the long-term goal is price stability The staff is now projecting an increase in the inflation rate next year I think it is a credible forecast and it means that inflation is moving in the wrong direction Second, I know there are risks on both sides of this forecast; there always are But it seems to me that what we heard around the table this morning suggests that the risk definitely has shifted, in my view at least, to the up side given the strength in demand, price shocks in the energy and food sectors, and a possible increase in the minimum wage  Despite the apparent divergence in our views about interest rates earlier in the meeting, I think we would agree, and I think most observers would agree, that the markets are not expecting a very  -32-    5/21/96  pronounced tightening of monetary policy, at least in the near-term future--over the next two or three months I find that a little intriguing because, given all that is going on and the clear change in the tone of the economy, one might expect market participants to anticipate somewhat more aggressive policy moves There may be several reasons for this One explanation might be that market participants are expecting us to be somewhat more hesitant in this period of the political cycle Partly because of this, and given the underlying inflation risks and the upside risks in the outlook for economic growth that I and others mentioned earlier, I think we should raise the funds rate today I would prefer or recommend a 1/4 point increase Even though it is a change in the direction of policy, it seems unlikely to me that an increase that modest would do any significant damage to real economic activity, although there would be some real cost I think the increased credibility flowing from such an action would hold down inflationary expectations and maybe reduce the amount of the increase we would have to engineer later in the cycle to contain inflation   I was going to make basically the same point that Jerry Jordan did, Mr Chairman I understand the timing problem currently, but I think Larry Lindsey is right It is very difficult to find a convenient time to do this I am concerned that we are going to continue to drift with this issue, and I was happy to hear your response to Jerry's question Two years is a long time down the road Maybe we can take an opportunistic approach to this issue as well [Laughter] If there is an opportunity and circumstances change  -7-    8/20/96  or it looks as if we might be able to make progress sooner, I would not hesitate to do that   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Beigebook summary this time starts off with a statement that the national economy continued to expand in June and July, but it points out that there was some slowing in some areas and in some sectors I think that characterization describes reasonably well what is going on in our region There are signs of slower growth in some sectors over the last month or so For example, the growth of consumer outlays for durable goods other than automobiles appears to have decelerated a  -13-    8/20/96  bit, and there is some evidence from one of our regular monthly surveys that the pace of manufacturing activity is a little softer than it was earlier But I would emphasize that this moderation in growth is still a pretty tentative development at this point At least in our region, it may reflect in part the unusually wet summer we have had At this point, it is not at all clear how long this trend will persist, if it persists at all Moreover, I would make the point that it is a moderation from a very robust rate of expansion in the second quarter, as I know was the case in many other regions of the country Overall, most of the comments we hear from our directors and other business contacts are still mainly upbeat They suggest that District business activity has settled into a groove at a very high level of activity even if there has been some deceleration in the rate of growth recently There are still pockets of very robust activity in certain parts and sectors of the District For example, on the commercial real estate side, the market for Class A office space is very tight here in the Washington metropolitan area Whatever may be happening to housing nationally, residential construction is really booming in West Virginia and there are a couple of very large resort and hotel projects under way in that state Again, the bottom line is some moderation in the rate of growth in the District, but the level of activity is still very high  I emphasize this point about the level of District activity because that, it seems to me, is where our focus ought to be in looking at the national picture this morning Given the greater-than- expected growth of the economy in the first half, it seems to me that the level of activity nationally is really quite high It is reflected in a number of ways, of course, but it is especially apparent in the tightness of labor markets and the recent behavior of wages Consequently, even if the growth of aggregate demand decelerates in the period ahead, as the staff points out in the very first paragraph of the Greenbook and Mike Prell has repeated again this morning, the pressure on resources is still likely to push the trend rate of inflation up a bit, perhaps to above 3 percent over the projection period  To me, that is the central feature in the economic outlook that we really need to focus on most closely at this juncture If we get an outcome like that, it will be inconsistent with our public commitment to hold the line on inflation Moreover, as I understood the discussion that we had at the last meeting about our longer-term price objective, while there was some disagreement around the table as to whether we should try to push the trend inflation rate below 2 percent, there was general agreement that we ought to move in that direction, and this projection is saying that inflation is going to be moving in the opposite direction It is true, of course, that the latest incoming data suggest that the economy may be slowing somewhat from the second-quarter pace In particular, as we all know, employment grew more slowly in July, but as was mentioned this morning, there certainly are signs of strength in some of the data Initial claims are at a very low level in recent weeks, as Mike pointed out The Greenbook is projecting a third-quarter gain in aggregate hours at a 2 percent rate That's lower than the second- quarter pace but it's still above trend, which means that labor markets are likely to tighten a bit further Tighter labor markets in turn could foster greater job security, and that raises some questions about the extent and duration of the current softening in consumer  -14-    8/20/96  spending But whatever the outlook may be and whatever the debate may be about that outlook, the main point seems to me to be that even if we do get a fairly sustained and marked deceleration in growth, we still have an inflation risk that we need to be aware of and come to grips with  One final comment about wages I think we ought to be quite concerned about the first-half pickup in the ECI One can interpret that pickup in several ways I am inclined to interpret it as a fairly straightforward bit of additional evidence that underlying inflation pressures may be increasing at least to some extent Obviously, an increase in wages is not inflationary if productivity is rising Like Gary Stern, I hear a lot of anecdotal comments that suggest productivity may be rising, but it seems to me that we do not yet have any really compelling evidence that the trend rate of productivity is rising I guess it is also possible, along the lines of the argument in Governor Yellen's paper that was distributed at the last meeting, that the increase in the ECI reflects a corresponding increase in the equilibrium real wage, perhaps because workers are more secure in their jobs now than they were before If that is happening, then obviously that would not be inflationary in and of itself But in my view it would still constitute an inflation risk since firms will try at some point to push those wage increases through to higher prices if they can get away with it They will refrain from doing so only if they are forced ultimately to absorb the increases For my money, that is where the Fed and its credibility come in I think we need to insure that our policy stance will maintain a pricing environment that is hostile to such pass-throughs I think we need to send the same message that a famous resident in Bob Parry's District, Clint Eastwood, used to send, "don't even think about it" [Laughter] Thank you   Economic activity in our District has continued to expand at a reasonably steady pace over the period since our last meeting There does appear to have been some moderation in the rate of growth of household spending and also in residential construction activity in some parts of our region from their very strong pace in the first half of the year But our latest regular survey of manufacturing indicates that factory activity rebounded very sharply in the latter part of the summer from its somewhat sluggish performance earlier in the summer Shipments, new orders, employment, and the average workweek have all been rising in that sector Also, as noted in our Beigebook report and picking up on a comment that Mike Prell made, commercial real estate activity clearly has strengthened through most of our region as vacancy rates have declined and rental rates have crept up The improvement is not so apparent in the Washington metropolitan area, but it is very evident in the southern part of the District in particular  Probably the most striking aspect of the recent regional information--and I suspect this is true around the country--is the persistent and increasingly widespread reports of very tight labor market conditions We, too, had a meeting last week of our small business and agricultural advisory committee and all five small business representatives who attended reported some difficulty in attracting workers despite fairly sizable wage increases in some cases We continue to get similar comments from the directors on all of our boards and in response to our periodic surveys Recently and interestingly, there have been more complaints especially from construction firms and employment agencies about the difficulty of finding suitable unskilled and semi-skilled workers There are people out there, but many of them have very little job experience and in some cases very little schooling As a result, their productivity is quite low and firms are reluctant to hire them in light of the potential costs of doing so Given this situation, some of our contacts have told us that local labor markets are really tighter in many cases than the already low state and local unemployment rates might suggest One other indication of tight labor markets comes from state reports of withheld taxes; I think the latter are running higher in all of our states and jurisdictions than had been projected earlier in the year    9/24/96  Finally, Hurricane Fran hit our region pretty hard I remember looking at the radar weather report, and at one point the clouds were coterminous with the boundaries of my District North Carolina was especially hard hit; the damage there is estimated somewhere in the neighborhood of $3-1/2 billion and the majority of it, though not all by any means, was to private residences Repairing that damage is going to spur activity in a local area that is already operating at a very high level of economic activity in relation to capacity  I do not have a lot to say about the national picture beyond what I have been saying for the last couple of meetings and that already has been noted by Jerry and others The Greenbook projection continues to reflect the view that monetary policy is now restrictive enough to foster a deceleration in real GDP growth to its long-term potential, and then to maintain such growth pretty much indefinitely In this environment, core inflation moves up fairly modestly to about 3 percent in 1997 and holds there in 1998 Maybe this will happen, but my feeling is that it is hardly a sure thing, and I continue to think that there are significant upside risks on both the real side and the inflation side in the current projection period   Mr Chairman, I recognize that there are cogent arguments on both sides of this difficult policy issue But after sorting it all out, the basic message for me is the one contained in the Greenbook projection--that labor markets are currently tight enough to put continuing upward pressure on wages, which may eventually feed into prices This is certainly consistent with what we are seeing in our District I agree with the staff's projection that if there is no change in policy, it is highly likely that we will see at least a moderate increase in inflation My own view is that the risk of error in that projection is skewed to the up side So, for me that certainly constitutes an inflation danger zone In this situation, I agree with Bob Parry I continue to believe that the Committee should act promptly and firmly to reduce these risks and  -33-    9/24/96  to hold the line on inflation Building on one of your comments, my own concern is that if we wait to see profit margins declining, I do not know where that will put us in the cycle or how much we would be behind the curve So, I would agree with Bob in favoring a tightening of policy today I certainly agree with you that when we do move, 1/2 point is the right dose   I would like to second that [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, activity at the regional level in our District, as elsewhere in the country, has decelerated pretty much across the board In particular, residential construction recently has softened noticeably Our most recent monthly surveys, though, do suggest a bit of a rebound lately in both the service and the manufacturing sectors It is our sense that despite the deceleration, these sectors are still relatively firm overall, with a few exceptions like textiles and apparel In addition, labor markets in our region remain tight according to the information that we have, and wage pressures are still evident in at least some local markets, although here as elsewhere these conditions have produced only scattered increases in prices at this point  In general, I think it is fair to say that households and businesses in our region remain reasonably confident that the expansion is going to continue for the foreseeable future One manifestation of this is continued, quite marked strength in commercial real estate along the lines of Cathy Minehan's comments Mike Moskow mentioned that as well As we pointed out in our Beigebook report, vacancy rates have fallen and rental rates have risen in many parts of the District, and we see at least some new construction activity In Charlotte and northern Virginia particularly, we see a lot of strength in the commercial real estate sector  Turning to the national picture, I think the third-quarter GDP report and the recent monthly data are quite encouraging on balance because they suggest that the economy is now moving back to a more sustainable growth path At a minimum, it seems clear that the very rapid and obviously unsustainable growth rate in the second quarter is not going to persist Moreover, and for me this is probably the single most encouraging development, the recent drop in long-term interest rates suggests that inflation expectations have diminished in a material way at least for now  Finally, employment growth has moved back closer to the trend growth in the labor force, and while labor markets remain tight, they may not be tightening further at present All in all, I think it is a considerably improved and encouraging picture As you know, I was not at all confident that we would get this kind of outcome without some additional restraint before now on our part I am happy that things have worked out this way, at least for the time being  Looking ahead, as others already have noted, the risks of error in the staff's projections are more balanced now than they were I did not think that there was any significant downside risk until recently, but final demand especially for households was very weak in the third quarter I don't think we understand this weakness or the  -10-    11/13/96  related increase in the saving rate very clearly at this point It may just be noise, and that is my guess, but we cannot rule out the possibility that something more is going on, and we need to be sensitive to that possibility  Having said all this, I do believe, like Mike Moskow, that the balance of risks is still skewed to the up side on both growth and inflation, if somewhat less dramatically than earlier It is certainly possible that we could experience a poor holiday selling season and that consumer demand could remain weak going forward But this outcome seems unlikely to me given what we know about the solid growth in jobs and incomes, continued high consumer confidence, and the behavior of the stock market Also, the overall level of activity seems to remain high According to all of the information that I see, labor markets are still quite tight The Greenbook, after all, is still projecting a modest but steady increase in the ECI over the projection period and also in the core CPI, especially abstracting from the reweighting of the index So, again, I think the risks remain weighted to the up side Also, even though the upside risk seems to be diminishing somewhat, as I see it there is precious little margin for error in that direction We are still at a very high level of activity, and if we see any significant increase in aggregate demand in the near term, that could get us back into trouble in a hurry So, bottom line, we need to remain vigilant   Mr Chairman, it is obvious from the discussion around the table today, the latest economic data, and I think particularly the behavior of bond rates that the risk of a pronounced near-term increase in inflation pressures has diminished So, I no longer think that we need a 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate But I still think it is more likely than not that somewhat greater restraint is going to be needed at some point in the relatively near future if we are going to contain inflation over the longer haul Beyond this, the Greenbook's projections for the core CPI over the next couple of years suggest that at best we are going to hold the line on inflation, and that is only with the help of the reweighting of the index The projections do not show any further progress toward our basic longer-term price stability goal And if that were the actual outcome over the next couple of years, the credibility of our longer-term strategy could be reduced, at least to some degree  For all these reasons, Mr Chairman, I would still favor a 1/4 point increase in the funds rate today Any tightening now obviously would surprise the markets I recognize that that could have near-term consequences, but I think it could well help us over the longer run In particular, I worry about the possibility of a scenario developing next year where we finally begin to see some discernible upward drift in the inflation rate at a time when the unemployment rate may be moving up to a more sustainable, longer-term level In that circumstance, I think it would be quite difficult to make a move toward restraint I feel a modest move now could help keep us out of that trap   Peter, just to get a little better handle on the magnitude of the benefits, do you have any sense as to whether the variance per day around the average effective fed funds target rate is greater in recent years? Are you having more trouble hitting your target in some sense?   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in our District have not not changed very much in the period since our last meeting Growth overall remained relatively moderate compared to earlier in the year Most of the anecdotal information that we get from our directors and others suggests a more moderate tone than earlier We see sluggish conditions in some sectors As Jack Guynn reported for the Atlanta District, housing in our region clearly has been more sluggish lately and that is fairly recent information So, it is a little out of line with the published data for November that you mentioned earlier, Mike At the same time, labor markets remain exceptionally tight in our region We hear that from virtually everyone--directors, other business contacts, just about anybody we talk to It appears that the tightness is perhaps greatest right here in the Washington metro area We are told that the inflow of new workers into the labor force here has slowed significantly Business at temp agencies for both skilled and unskilled labor in this area is booming, and again we are told that the supply of new workers has been constrained We see evidence of tight labor markets just about everywhere Yesterday, when Marvin Goodfriend and I were driving up Interstate 95 from Richmond, my eyes happened to fall on a mudflap of an 18-wheeler ahead of me, and they were advertising for truck drivers I have the number if anybody would like it! [Laughter]  At the national level, we have no strong reason to disagree with the Greenbook's forecast that real GDP will grow at a rate somewhere near its longer-term trend and that CPI inflation will remain moderate at a little under 3 percent, at least with the help of the recent technical adjustments to that index In the Greenbook scenario, the unemployment rate stays near 5-1/4 percent, with the continuation of only a gradual rise in hourly workers' compensation along the lines of what we have seen recently Not very long ago, an unemployment rate this low would have been accompanied by expectations of greater upward pressures on both wages and prices, and I have to confess to a little nervousness on this score But I think the staff is right in pointing in particular to the considerable capacity that exists in a number of manufacturing industries We see that in textiles and furniture in our District And while I am not ready to uncross my fingers yet, I think the near-term risks in the Greenbook projections are more balanced than they were 3 months or so ago, especially on the inflation side Some of the points that Bob Parry made are very relevant here In a sense, the picture might even be brighter in view of the emerging consensus that the CPI overstates actual inflation by something like a percentage point With both the overall CPI and the core CPI projected by the Greenbook to remain below 3 percent in 1997 and 1998, this would imply that the underlying true inflation rate is in some sense closer to 2 percent, which would mean that we may be closing in on price stability at least after help from those technical adjustments  Having said all of that and before anyone concludes that I have become complacent about inflation--[Laughter]  -18-    12/17/96  SPEAKER (?) You are ready to declare victory?   I am not ready to do that In a very important sense, and this is really the main point I want to make, I think we still have some distance to go before we can be comfortable that we have achieved price stability in the way we have defined it The old Neal Resolution language, which we endorsed, defines price stability as a condition where expectations of future inflation do not play a significant role in economic decision-making I think one of the best indicators of inflation expectations is the long-term bond rate That rate averaged around 3-1/2 percent in the late 1950s and about 4 percent in the early 1960s when the CPI inflation rate was in a range of 1/2 percent to 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate Today the long-term bond rate is at 6-1/2 percent, about the midpoint of its recent range between a little below 6 percent and a little over 7 percent There is not a lot of reason to think that the real long- term bond rate is much different now than it was in the earlier period when it appeared to average around 3 percent That seems to be generally consistent with the surveys depicted in the Bluebook, which suggest that long-term inflation expectations are still on the order of 3-1/2 percent today Alternatively, if we compare nominal rates in the earlier period with nominal rates today and attribute most of the difference to inflation expectations between the two periods, the implication would be that inflation expectations are anywhere from 2- 1/2 to 3 percentage points higher today than they were in the late 1950s and early 1960s Beyond that, the volatility of bond rates is a lot greater than it was in the earlier period and that volatility almost certainly reflects, at least to some extent, more volatile inflation expectations  So, Mr Chairman, I would conclude that we are still some distance from achieving price stability in the Neal Resolution sense, and I think we need to remain vigilant going forward   Mr Chairman, as I said earlier I think the risks are more balanced now Because of that I do not believe the need to tighten our short-term policy stance is as urgent as it was earlier and I would accept your recommendation, although if you had recommended a slight snugging, my opposition would have been less than heated [Laughter]  I would like to make one other quick comment that is very much in the spirit of what Tom Melzer and Jerry Jordan said during the economic go-around Our next meeting is a Humphrey-Hawkins meeting where we once again have an opportunity to look at our longer-term strategy I hope we will take that oppportunity to sharpen our strategy perhaps a little and communicate it even more concretely than we have This, it seems to me, is an appropriate time to do that since, with the Boskin Committee report, there now is an emerging consensus on the magnitude of the bias in the CPI It has always struck me as a little ironic or at least curious that at these Humphrey-Hawkins meetings we all submit a forecast for inflation for one year out and then just stop there Obviously, the Fed can control the inflation rate over a reasonable time period, so we cannot help but ask ourselves why we do not just set out a multiyear path to full price stability that we expect to follow over some sensible time period, state it publicly, and then pursue it Or at a minimum along the lines of Tom Melzer's comment earlier, we could state explicitly that we will not tolerate a backup in the inflation rate to a level over 3 percent If I am not mistaken, we briefly discussed the possibility of doing something like that at our last Humphrey-Hawkins meeting, and I would hope that we would consider it again at the next meeting in February I think this is the time to do it while the current inflation rate is relatively low If we lock in the currently low level of the inflation rate, I think that will position us to make some further progress on the expectations side, which seems to me to be the big thing now   Mr Chairman, the Fifth District economy continues a healthy  advance Labor markets remain exceedingly tight throughout most of the District, especially    3/25/97  in some of the booming areas of the southern part of the District in the Carolinas along  Interstate 85 Wages for skilled labor in that part of our District have been moving up  gradually for some time We now hear more reports of pay increases for unskilled workers  In Charlotte, for example, hourly pay for entry-level unskilled workers has risen about a  dollar over the last year to a range of 7 to 8 dollars on average currently Elsewhere, both  residential and commercial real estate and construction activity are rising sharply On the  commercial side in particular, we see very low vacancy rates and rising rents in some areas  That is especially the case in suburban areas, but to some extent we see it in central city areas  as well Most of the other anecdotal information we have received recently is consistent with  what appears to be happening in other parts of the country Consumer spending clearly  seems to have accelerated in recent weeks With respect to prices, although labor and other  costs are rising, there is relatively little talk of imminent price increases in most of the  comments that we hear Indeed, at their last meeting, several of our directors went out of  their way to say that there was a general absence of pricing power in most markets with  which they were familiar  There are nonetheless a few straws in the wind One director mentioned that  recent increases in trucking fees were beginning to stick for the first time in a while  who runs a large farm equipment dealership told me  that his major supplier, John Deere, is no longer guaranteeing prices for items that will be  delivered later in the year But those types of comments are still the exception rather than the  rule  Turning to the national picture, it is hard, for me at least, not to be impressed by  the current across-the-board momentum in the economy As you already mentioned this    3/25/97  morning, Mike, and as the Greenbook points out, the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index  is now at its highest level since 1965 That started me thinking a little about 1965; it was a  good year for the economy At the time, Arthur Okun described the situation as "the  promised land of 4 percent unemployment with no compelling evidence of accelerating  wages and prices or stress in financial markets" In hindsight, of course, we know that 1965  was the year in which inflation really began to take off The inflation rate was below 2  percent in 1965; it rose to over 3 percent in 1966 and subsequently to over 6 percent by the  end of the decade  Obviously, there are significant differences between 1965 and 1997, not the least  of which is our greater commitment, I believe, to contain inflation and resist inflationary  pressures and the greater credibility that goes along with it But I think there also are some  striking parallels between the situation in 1965, at least early in that year, and what we are  facing now As in 1965, the economy is now operating at a very high level and it strikes me  as being quite vulnerable to upside shocks In the 1960s, of course, the shock ultimately took  the form of the Vietnam military buildup The most likely shock, if that is the right word, in  1997 would be a more subtle process It would involve a kind of circular process where  increased spending generates increases in jobs, which generate increases in income, which  encourage further spending, and so forth I think a key feature of policy in 1965 was that the  magnitude of the upside risk was not appreciated by the policymaking establishment as a  whole as we went into that year In the current situation, I worry that the public, as  represented by the industrialist who sat next to Mike Prell, does not adequately appreciate the  extent of the current upside risk, mainly because of the damping effect of three temporary  factors on wage and price behavior These are the job insecurity that the Chairman has    3/25/97  emphasized in his recent public comments, increased labor force participation, which always  occurs at this point of the cyclical expansion but which I think is greater now than is  normally the case, and the strong dollar  Let me make just a quick comment on each of those As you said, Mr Chairman,  once the downward adjustment of real wages to the increase in job insecurity is complete, we  would expect the usual impact of tight labor markets on wages to reassert itself  Furthermore, if labor markets remain as tight as they are now for any extended period in the  future, at some point workers are not going to feel insecure any longer When that happens,  we could see the usual short-run Phillips-curve effect reassert itself just as the restraining  impact of job insecurity begins to unwind We will then have two forces working on the cost  side and a considerable upside risk from that direction Similarly, tight labor markets  encourage greater labor force participation because job search costs are lower and wages are  higher Sooner or later, that effect will dissipate even if demand remains strong Here again,  greater labor force participation can only delay the emergence of inflationary pressures, not  prevent them Finally, the restraint from foreign competition on US inflation can work  only so long as the dollar remains strong and does not depreciate significantly This, of  course, turns on the ability of the United States to continue to attract capital inflows I think  we have been lucky on this front over the course of the last several quarters in that our  economy has been quite strong compared to the economies of other major industrial nations  Obviously, that situation could change If growth in Japan and Europe were to begin to  accelerate, we could have some weakening of the dollar  The bottom line as I see it, Mr Chairman, is that I do not think the foundation for  our favorable macroeconomic performance is very solid or secure at this stage We need to    3/25/97  do all we can with monetary policy to reinforce that performance I think we have been  pushing our luck with monetary policy in recent months We could do this because we had  built a lot of credibility in 1994, but I would not want to see us push our luck much further   Mr Chairman, I can accept your recommendation On  balance, I think the case for a larger move is stronger than indicated by others who have  spoken to this point But I am satisfied with 1/4 point It is a way of getting back into the  ballgame, so to speak, and reaffirming our longer-term commitment to price stability I do  think, as you suggested, that this move very likely will not be our last and that we will have  to tighten further And I see a good chance that the tightening may happen sooner rather than  later, perhaps before the May meeting I hope we will move promptly if we need to do so  In that context, I would prefer an asymmetric directive because I think the situation even  after a 1/4 point increase is still going to be asymmetric The issue is not a deal breaker for  me, but I have more than a marginal preference for asymmetry  If I could add one other hopefully preemptive point In this situation, I think there  is some possibility the dollar could strengthen I am not predicting that, but I think it is    3/25/97  possible If it should, I hope we will resist the temptation to engage in any foreign exchange  market intervention because I think that would dilute the signal we want to send with this  move   Mr Chairman, I will start this comment off the same way I  started my comments at the last several meetings Economic activity in the Fifth District is  still very strong The survey readings for our manufacturing and services sectors did slip a  little in April, but they remained very close to the high levels to which they had jumped in  March This indicated a rate of expansion in our region that we had not seen since the first  half of 1994 Moreover, our directors and other contacts suggest little, if any, softening in  demand Labor markets remain very tight The demand for lower skilled labor continues to  increase at a substantial rate Despite some reports of rising wages recently in some parts of  the District, we have had fewer reports of price pass-throughs in the last several weeks than  we were getting a little earlier this year and that I reported on earlier  The most striking new development in the District is something that fits in with  what Mike Prell said about commercial real estate In our real estate markets, especially in  northern Virginia, we are told that rental rates for industrial and office space have now gotten  back to the peaks that they reached in 1989 Also for the first time in this expansion, we are  getting increasing reports of speculative building, especially of office buildings in northern  Virginia  Turning to the national picture, the Greenbook projects that real GDP growth will  slow of its own accord in coming months Certainly given the extraordinary growth we have  seen in the last couple of quarters, some slowing seems likely But as I see it, nothing in the  fundamentals really assures us that the rate of expansion is going to slow to trend That  obviously is what needs to happen if we are going to avoid a boom I think that is the point  Jerry Jordan was making in his question earlier On the contrary, the staff candidly    5/20/97  recognizes in its write-up that household fundamentals and general economic fundamentals  remain exceptionally strong I continue to see some significant upside risk in the outlook  The projected deceleration reflects in considerable part reduced inventory building after the  big run-up in the last quarter, as Mike Prell emphasized In this regard, the Greenbook  authors do not seem to be concerned that a constrained availability of supplies will generate a  precautionary demand for inventories at this time as it did in 1994 That conclusion may be  right, but if it is, the interesting question is why Maybe firms wanted extra stocks in 1994  because they were not sure that monetary policy would do what was needed to contain the  expansion Maybe they have more confidence in us this year, and if that is the case, I think  that would underscore the important role our own credibility needs to play in generating and  reinforcing the sustained moderation in economic activity the staff is projecting In any case,  I think stock building needs to be counted as an upside risk in the near-term outlook  Another considerable upside risk in the Greenbook forecast is that the projected  increase in the labor force participation rate will not happen The Greenbook is projecting a  real GDP growth rate of 31 percent for 1997, and that is expected to take the unemployment  rate down to 48 percent by the end of the year, leaving it around that level through 1998 If  such a rate is sustained for that long, it could in itself create capacity problems If the  expected further increase in labor force participation does not occur and we still get the  predicted growth, obviously the unemployment rate could be driven even lower Given the  relatively moderate increase in productivity the staff has forecast, I think Mike Prell made the  point that payroll employment has to rise 2 percent to generate the 3 percent growth  projected for this year That is twice the longer-term trend growth in the labor force  Increased participation may bail us out It bailed us out last year; maybe it will do it this    5/20/97  year, but then again maybe it won't Of course, an alternative possibility is that productivity  will rise more rapidly this year than the 12 percent increase the staff is projecting because  the trend rate may have moved up to 2 percent or so, as a number of economists and others  are arguing  Let me conclude with just a couple of brief remarks about what this alternative  scenario might imply for aggregate demand and interest rates This is a little  counter-intuitive, but I think even this possibility involves an upside risk Let us suppose that  markets are confident that the Fed will conduct policy so as to hold the CPI increase to a rate  of 3 percent this year and that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent--that that is not  an issue Let us assume in that environment that the productivity trend increases What  does that do to financial markets and specifically to real interest rates? Broadly speaking, the  improved productivity trend is going to cause firms to expect higher future earnings and  workers to expect higher future wages The point that needs to be emphasized in this  situation is that, at the existing level of real interest rates, businesses and households are  going to want to bring some of that expected future income into the present Workers may  want to fix up their houses; business firms may want to invest in new plant and equipment;  and they will try to do this by borrowing against expected future increases in income But, of  course, the economy does not have the future income and output yet so real interest rates  have to rise in order to restrain this new demand for credit In effect, the higher real rates  raise the price of current consumption in terms of future consumption foregone so that firms  and households will be content to wait until the economy actually has the output in hand  before they try to consume it The point of the story is--and this is the bottom line--that even  if the productivity trend turns out to be higher than the staff is assuming, which would    5/20/97  remove some of the inflationary risk stemming from the labor markets, real interest rates  would still need to rise to prevent a further credit-driven increase in aggregate demand  In sum, Mr Chairman, I see considerable upside risk in the staff forecast, and I  think we need to be in the market for a little more insurance   This has been a tough meeting, Mr Chairman, but I think a  very good one with a lot of constructive comments Early in the meeting, Jerry Jordan    5/20/97  summed it up best for me when he said that the choice may well be between moving a little  now and moving a lot more later on Let me make a couple of observations  We all recognize that there are significant upside risks To repeat what  everybody else has said, for me the key upside risk is that the expansion may not slow to  trend as projected The problem is, of course, that we are not going to know this for sure If  we find out that growth is well above trend at some point down the road, we could find  ourselves in a box with some very, very difficult choices There has been a lot of focus on  uncertainty in the commentary around the table, and there certainly is a great deal of  uncertainty I agree with Bill McDonough that greater uncertainty should induce greater  caution, but I think we need to be very careful not to let uncertainty paralyze us I have been  attending these meetings off and on since 1973 and there is always a lot of uncertainty  There may be a little more of it than the average at this meeting but in my experience not that  much more  With respect to productivity, I am glad that you have highlighted it today, Mr  Chairman I think you are providing a very useful service not only to the Committee but to  the country in emphasizing that we may well be in the midst of a significant increase in trend  productivity growth Again, as far as the short run is concerned, that does not necessarily  mean that nominal rates need to go up, but it certainly does imply that real rates need to  increase That is another factor in my thinking  As always, policy is a matter of balancing the risks Let me tell you that I  recognize the risk in moving today But I think there is also a substantial risk, in my view a  greater risk, if we do not move now I would reiterate the point Tom Melzer made about our  longer-term goal of price stability We certainly need to keep it in mind as we go forward    5/20/97  Someone mentioned today that the core CPI is flat; actually the growth rate is flat but the  index itself is still moving up We should not lose track of our longer-term goal If we are  going to try to make progress toward that goal, this is a very good time to try to achieve it  I think we need to move today This is not the beginning of 1994 The funds rate  is already at 5-1/2 percent, so I am not saying we need to make a terribly robust move, but I  believe that a 1/4 percentage move would be appropriate today   Thank you, Mr Chairman The central question on the economy  that we face this morning is much the same as the question we faced at the last meeting and at  earlier meetings Is demand reviving as we move into the third quarter or not? At our Bank, we  tried to analyze the recent information and data that we have received as closely as we could in the  context of that question Our sense is that activity did pick up fairly markedly in our region in June  and July, especially in the retail and services sectors As some of you may know, we conduct a  couple of monthly surveys, one on the manufacturing sector and one on services and retail In July,  our indexes for service-sector employment and wages both posted their strongest gains since we  started putting these indexes together about four years ago The results of the latest manufacturing  survey were less robust overall, but there are some indications in that survey of firmer wages at  plants and factories Prices for finished goods and manufacturing inputs are up about a percentage  point from the almost negligible increases that had been registered consistently for about 18 months  or so before this Overall, we do not see any signs of significant weakness in our regional    8/19/97  economy; even West Virginia is doing well On the contrary, we are impressed by the basically  across-the-board indications of stronger activity and at least some modest upward pressure on both  wages and prices  On the national picture, the Greenbook projection is certainly reasonable Like a number  of others around the table, we still think that the risk of error in the projection is moderately tilted to  the upside The major reports that we have received since early July--the jobs report, the  Purchasing Managers' Survey, the reports on retail sales and automobile sales--all suggest, at least  to me, that the economy is poised to put some additional upward pressure on our labor resources  I was especially interested and happy to see that this month's Greenbook and Bluebook  both included for the first time charts comparing the regular 10-year Treasury rate with the rate on  the new inflation-indexed note The first page of the Bluebook interprets the gap between the two  yields as a reflection of longer-term inflation expectations I hope the staff will continue to provide  that information As we gain more experience with it, I think it will be useful in both our economic  analysis and our policy analysis As many of you know, it has been used by the Bank of England  and included in their inflation report for some time with good results  A couple of quick observations on the behavior of this indicator in recent weeks I think  there is both good news and bad news, or at least not-so-good news The good news is that the  current gap indicates an expected trend CPI inflation rate of about 2-3/4 percent If we subtract the  1 percent Boskin Commission bias from that, the true expected trend rate of inflation is somewhere  below 2 percent That is very nice, and I will eat a little crow and say that a year or so ago I would  not have expected this result That kind of inflation expectation is close to what I think we need to  have to be able to say that inflation expectations are no longer a major factor in business and  household economic decisions, which has been our working definition of price stability for some    8/19/97  time now I do not want to understate this outcome; it is good news even for inflation hawks like  me  The bad news, or the not-so-good news, is that this indicator has been very volatile  recently It was at about 3 percent in early June and fell to about 2-3/8 percent in late July, but it  recently has risen again to about 2-3/4 percent in the wake of stronger-than-anticipated economic  reports To me that kind of sharp, short-run reaction of inflation expectations to just a couple of  monthly economic reports indicates that, although we certainly have had an encouraging increase in  our credibility in recent months, we still do not have a level of credibility that I would regard as  fully consistent with price stability as we have defined it Moreover, apart from the volatility, the  recent increase in inflation expectations in that indicator is a signal that bears watching Last  month Bob McTeer suggested, quite reasonably I thought at the time, that we are winning the war  against inflation but having trouble accepting our success I thought about that afterwards, Bob It  made a lot of sense to me and it is obviously a very attractive idea Around July 2 8 th I was about to  relax, declare victory, take the day off, go to a ball game, and maybe even drink a cold beer, but  then we got these numbers and the reaction to them So, I don't think we want to get too  comfortable yet  As far as the paradigms are concerned, I would characterize myself, Mr Chairman, as an  old paradigm optimist because I know that eventually we will do the right thing, whatever that  might be [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, just a comment here The only thing that bothers me  about making these changes--and I think I made this comment at the meeting last time--is that what  we are doing here is to be clearer about our operating instrument without making corresponding  changes with respect to the language on our longer-term goals That worries me because I think it  is going to increase the already intense focus on the funds rate, and that, I think, is one of the    8/19/97  principal difficulties we face currently in conducting monetary policy in the short run I don't  know how far I'll get with this, but I would like to make this suggestion concerning the lead clause  in the second sentence There are no suggestions on the table now for changing it, but it currently  reads "In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable  economic growth" Is it possible to consider changing that to "In the context of the  Committee's long-run objectives, which assign priority to price stability as a prerequisite for  achieving sustainable economic growth"?   I accept your recommendation   A quick question, Peter It seems to me that our key concern about  intra-day funds rate volatility would be the possibility that we would give the wrong signal to  markets I have not had the sense that anything like that has been happening lately, but you may  have a different impression   Obviously the latest data, particularly including the latest inflation  report, are very favorable Maybe it is time for me to stop worrying and join the celebration   You need not worry I'm still nervous, and I get the sense from the  questions and comments this morning that the staff and other people are as well I am still nervous  partly because of what I hear in my District and because I have a sense that the foundation of all the  good news lately may be fragile  As far as our District is concerned, it seems quite clear to me that regional economic  activity has strengthened appreciably over the period since our last meeting Labor markets, which  were already tight, strike me as even tighter now than they were I have heard some comments    9/30/97  recently suggesting that labor markets in much of our District are as tight as at any time since I  have been in the Federal Reserve There is increasing concern about this among employers We  hear this in a lot of comments, but I heard it especially loudly in the comments of the members of  our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council when they met a week ago They spoke  about signing bonuses for middle level and even clerical entry-level workers The owner of a  construction company talked about skyrocketing wages in his sector The owner of a private  employment agency said that salaries for mid-level people have risen sharply over the last three  months One of the members of the group said that the remaining labor pool in her region  consisted mostly of essentially unemployable people, and there were reports of construction  projects being stretched out for lack of even minimally qualified workers So, our regional labor  markets are very tight Elsewhere, we are hearing reports of overbuilding in the commercial real  estate sector These reports are not universal across the District, but we hear that especially in the  southern part of the District there is overbuilding of hotels and office and commercial space for the  first time in some time  Again, there currently seems to be a lot of steam in our District economy, but having said  all of this, let me acknowledge that we still are not hearing reports of significant price increases in  final goods and services That condition, of course, is encouraging, but I wonder how long it can  last given the apparent robustness of business conditions in our region  At the national level, I think we already recognize that the Greenbook's baseline  projections are quite optimistic They call for continuing growth at a robust pace, a drop in the  unemployment rate to 4-1/2 percent, and an acceleration in core CPI inflation of only 2 percent  next year despite the absence of any firming action on our part until 1998 That is a rosy scenario,    9/30/97  but it is not an unreasonable one given what has been happening over the last year and half or so,  and it certainly could come to pass  I think, however, that there are very substantial risks to this projection Some of them  already have been mentioned today I will focus on a couple that arise primarily from the  Greenbook assumption that we may wait until as late as next spring before tapping on the brakes  First, the Greenbook is projecting that our assumed tightening in 1998 will contribute to a 20  percent decline in the stock market over the course of the year Of course, we really do not know  where the market is going to be 6 months down the road, especially if we keep policy on hold until  then, or how strong the market reaction to our initial action may be, again especially if we wait  until as late as next spring before taking that action I think there's a significant risk that the  reaction could be very negative What worries me about that possibility is that concern about it  might incline us to wait longer before tightening further, and that could put us significantly behind  the curve I would argue that something like that happened after the market break in 1987 If this  does happen, we will have to play catch-up the way we did back in 1988 and 1989 Obviously, that  would increase the risk of a recession I recognize that is a speculative comment, but I do not think  it is far-fetched  The second risk, perhaps in some ways the greater one, is that by waiting until late next  spring to tap the brakes, we risk being challenged by some sort of inflation scare It could arise  from one of the incoming economic reports Capacity utilization, domestically at least, is now  approaching the level that has been associated with rising inflation pressures in the past So, the  good fortune and good luck we have had with the monthly core inflation reports may run out at  some point In that kind of situation, I worry that public confidence in our ability to keep a lid on  inflation could diminish quite rapidly if we are seen as reacting to developments rather than    9/30/97  conditioning them Some of you may have seen a TV commercial that advertises an upscale car by  saying that life is divided between drivers and passengers, suggesting that drivers are more content  than passengers because they are in control I'm not sure that is always true on the highway; I  know it is not true on 1-95 where I would rather let somebody else drive But I think it is applicable  to monetary policy I hope we will keep our hands firmly on the wheel and be ready to tap the  brakes sooner than in the Greenbook scenario if we need to, as I think we may well have to   Mr Chairman, I can accept your recommendation I also agree  strongly with the thrust of your comment that the probability of having to tighten in November has  risen significantly I hope that you will make some public comment, and I agree with Bill    9/30/97  McDonough and others that doing so would be productive I recognize that it is difficult to deliver  the message, but I think some comment would be in order  I would just add that a principal reason in my view for the considerable success of our  policy over the last three years as a whole is our consistent commitment to hold the line on inflation  built largely on our preemptive tightening actions in 1994 That series of actions was one of the  most successful we have undertaken in recent monetary policy history in this country And it was  successful precisely because we acted proactively rather than reactively Because of that, we  earned the public's confidence There is a lot of talk about a new paradigm I think that increased  confidence and credibility is a big part of that new paradigm But that confidence has to be  nourished, and I think there is a good chance for you to do that in November   Peter, on the domestic bond markets, the yield spread between the  regular 10-year Treasury note and the inflation-indexed bond has diminished a little over the  intermeeting period At first glance, that might normally be expected to imply a drop in  longer-term inflation expectations But I am wondering whether in the flight to quality, more  funds have been directed to the regular nominal note than to the inflation-indexed bond Would  that be part of what is going on?   Mr Chairman, I think my concerns about foreign exchange  operations are well known, and I'm not going to repeat all the arguments I have made earlier I  am uncomfortable with foreign exchange operations for the reasons that I have stated previously,  and I see the swap lines as our instrument to implement those operations Accordingly, I am  opposed to their renewal   No   Mike, I was struck by the fact that the projection for the ECI for  next year is the same as the number for this year I would like to get some sense about how  comfortable you are with that projection because I believe it was made before we had the  October jobs report Also, we at our Bank get a lot of anecdotal information to the effect that  health care costs will begin to rise at a more rapid pace That information comes from a fairly  broad range of contacts As an example, the head of  made a big point of this in a recent meeting I am wondering  whether you are factoring in that sort of information   Thank you   Mr Chairman, by all accounts, activity in the Fifth District has  continued to expand strongly since our September meeting By now, tight labor markets are  obviously old news but, if anything, our sense is that they have tightened even further Several  manufacturers in our region told us over the last several weeks that they had accelerated their  purchases of equipment because of the difficulty they are having in finding new workers In  general, the consensus among nearly all our contacts is that just about everybody who is willing  and able to work is already working Anecdotally, I have a little direct personal experience with  this I have two sons The older one graduated from college back in 1992, and it took him  almost a year to get a paying job The younger one graduated this year, and he already has two  jobs While he was on one of them the other day, someone came up and offered him another,  better job  Elsewhere, and somewhat related to what I just said about labor markets, there is  evidence of some precautionary inventory building in our area, especially at the factory level  The delays in rail deliveries are causing some manufacturers to stockpile raw materials because    11/12/97 53  of the difficulty they are having with those deliveries And some factories are stockpiling  finished products since it's hard to find additional workers to raise production when demand  increases unexpectedly  Despite this evidence of strong demand and tight labor markets, the reports we are  getting on final prices are still generally mixed Trucking rates have been rising this year As I  mentioned earlier, it is generally expected that health care costs will rise appreciably over the  course of the next 12 months or so, but goods prices at both the wholesale and retail level  generally have been flat recently  Finally, like Jerry Jordan, we are seeing evidence of booming real estate conditions in  the District, especially commercial real estate That is especially true right here in the  Washington metropolitan area And we are beginning to hear comments that developers are now  making some of the same kinds of mistakes as were made back in the 1980s We have a lot of  pickup trucks in our District, too!  At the national level, we have a lot of new information since our September meeting  I think the headline of 3-1/2 percent growth in real GDP in the third quarter indicates clearly that  the economic momentum we have seen for a year is continuing Indeed, the growth rate in that  quarter, as we all know, would have been even stronger had it not been for a slackening in  inventory accumulation And it appears that the fourth quarter is starting off on a strong note if  the job report and the purchasing managers' reports are any indication We had a big increase in  employment in October The increase was well above the average monthly increase for the first  three quarters of the year    11/12/97 54  In short, as I see it, the economy currently appears to be growing at a rate well above  the staff's estimate of potential longer-term growth of 2-1/2 percent, and we are projecting that  such growth will continue roughly through the second quarter of next year Beyond this, the  demand for labor nationally appears to be outstripping the sustainable supply currently by a  factor of maybe 2 or 3 That is certainly consistent with what we hear in our District about the  difficulty of finding employable people Factory utilization rates, according to the Greenbook,  are currently above past noninflationary levels  Against this background of quite robust economic activity, the recent stock market  volatility, as I see it, is being widely viewed in the markets as precluding any Fed policy  tightening for the time being And what I think is more important is that because the Fed is  expected to remain on the sidelines for a while, even very strong economic reports like the  third-quarter GDP report and the job report are not getting much reaction in bond markets They  are having little effect on longer-maturity rates This insensitivity of longer-term rates to the  gathering momentum in the economy--and I worry about this--may prevent them from playing  their usual role as an automatic stabilizer for the economy In that sense, one might make the  case that the recent market volatility has caused a de facto easing of monetary policy  Bottom line, I see a number of factors that increase the upside risks in the near-term  outlook These include the accommodation of an economy growing well above potential, labor  demand outstripping labor supply, factory utilization rates at high levels, and the short-circuiting  of the usual automatic restraining force of increases in longer-term interest rates due to the  market expectation that the Fed is on hold We have heard a lot about downside risks, and they  are certainly there, but the developments I noted certainly increase the upside risks In my view,    11/12/97 55  they also increase the danger that we could get behind the curve, as I think one could argue we  did in at least somewhat similar circumstances back in 1988 and 1989   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that, even taking account of the  market turmoil and what is happening in Asia, the basic economic case for tightening policy is  considerably stronger today than it was at the time of our last meeting or even a few weeks ago  My view is that our best course of action is to go ahead and raise the funds rate modestly today  A modest tightening would have the great advantage of putting the Fed back into play and it  would allow long-term interest rates to resume their role as automatic stabilizers  I recognize that an action like this carries significant risk It could produce a very  adverse market reaction We could be blamed for that, and that possibility obviously is an  argument for delaying any move But I think the key point is that delaying a move also involves,  in my view at least, significant risk In particular, if the economy continues to strengthen at  anything like the pace we have seen recently, then I believe we have to face the possibility of a  significant inflation scare If that happens, the markets will get a "double whammy" First, as  interest rates begin to rise and the discount factor on equity prices rises along with it, that would  have a negative impact on markets Second, if we ultimately have to play catch-up and take    11/12/97 99  strong action, which risks a recession, that obviously could have doubly adverse effects It is this  latter possibility that really frightens me To be sure, the probability of that outcome may be less  than 50 percent--maybe it is well below 50 percent--but I don't think it's negligible in the current  environment and the consequences of that kind of outcome would be very undesirable To me,  that would be the worst case scenario, the one we really need to avoid I would not want to write  Alice Rivlin's speech, but I wouldn't want to write this speech either It is a tough call  So, I strongly favor a modest tightening move today Yes, there are risks in moving  today, but in my view there also are significant risks in not moving It seems to me that the  recent, at least relative, market calm might give us a brief window to act I believe we need to  take advantage of it today   Ted, on the worse case scenario, do you have any sense of what  probability you would put on that given what you know now?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Overall, it appears that aggregate  demand remains relatively strong in our region, although reports are a little more mixed than  they were a month ago Regarding a couple of the details, general retail and service-sector  activity picked up sharply in November according to our latest monthly survey However, we  also heard a number of reports of weaker auto sales over the course of the last several weeks, and  recent anecdotal reports indicate that housing may be softening a little from a very high level  Commercial real estate activity, in contrast, appears to remain very strong, especially in the  Washington area but generally around the District as a whole Elsewhere, manufacturing activity  moderated in November according to our survey, but there is some evidence of a firming in this  sector so far in December Labor markets--what can I say? They are at least as tight as they  have been in our region, perhaps even a little tighter than they were if that's possible We have  reports of record-breaking job vacancy backlogs at a number of temp agencies Labor shortages    12/16/97 29  apparently are resulting in some buildup in wage pressures in at least some sectors of the  regional economy, especially construction and retail Typically, seasonal workers earn the  minimum wage on average during the holiday season They are now making $600 an hour or  even more in some cases  Turning to the national picture, I have to say that I found the abrupt revisions in the  Greenbook projections surprising, at least their extent Actually, this month's real growth and  inflation forecasts are not all that different from last month's But in this Greenbook, the  moderation in the rate of real GDP growth and the containment of inflation take place without  any tightening of monetary policy In the November Greenbook, a significant tightening was  assumed to occur over the course of 1998 I understand, of course, that this change reflects the  potential negative fallout of Asian problems on the US economy, but it is not at all clear to me  from the discussion in the Greenbook that in terms of the most likely outcome recent  developments have changed the outlook as substantially as the projections indicate  Let me make four observations about this very quickly First, at our November  meeting I expressed concern that the widespread view in financial markets that Fed policy was  on hold, at least for the time being, was preventing long-term interest rates from playing their  usual automatic stabilizer role In my view, the market reaction to the November employment  reports was very strong evidence for this point of view and this concern That report was much  stronger than expected The strength was across the board, and the report included an hourly  increase in wages that was well above any reasonable projection of productivity gains The  markets hardly reacted at all It appears now that the markets think the only thing that will make  us react is a fairly substantial jump in CPI inflation With labor markets as tight as they are, I    12/16/97 30  think this absence of the usual stabilizer mechanism coming from long-term interest rates is a  significant upside risk in the outlook, and I believe that needs to be given considerable weight  along with whatever weight we give to the Asian problem  Second, a key element in the Greenbook's new projections is the estimate that the  Asian crisis will double the decline in US net exports in 1998 from what was projected in the  November Greenbook and that net exports will reduce real GDP growth by about one percentage  point next year I don't know exactly how that estimate was arrived at More importantly, I do  not have a clear sense of what the staff would say about the confidence interval around that  estimate I think it would be helpful to know that, given the extent of the changes in the  projections, although Ted's answer to my question helps to put a little more of a quantitative  dimension on it The basic point is that net exports clearly present downside risks, but we need  to be careful not to overstate them when weighing them against other risks that we face in the  outlook For all of the talk about globalization, the US economy is still self-contained to a very  considerable extent  Third, the flip side of the prospective widening of the US current account deficit is a  widening capital account surplus The Asian crisis, as I think we all know, has redirected capital  flows away from emerging economies back toward industrial economies, especially the US  economy This is certainly part of the reason for the recent declines in bond rates in US  markets, and I think it has helped to increase loanable funds at banks In short, the capital  reflow that is occurring has some of the effects of an easing of monetary policy I don't think the  Greenbook mentions this, and I wonder whether the projections take account of it    12/16/97  Finally, while the appreciation of the dollar obviously will reduce export demand, that  effect will be partially offset by the restraining effects of the dollar's appreciation on prices The  better inflation performance will bolster real wage gains in the US economy and probably  increase household confidence that those wage gains will continue That could well keep  consumption expenditures on an above-trend path and add further to the tightness in labor  markets  In short, while events in Asia obviously are serious and present significant downside  risks, the upside risks that were in the outlook before the Asian crisis emerged have not  disappeared We should not discount them in our assessment of the outlook Thank you   My policy preference today, Mr Chairman, takes account of the  new Greenbook projection, which assumes no action on our part and has the growth of  employment barely getting down to a sustainable trend over the projection horizon Given that  forecast and for the reasons I outlined earlier today, I still think there is a significant upside risk  in the projection, even taking account of Asia I mentioned a number of things earlier, and one  of them was my concern about the impact of rising real wages on consumption Some of the  comments around the table have reinforced that point for me  I recognize, of course, that there are arguments for not moving at this point There are  clear reasons for lying low Don Kohn laid them out well, and you summarized them also, Mr  Chairman But I continue to believe that there are considerable risks to delaying action further  Cathy Minehan mentioned some of those Weighing the reasonably hard information we have  about current US economic conditions against the softer projections, I still think, stubbornly no  doubt, that a modest 1/4 point increase in the funds rate today would be a prudent step for us to  take It is a form of cheap insurance In my view, not only would a small rate increase today  better position policy for unanticipated strength in the economy if domestic demand should fail    12/16/97 78  to slow, but it would signal that we are prepared to take whatever actions we need going forward  to contain inflation That in itself would help longer-term interest rates resume their role as  automatic stabilizers  Let me make one final comment about flexibility A lot of people have used the word  flexibility today I know I am shifting the context a little here, but flexibility certainly does not  apply to our management of the funds rate Over much of the last year, that rate has been parked  at 5-1/2 percent That is not the way one would expect short-term interest rates to behave in an  adjusting, fluid economy I worry that we may be introducing inflexibility by the way we are  dealing with this policy instrument   Mike, I have the impression that the possibility of a stock market  decline is playing a larger and larger role in the projected deceleration of the expansion I would  be interested in some sort of quantitative relationship here Are you expecting a permanent drop  in the market? Is it something that is going to be extended and sustained? If we had a normal  correction, something like a 10 percent correction or like the correction that we had in the fourth  quarter, that really might not have much of an impact on aggregate demand So, I'm wondering  what underlies the quantitative dimensions of this aspect of your forecast   In keeping with most of the other comments around this table--]  guess Bob McTeer's comments are an exception today--our District economy seems by all  accounts to have remained very strong There are some indications in the manufacturing sector  that shipments may be softening a bit, but orders remain quite strong Like Jack Guynn and  some others, we have gotten occasional comments from folks indicating that the Asian situation  is having some negative impact in particular industries, especially in the paperboard industry A  manufacturer told us that paperboard orders from Korea and Indonesia recently have fallen  sharply, but those stories are the exception rather than the rule Manufacturing is very important  in our region and most manufacturers are quite optimistic for the longer term In general, they  are expecting total shipments, domestic plus exports, to be higher and perhaps significantly  higher six months from now than they are now  Elsewhere, in the words of one of our retail contacts, consumer spending is "going  great guns" Auto sales may be a little spotty, but they are higher than most dealers had expected  them to be not too long ago Our housing sector remains very strong, and we hear more and  more tales about speculative building We have had a lot of anecdotal reports on tight labor  markets and I, too, hesitate to add any more, but that is what most of our contacts want to talk  about At our small business council meeting a couple of weeks ago, a member who runs an  employment agency here in Washington reported that her firm no longer counsels prospective  employees on how to attract prospective employers Rather, she counsels "candidate" employers  on how to attract employees, especially high-tech folks but others as well She also told us that  $40,000+ salaries for senior level executive secretaries and other high level administrative  people are not at all uncommon in this market, runs a small    3/31/98  manufacturing company He told us that he recently lost a programmer who was making  $50,000 for a salary almost twice that level He now defines a "hot job prospect" as somebody  who shows up for an interview and passes a drug test [Laughter] And he is working on  introducing robot technology into his operations!  On the national economy, we now have at least some hard evidence as opposed to  pure predictions that the Asian problem is having some negative impact on US net exports  Obviously, we need to watch that situation and give it weight in our deliberations But, as Jack  Guynn and Cathy Minehan mentioned, the Asian situation has another side to it It is also having  effects that are helping to strengthen already robust US domestic demand, helping to keep the  inflation rate down, helping therefore to keep real wages up, and also helping to keep US  interest rates down  On balance, I think it's reasonably clear that at least during the period since our last  meeting, the strengthening in domestic demand has outstripped whatever negative impact is in  fact coming from Asia The Greenbook obviously has recognized this with what in my  experience is a fairly striking upward revision from one meeting to the next in the projected  growth of real GDP for the coming year I still think, and Mike Prell said the staff has this view  as well, that the risk is on the upside in this projection I have felt that all along and I feel it even  more strongly now, especially with respect to inflation  In this regard, it is interesting to note that almost all of the Greenbook's projected  decline in real GDP is accounted for by a drop in productivity growth, as several people have  noted already This means that labor markets are expected to remain tight over the forecast  horizon It is a little surprising to me that despite this extraordinary job market tightness and  widespread expectations that health care costs are going to move up, the Greenbook does not    3/31/98  project a further increase in the growth rate of ECI compensation for 1998 over 1997 Unit labor  costs in the projection do rise as a result of the weak productivity growth So, we do get a  projected 3 percentage point increase, on a consistently measured basis, in both the core CPI and  the core PCE measures of inflation Obviously, if compensation moves up more strongly than  the staff is expecting, that would compound any upward push on prices emanating from labor  markets  Approaching the inflation risk from a different direction, as we all know M2 growth  has accelerated sharply of late I am well aware of the tax and refund effects that may explain  part of this strength, and I know that M2 velocity is still subject to a lot of uncertainty Even so,  I think it would be a mistake to overlook what might be the most straightforward explanation of  this strong M2 growth, namely that domestic demand is very, very strong currently Thank you   Mr Chairman, I expected the general tone of this meeting to be  more bullish than it was at the February meeting, but the bullish comments today have exceeded  my expectations! So, it will not surprise you or anyone else that I would still prefer to take  action today Governor Gramlich's comments about operating with a funds rate target resonated  with me It is certainly true that we have had some movement in the real federal funds rate, but  we have pegged the nominal funds rate for almost two years Obviously, if we do not move the  rate itself at this meeting, I would certainly support very, very strongly your recommendation for  asymmetry  I have a lot of sympathy with the point that Bob Parry made, and I was in fact going to  raise the same issue I think that if we do move to an asymmetric directive, it would be desirable  to announce that decision now rather than waiting for six or seven weeks I believe it is  important, to use Bill McDonough's metaphor, for us to let people know that the guardian is  there and the guardian is awake I know there are some problems with this suggestion, but one  could make a good case for routinely announcing the directive language tilt concurrently rather  than shortly after the following meeting The tilt language is after all a routine part of the  directive; there are questions about this practice, but we do in fact follow it I don't see any  compelling reason not to release it concurrently   It would be more convenient, no doubt about it Maybe the best  way--   That's a good point It may be that the best way to go about  preparing the markets currently is for you to make a speech of some sort where you bring this  matter up But I think that we might want to consider later the other alternative of announcing  something immediately after each meeting   I don't have a lot to say about the District economy today, Mr  Chairman There hasn't been much change in our regional picture since the last meeting, and  overall it doesn't differ that much from the national picture  With that in mind, I thought it might be more useful to relay a few comments that  made to me recently He is a major real estate developer who  is active in the mid-Atlantic region, most of the Southeast, and parts of the Southwest He called  me on May 11 to express some concerns about what he sees going on in his sector of the economy  First--and this differs from a lot of the information we're hearing--he said that prices of  construction materials that he is familiar with have been rising sharply very recently, especially the  price of concrete Second, he indicated that there are now very high absorption rates for office  space in most parts of the country He said that rents are rising and that he actually has seen some  acceleration in rent increases most recently To pick up a little on what Ed Boehne just mentioned,  he also said that the amount of money available for speculative investment in real estate is beyond  anything he has seen in his long and very active career Finally, at a recent meeting with other  large-scale developers from across the country, he said the general consensus was that there are  clear signs in many markets of some overheating in the commercial real estate sector    5/19/98  With respect to the national economy, for several quarters there has been a tug-of-war  between those who expect real GDP growth to decelerate appreciably, including the Greenbook,  and those who think that strong domestic demand will continue to propel strong economic  expansion With the Asian drag on net exports expected to peak soon, the Greenbook, as we have  been discussing here this morning, is now predicting that a significant inventory correction will  bring about sharply slower growth in the second quarter Now, it is certainly true that inventory  accumulation was quite robust in the first quarter But as I see it, inventory-sales ratios are still  very much in line I don't hear much anecdotal evidence of excessive inventories in my region  So, they may or may not be excessive But in general, it is hard to escape the conclusion that at this  point predictions of a deceleration boil down to a general feeling that the expansion will have to  slow from its current track on general principles, which is certainly not an unreasonable view to  take  But as I see it, even if the expansion does slow, the growth of demand has already  outstripped the growth of productivity for a long time Mr Chairman, you expressed some concern  about this in testimony back in October as I recall Since then we have seen what has happened in  labor markets We have had average monthly growth of about 200,000 jobs, which is about double  the trend growth in the labor force Everybody agrees that the labor markets are extremely tight,  and that seems at least to some degree to pose an inflation risk going forward  On the other side of the issue, people like me have been predicting higher inflation for  a long time, and those predictions certainly have not been borne out by events So, I think a little  humility on our part is pretty much in order at this stage and I acknowledge that But frankly, as I  look forward and try to assess the risks in the outlook, I still think that the key risks are on the  inflation side It occurred to me that it might be time for me to sit back and review, with the help of    5/19/98  my staff, what the analytical basis for that concern might be I would like to summarize that  analysis for you this morning, and I will do so quickly It has to do with real interest rate behavior  and what that might be telling us  First, it seems clear enough at this stage that permanent productivity gains are a major  force driving this economic expansion The staff has revised upward its estimate of productivity  growth That revision in turn is consistent with the higher level of stock prices in the current  Greenbook forecast If households similarly are now beginning to think that their recent real wage  gains and their stock gains are going to be sustained, that might help to explain some of the  extraordinary current strength in consumer demand  If permanent productivity gains are in fact driving the expansion at this stage, one  would expect on general economic grounds to see higher real interest rates as consumers borrow  against expected future income gains and firms borrow to take advantage of favorable investment  opportunities Sure enough, real interest rates are rising, and they already are relatively high That  then raises the key question in this analysis Is it possible that our policy stance is still inflationary  even though real interest rates are at a relatively high level? I think it's possible First, if  technological innovations have raised the marginal product of capital, and I believe many would  agree that they have, then firms naturally would be willing to borrow at high real rates to finance  acquisitions of new capital But as the investment boom progresses, one would expect the capital  deepening to cause the marginal return to capital to decline over time That in turn would be  consistent with the pattern of real interest rates where current short real rates are above expected  future short real rates, resulting in a downward sloping real yield curve The fact that the actual  real yield curve now is basically flat at least raises the possibility, even though real rates are high,  that with monetary policy we are holding current short real rates below the level they are trying to    5/19/98  reach Given that possibility, I think the bottom line is that we may not want to take too much  comfort, from the standpoint of evaluating our policy stance, from the fact that real rates have been  rising and are fairly high  Finally, the possibility that policy is too easy seems to me to be made all the more  likely by the strong growth in M2 and other monetary aggregates, at least until very recently That  growth has carried M2 above the 1998 target cone and even at one point, if I am reading the  Bluebook picture correctly, above the wider band that we used to refer to around here as the  Volcker tunnel The bottom line is that I still think there is good reason analytically and  fundamentally to be concerned about inflation even though we have not seen very much of it lately   Mr Chairman, if it were my choice, I would still prefer to make a  small move today for many of the reasons that Cathy Minehan and Bill Poole have adduced here  To go beyond what they said, there are a lot of folks in this room and outside of the System who are  making the point that we have time to wait before we move I am a little suspicious of that  judgment As Bill Poole said earlier in the meeting, expectations and psychology can change very,  very rapidly As has occurred at times in the past, we can get behind the curve very quickly When  we do, there is usually a big price to pay So, to paraphrase Governor Kelley, I would say that if  we sit still, I hope we will at least sit uptight [Laughter]    5/19/98   Mr Chairman, I continue to believe that the more information  and the clearer the information, the better So, I agree with the majority here I like the language  of Option 1, and I think Tom Hoenig has improved it With Tom's changes, that option strikes  me as a huge improvement over what we have now I would release the directive immediately  and release the minutes as early as possible   I didn't have a question, just a 15-second comment in the context  of this Committee's broader responsibility Bill, I would not second-guess your decision for a  minute It is the most natural thing in the world to respond to a request for our good offices in a  situation like this But this kind of action does create expectations with respect to what we might  do going forward that in turn create expectations about monetary policy So, this issue clearly is  an FOMC matter in my view, and I appreciate it being brought to this Committee The problem,  of course, is that there is no time for the FOMC to deliberate a situation like this on a case-by-  case basis   Right Against that background, it might be constructive for us to  have a discussion at some point in which we would explicitly address the tradeoff and how we  balance the need to intervene in a crisis   Well, if we could do that, it would give us some sense of how we  as a group view the tradeoff So I think that would be helpful   It is the latter context that I had in mind   At least for the time being, overall economic activity in our  District remains at a very high level Revenue growth in the broad service-producing sector  slowed in August but picked up again in September There was a noticeable rise in retail activity  essentially across the board in September As in many other Districts, residential construction  and new home sales are still quite strong throughout our region More generally, our contacts  indicate that there has been no perceptible easing in the extraordinarily tight labor market  conditions we have experienced for many months Workers with even minimal job skills are  hard to find in many areas Skilled construction workers are especially scarce We had a  meeting of our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council last week and they were  particularly direct in describing the tight labor market conditions in their respective industries  and areas  That said, we are now seeing for the first time some unmistakable signs of softening in  the region's manufacturing sector Manufacturing is important in our region A special note A  couple of components on our monthly manufacturing survey, namely new orders and planned  capital spending, slowed quite sharply in August and September A number of manufacturers, as  in other parts of the country, had been telling us about reduced exports and increased competition  from imports One especially high profile example of a change in sentiment in the  manufacturing sector was the announcement a couple of weeks ago by Motorola that they are  going to suspend construction on a new $3 billion chip plant that was being erected near  Richmond That is a big blow to our local community They did not announce any time frame  for resuming construction In my view, manufacturers in our region now clearly have the sense    9/29/98  that they have bigger problems and that these problems may last longer than they had thought  previously  Turning to the national economy, I would like to add a note of caution, and I guess I  am underlining some of the things that Gary Stern, Jerry Jordan, Tom Hoenig, and others have  said It is certainly true that the overall national picture has changed quite radically in many  ways over the last couple of months As we all know, the Russian devaluation and default,  doubts about the effectiveness of the IMF, and perhaps to some extent a perceived world  leadership deficit have produced a quantum jump in risk in world financial markets I think that  has been a seminal event One can see it in the data, as Bill McDonough said, and it is quite  dramatic The Salomon Brothers spread on Brady bonds over US Treasuries, for example,  increased by fully 5-1/2 percentage points between the end of July and the end of August That is  not much less than the cumulative increase in that spread over the much longer period when we  were tightening policy back in 1994 and 1995 This increased financial risk is significantly  complicating adjustment problems in the world economy, and in the United States it probably  accounts for a good part of the decline in stock prices and the apparently tighter conditions in  loan and other credit markets  I certainly agree that these shocks will likely take some of the steam out of domestic  US demand That is probably a good thing But it is still unclear to me how sharp the ultimate  slowing is going to be Even with a 75 basis point decline in the funds rate built into the  forecast, the Greenbook expects the real GDP growth rate to fall to only 1 percent in the first half  of next year and then to rise only 1/2 point to 11/2 percent in the second half However, there still  is no really hard evidence as I see it that the US economic expansion either is or will soon slow  in a major way It may happen Certainly, the downside risks are greater than they were, but it  may not happen Labor markets are still tight Wages are rising Consumer confidence is down    9/29/98  from its peak, but it could pop back up in the wake of any easing action we may take Also, the  rate of growth of M2 over the last 18 months or so, as far as I am concerned, still constitutes an  inflation risk in the outlook The most recent M2 surge probably does reflect a flight to liquidity,  but the rapid M2 growth in the earlier months of this year and late last year did not This latest  bulge could well reflect in part the prospective policy easing that is now apparent in fed funds  futures rates  If we ease policy now, as assumed in the Greenbook, in reaction to events that many  in the United States regard as largely a foreign problem, we run at least some risk in my view of  creating a perception at some point that our longer-term price stability objective has changed or  at least that we are being distracted There is a risk that we may in fact be distracted to some  extent from our long-term price stability goal I think that risk is heightened by the tightness in  labor markets and the general strength of the economy  The good news at this stage, of course, is that markets have already priced in much of  the policy easing that is assumed in the projections As yet, bond rates have not risen; they show  no increase due to heightened inflation expectations For now at least, I think we still have our  credibility and it is holding up well But I do hope we will watch closely as we go forward for  any evidence of eroding public confidence in our commitment to price stability if we follow the  policy strategy that is laid out in the Greenbook   I would like to review briefly where I am coming from, Mr  Chairman Despite the rising turbulence in the international economy over the last year or so, I    9/29/98  have been primarily focused on the upside risks until recently I am still focused on them at least  to some extent Until recently, I have felt that the effects of the foreign shocks were primarily  two-sided in terms of their implications for GDP growth The drag on GDP growth from  reduced net exports was offset to a considerable degree in my view by lower interest rates due to  the flight to quality and by downward pressure on domestic prices occasioned by the stronger  dollar and lower commodity prices With that offset in place, I tended to look through the  international problems to the domestic economy where I saw very rapid growth in M2 and a high  level of economic activity That for me translated into an inflation risk That situation clearly  has changed dramatically The huge increase in perceived risk in financial markets, if it persists,  may well short-circuit the earlier, mainly favorable, impact of foreign developments on US  financial conditions In this new environment, we no longer have that offset Bob McTeer will  be happy to know that I am no longer in favor of tightening monetary policy  While the downside risk in the domestic outlook clearly is greater than it was, that  alone would not be enough to persuade me that we need to ease monetary policy, at least not  quite yet I see a continuation of very strong conditions in the economy and not much evidence  that they are going to weaken significantly in the near future If there is a case for easing now,  from my standpoint it would be to signal that we are not indifferent to the growing risks in world  financial markets and that we are prepared to be flexible going forward as emerging  developments may require In my view, 25 basis points is a sufficient signal to get that message  across I think a 50 basis point reduction would go well beyond what is necessary  As far as the symmetry of the directive is concerned, since I think a 1/4 point reduction  is going to put us a little ahead of the curve--I may be the only person in the room who feels that  way but I do feel that way--I would prefer a symmetric directive   Mr Chairman, I think that either Option 2 or Option 3 would be a  significant improvement over what we have now For the reasons that Jerry Jordan mentioned, I  would have a preference for Option 2 In my view, it is a little more compact and a little clearer  I would agree with those who feel that we should remove the third sentence If we do so, I  would suggest a change at the end of the preceding sentence Where there is a reference to "the  federal funds rate in coming months," I would prefer to see the words "in coming months"  changed to "in the intermeeting period" That would make the period that we are talking about a  little more explicit and definite Finally, if we can get the language changed, I hope we will then  move on to the next and I think equally critical question of whether or not we will release this  information to the public shortly after the meeting at which the directive is set   I agree strongly with Jerry Jordan, Bill Poole, and Mike Kelley on  the TIPS issue It seems to me that from a policy standpoint the great advantage of this market is  the possibility that it can give us a clearer read on inflation and price level expectations down the  road We should not confuse that picture in any way, so I would much prefer to stay out of it   Just one other comment on your comment, Mr Chairman, on the  forecasting usefulness of TIPS I think it's important to keep in mind that we are in a period of  very low inflation and very low inflation expectations If we were to move back into a situation  where there was more inflation, I think we can foresee that indexed securities would be a more  useful forecasting tool I guess, Ned, if we are doing these operations and find ourselves in a  situation where we might want to pull back, I would be concerned that it might be very difficult  to do so   On the swaps, Peter, I would applaud you and all the others who  have worked very hard to get to the point where we are with most of these arrangements In the  memorandum you and Ted Truman distributed at the time of the last meeting, you made  reference to your intention to talk with the Bank of Mexico about their swap line Could you  update us on any progress on that?   I am not concerned about the timing of not doing it now But I  just hope that on our agenda going forward we would always listen to--   Mr Chairman, overall activity slowed in our District in the third  quarter as it did elsewhere, but my sense is that it has strengthened on balance over the period  since our last meeting Consumer spending in October in particular was considerably stronger  than anticipated Automobile sales and outlays for other durable goods were especially robust in  October, supported by well above average refinancing activity In general, retailers seem to be  considerably more optimistic in our region than they were a few weeks ago Housing activity,  both sales and construction, also appears to remain quite solid throughout our District on the  basis of anecdotal information we are getting from our directors and others One director we    11/17/98  have from the District of Columbia described conditions in the housing market here as booming  The main weak spot in our region, as elsewhere I guess, is manufacturing due to the  disproportionate impact of negative international developments on that sector Farming also is  down, owing to weak prices and income One of our directors from South Carolina said they did  not have any agriculture in South Carolina this year  On the financial side in our District, bank business lending has increased very sharply  recently, especially at the larger banks as companies that have been shut out of the securities  market have turned to the banks for credit My sense is that credit is readily available for all but  the lowest-rated borrowers in our region, albeit at higher rates than earlier in the year To round  out information on the District, I would just add that yesterday I attended the meeting of the  Committee on Revenue Estimates for the Virginia Governor, with 20 Virginia CEOs in the  meeting I was struck by the number who still emphasize the tightness of labor markets and the  difficulty they are having finding qualified people at all levels of the experience and knowledge  spectrum  With respect to the national economy, the Greenbook is projecting a deceleration of  real growth to a below-trend rate next year, even with an assumed further easing of monetary  policy There is no question in my mind that this is a plausible forecast, but it depends heavily  on a halving of growth in consumer spending next year That could happen, but it seems to me  far from a sure thing Certainly there is not much evidence of any marked deceleration of  household spending currently Problems in capital markets do not appear to be constraining  consumer credit to any significant degree Some have argued that the low recent saving rate  could crimp consumer outlays going forward But some empirical work and research we have  done at our Bank shows that on average over the last 20 or 25 years low saving rates have    11/17/98  preceded increased rather than diminished growth of consumer spending A weaker stock  market certainly could damp such spending, but clearly we cannot feel very comfortable in  forecasting either the stock market or its impact on consumers There also is Bill Poole's  comment and observation during the question period about the strong growth in household  liquidity  In short, it seems to me that consumer spending could decelerate less than is projected  in the Greenbook If it did, overall GDP growth would be close to potential, which would be a  favorable development in my view I think that scenario is not much, if any, less plausible than  the Greenbook projection Obviously, the still unsettled conditions in capital markets pose  continuing downside risk to the economy, but the aversion to risk in capital markets has clearly  diminished greatly in recent days A number of yield spreads have narrowed significantly Risk  premia, of course, are still higher than they were before August, but the overall credit  intermediation process seems to be adjusting to this Credit flows that would have bypassed the  banks in the more normal circumstances that prevailed before August are now going through the  banking system Bank credit rose at a 27 percent annual rate in October on a reported basis, and  the accelerated growth of M2 indicates, as you would expect, that the size of our open market  operations has increased as the demands for liquidity are being met  In sum, the economy may not be out of the woods yet, but prospects seem distinctly  better now than they were at the time of the September meeting I think that may justify a little  caution on our part when we address policy later Thank you   Mr Chairman, I agree with you that this is a tough call but let me  just get the other point of view on the table As I see it after listening to all of this, there are two  principal arguments for easing policy today One is the downside risks in the economy, the  possibility that the actual outcome will be weaker than the Greenbook projection The other is  the need to act to prevent a reemergence of the extreme risk aversion of a few weeks ago I just  respectfully do not believe that either of those two arguments is very compelling today They  may be compelling a few weeks down the road but not today It seems to me that recent  developments and a lot that we have heard around the table this morning suggest that growth  may decelerate to trend rather than below trend as in the Greenbook  On the other point, it seems to me that the financial system is adjusting, as a number of  people have said, and working reasonably well In a situation like this, there is always a  tremendous bias and pressure on the Fed to do something But I would point out that we are  already doing something even if we don't reduce the funds rate today Just given the way we    11/17/98  operate, we are providing additional liquidity to meet the additional demand for it and at a 50  basis point lower price than that liquidity was being provided just a few weeks ago  One other point I would make is that I see some risk in moving today because it is  always difficult to tighten monetary policy With all respect, I think it might be difficult to  change our policy course and it might be hard to do it as quickly as we would like Given all of  that, I would have a strong preference for alternative B   Mr Chairman, I certainly understand the dilemma we face and I  agree that we need to have a strong consensus before we make a fundamental change I suppose  this is probably a good step, but I'm not quite as sure or confident of that as other people I think  there is some risk that it could cause confusion in the markets and for the public generally I  guess I'm thinking of a situation where there is no change in basic policy but where we change  the tilt As I understand it, sometimes we would announce it and sometimes we would not; I  don't know what the criteria will be and I think there is going to be some head scratching out  there about that I can certainly support your suggestion However, I think it would be very  useful to have a formal commitment that a year from now we will revisit this issue and evaluate  in some detail how it has worked Then at that point we can decide whether it has been a plus or  a minus and whether we should go forward or backwards   Okay   On balance, Mr Chairman, the Fifth District economy appears to  be continuing to expand at a moderate pace Retailers are reporting very busy stores, brisk  holiday sales, and the strength seems to be broadly based Specialty stores and apparel shops,  big box discounters, building supply stores, and hardware stores all appear to be doing very well  told us that their credit card receivables increased  more than 10 percent in November over October, which obviously is a huge increase We are  also hearing of increased strength in residential and commercial real estate Local housing    12/22/98 18  markets in Virginia, the two Carolinas, and particularly here in the District of Columbia are all  stronger than they were a few weeks ago Notably, institutional financing for office and retail  space construction appears to have returned to at least some parts of the District after  disappearing for a while in the third quarter as a result of the market turbulence  On the other hand, our contacts in the manufacturing sector continue to report that  District plants and factories are feeling the effects of lower commodity prices and increased  foreign competition As you know, we do a monthly manufacturing survey and it showed that  employment dropped sharply in the manufacturing sector, particularly in the tobacco industry,  machinery fabrication, and textiles But on the more encouraging side, the survey also indicated  that factory shipments rose in November to a level we have not seen for some time We have a  question in that survey about expectations of future shipments and, somewhat encouragingly,  that figure rose in November for the first time since May So, there may be some signs of a  bottoming out in this sector, although the signs are still fairly weak  As far as labor markets in our region are concerned, it's hard to believe but, if  anything, they seem to be getting even tighter in the service sector, especially in the information  technology sector We get more reports of labor shortages now than we did a while back, and  efforts to hire and retain workers are really very aggressive They were already aggressive but, if  anything, that aggressiveness has become even more visible recently  At the national level, we agree with the staff that the most likely outcome in coming  months is that real GDP growth will decline to a rate closer to trend It certainly seems  reasonable to expect business investment in particular to decelerate, given the prospective  slowing in corporate earnings But a good deal of the current momentum in consumer spending  should carry through, underpinned by the recent strong growth in jobs and in real wages    12/22/98  I think the important point here is that even if overall growth does in fact slow to  trend, that will not necessarily relieve the current extraordinary tightness in labor markets It will  only stop the tightening that has been accompanying above trend real growth from increasing  further In other words, even with the slowing, we may still be above the maximum path on  which the economy can grow without an increase in inflation at some point down the road It  certainly proves that inflation currently remains exceptionally well behaved We can take some  credit for that, I think, and we should But some time next year the decline in commodity prices  and in import prices of manufactured goods should end as Asian economies begin to heal At  that point, goods price inflation could well bottom out and begin to rise rather than offsetting the  service price increases as has been the case recently  With this in mind, and as we enter a period where our focus is shifting from trying to  achieve price stability to trying to maintain price stability, I think we need to ask ourselves how  we judge whether the policy choices we are making now are laying the foundation for continued  low inflation or a resurgence of inflation, or for that matter deflation The Greenbook forecast  and the assumptions underlying it serve as the basis for the Committee's discussion of this  crucial question at each meeting Of course, the Greenbook, as we know, presents a forecast that  is conditioned on a funds rate path Presumably that path is the one the staff believes is  consistent with the maintenance of the nearly stable price level we have now managed to  achieve In effect, the Greenbook prejudges to some extent where the funds rate needs to be  But it does not routinely present the core model and judgment used in arriving at that path for the  funds rate, which makes it harder, for me at least, to evaluate whether the path is the appropriate  one or not    12/22/98  In the current situation, for example, the Greenbook projects that a constant funds rate  at its present level would be consistent with no acceleration in core inflation over the next couple  of years I'm not necessarily criticizing that assumption; it is a reasonable assumption, I  suppose I'm just saying that I personally do not understand fully the basis for that assumption  It would be really helpful to see in more detail the core model and the analysis that is used in  making that call I don't mean to sound critical of the staff on this In my opinion, the staff does  a consistently fine job with a nearly impossible assignment But I do think, especially in this  new situation we face, that the Committee would be in a better position to make the best policy  decision going forward if we could see a little more into the "green box," if I can put it that way   Let me just respond to that, Mike You say you run it through the  model A more explicit discussion of how that is done and what judgments are made so we can  feel comfortable with a constant funds rate in this forecast would be helpful to me   Okay   I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman, not with  agony--that would be too strong a term--but with at least some sense of unease What I  especially agree with in your recommendation is your statement that we are now back at the  point of looking at the risks on both sides of the equation My feeling is that they are now  probably skewed to the upside I agree with the comments that Larry Meyer made and Bill Poole  as well I am comfortable with a symmetric directive at this meeting but had you recommended  an asymmetric directive toward tightening, I would have been perfectly happy with that as well   Mr Chairman, I would prefer option 3 but, like Governor Kelley,  I have a rather strong preference for taking out that phrase "in coming months" This is an  operating paragraph that is supposed to focus on our plans for the operating instrument over the  operating period, which is the period until the next meeting As a matter of logic and clarity, that  phrase just seems to clutter things up and could cause some unnecessary confusion  With regard to the money sentence, I have a preference for leaving it in It does not  refer to an operating instrument However, this is monetary policy, and I would like to see a  reference to money in a statement about monetary policy   Mr Chairman, could I raise a quick question? Are we going to  return at some point to the question of when this would be released?   I have a question for Karen You are projecting a further   deterioration in the trade balance currently and in the near-term future, but the projection   for the dollar shows it fairly steady or actually increasing a bit I know that last year we   had a worsening trade deficit and the dollar actually appreciated, but there was a huge   inflow of capital as a result of the flight-to-quality movements, which I would imagine   we are not expecting this year So, I am wondering how confident you are that the dollar   will hold up, given this situation going forward    Thank you, Mr Chairman Conditions in our District for   the most part mirror the robust national economic situation Consumer spending remains   very strong Indeed, our latest service sector survey suggests that retail sales are now   rising more rapidly than they have at any time in the last year Residential construction   and housing sales are extremely robust pretty much across our District Commercial real   estate activity is less uniformly strong, but it is very strong in certain markets, including   the one right here There is very little available office space in the District of Columbia   and rents are rising     3/30/99 29   Labor markets remain very tight In answer to Bill Poole’s question, textile   companies are the main source of layoffs in our District, and they are laying off a lot of   people The service sector and construction companies are going after these displaced   employees and are hiring them Of course, the textile job losses are permanent, so what   is going to happen in the long run is an open question But the losses may be having   some moderating effect on wages elsewhere in our economy In any case, wages   generally in our District still seem to be rising quite moderately, although we hear from   some of our contacts now that wage offers are a little richer than they were a few months   ago Still, on the whole, final prices in our region show little upward movement   At the national level, the beat goes on The incoming first-quarter data, as   everybody knows, suggest continuing considerable upside risk in the near-term outlook   When one thinks about it, as we have gone through the first quarter, the changing   prospects for the quarter, as they evolved, really have been extraordinary At the time of   the last FOMC meeting, the Greenbook--along with just about everybody else--was   forecasting about 2 percent growth in domestic final demand for the quarter In the   current Greenbook, that projection has been raised to close to 7 percent   I believe it is important that we understand as clearly as we can the reasons for   this extraordinary strength in spending and its implications It seems to me that two main   factors are involved The first is the apparent increase in trend productivity growth The   resulting greater return on investment is keeping business investment spending at an   advanced level, and the current and expected higher real wages are helping to keep   household spending high A rise in productivity growth, I might just note parenthetically,   normally implies an increase in real interest rates So that is one factor The second   factor, I think, is the high credibility of our low inflation strategy That supports the   increases in real income and allows labor markets to operate at much lower   unemployment levels without generating the potentially inflationary wage increases that   have been typical historically As I see it, maintaining this credibility is the key to what   we can do to help sustain the expansion In order to do that, I think we need to be sure     3/30/99 30   we interpret the risks in the outlook as accurately as we can I would like to make a   particular comment about this   In the second half of 1997 and last year, there was a lot of concern,   understandably, that the East Asian crisis would have a significant negative effect on the   US economy There certainly were some negative effects But there also were very   powerful offsetting effects in the form of a big capital inflow that helped hold US   interest rates down and in that way helped hold domestic demand up At the end of the   day, as I see it, the Asian crisis really didn’t have a terribly marked negative effect on the   US economy And I think these offsetting factors played at least as significant a role in   this as our easing of policy last fall   In my view it is desirable, and I think important, to avoid a similar possible   premature conclusion going forward In that regard, as I mentioned earlier, the   Greenbook is projecting a significant further deterioration in net exports this year, which   is portrayed not only here but by a lot of other forecasters as a significant drag on US   growth In the Greenbook, this deterioration is projected to be accompanied by a   modestly stronger dollar which, of course, would help keep inflation in check I can   think of an alternative scenario, which is probably closer to John Makin’s point of view,   where the trade deficit indeed widens, but in the absence of any tightening of US policy   or some fortuitous capital inflow into the United States as we experienced last year, the   dollar declines I think there is ample historical precedent for such a scenario With the   dollar depreciating, foreign central banks might well feel they have more room to ease   policy But with the outlook for much of the rest of the world improving and the US   economy already operating well above potential GDP, a worldwide easing of policy   could cause commodity prices to snap back And that, along with the decline in the   dollar, could well turn inflation expectations back up in this country We could then find   ourselves in a situation where we are forced to tighten sharply to contain inflation, with   all that might imply for the expansion going forward Now, we may see this coming in   plenty of time to act in a measured way to prevent it, but I wouldn’t count on it I hope     3/30/99 31   that we will consider later in the meeting some near-term preventive action that will   reduce the risk that something like this scenario will unfold    Mr Chairman, my views on policy are related to a couple   of the points I made earlier in the economic go-around First, as the Greenbook indicates   and as you have stated very eloquently, we are looking at an acceleration of productivity   in this country If that is true, that implies an increase in real interest rates That is not   antigrowth; that is just the way the macro economy works, as I understand it And I     3/30/99 61   worry that if we fail to validate that increase, we risk over-stimulating the economy and   eventually producing inflation   Secondly, whereas the increase in the trade deficit last year reflected   widespread weakness abroad, it seems to me more likely that an increase this year could   reflect excessive domestic demand in the US economy, which could lead to a   depreciation of the dollar and inflationary impulses from that direction What worries me   the most, ironically, is that our high credibility may in some sense be permitting us to   delay confronting this inflation risk But if things ever begin to go in the other direction,   I think they could unravel very quickly So, as I said at the last meeting, I think it is time   for us to get back in the ball game In my view, a step toward an asymmetric directive   would be a good way to do that   I hear your comment about Kosovo I don’t know exactly how to read that in   the sense that I think, as you suggested, it is likely to be a lengthy conflict And it is a   very dangerous situation But the longer we wait, the more difficult it will be to move It   seems to me that we might want to try to preempt that problem by moving sooner rather   than later    Mr Chairman, the Fifth District economy remains robust   overall I think I have probably started my comments at the last eight or nine FOMC   meetings with that same statement    Nevertheless, that is definitely the case But, if anything,   there seems to be some evidence of a possible acceleration in activity over the last several   weeks Manufacturing is still a very important part of the economic base in our region;   you name it; we make it in the Fifth District And manufacturing activity clearly seems   to have bottomed out and turned up Consumer spending is very strong We had   expected it to be strong, but its recent strength has exceeded even those expectations   Probably the strongest sector in the District’s economy now is construction, both   residential and commercial We are sitting in one of the hottest markets in the region   right here in the DC area; that’s true in the District of Columbia as well as in the   Virginia and Maryland suburbs There is plenty of money around to finance all of this   building, maybe too much The only apparent constraints that we are seeing and hearing   about in construction are the shortages of skilled workers and certain materials   Elsewhere, both commercial and consumer credit are readily available So far   we do not have any significant evidence of a decline in credit quality But we are hearing   from experienced bankers, anecdotally at least, that the competition for loans is very,   very strong--probably excessive--which may be laying the foundation for problems down   the road   On the price and wage side, retail price increases in the region have been   accelerating lately, slowly but steadily according to the service sector survey we do   monthly At our last board meeting the Chairman of Reynolds Metals, who has been   complaining about weak metals and other commodity prices for at least a year and a half,   told us that prices of a broad range of items--not only metals but other commodities he   deals with in his business--have turned up Finally, while there is not yet a lot of hard   evidence regarding rising wages in the District, we are hearing more and more anecdotal     5/18/99 25   comments regarding pay increases and a speeding up of wage increases here and there in   different industries   At the national level, it seems to me that when one puts last week’s CPI and   industrial production reports in a longer-term context, they indicate that the risk in the   outlook has now moved pretty sharply to the upside Back in November when we put in   place the last of our three policy easings, we did so because we were concerned that the   financial turmoil and the credit crunch that might come with it could push the economy   into a recession There is no question that those easing moves did calm financial markets   at the time But they also delivered, in my view, a very strong monetary impulse to an   economy which, even then, was arguably at risk of overheating I think we have seen and   are seeing the results Private domestic final purchases rose at a 7½ percent rate in the   first quarter I agree with you, Mike, that that is probably above trend, but it’s probably   not too much above trend; I think final purchases grew 6½ percent last year And given   the number for the first quarter of this year, the staff has increased its projection of real   GDP growth over the next two years by ½ percentage point and now sees the   unemployment rate as low as 4 percent by the end of the year   That is the context in which we have to view this April CPI report Obviously, I   don’t want to put too much weight on one figure, especially one that may have some   seasonal adjustment problems, as I gather this one may have But against the background   I just reviewed it is worrisome to me because it offers the first direct evidence in some   time that inflation pressures may be building The breadth of the increases in the core   index I found especially troubling But even the headline figure--reflecting the jump in   oil prices--had a big impact The oil price increase is going to get some attention if it   stimulates increased inflation expectations going forward And sooner or later, if it   continues, it is going to show up in the core price component of the index   Finally, the 20 basis point jump in the long bond rate to almost 6 percent, which   came on top of an increase after mid-April of about 15 basis points, makes it clear that   the markets have taken this report reasonably seriously and have not just dismissed it as   monthly noise So for me, the bottom line is that at this point everyone is watching us   People in the markets especially are watching to see how we are going to respond to what   may be direct evidence of rising inflation pressures     5/18/99 26   Just one additional thought if I may, Mr Chairman The monetary stimulus we   injected in 1998 I think is a bit reminiscent of the stimulus we injected in 1987 in the   immediate wake of the stock market crash With that in mind, I think it is worth   remembering that the latter was sufficient to help set off an increase in overall CPI   inflation--briefly to 63 percent in 1990 Oil prices were a factor then, but the core rate   also went up in that period It is true, of course, that we have more credibility now than   we did then, but demand is stronger now than it was then Labor markets are a lot tighter   I know I have been crying wolf around this table for a long time and my fears have not   been realized, but we have to take each day as it comes, I guess So, wolf! [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, what you are proposing is certainly a step   in the right direction, but my preference would be to go ahead and move the funds rate up   ¼ percentage point today I would respectfully disagree with Bill McDonough about the   interpretation of such a move as a knee-jerk response Some people might read it that   way, but I really don’t think it has to be seen that way   As I have said at some earlier meetings, I believe there has been a case for   tightening our policy for some time now on a lot of different grounds We have talked a   lot about productivity trends at this meeting To me it seems increasingly likely that   trend productivity growth is rising Some may see that as a reason to stand pat on policy,   but higher trend productivity growth will lead at least some households and businesses to   expect higher incomes in the future Some are going to try to act on that expectation now   by borrowing to increase their spending even though the actual increase in output is not   yet available In that situation, interest rates need to rise to keep demand from becoming   excessive The extraordinary growth in domestic demand of late seems clear if one looks     5/18/99 60   at a measure like private domestic final purchases, which grew at an annual rate of 7½   percent in the first quarter after growing at a rate of 6½ percent last year That has to be   above any reasonable estimate of the sustainable growth in output, and it is one reason for   tightening policy   Beyond that, as Governor Meyer mentioned earlier, when we last reduced the   funds rate in November, I believe a lot of people around this table saw that move as extra   insurance, so to speak, against the possibility that the financial difficulties we had   experienced would undermine the general economy Those fears clearly have not   materialized, so I think there is a case for taking back that last rate reduction   With regard to the CPI for April, again it is only one number But it comes at a   time when we are already on the lookout for rising inflation on the basis of a variety of   other developments and at a time when financial markets clearly are taking the risk of   higher inflation seriously We have fought long and hard to win the credibility we now   have, and going forward I think our credibility can be an enormously powerful weapon   for keeping inflation under wraps at minimum cost in terms of lost output and jobs I   don’t pretend to know exactly what we have to do now to preserve that credibility, but I   have a sense that we need to show the flag, get back in the ball game--whatever metaphor   you want to use--and to do so more decisively than by just moving to a tilt So, I would   favor alternative C    Peter, I don’t have a big problem with what you are proposing,   but I think some of the principles in the 1977 Guidelines are quite valuable I’m thinking   especially of the first two I’m wondering if we really need to suspend those to get what   you want Might it not be possible to suspend some of the guidelines but not all of them?    It’s mainly the fourth one that gives you the difficulty, right?    I think the case for this is pretty persuasive But in the spirit of   Bob Parry’s question, on the issue of the Fed operating in options and the Fed doing   derivatives I have a sense that the public perception of that might be of some concern to us   I think we should be aware of that I know this is a vote on a temporary authority, but   temporary things sometimes become permanent  And certainly before we decide to do   anything like this on a permanent basis, we ought to consider the broader implications   relating to public perceptions    Mr Chairman, we have not had a lot of change in our District   since the last meeting To jump to the bottom line, with one exception I’ll mention in just a   minute, we see relatively few signs of any deceleration in activity in our region At the last   meeting, I reported that consumer spending had been especially robust in May and June, and   all reports suggest that that is continuing Car sales remain at an exceptionally high level   One of our bank directors recently told us that new car loans at his bank,   were at an all-time high This strong auto demand may soon be stimulating some additional   manufacturing activity in our District, which generally is already fairly strong As you may   know, BMW has a big new plant in Greenville, South Carolina As I’m sure Jack Guynn is   aware, people down there like to say that in South Carolina BMW stands for Bubba Makes   Wheels! [Laughter] Anyway, that is a big plant and they’ve announced plans for a $650   million expansion in part to make sports utility vehicles at that plant to meet the strong   demand for those vehicles   Elsewhere, construction is the sector in our region where imbalances and bottlenecks   are most apparent Skilled construction workers are still in very short supply We hear lots   of anecdotal reports about pay increases and special bonuses for that particular category of     8/24/99 49   labor, which seems consistent with what Mike Moskow was saying about wages generally   Materials are also in short supply I heard a report from one our directors that somebody   had hijacked a truckload of drywall somewhere in Maryland! [Laughter] So we really do   have some of those kinds of conditions And I think that situation reflects continued very   strong demand for housing in our District, despite the recent increases in mortgage rates--or   maybe because of them, if people fear further increases As a result of that demand, I’ve   seen a number of reports recently of a quicker pace of price increases for both new and   existing homes   The two weak spots in our District are still textiles and agriculture As I am sure most   of you are aware, our farmers are suffering from what may be the worst drought in the last   half century in this part of the country The problems for farmers, of course, have been   exacerbated by the low prices worldwide for agricultural commodities   Also, I might just note that I got a call yesterday from  who   runs a rather big furniture company in North Carolina He said that his business had fallen   off fairly noticeably over the last 90 days or so, so I thought I should report that But that is   really an outlier With that exception, we don’t see many signs of a slowing in overall   activity at the regional level   We don’t see many signs at the national level either The Greenbook points out that   the widening US current account deficit could produce a sizable depreciation of the dollar,   with potentially inflationary implications I think it’s also possible that some of our major   trading partners could ease their monetary policies going forward to prevent their currencies   from appreciating, which could stimulate foreign growth perhaps even beyond what is now   anticipated Either of those developments could increase US net exports or at least   moderate the rate of decline, with potentially inflationary consequences given the already   tight labor market conditions in the United States   So it seems to me that the weight of the risk in the national outlook is still skewed to   the upside At the same time, I would certainly acknowledge that there are downside risks,   specifically the possibility that a sharp decline in the stock market might scare consumers   and precipitate a sudden collapse of confidence and spending Obviously, we cannot rule   out a sharp market correction But even if one occurs, there are a few reasons for thinking   that in the current situation the negative impact of such an event on demand and     8/24/99 50   employment could be contained I’ll just mention a couple of points First, back in 1987 I   think we saw and learned that if we react quickly and appropriately we can contain the   downside impact of a market break Also, we are talking here about wealth effects and it is   worth keeping in mind that physical capital constitutes about 30 percent of aggregate wealth   in the United States while human capital constitutes about 70 percent So if monetary policy   keeps the job market on track, I think workers can still have reasonable confidence about   their longer-term income prospects, which would moderate the negative effects on spending   that might otherwise come from a market break   Finally, the situation is a bit less precarious precisely because the Fed now has   credibility and is expected, I think quite generally in the markets, to take the actions that are   needed to contain inflation Because of that, over the course of this year at least, bond rates   have been rising well ahead of actual policy actions, preparing the market for additional   restraint and in a sense creating a continuity--maybe smoothness would be a better word--of   monetary policy I think that can reduce the likelihood of a really sharp market break,   though it doesn’t eliminate it   The bottom line, Mr Chairman, is that while there are downside risks in the outlook,   at this point they seem to me still pretty clearly outweighed by the upside risks and the   potentially costly inflationary implications of those upside risks    Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation to increase the   rate As far as the tilt is concerned, my position is still what it was before I recognize all   the issues that have been raised here But looking at all of the information we have and   giving full weight to your comment that we are probably going to have to move at least one   more time, given the way we have been operating, my sense is that an asymmetrical tilt   toward tightening is better   If I may, I’d like to make one other comment about the tilt I certainly agree with what   Bill Poole and others have said about the need to get our act together and make sure we all   are on the same page Nevertheless, there has been a sentiment expressed by Jerry Jordan   and others about not using a tilt in our directive, and I certainly understand those arguments   But I have a slightly different perspective on this As I see it, under our current operating   procedures monetary policy works to a very large extent by influencing the yield curve   One of the most important determinants or channels of that influence is market expectations   regarding our future policy actions The key point is that those expectations are always out   there In a sense one could say that there is always a market perception of a tilt in one   direction or another or of no tilt, whether we use tilt language in the directive or not--and if   we do, whether we announce it or not That is a key issue that we need to keep in mind   And given that, the issue as I see it is how that inevitable market perception of a tilt or the   absence of a tilt gets determined If we don’t use symmetric or asymmetric language in the   directive at all--or if we do and don’t announce it--then those expectations would be formed   largely, and I think obviously appropriately, by the Chairman’s public statements They   might also be influenced from time to time by what some of the rest of us say and more   generally by how markets guess we are going to react to incoming information about the   economy By telling the markets what our consensus view is, it seems to me that we cut out   a lot of that guesswork, or at least some of it That should make it easier for markets to   move ahead of our actions and create the kind of continuity and smoothness in monetary   policy and its implementation that I referred to awhile ago in my statement on the economy   So, I just offer that perspective     8/24/99 85   One quick final point To my mind, an asymmetric directive is a statement about a   propensity It has never really been, as I see it at least, an unconditional promise of future   FOMC action, and it never should be interpreted as such a promise So, if we are going to   use anything like that in the future, we need to make that clear    Peter, with respect to the last point, I remember that about a year ago-­  or maybe not that long ago--we talked about your securities lending program Are you going to use   that at all in the year-end program?  Would you use that if you had a shortage of collateral?    Of course, the principal development in our region since the last   meeting was hurricane Floyd It did some damage in eastern South Carolina but, as I am sure you   know from the news reports, the brunt of the storm was borne by eastern North Carolina and the   coast of Virginia Apart from the resort areas on the Outer Banks, I would describe eastern North   Carolina as a moderately depressed, thinly populated, agricultural region It contrasts very sharply   with the central part of the state where so much is going on So, while the farmers and others who   were hit directly by the storm are really devastated in many cases, at the end of the day I don’t   think the overall impact on the District’s economy is going to be that great And any impact at the   national level is likely to be relatively small I gather the staff does have a slight increase in its   housing starts forecast to cover the rebuilding, and I think that is about right   Apart from that situation, as far as the District economy as a whole is concerned, the story   is basically the same old story I have been telling you all year We don’t see any signs of a   significant slackening in demand in our region We do a monthly survey of retail activity, and   when we conducted that survey in August we detected a little deceleration in spending But sales   came back very strongly in September, so the August report was probably noise Demand is strong   essentially across the board, especially for automobiles but also for furniture and other durables, for   soft goods--you name it All of our directors and other contacts who sell to consumers, or know   people who do, have stressed the extraordinary strength of household spending at this stage of the   expansion A lot of them refer to it as a household spending “binge,” and nearly all doubt that it   can be sustained     10/5/99 17   Elsewhere, labor markets remain very tight in our region We continue to hear a lot of   individual reports of sizable wage increases in certain markets, though I wouldn’t say that is the   general pattern The bottom line on the District is that if you are not under water, you are probably   doing pretty well, at least for now--and maybe too well   In a broad way, as I read the Greenbook and listened to the staff’s comments this morning, I   think that description applies to the national economy as well It seems clear at this point that   economic activity in the third quarter was a lot stronger than we thought it was going to be when   we discussed it at our August meeting All indications are that household and business spending   were truly robust across the board in the quarter As we all know, a lot of that spending spilled   over into imports, and that propensity seems to have intensified recently The current Greenbook   projects that real net exports will reduce GDP in 1999 by 1¼ percentage points as opposed to 1   percentage point at the time of our August meeting Also, the exceptionally strong demand for cars   and for computing and communications equipment has revived the manufacturing sector very   nicely The level of industrial production in August, I think it is worth pointing out, was 1¼   percentage points above the second-quarter average That’s about 4 or 5 percent at an annual rate,   and that is a lot! So the growth of aggregate demand is continuing to outstrip the growth of   potential GDP, it seems to me, further straining labor resources According to the Greenbook,   aggregate hours worked currently exceed the second-quarter average by close to a percentage   point--that is not annualized--and that also is a lot So for me at least, it is very hard to see how   these trends can continue   As I see it, a couple of things principally have allowed the economy to sustain this boom   situation to this point without any run-up in inflation I doubt that this is news to any of you, but I   think it is useful to point them out Clearly, it’s basically two things First, higher productivity   growth has enabled firms to pay the higher wages needed to attract additional workers in these very   tight labor markets If nominal wage increases at some point begin to exceed the growth in   productivity, I think we would have a problem We would have a profit squeeze that would likely   produce some combination of higher inflation and declining stock prices Second, imports,   supported by capital inflows, have been a safety valve as I see it, relieving some of the pressure we   otherwise would have experienced in labor markets That valve would tighten if net exports were   to improve, and we do have a projection of higher US exports in the current Greenbook, given the   signs of revival in Asia and Europe and the weaker dollar  I believe we need to keep a very close   watch on both of these factors, which have been supporting our noninflationary expansion If     10/5/99 18   either gives way, it seems to me that the expansion will be threatened And the perception in some   quarters is that they are weakening; I think that has been a factor in the recent decline of the stock   market What I worry about is that things could unravel pretty quickly if these pessimistic   perceptions were to build rapidly And I don’t think we necessarily have a lot of time to react once   a process like that gets under way So, bottom line, I think we need to be especially vigilant at this   stage and in my view we at least ought to consider seriously a further preemptive action later in the   meeting    I’ll pass your apology along!    Mr Chairman, before I came to this meeting I concluded from reading   the staff documentation that the Bluebook didn’t make a very strong case for tightening but that the   Greenbook really did The Greenbook projection may be wrong but I’m just not prepared to   discount it to the extent that I think you have I believe the comments that you made--I had to hold   on to my seat as Larry Meyer did--were a very useful reminder I really do But at the end of the   day, I think we’re still just very, very uncertain about what’s happening to the second derivative of   productivity growth So that’s where I’m coming from And against that background, what we   have is very strong growth in domestic demand and continued tightening in domestic labor   markets I agree with Bill McDonough that we don’t want to fight either growth or lower   unemployment But to be concerned about the possibility that demand growth is not sustainable is   a legitimate worry for this group Moreover, the Greenbook at least is projecting a rather steady   increase in core inflation from about 2 percent this year to 3 percent in 2001 That strikes me as a   plausible projection, given what is happening to some intermediate prices and given the kind of   anecdotal information Jack Guynn offered about attitudes toward pricing power We hear a little of   the same thing in our District   And finally, I was interested in one of the alternative simulations in the Greenbook, which   suggested that in order to hold the line on inflation the funds rate needs to rise another point We   probably still have some time before we absolutely have to act, mainly because our credibility   currently is so high, but I just don’t see any particular reason to delay I doubt that it is going to get   any easier to tighten policy and it might get a lot harder   There is one other point that I consider quite important, which I think Larry Meyer   mentioned Even if you are right about productivity growth continuing to accelerate, in that   situation an increase in interest rates is not necessarily inappropriate We need to keep that in   mind If, as appears likely, we don’t raise rates today but stay with “B” and have an asymmetric     10/5/99 61   directive, I have a very strong preference for announcing that I would be very concerned about   trying to do that with language I have the same feelings a lot of other people have expressed, but   perhaps I have those leanings even more strongly To me it’s a matter of credibility If we don’t   announce asymmetry, I’d probably prefer the third alternative--just saying we’ve changed the rules   of the game But when we first adopted the procedure we’re now using we indicated that if we had   a material change that would interest the markets, then we would announce it To go back on that   at this stage of the game would be a mistake    I would like to associate myself with Larry Meyer’s comment; I   have the same concern I don’t know what substitute language to offer, but perhaps something   along the lines of “after taking three actions, we think this is sufficient for the time being but   continued vigilance is needed” as opposed to something that has this sense of finality about it    You better get rid of that    Roger, let me first say that I compliment your Working Group   You took on a tough set of issues and dealt with them I think very forthrightly and got all of the   significant issues on the table   Let me make just a couple of comments about the points of consensus Generally I’m   comfortable to one degree or another with all of them, and very comfortable with the first one   On the fifth one, which recommends that we not get a draft statement in advance, I came into the   meeting thinking I would like to have it in advance, but after the discussion today I won't worry     11/16/99 71   about that [Laughter] I guess the recommendation that I have serious reservations about is the   ninth one, which involves the proposed change to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market   Operations I hope it goes without saying that in my mind the reservation is certainly not about   Chairman Greenspan or any other chairman in particular for that matter, but about the crucial   institutional relationship between the Chairman and the Committee I can’t say this absolutely,   but to the best of my knowledge and that of staff members in Richmond who have studied the   history of the Committee, I don’t think the FOMC has ever previously authorized the Chairman   to take policy actions without prior consultation with the Committee in a manner that would be-­  and this is the crucial part--so explicit, so public and, in my view at least, so permanent as is   suggested in this recommendation Instead, we have extended such latitude informally and   internally and non-publicly In my recollection in thinking back about it, the latitude has evolved   over time with changes in our operating procedures, in the language of the directive, and as   chairmen and members of the Committee have come and gone   I have two principal--and I think practical--concerns about this The first is that if we   were to change the Authorization language as recommended, we might get to a point in the   future where the Committee is not so comfortable with giving some future Chairman this   latitude But if we had this language, it would be very difficult to remove it because if we didn’t   renew the Authorization in its existing form, it would be like a vote of no confidence and almost   a constitutional issue So once we change the language, I think it would be not impossible to   reverse that decision but it would be very difficult   Secondly, it seems to me that doing this may expose the Chairman to more political   pressure Under the existing approach the Chairman is in a position where he can say, if pressure   is put on him  “I can’t do this by myself; I have to go back to the Committee” He would lose a   bit of that cover That may not be such an important point The first of these two points is really   the crucial one to my mind As I understand the argument in the memo for doing this, it is that it   is tied to taking the symmetry/asymmetry statement out of the operating paragraph If that’s a   problem, then put it back in the operating paragraph The language of the memorandum didn’t   strike me as indicating that removing it from the operating paragraph was urgent or truly   compelling--desirable but not absolutely necessary   As far as the choice between the language of the two alternatives is concerned, I   suppose I could live with either but I have a pretty strong preference for the second one The use     11/16/99 72   of the word “possible” suggests to me that the trigger isn’t fully cocked The problem I have   with the first option, looking at it as a whole, is that it almost formalizes a simple Phillips curve   tradeoff between inflation and a recession It’s quite possible, of course--we only have to   remember our experience not too many years ago--to have the risk of both higher inflation and a   recession simultaneously In such circumstances, I think this choice would be problematic We   could change the language at that point, but after having argued about it for so many years in so   many different forms I would hope that we can make a decision and stick with it forever    Thank you, Mr Chairman In our District, activity continues to   grow at a solid pace overall, maybe even a bit more than solid Sales in our region seem to have   accelerated in October and those strong sales appear to be continuing in November Generally   retailers in our region are fairly optimistic about prospects for the holiday season Activity   elsewhere in the service sector is less buoyant, particularly in the real estate industry   Manufacturing activity remains on a rather significant upswing The exceptions, as I have   mentioned before in these meetings, are textile and apparel manufacturing in the Carolinas A   lot of those companies are moving their operations to Mexico   Like everybody else who has commented, what can I say except that labor markets are   still very tight?  But I would underline Mike Prell’s comment that stories about pressures in labor     11/16/99 27   markets seem to have become more common and intense We are hearing not only the usual   tight labor market anecdotal comments, but they are more frequent and they are much more   emphatic on the part of employers than earlier Also, over the last several weeks I have heard a   number of employers talk, again emphatically, about very sizable wage increases I attended the   annual meeting of the Virginia Governor’s Revenue Forecasting Committee yesterday, which   includes a number of CEOs of large companies At that meeting they have a business conditions   go-around, and I would say that at least a third and maybe half of the participants mentioned   recent increases in wages, which in some cases were sizable One person talked about 10 to 15   percent increases for skilled workers  Firms are doing this in order to attract and to retain   people Often the wage increases are for skilled workers, but others are involved as well   With respect to prices, we still don’t see any general increase in the price level in our   area, but underlying pressures may be building Intermediate prices appear to be rising broadly   in the industrial sector according to many of our contacts We hear the same kinds of comments   a lot of others have already mentioned about rising health care costs One of our Richmond   directors who runs a hospital in Charlottesville referred to HMO costs as “exploding” and said it   was clear that those costs would have to be passed on That is the District situation   With respect to the national economy, I have read a lot of Greenbook forecasts over   the years and, naturally, have found some more persuasive than others But I found this month’s   projections and the reasoning behind them very persuasive The bottom line as I read it--and I   think it’s the way Cathy Minehan read it--is this While recent increases in long-term interest   rates and a less buoyant stock market may slow the growth in aggregate demand to some extent   in the period immediately ahead, we probably are already somewhat behind the inflation curve   And that is likely to become more apparent as time passes Beyond this, the overall tone of the   Greenbook--and also I think much of the recent economic data if one looks at them carefully-­  suggests to me that the risk of error in this even quite strong forecast remains on the upside We   hear some comments about signs of softening in the economy That sounds to me a little like   saying that Mark McGuire had a softer season this year than last year Overall spending growth   is currently still very strong despite the recent leveling off in home sales The big jump in hours   worked in October suggests to me that real GDP growth in the current quarter could well exceed   the 4 percent Greenbook projection And there is a possibility, as Karen Johnson mentioned, of a   greater-than-expected depreciation of the dollar In general, I think these upside risks compound     11/16/99 28   the prospective deterioration in the inflation outlook that is already built into the Greenbook   forecast   Let me make just a couple of other quick points First, I think the Greenbook is quite   correct in suggesting that the moderation in wage increases we have seen over the last two or   three months may well reflect the drop in inflation last year In fact, I think the record shows   that wage-setting behavior in the last few years has generally responded to recent movements in   prices With both overall and core inflation accelerating lately, I think we can expect to see   faster wage growth next year And in my view that is consistent with the anecdotal information   mentioned by me and by a number of others earlier   Second and finally, I was pleased to see the explicit recognition in the Greenbook that   faster trend productivity growth implies higher real interest rates  I think one of the principal   policy questions we need to ask ourselves later in the meeting is whether the tightening actions   we have taken to date are sufficient to allow the upward adjustment in real rates that is necessary   to keep the economy in balance, given recent productivity developments The alternative is that   we may be holding rates below where they need to be to accomplish that objective, with all of   the inflation risk that would imply Thank you    I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman I think an   economic case could be made for retaining asymmetry, but I won’t press my luck    Roger, first, I would second Ed Boehne’s compliments to you   and your colleagues on the Working Group You’ve done a lot of hard work You’ve done   a great job, I think, in framing the issues and getting them on the table But I continue to   have reservations about two aspects of the proposals the balance-of-risks language and also   the amendment to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, which has not   been focused on so far Let me just run through my views on these issues as quickly as I   can   On the balance-of-risks issue, I’m very much in the same camp as Bill Poole and   Larry Meyer, and I guess Bob Parry as well Inevitably, in my view, this language is going   to have the effect of reinforcing the short-term Phillips curve tradeoff mentality that   pervades public discussion of monetary policy in particular and of economic policy   generally I recognize that the recommended language, if read and analyzed carefully, does   not necessarily imply that the Committee in its decisions assumes such a tradeoff, although   the language is certainly consistent with that assumption But to most readers and to most   reporters in particular, the language will almost certainly still seem to posit a choice   between fighting inflation on the one hand and stimulating growth on the other Again,   while it doesn’t necessarily follow, I think a lot of people will infer that we are implying that     12/21/99 69   addressing one of these two objectives necessarily means neglecting the other I think this is   really important The notion of a tradeoff between resisting inflation and stimulating growth   is deeply ingrained in Americans, or at least among those people who think about policy I   believe it’s arguably the single biggest obstacle that we face in communicating clearly to the   public about policy And I would hate to see us reinforce this perverse idea with the   recommended new language, which to my mind inevitably it would do I would much   prefer something like Option 2 in Bill Poole’s memorandum In fact, I had written down   wording that’s amazingly close to that; it’s almost identical I don’t think anything is lost by   referring candidly and directly to prospects for policy As I think Larry Meyer said at our   previous meeting, people are not interested in our views on the balance of risks per se They   are interested in them only from the standpoint of their implications for policy I don’t think   we are going to change that by avoiding the “P” word And the risk is that we will tend to   reinforce the popular notion that the Fed is not able to speak clearly and in a straightforward   manner about policy   Let me shift now to the proposed amendment to the Authorization This is obviously   a tough subject to discuss here We have a great Chairman currently, one who takes most of   the heat that is directed at the Fed, and no one, including me, wants to seem to be   advocating restrictions on his authority to act, especially in a crisis But I have to tell you   that I have tried to think this through and I’m still uncomfortable with the proposal It   represents a significant and, most importantly for me at least, permanent institutional change   that could serve us poorly in the long run The idea, as it has been presented, seems to be   that we are simply codifying current practice or our current understanding about this But if   that’s the case, I think it’s fair to ask if we are all clearly on the same page with respect to   exactly what the understanding is, how we arrived at it, and whether it’s firmly grounded   When the amendment is made public, I think informed people are going to ask those kinds   of questions as they try to figure out what we are really trying to do and what we really   mean At the present time at least, I’m not sure we have crisp and convincing answers to   these questions To be candid, I’m not sure that the current understanding has a firm basis   I’m not sure I’m clear on exactly what the understanding is, though I may be the only one   here who feels that way But that is where I am More broadly, it seems to me to run   counter to our federal structure     12/21/99 70   Of course, the fundamental question involved is whether a chairman should have the   authority, either implicitly through some sort of understanding or explicitly through the   Authorization, to act unilaterally even in clearly delimited circumstances--that is, whether   it’s wise and desirable for the Committee to confer that authority Obviously, we always   can I recognize that I’m swimming upstream here and that some people--maybe everybody   else at the table here--believe it is wise to do this I don’t pretend to be all knowing on this   and I acknowledge that that may be true But I have to tell you I’m still not convinced, after   having tried to assess the benefits and the risks   It seems to me that the gains of doing something like this, either explicitly or   implicitly, are small at best Presumably we’re talking here mainly about emergency or   crisis situations But under our current operating procedures, we can already accommodate   increased demands for currency and reserves and the interest rate implications of that in a   crisis by amending our funds rate target The Chairman and other senior System people can   and will--as they have historically--continue to exert strong leadership in managing a crisis,   using the discount window and other tools at our disposal Also in such circumstances, I   think markets would generally expect us to move fairly promptly, so that is going to get   reflected in the yield curve rather quickly in any event And importantly, in a crisis I think   it’s really important for the public to understand that the whole Committee is fully behind   any action that is taken and will follow through on it It is hard to imagine that they   wouldn’t think that with Chairman Greenspan at the helm, but we don’t know who is going   to be Chairman in the year 2050, for example, and what the attitude might be   Finally, at just a practical level, with today’s technology--we’ve been talking about   that a lot around this table--it’s pretty easy to get the Committee together quickly So it’s   not clear to me that we buy a lot by conferring this authority And I think the longer-term   risks of doing so--I mean the real long-term risks, the permanent institutional risks--are not   inconsequential Most importantly, it seems to me that it is precisely in a crisis situation that   a Chairman is most exposed to external political pressure Full Committee deliberation and   participation in a situation like that I think is a protection for the System and for the   Chairman If the President calls, the Chairman can say, “I have to talk to the Committee”   and, of course, benefit from any deliberation that takes place  Also, full Committee     12/21/99 71   participation ensures a detailed public record of what occurs, which I think is consistent   with our very appropriate drift toward greater transparency and greater accountability   The bottom line--again, I realize I’m swimming upstream on this--is that I would   urge the Committee to think very carefully about this Before we do it, we should be really   confident that this is in the best interests of the Committee and the Chairman in particular as   well as the System and the country    Mike, on the top of page 7 of the first part of the Greenbook,   you say that you are expecting hours in the nonfarm sector to increase at a 2¼ percent rate   this quarter And you say that if we get nonfarm productivity increasing at a 3¼ percent rate   we will get the 48 percent GDP forecast That doesn’t seem to add up Does that imply   that agricultural productivity is declining?    Yes, that’s why I couldn’t figure out-­   Mr Chairman, I would like to say a few words about the   directive when we get to that later in the meeting, so I’ll try to compensate by being   especially brief here In any event, I don’t have any great insights on the economic outlook   In short, I don’t detect a lot of change in conditions either in our District or in the   national economy since the November FOMC meeting Activity in our region continued to   advance at a solid pace in November and early December according to our contacts and the   surveys that we conduct Consumer spending remains strong Our retail contacts are   looking for nominal increases in sales over last year in the range of 5 to 6 percent Outside   of the textile industry which, of course, is still declining, manufacturing continues to   rebound Prospects going forward look pretty good, with new orders rising in a large   number of industries There are a few signs of some deceleration in residential sales and   construction in some local markets, but there is, of course, a lot of noise in the short-term   housing data, especially at the regional and local levels Activity remains at a high level in   any event Labor markets are still very tight in our area We have heard a few reports   recently of quite sharp wage increases in some service industries, but increases in the   manufacturing sector remain fairly moderate And many of our business contacts continue   to report a lack of pricing power   The same kind of story seems to hold true at the national level As I see it,   projections of a deceleration in the growth of demand continue to be pushed forward not   only by the Board’s staff but by other forecasters as well I think the continuing momentum   in consumer spending is particularly striking, although not terribly surprising, given strong   growth in jobs and personal income As I mentioned earlier, the Greenbook projects growth   in hours worked at a 2¼ percent annual rate this quarter It is hard to see how that kind of   growth can be sustained without at some point generating inflation and inflationary wage   demands, especially if the core CPI is accelerating as the Greenbook is projecting going   forward   One final point of interest A teenage daughter of one of our Baltimore officers is   reported to have been offered $250 to baby sit for a local dentist on New Year’s Eve She     12/21/99 24   turned it down in order to go out with friends We’re not sure what that implies for the   funds rate [laughter] but we still think the risks are on the upside and that we may be at least   a little behind the curve We’re still working on it and we’ll let you know when we figure it   out!    I guess I’ll take the opposite position, Mr Chairman I can live   with either of these statements But the way I heard our discussion today, this Committee   essentially is asymmetric and pretty clearly so except for concerns about the century date   change And I think we ought to say so It seems to me that the last sentence in the main   paragraph of the draft with asymmetric language says it very well The whole tone of it and   the way it’s structured make that point very clearly I wouldn’t expect that to result in a   market overreaction or concerns from a Y2K perspective So, I think asymmetry is the best   way to go     I would just follow up on what Jerry Jordan said with a brief   comment aimed at what you contemplate doing in the study, Don and Peter  I certainly   understand the situation we are in and the need to look at options, but I would hope that in doing   that we keep in mind the fundamental basic principles here  We must be able to conduct   monetary policy independently in order to maintain low inflation  And if we're going to do that,   we have to maintain our financial independence, that is, our off-budget status  For that reason I   think it is essential that we not be perceived in any way as misusing our off-budget status--  whatever the impetus may be--for fiscal purposes that depart from our basic monetary policy   mission  So, with that in mind, I think the choice of assets that we hold in our portfolio ought to   be made with a view to minimizing the likelihood that we could be drawn, inadvertently, into   fiscal matters involving credit allocations or credit enhancements or subsidies or anything of that   sort  And the absence of such involvement in fiscal issues is what is so wonderful about   Treasuries and why we have had a preference for operating in Treasury securities for so many   years  So I am hoping, and I think this is what Jerry was saying, that we will do everything we              - 19 -     can as a first step to work with the Treasury to get them to tailor their debt management   procedures in a way that would help us meet our needs     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The overall pace of activity in our   District, which was already strong, may actually have accelerated a bit over the last several   weeks  And the strength we see is pretty much across the board  Just to summarize quickly, our   latest retail survey, which we do monthly along with a manufacturing survey, suggests that   consumer spending in our District is very strong  Auto sales in our region, as elsewhere in the              - 48 -     country, are quite robust, as are department store sales  Moreover, the strength in retail sales   now goes beyond the discounters like Target and Wal-Mart, which have been doing fairly well   all along, and extends to mid-price stores and specialty shops as well  In manufacturing,   shipments and new orders are very strong in our region  Our sense is that a good bit of this   reflects increased export activity  Elsewhere, new residential building permits were down a bit   in the fourth quarter, but all of the anecdotal reports we hear on housing suggest that the sector   remains quite healthy  Despite all of this evidence of exceptionally strong demand, we don't yet   see any broad signs of an acceleration in prices beyond those that are directly affected by higher   fuel prices     With respect to expectations, business people in our region are very optimistic at this   stage about their future prospects  I don't want to be too anecdotal, but perhaps the best example   of this optimism is the amount of investment in new golf courses and, in our region in particular,   stock car racing facilities  It is just astonishing  I think it reflects a very broad-based bullishness   in attitudes in our area  This optimism in our District seems consistent with what I sense to be   the prevailing attitude at the national level     As I interpret the recent data, they continue to show ever more dramatically the   effects of the increases in trend productivity growth on both domestic demand and supply in the   US economy  On the supply side, as Mike Prell mentioned, productivity growth came in at 37   percent in 1999  That is 1/2 percentage point higher than the projection in the January   Greenbook  And the staff has now raised its estimate of underlying structural trend productivity   growth to 32 percent  On the demand side, there’s a host of very strong numbers  We now   know that real GDP grew at a 7 percent rate in the fourth quarter  That is almost a 2 percentage   point upside surprise compared with the estimate in the January Greenbook  That has been              - 49 -     carried forward to the projection of GDP growth for the first quarter, which is now 03 percent   higher than in the last Greenbook; and for the second and third quarters, the projection is about   07 percent higher  I have been involved with these meetings for many years--not as long as Ed,   but for a long time--and those are very big revisions in my experience here   Even more remarkably, private domestic final purchases, a good measure of aggregate   domestic demand, are now projected to grow fully 2 percentage points faster than was expected   in the previous Greenbook  Moreover, the imbalance between the current growth of domestic   demand and currently available supply seems to me ever more apparent  Job growth in January   and February was only slightly below the average monthly growth in jobs last year, and that   unfortunately was well above trend pace  And only a big increase in imports prevented the   domestic spending surge from putting even more pressure on domestic supply     In any case, with that as background, the key question for us--and I assume everybody   knows this--is whether we have sufficiently strong restraining forces in place so that we can   expect to see this imbalance diminish and ultimately go away  In that regard, longer-term   interest rates rose a percentage point or so last year as households and firms borrowed against   their expected higher future earnings to purchase goods and services  And that rise in rates was   helpful because longer-term rates help bring demand and supply back into balance by making it   more costly to consume currently those things one can consume in the future  In other words, it   makes people more patient  With that and the very robust data we are looking at in mind--along   with the higher projections for future growth not only in the Greenbook but among other   forecasters as well--it looks to me as though real longer-term interest rates need to rise further to   correct the current imbalance  As it happens, though, if one looks at the data over the last several   weeks, there really hasn't been much movement in long-term interest rates  We are not getting              - 50 -     that kind of supporting effect  Of course, Treasury rates are down  But other long-term rates,   even the BBB corporate rates, have been basically flat for the last several weeks     I think expectations about future Fed policy and maybe some changing nuance in   expectations are playing a role in this  As I believe somebody already mentioned and as the first   chart in the Bluebook shows, implied future funds rates at least for the second half of this year   are now actually lower than they were at the time of our last meeting  So it may well be that the   markets are expecting us to tighten less aggressively now than they did earlier, given the good   behavior of some leading indicators of future inflation like unit labor costs and so forth  Since   long-term rates are an average of expected future short rates, at least up to the term premium, this   would tend to keep longer-term rates lower than they otherwise would be     In my view, Mr Chairman, that's a problem in terms of helping us create the sort of   expectational climate we need in order to correct the demand/supply imbalance in a reasonably   smooth manner  I would hope that we might give that issue some attention when we talk about   policy later on in the meeting     Mr Chairman, I can support your recommendation  But let me   make a quick comment  I have some of the same feelings that Ned Gramlich and others have   expressed in that I worry a little that we may get a bit too comfortable with this incremental   approach of 1/4 point increases  That may be enough to do the job, but it may well be the case--  and there is a good chance in my view--that more forceful actions are going to be required   sooner or later  And I think we need to keep that in mind going forward  As I said earlier in the   meeting, long-term rates, at least currently, are not supporting the moves up on the short end of   the yield curve  Also, I think it is worth pointing out that back in 1994 we tightened policy   rather aggressively and we contained inflation and had a soft landing without a recession  So,              - 90 -     maybe that will change people's attitudes about the impact of our current policies  It’s almost as   though we have too much credibility, in a sense  [Laughter]      Also, on the issue of rising productivity growth, I agree with you that the second   derivative may be positive  But as I understand it, the economic implications of that are in the   direction of even higher real rates; people are going to extrapolate the acceleration in   productivity and try to bring the attendant higher expected future earnings forward  The way to   cut that off is by an increase in real rates, and that might argue for an even more aggressive   policy     In any case, again, I can agree with your basic recommendation  But with respect to   my good friend Tom Hoenig’s comments, I would put the opposite spin on the asymmetry  I   think I said last time that I wanted asymmetry plus  Maybe this time I should say I want   asymmetry with a vengeance!  [Laughter]  I think we need to make very clear that we are   prepared to turn up the heat quickly if we need to       I need to read the Bible more      I have one question, Mr Chairman  The first sentence in the   second paragraph makes the statement that conditions and considerations are essentially the same   as when the Committee met in February  I suppose if one interprets the word “essentially” quite   broadly, that may be true  But the projections in the latest Greenbook are much stronger  I see a   change toward greater recent strength and greater expected future strength in real activity at this   meeting compared to the last meeting  So my preference would be to take that sentence out  I   don't think it adds very much and it may be a bit misleading     I wanted to ask a question--or I guess more accurately state an   opinion--about the swaps  Is that proposal on the table now?      What really worries me is that the continued existence of this   facility puts us in a position where we can be drawn into actions that we may not want to be   drawn into at some point  I question whether that is desirable  In my view it is not  I'm   talking, of course, specifically about Mexico  The situation is very different now from what it   was in 1994 when this swap was originally implemented  The Mexican economy is   considerably stronger and the peso is floating reasonably successfully  So I just wonder   whether this would be a good time to get out of this swap, as we've gotten out of nearly all the   others      I want to dissent on that vote     Mr Chairman, the information we have this month from our   District is not very different from what it has been for the last several meetings  We've seen a   few signs of a possible moderation in consumer spending  The pace of car sales has   decelerated in several parts of the District, following the national pattern to some extent    We've also had a few reports of less robust housing construction and sales most recently,   especially in the Carolinas  And we’ve heard some anecdotal reports that higher mortgage   rates are finally beginning to bite  But as Mike said, the evidence is still pretty ambiguous    Such comments are not heard that frequently and our sense is that residential activity is still   remarkably strong across our region as a whole  Indeed, broadly speaking, our District   economy across all sectors is clearly very strong  We had some signs a couple of months ago   that manufacturing activity might be decelerating a bit, but our most recent survey suggests   that factory activity has revived  We've even had a few positive comments from the textile   industry, something we haven't heard for a long time  Just to cite a little additional   information, the Washington metropolitan area can only be described as booming, and that   includes the District of Columbia as well as the outlying suburbs  Both commercial and   residential real estate are very strong here  And finally, labor markets remain exceptionally      38  tight throughout our District  That is obviously an old story, but in my experience it's   increasingly becoming a preoccupation with our business contacts, directors, and others  And   we do hear more reports of wage increases     Now, when I look at the national economy, the question I ask myself is this  Is   there anything in the recent information on the economy that suggests we ought to back off   from our current strategy of incrementally increasing the real federal funds rate until we get   some sense that the growth of aggregate demand is coming back into line with reasonable   estimates of the sustainable growth in supply?  I just don't see any such information at this   point  On the contrary, the most recent data on prices and on wages in particular seem to me   to underscore the need for continued increases in real interest rates to bring the aggregate   economy back into better balance  We got a new CPI number this morning  Mike, you   mentioned the 12-month change in the core CPI was 22 percent  I had called Richmond and   my staff said the number was 23 percent for the 12-month period ending in April  It may   have been 2-1/4 percent and the difference is in the rounding  In any event, it is approaching a   rate that is 1/2 point higher than it was just a few months ago  So it seems to me that there is   at least some evidence that we are at last experiencing some increase in actual inflation  And   the staff's projection that the upward trend is going to persist strikes me as both reasonable   and disturbing   Wage pressures also appear to be picking up; that shouldn't be surprising with labor   markets as tight as they are  The ECI rose very sharply in the first quarter  The staff has now   revised upward its projection for that measure, which again seems reasonable to me  The   Greenbook observed that the various compensation measures we use may not be capturing the   full impact of nontraditional actions that business firms are now taking--signing bonuses,      39  retention bonuses, and the like--to attract and retain workers  We don’t really know how these   new actions may be affecting both the growth of overall labor costs and pricing behavior by   firms  I would just add that that observation is very consistent with many of the comments   we've heard from our directors and other business contacts   What bothers me most, though, is the evidence--or at least what I see as evidence--  of higher inflation expectations  We see it to some extent in the household survey data    Long-term interest rates are now rising  To me a reasonable guess is that at least some of that   reflects an increase in inflation expectations   The spread between the yield on regular10-year   Treasury bonds and 10-year TIPS has increased significantly since our last meeting  I know   one can't read inflation expectation changes point-for-point from changes in that spread, but I   think the kind of increase we've had recently is probably signaling that expectations of future   inflation have risen at least to some extent and maybe materially  I recognize that temporary   factors can explain some of these developments  But it also seems perfectly plausible to me   that they are being driven to a large extent by our persistent aggregate demand/supply   imbalance in the context of ever-tighter resource constraints, and that real interest rates need   to continue to rise to contain inflation going forward  That strikes me as the most   straightforward interpretation of the most recent information we've seen  And for me at least,   the main policy imperative facing us now is to be sure that real interest rates continue to   increase  I would add that this feeling on my part is hardly diminished by Mike Prell's   comments at the end of his statement, which I thought were very powerful  Relevant to your   comments, Tom, it seems to me that what we need to do is to avoid getting ourselves into a   position where we have to react strongly and thus open ourselves up to the charge of   overreacting      40    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation and I do so   enthusiastically  I would simply add the point that if in fact inflation expectations are now   rising, this move of 50 basis points is really not that much more aggressive than the moves we   have been taking up to this point While some differences of opinion have been expressed      93  around the table about whether inflation expectations are indeed rising, I think there is some   evidence that that is the case  So, I support both parts of your recommendation     Peter, with respect to the foreign exchange proposal in your memo, is   this going to be announced publicly or to the markets in some way?     I think it’s fine to do this, as we discussed earlier, as a housekeeping   item  But it occurs to me, given the condition of the euro, that this could be seen by at least some   people in the markets as a signal that we may be more inclined and more willing to intervene in   foreign exchange markets than we have been in recent years  I would hope, however it comes out,   that we would be sensitive to that possible interpretation and not do anything to reinforce it     I had to get that on the record!     David, you may have touched on this and if you did, I missed it  You   have a very weak projection for housing activity in this quarter and also going forward for at least   the next couple of quarters  It’s important, I think, because that dip in housing activity is a   significant element in the slowing of growth that is forecast for the second half of this year    Mortgage rates have come down significantly in the last four or five weeks  I was just wondering if   you have taken full account of that  Or is that a risk in the outlook?     We are hearing a little bit of that anecdotally     Mr Chairman, the latest information we have from our District is a   bit more mixed than it was at earlier meetings this year  On the one hand, factory output has   remained at a very high level in most, though not all, District manufacturing industries  Labor   markets are still tight  We have low state unemployment rates also  Cathy, Virginia's rate is at    2-1/2 percent and even in West Virginia, which has perennially high structural unemployment, the   rate is at about 5-1/4 percent, I believe  In Fairfax County, Virginia--I don't know who computes   this--the reported unemployment rate is 09 percent  I don't know what the NAIRU is in Fairfax,   [Laughter] but that is a low unemployment rate  In general in this situation, in contrast to the point   you made about wages in your area, Tom, we are seeing fairly widespread indications across the   District of at least a moderate acceleration in wage growth, especially in manufacturing  So, I think   for the most part we still have strong production and tight labor markets     At the same time, though, like others we do see concrete evidence now of softer demand   in our area than we had seen heretofore  Retail sales overall are still growing, but sales of durable   goods, big-ticket items, have moderated noticeably in recent weeks  In asking Dave Stockton earlier   about housing activity going forward, I talked about the possibility of stronger sales  But residential   construction has been weak and home sales have been weaker in our area as well  That has had a   particularly noticeable effect on furniture sales, which is a big industry in our region  And we are   seeing some diminution in the output of the major furniture companies in our District  We had a   report recently that business at a national furniture trade show--I think this was in Dallas, Bob--was   about 20 percent lower than at the same show a year ago  And a former director who runs a fairly   good sized furniture manufacturing company in western North Carolina told us that he has laid off   all of his temporary workers  Back in the second quarter business was really thriving, but now he   has laid off all his temporary workers, is operating some of his plants only four days a week, and is       41  offering discounts for the first time in a while because his inventories have been moving up so   quickly  So, again, I’d say we have a mixed picture in the District   With respect to the national economy, rather than commenting on the particulars of the   Greenbook forecast, which seems reasonable enough to me, let me just offer a general reflection if I   may  Clearly, the place to start today in thinking about the implications for monetary policy of   recent developments in the economy is the remarkable recent growth in labor productivity and the   extent to which that growth has continued to accelerate  People use the word “amazing” a lot, but it   is amazing to me  As the Greenbook points out, growth in output per hour in the nonfarm business   sector exceeded 5 percent in the four quarters ended in the second quarter  That’s the fastest   productivity growth since 1983 when we were coming out of the deepest recession in the post-World   War II period  It is also especially striking given that the trend growth in productivity in the first   part of the 1990s was only 1-1/2 percent   Nevertheless, in light of the wide range in which productivity growth has moved over the   last decade, I think there is still a lot of room for doubt and uncertainty about the persistence of its   recent behavior and where the trend will ultimately settle going forward  Moreover, as we’ve   discussed before, productivity growth for monetary policy is a two-edged sword  In the short run   faster productivity growth, of course, allows firms to pay higher wages without necessarily raising   prices, which is why a lot of people see the recent increase in productivity growth as a reason for us   not to tighten policy further  But we know that rising productivity growth also produces a wealth   effect  It is most visible in higher equity values  Even more importantly, it is also evident in   household expectations of future wage growth  And they are rising  It is the magnitude and timing   of this wealth effect that ultimately determines whether the growth of demand over time outpaces the   growth of supply  That, of course, is essentially the main focus of our concerns       42  For purposes of evaluating our policy options today, we need to know as much as we can   about the prospective evolution of productivity growth and its likely impact on wealth and spending   over time  That raises a couple of questions about the recent burst in productivity growth that we are   all witnessing and marveling at  First, how long will it persist and will it conceivably rise to an even   higher rate than we have had to this point?  Second, to what extent has the surge already affected   household and business spending plans?  Have they been affected a lot already or is there perhaps a   lot more still to come?  In other words, what is the public’s recognition lag with respect to changing   productivity growth?  You alluded to this at least implicitly, David, in your comments about how   productivity may affect spending going forward  These questions obviously are very difficult to   answer  But as I see it, at least, they are the core questions that we need to be focusing on now in   making monetary policy decisions at a time when structural productivity growth is very much in   play  I think the staff can help us do this  For example, in the Greenbook conceivably you could   present some alternative simulations for trend productivity growth the way you do now for the funds   rate and equity values  And you might discuss how different recognition lags could affect the timing   of the impact of these productivity changes on spending in the future  But ultimately econometric   and statistical analysis, I think, can only take us so far at a time when we are in a situation that is   totally unprecedented, at least in the modern history with which I’m familiar    At the end of the day in this very unique period, I believe this Committee is going to have   to make some difficult policy calls the old fashioned way, by sharing relevant anecdotal information   around the table  We need to discuss what is happening and what may happen prospectively to   productivity growth in particular industries and particular regions and then use this information as   best we can to make reasonable judgments about what’s going to happen to productivity growth in   the aggregate going forward  Obviously, we’ve been doing this a great deal already  But I think we       43  may need to focus even more clearly and directly on these kinds of issues than we have to this point    That’s my reflection  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, especially your   recommendation to keep the tilt in place  I think it would be premature to remove it  Also, Tom   Hoenig’s suggestion resonates with me and I hope we will look at that again in the near future     Mr Chairman, for all of my strident opposition to intervention over   the years, I recognize that in particular cases such as this one tough calls have to be made  And we   are in a difficult situation  But I certainly want to support the thrust of Bill Poole’s statement  For   me the problem has always been the damage that intervention and the prospect of intervention can   do to the overall credibility of our longer-term price stability objective  To me that’s the key   problem  So I would support Bill and in particular his suggestion that at some point we consider   trying to find a way in advance to commit ourselves to disengaging from this activity   While   intervention may seem not to do great damage in a particular instance like this if it involves a   relatively small amount of transactions, it still puts the possibility on the table; it’s always out there    So I really believe we need to try to find some institutional way to get around it permanently       May I just make a quick follow-up comment?  To me it’s not the   question of inefficacy or whether sterilized intervention does or does not have an impact of some   sort over the short run  It’s a matter of our credibility and what it does to that     Well, I think it raises questions about what our ultimate fundamental   objective is     I mean the credibility of a long-run strategy aimed fundamentally at   longer-term price stability      23    Mr Chairman, at our meeting in August the information on our   District that I had at the time suggested a more mixed picture in the lower Middle Atlantic region, at   least by comparison to the unambiguously strong growth we were seeing in the first half of the year    And the picture is still mixed  As has been mentioned for other Districts, there are signs of   moderating activity in some sectors  Higher fuel prices are damping sales of vehicles generally,   especially the larger SUVs and trucks  They are squeezing the profits of some of the trucking   companies in our region, and we have a large number of these companies  But at the same time, a   significant portion of the anecdotal information we have received in the last two or three weeks   suggests that demand may be strengthening, or at least not weakening any further  Just to cite a      42  couple of examples to back that up  Back-to-school sales were reported to be unexpectedly strong in   our region, and those are sometimes said to be harbingers of upcoming holiday sales; recent declines   in mortgage rates have definitely stimulated new residential construction and sales of both new and   existing homes in our area; and respondents to our latest monthly services sector survey indicated   that their revenues were firming    Also, labor markets are still very tight in our area  Our Small Business and Agriculture   Advisory Council met last week, and though they told the same old story of a tight job market I was   struck by the intensity of some of the comments members made about the competition for capable   workers  One fellow said that he had recently raised wage rates across the board by about 10 percent   to stop what he referred to as “poaching” of his workforce by his competitors   In sum, of course it is always hard to know whether this somewhat stronger tone in the   last several weeks is just noise or perhaps seasonal influences  Nevertheless, I have some sense at   least that business activity is no longer decelerating in our region   With respect to the national economy, I think the key questions right now center on the   underlying growth rate of structural productivity, the extent to which that growth rate is anticipated   and perceived by the public, and the net impact of those two factors on inflation going forward  I   see that impact working through two channels  First, the effect on the aggregate demand/supply   balance and second, the effect on unit labor costs  And I want to add my compliments to the others   you've received, Dave and Karen, because the simulations, especially the ones on productivity, were   very helpful in thinking through these issues  I know I am repeating other compliments, but I have   been reading these Greenbooks for 30 years and I think you are on a roll!   The baseline Greenbook forecast projects high but fairly steady structural productivity   growth over the forecast horizon that is fully anticipated by the public  I think that is a key point  If      43  that turns out to be right, then the apparent moderation in demand nationally over the second and   third quarters may be a good sign  It may indicate that we have the real funds rate now where it   needs to be to bring the growth of aggregate demand in line with the sustainable growth of potential   output  But, obviously, there are other possible outcomes and you recognize a lot of these  We   could have a further acceleration of structural productivity growth, although that is not very likely at   this point given the level of your projections  A more likely prospect, I think, is that the increases   projected by the Greenbook for the current year and for 2001 and 2002 are not yet fully anticipated    They are, after all, higher than most of the published or publicly announced private sector   projections and simulations I've seen  If the Greenbook projections are right, expected future income   and wealth would rise as the public recognizes that productivity growth is higher than they had   anticipated, and that could generate renewed excess growth in demand going forward  Now, your   productivity surprise simulation, of course, incorporates this effect and recognizes that at some point   that could put upward pressure on inflation  But the actual numbers in your simulation show   virtually no effect, at least for the next couple of years  I guess what happens is that the presumably   positive effect on demand is outweighed by the negative effect on unit labor costs  And I recognize   that things could well work out that way  But the near-term impact of a further increase in expected   income and wealth on aggregate demand could well be greater over the forecast horizon of the next   few years than the simulations suggest  That could be a problem since we are already seeing at least   an uptick in core inflation  And many people are projecting a further increase as recent energy   prices work their way through the economy or if the dollar drops more than anticipated in the   Greenbook forecast  So, like others, I think the balance of risk is still on the up side, though maybe   not as decidedly as it was a while back  Therefore, I also think that we should leave the tilt in our   press release in place      44  I believe it is worth reminding ourselves in this context that the accelerated technological   progress and capital deepening are not the only factors driving the “new economy,” if that is indeed   what we have  Another absolutely critical element has been our enhanced credibility--first, that we   have achieved price stability or some close approximation of it and secondly, that the credibility of   our strategy is so much stronger than it was  And I don’t think we should take that credibility for   granted  I think the latter part of Bob Parry’s statement was right on the money and I would   certainly agree with his point of view on that  Thank you     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman     Run that by me one more time!        On balance, Mr Chairman, our District economy is growing at a   slower pace currently than at the time of our last meeting, although activity is still at a very high   level  And labor markets in our region, as appears to be the case elsewhere in the country, are   still very tight  According to retailers we survey each month by mail, sales were strong--very   strong, actually--through early October but have weakened fairly markedly since then  Car   dealers in particular have seen their sales drop off and customer traffic has diminished  That was   in October, however; I should point out that in September their activity was very strong    Furniture dealers and home improvement stores also report somewhat slower sales  Looking   ahead to the holiday season, most retailers tell us they expect a reasonably decent season, but               43      they certainly aren't looking for anything like the strong performance they had last year, and a   number of them are pretty nervous   Elsewhere, manufacturing activity in the Carolinas, where it is concentrated in our   District, has decelerated lately  Both factory shipments and orders were notably softer in   October than earlier in the year  In contrast to the softening in manufacturing, though, generally   demand in the services sector is still holding fairly steady and in some cases is even stronger,   according to a majority of the services firms that we have talked to over the last several weeks    As far as labor markets are concerned, basically the story is the same as it has been  Qualified   workers still are very hard to come by throughout our region  We are told that some retailers   have actually had to cut back on the hours they are open because they can't find people to staff   their stores  Also, a board member who runs a hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, told us that   they actually are delaying some non-emergency surgeries because of the shortage of nurses  We   don't see any broad breakout in wages yet, but my sense is that wages are creeping upward on   balance throughout our region and that the pattern is pretty pervasive across a broad array of   industries and companies    On the national scene, the data that have come in since our October meeting indicate a   national picture similar to the regional one I just summarized, and we’ve heard that assessment   around the table today  Overall spending, housing activity, and business investment are all   growing more slowly than in the first half of the year  And I think the perception of softer   demand, as we’ve heard here this morning, has broadened and deepened  The October labor   market report does provide some evidence that the slowing is continuing into the fourth quarter    Jobs grew in October at about the trend rate of growth of the labor force, but the index of               44      aggregate hours worked changed little from the third-quarter average, indicating for now at least   that aggregate demand may be growing somewhat more slowly than potential output  So I would   agree with others around the table who have said that for the first time in a couple of years there   is now some significant downside risk as well as upside risk in the outlook for the real economy    And I would underline “real economy”   Now, focusing more on prices and wages, the moderation in demand might seem to   suggest that the inflation threat is now abating  But I don't think it’s clear yet that that is the   case, especially when one looks at labor costs and wage and benefit figures  Wage growth in   October jumped to an annual rate of about 5 percent, well above the 36 percent average rate for   the year to date  And with the persistent tightness in labor markets, the ECI was up 46 percent   over the last four quarters  I believe that’s the biggest four-quarter increase in ten years; it   compares to only 31 percent in the previous four quarters  Also, productivity growth in the   nonfarm business sector did slow to 38 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter  I agree   with Bob Parry that it could have been worse, but it was a drop from 61 percent in the second   quarter and about 5 percent on average over the last year or so  As a result, unit labor costs rose   at a 2-3/4 percent annual rate in the third quarter after remaining roughly flat for an extended   period--in fact, over the four previous quarters  I think that’s worrisome, and in my view unit   labor costs could increase further  The continuing labor market tightness could easily cause   compensation growth to rise more and productivity growth might slow further  In that regard, I   think it’s notable that for the first time in a long time, Dave, you have revised downward your   structural productivity projections--not by a lot, but it's a change in direction  And I think we               45      could see a slowing in cyclical productivity growth along the lines suggested by Michael   Moskow's questions   So, while aggregate demand appears to be growing more slowly--and I think that's   clearly constructive from the standpoint of the longer-run health of the economy--the bottom line   for me is that I believe we are still a long way from a soft landing  And I don't think we should   take one for granted  Oil prices are high and core measures of inflation have risen 1/2 percentage   point  I was struck, Dave, by your comment about your sense of the underlying direction of core   inflation  Again, the labor market is still exceptionally tight  In this situation, I think an actual   or anticipated further rise in the growth of unit labor costs could readily provoke an increase in   inflation expectations  Like many others around the table--and I thought Jack Guynn said it   especially well--I think the risks are clearly still on the up side  And I believe we need to be   positioned to deal with those upside risks going forward  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I strongly favor the policy position you’re   recommending, the asymmetry  And I would just underline what Gary Stern said  I               97      thought he made an interesting observation, namely that it would be very difficult at this   point to explain why we would change to a balanced statement  And I think that would   just further encourage markets to expect that we are beginning a cycle of easing, which in   my view would increase the upside risk     Also, I would go back to something that Governor Kelley said in the economic   discussion, and I thought he put it quite well  It’s just too early to get overly concerned   about downside risks  We have had many quarters in which there was a general   consensus that aggregate demand was growing more rapidly than potential  We now   have one quarter when it may be growing somewhat more slowly than potential  Frankly,   I think that's healthy  And if I could follow on Ned Gramlich’s medical analogies, I   wouldn't want to do anything at this point to undercut the therapy   As far as the statement is concerned, I think this one really gets it exactly right    I believe the nuances are exactly right  So, I’m a “yes” on both counts     Mr Chairman, I don’t really have a question but I have an issue I   want to raise if no one is going to ask a question  I’m not sure this is the right time to do it, but I   don’t know when else on the agenda to do it  The issue relates to the new legislation that reinstitutes   our semi-annual monetary policy reports  I believe that legislation requires you to testify, among   other things, on the objectives and plans of the Board and the Committee with respect to the conduct   of monetary policy, as well as on economic developments and prospects for the future  I think it’s   interesting because before, under the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation, our statements in the report on   our objectives and plans had to be tied to the growth of the monetary aggregates  Under this new   legislation, as I understand it, the ball is really in our court in terms of how we present that report;   the legislation hasn’t instructed us to do it in a particular way or tied our hands in any respect  It   seems to me that this might give us an opportunity to consider some approaches like inflation   targeting that we have been reluctant to consider before because we might be seen as preempting the   Congress  I was just wondering Are we perhaps going to be able to look at some options on this?      18    If I may say so, I would hope that we would look for opportunities to   consider alternative approaches  It worries me that we no longer have anything like the ranges for   the aggregates, which for all of their weaknesses in recent years were a fairly objective anchor, at   least at the beginning, for our longer-run policy actions       Okay      19    Mr Chairman, the signs of slower growth in the national economy   are now more clearly reflected in our District economy than they were at the time of our last   meeting  Consumer spending in particular has throttled down and home sales and housing   construction have continued to moderate  We are hearing more reports now about layoffs at   manufacturing plants in the Carolinas More generally we have a sense that labor markets are   loosening a bit; they are a little less tight  Trucking companies in particular have reported fewer   difficulties finding and retaining drivers  Looking forward, I think it's fair to say that most of our   business contacts are still reasonably optimistic about the prospects for the year ahead, despite the   slowing in activity, but an increasingly vocal minority is worried that the national economy is going      39  to decline sharply going forward  And we now hear the “R” word fairly frequently in our region for   the first time in several years, especially in the southern parts where there is a lot of old economy   manufacturing activity  At the same time, I would point out that our latest monthly survey of retail   and service firms indicated that their prices have drifted upward in recent weeks   The data released since our November FOMC meeting have provided further confirmation   of the softening in the national economy  The Greenbook has reduced its projections of real GDP   growth for the current quarter and for the first quarter of next year to about 2-1/2 percent    Obviously, that would be a quite pronounced deceleration from the 6 percent rate of growth we saw   in the four quarters ending in the second quarter of the year  To keep it in perspective, though, that 6   percent growth rate was not sustainable, especially in labor markets  That's why we tightened   monetary policy in that period  So, we are getting the slowing we needed     The question, of course, is whether we're going to get more slowing than we need or   wanted  My sense of the Greenbook baseline forecast is that the staff is relatively optimistic on this   score  Private domestic final purchases, a key component of the underlying longer-term growth in   aggregate demand, are projected to grow between 3 and 3-1/2 percent for the year ahead, which   would be moderately below the estimated 4-1/2 percent potential GDP growth going forward  That   does push the projected unemployment rate up to 47 percent in the fourth quarter  Rising   unemployment, obviously, is never a good thing, but it seems to me that an increase of that   magnitude would probably be manageable, especially if inflation remains contained and growth   reaccelerates in the second half of the year and in 2002, as in the baseline forecast   In short, as I see it, the baseline Greenbook forecast projects what I would call a classic   soft landing with no change in the funds rate  I have no reason to quarrel with the projection and I   think the upside and downside risks are reasonably well balanced around it, given the tone of the      40  regular monthly economic reports since our last meeting  Clearly, there are significant downside   risks and I recognize them  A further decline in equity markets or additional tightening in credit   markets would increase the downside risks, especially if equity prices were to weaken sharply     To my mind, another point that is important here is exactly how households react to rising   unemployment if in fact the unemployment rate does begin to rise  If we think back, when we   tightened in 1994 the unemployment rate was higher than it is now, but it was on a downward trend    Today it looks to have bottomed out and, of course, the staff is projecting an increase and that   increase could be even greater than projected  We have not had rising unemployment in this country   in about 10 years  It's hard at this point to gauge how much consumer confidence would decline if   unemployment did begin to rise, even to the moderate degree projected in the Greenbook, but   especially if it were to increase by more than is projected   Now, I want to be clear I'm aware of the downside risks out there and I take them   seriously  I think it's essential that we do all we can to avoid unnecessarily weakening the current   expansion  At the same time, I also believe there's a considerable risk in a precipitous reaction by   this Committee to what at this point is still an incipient slowdown, and in particular I think a marked   shift to ease could cost us over time   I have just a couple of additional comments  In thinking back on our easing in the fall of   1998, it was clearly appropriate in retrospect, but it probably contributed over time to the moderate   increase we have seen in various measures of inflation over the last several quarters  Going back   even further, our easing in 1987--while again clearly necessary in the circumstances--in my view   helped produce the sharp increase in inflation in 1988 and 1989 that set the stage for the recession in   1990  So against that background, I think any significant easing in policy now risks creating the      41  perception that we're willing to accept a further increase in inflation today to prevent even a   moderate increase in the unemployment rate from what is historically a quite low level   Let me close by saying that we need to remind ourselves that we have worked very hard   over the last couple of decades to build what I believe is now the considerable credibility of our   commitment to low inflation  That credibility enhances our flexibility to respond to downside risks    Unquestionably, if circumstances warrant, we may need to spend some of that credibility  But in   confronting the immediate situation, I think we should recognize that there is a risk in easing policy   more than expected at a time when labor markets, while perhaps a bit looser, are still quite tight and   inflation is drifting upward  Absent a very sharp deterioration in financial markets--a real market   break as in 1987 and 1998--I think we still have time to proceed in a measured manner, and I would   hope that we’d do that Thank you     Mr Chairman, let me say first that I can accept your proposal  I   definitely recognize the downside risks and I am getting the same kinds of messages as everyone   else  My preference would have been to have a balanced risk statement  My concern with this move   is that it is not yet fully priced in the markets  And I think it will be seen by some as a fairly   aggressive move toward ease in the context of an historically low unemployment rate and a labor   market situation that is tight by historical standards  That could set up a series of expectations,   which could put us in a box if confidence is not yet breached, to use your phrase, and the economy   begins to show some strength going forward  But I can accept your proposal  I would recommend      80  and would hope that the press statement that accompanies our announcement includes language   making it clear that we are not yet panicking--that it’s not a foregone conclusion that we’re   necessarily going to ease further  I guess that comment was predictable!  [Laughter]     I'm expressing my preferences!      Mr Chairman, our District economy would have to be   described as soft overall but conditions are still mixed, as I have been reporting for the   last several meetings  Manufacturing activity in our traditional old-economy industries   like textiles and furniture and paper continues to weaken  We hear many reports of   layoffs, reduced hours, and decreased output in an effort to adjust inventories  Like   Michael Moskow, I’m getting a lot of letters and unsolicited advice, especially from my   contacts in the manufacturing sector  Much of that advice, incidentally, is not very   gentle   It seems fairly clear that most of these industries are a lot weaker now than they   were recently or weaker even than they have been since the last recession   Conditions are more disparate across the high-tech manufacturing industries   we have in northern Virginia and in the research triangle area of North Carolina, but   overall they’re still notably softer than they were a year ago  Factory shipments and   orders were up a little in February according to our latest monthly survey of District   manufacturing activity, and similar to Cathy Minehan’s comments about New England   manufacturers, the tone seemed a bit stronger too  I should point out, however, that this   information was gathered several weeks ago before the big drop in equity markets, and   these firms might not be quite as optimistic now  So, the manufacturing sector doesn’t   look good, but elsewhere conditions seem a little brighter, as many other people around   the table also have pointed out     3/20/01 55  Retail sales and employment in our region were down in both January and   February but, as in other parts of the country, car sales have picked up recently and store   sales across the District have improved  Residential construction is still very strong, with   a lot of homebuilding here in the Washington area, though strength in that sector is   apparent uniformly across the District  Nonresidential construction also continues to be   reasonably healthy  We’re not hearing quite as many anecdotal comments as we were   earlier about extremely tight labor markets but they are still reasonably firm    Unemployment rates have not moved much; they remain at quite low levels in all our   District states  North Carolina is a bit of an exception  While the unemployment rate is   still at a low level in that state, it has moved up a little because of the heavy concentration   of manufacturing there  In sum, we have a very weak picture in the factory sector but   modestly encouraging developments elsewhere in our regional economy   Turning to the national economy, I believe the situation we face today is   particularly difficult  Clearly, the equity markets have just finished one of the worst   weeks in recent memory  Earnings forecasts continue to be written down  Also, large   layoffs, especially in the high-tech sector, have added to the sense of unease that has been   moving across the country and in my view accelerating of late  I think one would have to   say that, at best, economic conditions in the country are fragile  Still, if we compare this   Greenbook to the last one, David, I would say that there are grounds for optimism   Most importantly, the projected growth in private domestic final purchases for   the first quarter has been revised up significantly from 1-1/2 percent to a little over 3   percent, largely on the basis of actual data  You have a lot of information to back up that   forecast  All the major components of private demand--including PCE, business fixed     3/20/01 56  investment, and residential investment look better now than they did in January  In my   judgment that is probably due, at least in part, to the stimulative impact of the fairly   significant drop in long-term rates that we’ve had, and I think we need to keep that in   mind  The 10-year Treasury rate is now all the way down to 4-3/4 percent  I think the   more favorable outlook also reflects some underlying confidence in the longer-run   prospects for the US economy, a point that Karen Johnson made very well in a different   context  The sense I get from most of my contacts is that we’re likely to have a rough   period in the near term but in the longer run the situation may not be so bad    The Greenbook does, of course, expect near-term weakness  The projection is   that growth in real GDP will be held to below 1 percent by the continuing drag from   inventory adjustments and by the drag from the foreign sector  But the inventory   adjustment is projected to be completed by the third quarter of the year, and real GDP   growth is forecast to be over 3 percent again by the fourth quarter  If we can get that   result, I’d consider it a quite favorable outcome, given the situation we’re facing and   some of the commentary we’re hearing  And I think there’s a reasonably good chance   that we can    Of course, as everybody knows, the main risk in the outlook is that rising   unemployment and falling stock prices may cause business and consumer confidence to   fall significantly further before the inventory adjustment is completed  In that regard the   fact that the University of Michigan’s preliminary report did not show a further decline in   its index of consumer confidence was encouraging  I know the index has come down   quite a lot from its peak but the pause reported in the most recent figure was promising,   given that a drop had been widely anticipated  That may have been due in part to the fact     3/20/01 57  that the unemployment rate has not risen much to this point  Also, the stock market   decline, while dramatic, in my view can still be called orderly to date  And while credit   market conditions are tighter, I don’t hear people telling me that credit is not available    In that regard, we don’t have the kind of credit situation we’ve had in past slowdowns      On balance, given what we know now, I see no compelling reason to believe   that the reductions in the funds rate that were priced into the term structure prior to last   week’s stock market decline will be insufficient to carry the economy through the current   inventory correction Thank you       Mr Chairman, I come out exactly where President   Minehan did  I certainly support the 50 basis points move  I thought the reasons you   gave at the end of your statement really iced the case, although I have to confess that I     3/20/01 98  wasn't sure for awhile exactly where you were going to come out  But cutting the funds   rate as you proposed is what I think we clearly need to do   I can support an asymmetric directive  On the economic merits that makes   sense to me  But I have very strong reservations and would oppose adding new language   about the possibility of an intermeeting move  I just don't think it would buy us a lot, and   it could be dangerous in terms of the market dynamics and the expectations it could   create  The word that comes to my mind in thinking about it briefly here is “tantalizing”    As Cathy Minehan said, everyone knows that we can always make an intermeeting move;   we've done it fairly recently  I don't see much to be gained by underlining that  So I   would support all of your recommendation except for that element of it     I just want to get some sense of the time frame we’re talking   about  You said it would take several months  Can we anticipate--it’s such a wonderful   opportunity and I’d hate to see us--      David, you pointed out, as is well known, that spending on   equipment and software has been very weak and continues to be weak  But I noticed in going   through the Greenbook that nonresidential construction outlays are still quite strong  I know   some of that reflects drilling activity and, of course, the investment process has a lag that is   different from spending on equipment  But the difference still struck me as an anomaly  How   do you evaluate that?  Does this present some significant downside risk going forward?       5/15/01     18     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our District continues to present the   mixed picture I’ve reported at recent meetings, though it may be a little less mixed this time than   earlier  There are some positive developments  Sales of nondurable goods and services were   actually up a bit in April; they increased at a somewhat more rapid rate  Tourist activity in the   early part of the holiday season and the summer season along the North and South Carolina coast   has been strong  The new pandas at the National Zoo up the street are bringing an even larger   number of people into Washington than is normally the case at this time of the year   Overall though, I would say that the situation doesn’t look so good  Automobile and   other durable goods sales--sales of big-ticket items--have been quite soft pretty much across our   region  Manufacturing activity weakened sharply further in April and in other recent months,   according to the reports we get  Furniture manufacturing is a big industry in our District, as I’ve     5/15/01     38   said many times before, and it is very weak  Moreover, almost all the comments I hear from   people in that business--and I get a lot of information from that industry--are quite pessimistic   about the outlook  Labor markets have softened in our District as elsewhere  And we are seeing   rising vacancy rates in the office sector, especially in northern Virginia  I gather that’s also   happening in some other parts of the country, and we certainly see it in our region  So on   balance, I would say that conditions in our District are noticeably weaker than at the time of our   March meeting  And generally I think attitudes and confidence, especially among our business   contacts, are significantly weaker  A couple of months ago people thought  Yes, there’s a big   slowdown and it’s going to take a couple of months to get out of it, but by the time we get to the   second half of the year things are going to be moving up  We don’t hear that view much   anymore                      We surveyed approximately 35 firms in our District across a broad range of   manufacturing and services industries about their capital spending plans  As elsewhere,   companies are cutting back on these plans  Where investment is going forward, often it’s   because of stiffer environmental regulations rather than an improved economic outlook and more   optimism about the future                    I’ve mentioned the weakness in manufacturing in our District, and I have to tell you   that I’m becoming increasingly concerned about what I read and hear regarding the weakness in   manufacturing nationally   Like others, I was encouraged by the progress in the automobile   industry  It appeared that the situation in that sector was improving and inventories were being   brought under control  But as the Greenbook pointed out, quite clearly there is a significant   overhang in a wide range of other manufacturing industries, especially high-tech and other   equipment manufacturers  The prospect of correcting this overhang any time soon strikes me as     5/15/01     39   not terribly good  Spending on equipment, of course, declined in the first quarter for the second   consecutive quarter  As David Stockton noted, the latest data on new orders suggest that we’ll   have another decline not only in the growth rate of such spending but in the actual level of   expenditures  Also, I was struck by the mention in the Greenbook of the purchasing managers’   diffusion index for manufacturers’ expected capital spending  According to the Greenbook,   that’s now at its lowest level since May 1982, which was not a very good month  It was the   bottom of the deepest recession in the postwar period, so that particular statistic really got my   attention   All in all, I don’t think there’s a lot of evidence yet that the contraction in   manufacturing is bottoming out  Some people apparently have a different view  But from my   perspective at least, especially at the District level but also on the basis of what I read about   manufacturing nationally, I don’t see much evidence that it’s bottoming out  More importantly   though, as you pointed out, David, the sharp drop in overall payroll employment and the breadth   of that drop across sectors and industries of the economy raise the prospects that the weakness in   manufacturing is now spreading to other sectors of the economy   So, like Bob Parry, I think the downside risk in the current situation is substantial  Of   course, we’ve had some good news lately The retail sales figure for April was better than   expected and equity markets have stabilized  That to me suggests that the softness is being   contained, at least to some extent  We’re not in a free fall  And I think that’s probably because of   the aggressive action we’ve taken with monetary policy  But in that context I think we need to   recognize and keep in mind that the reason we have been free to move as swiftly and aggressively   as we have is that we’ve built up a substantial amount of credibility for low inflation in recent   years  And I think it’s precisely at times like these that the value of anchoring inflation     5/15/01     40   expectations is most evident  With this in mind, we need to be careful not to let our credibility   and the soothing effect it has had on inflation expectations, to date at least, fool us into easing   policy too much  We’re already seeing some warning signs  Long-term Treasury rates have   moved up by nearly 1/2 point since the March FOMC meeting, despite the further easing we’ve   put in place  That rise in long rates probably reflects some increase in financial market   expectations of stronger growth in the economy, as we have observed already  But the evidence   from indexed bond rates suggests that inflation expectations may have increased recently  Either   way, the market is telling us, I think, that we’re at risk of overdoing it   Boiling this all down, what it suggests to me is that we need to ease further today but   we need to do it in the context of a clear vision of where we’re going  Jerry Jordan’s comments   on this resonated with me  We need to think about the ultimate end of this process--what the end   game is, so to speak  I hope we can return to this point when we discuss policy later  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation generally  If I   may, let me make a few additional comments to indicate the way I’ve been thinking about this    As I said earlier when I made my economic statement, I believe it’s important to put what we do   in a context  And the context that I’m thinking of is the amount of overall leeway we have on the   real federal funds rate  It seems to me, given the outlook today, that we certainly should not move   the real funds rate below zero  I realize that there are some differences of opinion about inflation   expectations, but the Michigan survey, for example, is saying that one-year-ahead inflation   expectations are about 3 percent  If that’s the case, with the nominal funds rate currently at 4-1/2   percent, the real funds rate is something like 1-1/2 percent  I know one can argue about that but if   that’s about right, we don’t have a lot of downside leeway left   In reflecting on what we ought to do today, I found it helpful to look at the economic   situation the last time the real funds rate was at zero--which was roughly between September ’92   and September ’93--and to compare it with the current situation  In that earlier period, inflation   was 3 percent and drifting down, long rates were coming down, and we were running up against   financial headwinds  The unemployment rate was at 7 percent, higher than it is today  And trend   productivity growth was still weak; this was before we got into the late 1990s  The Government   deficit--remember those?--was still a problem then and there was talk about a tax increase to deal   with it   Today we have a very different situation  Inflation is about 3 percent and has been   drifting up, and long rates have been rising  Lending institutions now are well capitalized, so     5/15/01     84   we’re not looking at the financial headwinds we were experiencing then  The unemployment rate   is drifting up, but at 4-1/2 percent it is still at a relatively low level  We may have the advantage   of a couple additional points on trend productivity but we have a budget surplus and people are   talking about tax reduction  The zero real funds rate policy that we had in the earlier period   worked well, I think  In my view it helped to lay a solid financial and monetary foundation for   the fine economic performance that we had in the late 1990s  But my comparison of the two   periods suggests to me that if the overall economy were at a bottom now, a zero real funds rate   might be too low in the context of the leeway target I mentioned earlier  I think that’s important    In any case, this led me to think about our decision this morning in the following way    Though I guess no one has thought very seriously about the 75 basis point alternative that was in   the Bluebook, clearly, against the background that I’ve tried to lay out, that would be too much    It could push the real rate lower than we would want it to be once the economy hit bottom and   began to turn up  On the other side of the argument, I believe a case could be made for a   reduction of only 25 basis points today  And there’s a big part of me that thinks I ought to be   making that case!  But obviously that would disappoint expectations  It would risk prolonging the   time before the economy gets to a bottom and might make the bottom deeper than we need it to   be  So by process of elimination I come out where you are, with 50 basis points as the right move   today    For me a really key point is that if we reduce the funds rate by that amount, we’re   going to reduce that leeway--based on the way I’m looking at it--significantly further  And this   might be where I differ with you a bit  Having reduced that leeway, I think we ought to be very   careful with respect to the expectations we foster about where we’re going from here  In my   view, it would be helpful to signal the markets now that there’s a limit to this process and that we     5/15/01     85   may be closing in on it  We could go to a symmetric or balanced risk statement; I think a case   could be made for that  But if we drop the rate 50 basis points and keep the asymmetric risk   statement--which is, of course, expected--at a minimum I would hope that the press release   language would suggest that we may be closing in on the limit of this easing process  I believe   we should begin to get that idea built in, within the context of where we are going in the long run   Thank you     I think this statement as drafted is very likely to build into the   yield curve another 50 basis point move at our next meeting  Our statement doesn’t have to say   anything about our being at the end of the easing process  If it simply indicated that with this   additional move we have put a significant amount of stimulus into the economy to try to deal   with the downside risks--which get so much emphasis in the draft--it would be at least a weak   signal that this process can’t go on forever  Repeating what I said earlier, I would love to see   some wording that would give some sense of that, because I think it might serve us well going   forward  That would be my thoughts on this     5/15/01     95    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The overall economic picture in our   District has not changed markedly over the last several weeks  Manufacturing activity continues   to decline, although perhaps at a bit slower pace than earlier  The key issue, of course, as     8/21/01 13   highlighted in the Beige Book summary, is whether the weakness in the manufacturing sector is   going to spill over into other sectors of the economy  I don’t think we have any very conclusive   evidence regarding that in our District  I read a book recently that talked about a tourist at Fort   Sumter asking a guide why so many Civil War battles were fought at national parks [laughter] so   I’m very skittish, even more so than usual, about ascribing causality  However, retail sales have   weakened in our area in recent weeks, in contrast to the national data, and it seems reasonable to   me to speculate that at least some of this weakness reflects the softness in manufacturing  And   the problems from high-tech manufacturing and related industries clearly are contributing to   what appears to be a growing weakness in commercial real estate and commercial construction   activity in parts of our District where high-tech activity is concentrated, such as Northern   Virginia and the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina     We don’t see in our region any definitive indication that manufacturing is bottoming   out yet, but there are at least a few straws in the wind  I have a contact in a sizable trucking   company that is based in Richmond but does a lot of business with the furniture manufacturers   and others in the Carolinas His firm does a large volume of business and it’s broadly spread,   and I think he’s a reliable source of information  He tells me that his customers’ shipments have   been stabilizing most recently and that several manufacturing operations in the Carolinas are   telling him that conditions are at least not getting any worse  Elsewhere, revenues in District   service industries other than retailing continue to grow at a healthy pace, according to the   monthly service sector survey we do And residential sales and construction activity are holding   at their recent high levels   So to summarize on the District, we have not seen a lot of change except perhaps some   negative spillover from manufacturing to other sectors of the economy  But there is a glimmer     8/21/01 14   of an inflection point in manufacturing, to use a phrase that Jeff Lacker coined the other day     The Greenbook forecast for the national economy has an inflection point of its own    The forecast calls for the decline in the rate of real GDP growth to end in the second quarter and   for growth to reaccelerate gradually this year and next year  There are obviously significant   downside risks in this forecast, and David has noted a number of them  One is the projected   return of business investment to at least a moderate upward trajectory next spring; it could take   longer Consumer spending could be significantly weaker than projected for any number of   reasons, and all the downside risks in the domestic outlook obviously are compounded by the   cumulating weakness in the international economy     But in my view there are also some modest signs of improvement  The retail sales   report for the month of July, released recently, got my attention  I think it’s quite positive when   one digs down into the details It’s only one monthly report to be sure, but it is at least consistent   with the idea that the reduction in energy prices--or the anticipation of declining energy prices--  and the significant monetary stimulus already in the pipeline may be shoring up household   spending Elsewhere, manufacturing activity as measured in the industrial production index was   flat last month after a long series of monthly declines  Even when one abstracts from the strong   motor vehicle production, what is left is a decline but a smaller decline than we’ve seen for a   number of months  Job markets are still softening but overall the July report suggests that they   may not be softening quite as rapidly as had been feared earlier  And all of these developments   are reinforced by the continuing strength in residential construction     The current view in financial markets, as reported in the media at least, seems to be   that a bottoming out in the economy is now further out in the future than most people had   thought several weeks ago The recent information I just cited suggests that the gradual upturn     8/21/01 15   in the economy, as projected in the Greenbook, is actually a little more plausible now than it   might have been at the time of our last meeting, or at least it seems that way to me  The   implication of this for policy, in my view, is that the economy could turn up sooner rather than   later, although that’s certainly not a sure thing  And if it does, with unemployment still relatively   low and the real funds rate quite low, we may need to reverse course promptly and remove some   of the stimulus that is currently in the pipeline  Historically, this has always been a very difficult   thing for the Fed to do So I think we need to begin to prepare ourselves as well as the public for   this possibility, in the absence of a marked further weakening in the economic outlook  Thank   you    Mr Chairman, if you’ll forgive a personal note, let me make a   couple of comments here After our meeting in June, where I supported a quarter point reduction   in the funds rate, one of my FOMC colleagues came up to me and said “Gee, you’re really   changing stripes Where is the old inflation hawk I used to know?”    And that’s a fair question  But the answer I would give to the   question is that I can remember when the Committee did not have full credibility  A lot of us   were saying then that if we could ever achieve credibility, that would give us greater flexibility   to move the funds rate in the short run in conjunction with changes in economic conditions    And, of course, now I think we do have considerable credibility  And with the downside risks   still quite substantial, as you and others have mentioned, I think we need to take advantage of   that credibility  To say the same thing a bit differently  Unlike the situation in a number of   earlier postwar episodes, we don’t need a recession to contain inflation or inflation expectations     8/21/01 75   at this point  We may have a recession ultimately or we may not  But if we do, I think it’s   important that the Fed not be perceived as contributing to it--or worse, actually causing it  So   I’m not ready to disappoint market expectations today  Therefore, I agree with you and I favor   going ahead with the expected quarter point reduction  If we don’t, I think it would be a big   surprise and quite disruptive   Having said that, there isn’t any doubt, though, that the real funds rate is not very far   above zero And if the economy is near a bottom--and here is where I might disagree with you a   bit because it seems to me that there’s at least some mild evidence that it could be--I think we   need to be prepared to reverse course if necessary and to begin to tighten policy   But more to the point--and this is really the main point I would make--I think we need   to prepare the markets and the general public for that possibility, which I don’t think we’ve done   adequately to this point There are lots of ways to do it  One way would be to go ahead and drop   the rate a quarter of a point at this meeting and go to a symmetric directive  However, I agree   that that would be pushing it Nevertheless, I do believe that our statement, which is now an   increasingly important signal of what we may be doing down the road, should indicate clearly   that there’s at least a possibility that the easing cycle may now be approaching an end  Our   objective ought to be to try to preempt as much as we can the quick development of market   expectations of yet another rate cut at the next meeting, so that we’ll have greater flexibility at   that meeting  So I would hope that our statement this time might have some language like that    I think that helps, Bill  But given the level of the funds rate now,   I think an additional phrase might be prudent  I’m not sure I’m selling this to anybody here!    [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in our   District seems to have advanced at a modest pace in August but it weakened sharply in   September  Some of the anecdotal and survey information we’ve received indicates that   activity would have slowed in September even in the absence of the attacks  Of course,   we did have the attacks and they’ve had the same extremely negative impact on our   region as they’ve had elsewhere in the country, as we’ve heard around the table this   morning Part of the drop in activity in our region might be temporary, if the terrorist   threat can be reasonably well contained   As several others have noted about their Districts, we too experienced a big   drop in retail sales initially but in general they’ve come back to earlier levels since then    The exception is automobile sales, which have rebounded some but not to the levels we   were seeing before the attacks occurred In the manufacturing sector, early on there were   some supply disruptions and some disruptions in shipments to customers, but at least for   the time being those seem to have subsided  In our region as elsewhere the big hit, and   probably the more permanent hit, is to the travel and tourist industries  Tourist activity   here in Washington is usually very substantial at this time of the year and it is at a much   lower level now than normally     10/2/01 57   With respect to the airlines,                the airline headquartered in our District, just on the other side of the   Potomac river  It was an airline in trouble--its condition was very shaky--even before the   crisis  The company has announced 11,000 layoffs and a lot of those will be in our   District I think a good number of them will be right here in the Washington area  Also,   beyond the layoffs, the US Airways hub in Charlotte has for a long time been a   foundation for the growth and strength we’ve seen in that city over the last 15 years or so    So there is concern about that area   With respect to the national economy, I think the data indicated pretty clearly   that economic activity might be weakening even before the attacks  We had a run-up in   the unemployment rate and, of course, manufacturing was still contracting despite the   somewhat optimistic purchasing managers’ report we got a month ago  With wages and   home values rising, consumer spending was still holding up reasonably well going into   the crisis  But the sharp increase in unemployment and evidence that housing demand   and home prices might be beginning to soften have contributed to the deterioration in   consumer confidence that I think was evident even before the terrorists struck     Against this background, the September 11th attacks, of course, have added to   the anxiety and uncertainty that households, business firms, and investors were to some   extent already experiencing before the attacks occurred  Those concerns showed up   initially in asset markets  The negative impact on asset markets appears at least for the   moment to be reasonably well contained under the circumstances, but obviously the level   of anxiety in those markets is still very high  With a recession increasingly likely,   consumers feel exposed to the risk of losing their jobs as well as to other risks and,     10/2/01 58   therefore, are likely to spend less and save more out of current income in order to build   their precautionary balances  And businesses, whose investment returns are now subject   to a greater degree of risk than before the attacks, will probably cut back on their   investment plans even further than they already have, at least for a time   Barring any further attacks and resulting increase in anxiety, some of these   effects may prove temporary  As households get their precautionary balances and asset   positions back up to the higher level they may now desire, presumably they will again   begin to spend a more normal fraction of their current income  And when business firms   get to the point where they think they have sufficient liquidity to deal with the   contingencies they’re concerned about, presumably they will begin to redirect a greater   portion of their earnings to investment     Even so, it seems clear to me that the downside risk in the near-term outlook is   significantly greater than the upside risk, at least for the time being  I don’t really see   much upside risk in this situation, and I think we need to recognize that a significant   cumulative contraction can’t be ruled out even in the absence of further terrorist activity   In light of this risk, I think it’s worth noting that the Greenbook is projecting a   relatively mild and brief recession ending in the first quarter of next year  In my view it’s   a plausible point forecast  One reason it’s plausible is that economic policy and other   public policies at the moment are well positioned to cushion the downturn that we   currently anticipate  Tax cuts are in place; rebates have been paid out; and there’s a good   likelihood that military spending will increase  We’re likely to see more public spending   on security here at home Perhaps most importantly though, thanks to our actions over   the last decade or more, the Fed generally as an institution--and Fed monetary policy     10/2/01 59   specifically--probably has as much credibility for low inflation as it has ever had  And   inflation expectations have been declining so far this year  This to me is the big   difference between the situation we face today and the one we faced in the early 1990s    Consequently, I think we can probably move interest rates still lower without triggering   an inflation scare in bond markets  The question Cathy Minehan raised about what the   bond markets are telling us with regard to inflation expectations is a very relevant one    But there are obviously other potential plausible explanations for what has been   happening in bond markets   The Greenbook projection assumes another 1/2 point cut in the funds rate   before the end of this year Frankly, I think there’s a strong case to go ahead and make   that move this morning  Having said that, I must say that I believe Jack Guynn made a   very good point We have been easing aggressively  I have favored this and I’m   comfortable with it And I would be comfortable with more easing this morning   precisely because of our enhanced credibility  But once a recovery gets under way--and   sooner or later that’s going to happen--I think we’re going to need to reverse course and   move in the other direction just as aggressively as we’ve eased  That will be necessary in   order to maintain our credibility, and in many ways I think that’s the most important   thing we have going for us in this situation Thank you, Mr Chairman    I support your recommendation     10/2/01 87    David, I just wanted to probe a bit more on the impact you project   from the assumed passage of legislation regarding a partial expensing provision  If you’re right in   your projection, that won’t make much of an impact until we get to the second quarter of 2002  But   from then on the effect is fairly significant  The analysis seems solid, but in an environment where   we have so much excess capacity and a great deal of pessimism, intuitively it’s a little hard for me to   connect to it Could you elaborate a little on that?  In particular, I wondered if you looked at this at   all from a disaggregated standpoint  In other words, I’m asking what particular industries might   react strongly to this provision if it is passed    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in our District appears   to have declined further in October, but perhaps a bit more moderately than in the weeks   immediately after the September 11 attacks  That partly reflects the pattern of retail sales, which   dropped less sharply in October than in September, due mainly to strong car sales in our region--as   elsewhere in the country--in response to the zero percent financing packages   A couple of weeks ago Jerry Jordan, who apparently has been spying in my District, told   me he had heard that a large annual boat show in Annapolis had surprisingly strong results  We   checked it out, Jerry, and you were right Sales were quite robust  But the reason given was that   people want to enjoy themselves while they still can!  [Laughter]  I don’t know whether that’s a   good signal or a bad signal   Many of the retailers we talked to over the last couple of weeks in an attempt to get some   sense of how they are approaching the holiday season, indicated that they are quite nervous about it   and accordingly are building holiday inventories very cautiously  Elsewhere in the District,   residential home sales and construction are still growing, but much more slowly than a year or so   ago We no longer see the signs of a possible bottoming in manufacturing activity that we thought     11/6/01 35   we might be seeing right before the terrorist attacks  In sum, with unemployment rising, both   households and business firms in our region are generally nervous, and I would describe many of   them as hunkering down   Turning to the national outlook, in short I think it’s problematic  The staff, as we know,   has marked down fourth-quarter real GDP growth to minus 3 percent at an annual rate  And they see   it remaining negative until the spring  On the face of it, one could see that as a pessimistic forecast   But in my view, as a number of other people have suggested, a strong case can be made that under   the circumstances it is an optimistic forecast with a considerable amount of downside risk  I say that   for three reasons First, the Greenbook is projecting a loss of payroll employment of about three-  quarters of a million jobs in the fourth quarter  Of course, we got more than half of that in October   so the staff may already have revised that quarterly number, though I haven’t seen it  In any case,   we could get significantly greater job losses in this quarter  Second, the Greenbook still projects that   the unemployment rate will peak at around 6 percent or perhaps a little higher  That would be a   cumulative increase from the low point of a little more than 2 percentage points  But in four of the   five recessions since 1970 the cumulative increase in the unemployment rate has been somewhere   between 3 and 4 percentage points Only in the unusually brief and quite atypical 1980 recession   was the cumulative rise limited to only about 2 percentage points  Based on past experience, I think   it’s reasonable to expect that the 1-1/2 percentage point increase in unemployment that has already   occurred will weaken household confidence further, continue to depress spending growth, and cause   still more job losses and so forth  Third, the possibility of higher than projected unemployment in   and of itself is not the only downside risk in this situation  Historically, rising unemployment in   recessions has been associated with disinflation  The Greenbook is projecting some disinflation this   time around, of course, but it is relatively mild  The slower growth in projected wages due to the     11/6/01 36   slack in the labor markets is accompanied by a slowing in productivity growth, so the decline in unit   labor costs is restrained by that  But the disinflation could be more pronounced than projected  For   the last several decades, disinflation has been seen as a good thing and many of us around this table   have spent the better part of our Fed careers promoting it  But it is a potential problem today    My main point, and this has been alluded to already, is that in past recessions the Fed has   had the leeway to cut the nominal funds rate to keep the real funds rate from rising as disinflation   has run its course through these periods of weakness  Today, we have only 2-1/2 percentage points   of leeway left before the nominal funds rate hits the zero bound  We will have to match any further   disinflation with nominal funds rate cuts just to keep policy at the same place  But that’s going to   eat up part of the leeway to cut the real funds rate, which we may need to do in order to counteract   potentially serious weakness in the economy    I have always believed that price stability is the goal of monetary policy  I still believe   that Often in the past I’ve argued for policy actions to preempt inflation as over time--over a couple   of decades--we moved the trend inflation rate down  That was really the essence of our anti-  inflationary strategy And it has largely succeeded  But in my view the risk to price stability is   different today What we need to do now is to preempt disinflation--as novel as it is to think in those   terms--and do so fairly aggressively to guard against the potential problem of the zero bound I   mentioned a minute ago  Of course, the core PCE inflation rate, which is the measure I think most   of us now focus on, is currently about 1-1/2 percent I think that’s pretty close to the inflation target   we should be aiming for at this stage, for the reasons I just noted  And I believe we should focus our   short-term policy actions, as best we can, on preventing that particular measure of inflation from   falling much below 1 percent      I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I support it   strongly    I think that’s very good I’d suggest the language “may restrain   advances in productivity,” which is shorter and less awkward     I don’t have a whole lot to say about our District economy that is new    Overall activity seems to have continued to decline in November  In particular, retail activity in our   region fell sharply in November, based on information we received in the monthly survey we conduct    Much of the decline seems to be the result of a drop-off in car sales  Moreover, most of the retailers   that we talked to are not optimistic about the holiday season  There’s a lot of discounting going on at   all levels and in all categories of stores  Only the big box discounters like Wal-Mart and Target seem   to be having fairly good results so far   In the manufacturing sector also the news that we’re receiving is not favorable  Shipments,   new orders, and order backlogs all declined further in November overall  Many manufacturing   companies are either reducing their capital budgets further or freezing them  A few manufacturers   among those we talk with regularly did report some pickup in business and a few indicated that they’re     12/11/01 45    reconsidering some of their earlier decisions to cut capital spending  But those firms are definitely in   the minority   On the national economy, clearly there may be more reason for optimism regarding the   outlook today than there was at our November meeting  Others have made a number of comments   about that already The stock market is up, Treasury bond rates are up, credit spreads have narrowed,   and the federal funds futures market suggests that market participants expect policy to be tightened   more aggressively next year than was expected earlier  There is some evidence, though I would say it   is limited, in the recent economic reports that the contraction in activity may be moderating  And at   least some indicators--the Michigan survey, for example--suggest that consumer confidence may be   stabilizing Also, the small increase in nondefense capital goods orders in October could be an   indication that the rate of decline in business spending on equipment may be slowing a bit  But in my   view the downside risks in the outlook are still material  So let me play Scrooge and underline them    Cathy Minehan and others have already made some of these points   First, I would suggest that the optimism so evident in financial markets may reflect to some   extent the assumption on the part of a lot of investors and others that this recession is going to end in   the spring because the average postwar recession has lasted about 11 months  But this assumption   may well be unwarranted if this recession is different from the go/stop kinds of cycles we have   experienced in recent decades  The optimism may also reflect confidence that fiscal stimulus will be   forthcoming and that when it comes it will be effective  But in my view--and others have said this   too--it’s not clear that fiscal stimulus will be forthcoming  And even if it is, it’s not clear to me that it   necessarily will be effective     Beyond that, the latest hard economic data we have are not as a whole rosy in my view    The Greenbook reports that, despite indications of somewhat more favorable news with respect to     12/11/01 46    equipment investment, the staff is now forecasting a very significant further drop in spending on   equipment and software in the current quarter  And while people have recognized the weakness in   labor markets, I wonder whether we may be minimizing just how weak that November job report was    After all, the level of payroll employment was about 200,000 jobs lower than had been anticipated   before the report was released And the rise in the unemployment rate over the last three months has   been the fastest increase in a long time--since 1982, I believe  Moreover, the drop in manufacturing   jobs, at 163,000, was the biggest decline so far in this cycle and, of course, that number has been   coming down now for a long time  With weak labor markets, of course, the risk is that the contraction   could be deeper and longer if household confidence is shaken  Confidence may be adversely affected   by job losses that have already been reported, if people are concerned about losing their jobs or about   the prospect for slower growth in wages and income     One other statistic that I think underlines the downside risk is the sharp deceleration in one-  year-ahead inflation expectations as measured by the median response in the latest Michigan survey    As Bob Parry mentioned, that number dropped from 28 percent in September to 04 percent in   November  The December survey showed a rebound, but the level is still much lower than in past   months, looking further back into the past  Some of this decline may be transitory, related to what is   happening to fuel prices and so forth But I think there are broader reasons to be concerned about   disinflation The Greenbook estimates that core PCE is currently running at a rate of about 1-1/2   percent and the staff is forecasting that it’s going to come down 1/2 point to 1 percent by 2003    Moreover, focusing again on labor markets, it seems to me quite plausible that the unemployment rate   could peak at a higher level than is now being projected in the Greenbook  If that happens, I think that   would have an impact on wages and also implications for disinflation going forward  Fortunately, to   this point our reductions in the nominal funds rate have prevented the disinflation that apparently     12/11/01 47    already has occurred from pushing up the real funds rate  But I continue to believe, given all the   information we have, that we need to do what we can to keep real short rates from rising in the near-  term future      I started to do that but in light of the reaction to what I said about West   Virginia last night, I thought that might not be wise  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, let me make a couple of comments that may make your   recommendation look a little more moderate and restrained  [Laughter]  There are certainly some   differences in the situation we face today from the one we were looking at when we met last month    But I think there are a lot of similarities as well  At the November meeting I favored a 50 basis point   reduction in the funds rate, which we eventually did, and I favored it very strongly and categorically    There were primarily two factors that conditioned my thinking  First, I didn’t see any evidence of   either inflation or rising inflation expectations anywhere  And second, given our high credibility, I   thought we would have time to reverse course, if we needed to, and move the rate back up  After all,   we did that in 1999, so we have had at least one recent experience when we were able to pull that off    Given these two preconditions, I thought we ought to use some of our credibility to ease policy   aggressively and to reduce the risk that disinflation might undercut the stimulative impact of the   reductions in the nominal funds rate we had engineered  I think those two preconditions are still in   place and in my view the policy risks today are much the same as those we faced last month     12/11/01 87    What I think we need to do above all is to avoid getting into a situation where inflation   expectations are quite low and we have the nominal funds rate close to zero  That’s the so-called zero   bound problem  It’s very difficult to get out of that, as I think we know  We don’t want to go there   As we discussed earlier in the meeting, inflation expectations in the Michigan survey have dropped   quite abruptly over the last several months as a whole  So I think that risk of a zero bound problem is   still with us  For that reason I believe a persuasive case can still be made for another 50 basis point   reduction today, using the current core PCE rate, which is about 1-1/2 percent, as our measure of   inflation That would take the real funds rate down roughly to zero  Now, granted, we’ve gotten into   difficulty in the longer-term past when we have pushed the real rate below zero--and this was   especially evident in the 1970s We took the real funds rate to zero in 1992--which is where a 50 basis   point reduction today would put it--and we did not get a subsequent increase in inflation  So I still   think the case is persuasive and in my view a 50 basis point cut is the best option  I recognize though   that the tone of the economic data is a bit stronger in some respects and in some places this time    Therefore the argument for a half point is a little less compelling today than it was last time  But if it   were my choice, I think that is the way I would go    Mr Chairman, if I could just make a couple of comments here  I   certainly think these studies are useful and worthwhile  If we get to the point that we don’t have   enough Treasury securities out there to do our job, it’s going to be helpful to have done these   studies and given some thought to these alternatives in advance  So I consider it a useful   exercise But I do have problems with both of the alternatives that are before us this morning  I   agree with what you just said about using foreign government securities as collateral for repos  I   think that could be very politically sensitive and this is at a time when we’re trying to put   together and maintain a coalition to fight terrorism around the world     The Ginnie Mae option may seem better at first glance, even taking account of the size of   the market and questions about liquidity and whatnot  After all, they do carry the full faith and   credit of the US government  But when I think about it, that may not be all that helpful in some   sense The loans we made a number of years ago to Chrysler and to Lockheed also carried the   full faith and credit of the US government  It worries me that we might set up a precedent or   convey the idea by dealing in GNMAs that in some sense full faith and credit is a sufficient   condition to hold securities or other kinds of assets in our SOMA portfolio  If that is the message     March 19, 2002 Page 13 of 117  conveyed, then I think there’s a possibility that in the future, when some other Chrysler-like debt   comes down the road, we might have to say yea or nay as to whether we’re going to hold that   particular asset I can imagine that that could put us in an uncomfortable position    Moreover, buying GNMAs themselves would pose problems  If we’re willing to buy   securities that support housing, then someone is going to ask why shouldn’t we buy securities to   support some other activity that the government thinks is worthy of the full faith and credit   designation Now, one might ask, Well, if the Treasury is willing to make that designation, why   should we be worried about it? But to me, in this situation, perception is reality  If we’re   perceived as being a part of some sectoral credit-allocation process, then in my view that could   be problematic for us, and I think we ought to avoid that    So I come back to something I tried to sell a while ago and didn’t have much luck  My   suggestion is that we find a way—or at least discuss with the Treasury the possibility of finding a   way—for them to increase the supply of Treasury securities for us to purchase if that need arises    I know this is a tough sell But we’re doing all these studies of other options, many of which—or   perhaps all of which—arguably are not all that attractive  So I just wonder if we couldn’t spend   a little time and effort to try to talk with Peter Fisher or whoever is the right person at the   Treasury to explore whether this concept might be feasible  I just throw that out as a suggestion    This will probably be my last speech about this, but I really have problems with these other   options    All I’m asking is that this one other option be put on the plate and   given some time and consideration     Well, I’m sure there are challenges and issues and mechanical   questions to deal with But that is the case with all of these other options  All I’m saying is that   I hate to see this possibility get dismissed pretty much out of hand    Well, that’s their business, I guess    Well, they don’t just have to buy assets  They can always reduce   taxes This doesn’t constrain fiscal policy     Well, I think both Cathy and Tom have made good points  These   disclosure issues are always difficult, but it’s generally helpful for me to try to get back to basics   and fundamentals when I think about these issues  The way I see our actions affecting the   economy, both short run and long run, is basically through the combined effects of what we do   on the funds rate, what we say in the statement, the tilt, and all the other information we release   as it relates to expectations and the yield curve  Against that background, I think greater   transparency is better than less transparency  And that includes earlier release of information in   most cases So I’m very much in favor of where you came out  I recognize Cathy’s point about   the slippery slope I see that that has merit  But I think there is some point where the slope is   going to flatten out before we get to the TV cameras stage in our room here  Maybe I’m too   optimistic, but that’s the way I feel about it     Even if we go with the recommendation you’ve made with respect to an immediate   announcement of the vote, I still think it would be a good idea—in fact this probably gives us   more reason—to bring the release of the minutes forward, as soon as possible  It might involve   some additional expense  But in the context of all the other funds we spend on monetary policy   and the private sector spends trying to figure out what we’re trying to do, it’s probably rather   minor  So I would hope that we would think about moving in that direction      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions have definitely improved in   our District since the last meeting, as seems to be the case elsewhere around the country         March 19, 2002 Page 59 of 117  Business people in our region are more optimistic than they were, but I would say that at this   point their optimism is still rather cautious, along the lines of the attitudes that Gary Stern and   some others have described for their Districts    Breaking it down a little, local areas in our District with a significant defense presence,   such as the Washington, DC, and the Norfolk, Virginia, areas, are recovering nicely  We are   also beginning to see some improvement in the District’s manufacturing base in the Carolinas    Furniture shipments and orders in particular have strengthened, presumably because of the   continued strength in housing nationwide  There has also been a glimmer of improvement for   the first time in a very long time in the textile industry  That probably is also related to housing   activity, and it has been quite a while since I’ve been able to say anything positive about that   industry We also see improved conditions in some other industries represented in our region,   notably plastics and chemicals  So there are certainly some signs that our region is participating   in the apparent revival of the economy nationally   Other indicators, though, suggest that while momentum is building, it is building at a   fairly moderate pace in our area  For example, what I hear about consumer spending in the   region is fairly positive, but I wouldn’t call it spectacular by any means  A number of retailers   tell us they still have to do a lot of discounting to move particular goods and services    Employment appears to have stopped declining in the region, but as far as I can tell it really   hasn’t turned up sharply yet And we still hear a few announcements of layoffs from time to   time, although not nearly as many as we did last fall   The revised Greenbook projections, of course, indicate a more pronounced improvement   in the national outlook than some of the anecdotal comments I just summarized for our region   might suggest  But the projections are certainly plausible, given the strength of the latest data  It              March 19, 2002 Page 60 of 117  may well be that the anecdotal information I’m  hearing is a little behind the curve, given the   rapidity of the evolution of conditions generally  I also, like Bob McTeer, thought Dave did a   great job with his briefing, and I think the lessons were well stated and well taken  Still, the   revisions from the last Greenbook to this one—and I’ve been looking at the Greenbooks for   many years—are about as dramatic as any I can remember  The staff now expects real GDP to   grow at a rate of 4 percent in the first half compared with 2 percent predicted only seven weeks   ago For me perhaps the most striking change is the 2 percentage point upward revision in the   projection for real GDP growth in the first quarter despite a fairly significant downward revision   in the contribution from a slower pace of inventory liquidation  Of course, the difference is a big   change in the projection of private domestic final purchases, which are now expected to grow at   a 2 percent rate in the quarter as compared with the earlier projection of a 2½ percent rate of   decline in the January Greenbook As a lot of people have said, this apparent dramatic   strengthening of final demand obviously reduces the downside risks that many of us, myself   included, were very worried about last fall   Moreover, the net growth in jobs in February, even if some of it was due to favorable   weather conditions, suggests to me that the labor market may be stabilizing  I think that’s very   important because, if that is the case, it would reduce job security as a concern among   consumers  And continued solid growth in jobs and real wages is needed to support consumer   growth at the 2 to 3 percent range projected in the Greenbook     Finally, the improvement in the manufacturing and industrial sectors of the economy at   the national level—in addition to the regional improvement that I mentioned earlier—also   reduces the downside risks looking forward because the weakness had been concentrated in those   sectors  It now appears that manufacturing output will rise in the first quarter for the first time        March 19, 2002 Page 61 of 117  since the summer of 2000 The prospects for manufacturing activity will brighten further if the   significant improvement in business spending for equipment projected in the Greenbook actually   materializes    Against this background, it seems clear that the key question regarding the near-term   outlook for the economy from the perspective of policy—and others have alluded to this—is how   strong the early stages of this recovery will be  I think the answer to that question is going to   turn in large part on the timing and the profile of the swing from inventory liquidation to   inventory accumulation that presumably the economy is now in the process of going through    The Greenbook expects continued inventory liquidation, albeit at a progressively slower rate,   through the middle of the year with actual restocking only beginning thereafter  I think the turn   actually could come sooner due to stronger expected sales growth  If it does, that could have a   significant impact on the behavior of the economy in the months ahead, which has implications   for our policy in the near term that we need to think about when we have our go-around on   policy later Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I’d like to make just   a quick comment, following up on what Bill Poole said about how we would be looking at this   process of tightening in the next few weeks and months  In my view it’s important that our   behavior as we move in this direction is symmetric with our behavior on the downside  We   eased policy very aggressively last year I supported that, and I believe it was appropriate  In   fact, one can argue that those actions may have contained and restrained the recession  We were   able to do that because we had credibility; our credibility was well established  I think we now   need to move as aggressively on the upside as necessary to maintain that credibility so that we   will be well positioned in the future          March 19, 2002 Page 93 of 117  Actually I think one could make a case for tightening policy today, but I agree with your   recommendation  I would say that I like very much your suggestion that we use the term    “accommodative” in our statement because I believe many in the market will see that as   something very close to a switch in the tilt by two notches to a tilt toward tightness, which would   position us if necessary to move the rate even before the May meeting  It’s a long intermeeting   interval, and a lot could emerge in that period, and I think we ought to consider that possibility if   we need to    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The information we’re getting on the   Fifth District economy currently is quite consistent with the national picture painted in the   Greenbook Growth at the national level for now is being driven primarily by diminished   liquidation of goods inventories, and the same seems clearly to be true in our region  In some   contrast to your region, Cathy, manufacturing is really the strongest sector in our District; factory   orders and shipments have been rising for several months  And like Jerry, we’ve seen significant   strength in the last several weeks in the furniture industry  I’ve been more or less attaching that   to the strength in housing, but other forces along the lines of what you talked about may be at            May 7, 2002 43 of 81  work as well Most manufacturers we’re in contact with are reasonably optimistic that their   production will continue to increase over the near term  Elsewhere in the District economy the   picture is much more mixed  Retail sales softened in April  We don’t see any significant   upswing in business capital spending On the other hand, new home construction and sales are   still quite solid So again, what we’re seeing in the Fifth District I would say basically reinforces   the Greenbook’s overall portrayal of national conditions and does not in any way present a really   divergent view   With respect to the national economy, the Greenbook projects a steady increase in the   growth of final demand—at least as measured by the growth of private final domestic   purchases— through the projection period  I think that’s a reasonable point forecast  After all,   real PCE grew at a healthy rate of 3½ percent in the first quarter  And while business fixed   investment did contract again, the rate of contraction was the smallest since the first quarter of   last year So again, a moderate but steady acceleration of final demand is certainly a plausible   projection   But as always there are risks in any forecast, and I think there are risks in this forecast  In   particular, job growth remained weak in April  Payroll employment grew by only 43,000 jobs   last month, well below the trend growth in the labor force  Earlier reports of increases in jobs in   both February and March have subsequently been revised away, and the index of aggregate   hours worked appears likely to fall again in the current quarter as it did in the first quarter  Even   as job growth stayed sluggish in April, the labor force expanded significantly, driving the   unemployment rate up to 6 percent  And not surprisingly in this situation, the softening labor   compensation that we saw beginning last year continued in April             May 7, 2002 44 of 81  Now for me these labor market developments pose at least two significant downside   risks First, obviously, rising unemployment could undermine consumer confidence by creating   doubts about job security You mentioned job security, Dave; I actually think the downside risk   from rising unemployment could be broader than that if it constrains real wage and income   growth Second, labor market slack may foster disinflation, which would increase the real funds   rate Indeed, there is already evidence of disinflation in the works—for example, in the data for   the core PCE Between November 2000 and November 2001, the core PCE increased   16 percent; over the period since then, which is about six months, it has risen at a rate of only   06 percent If that 1 percentage point disinflation were to persist, it would eventually translate   into a 1 percentage point increase in the real funds rate, other things being equal  Moreover, the   interplay of slack labor markets and rising productivity compounds the disinflation risk in my   view Productivity grew at a 5½ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and apparently at an   extraordinary 8½ percent rate in the first quarter  Much of that, as we’ve discussed, undoubtedly   was cyclical and won’t persist  Nonetheless, such strong growth in measured productivity   suggests that the underlying trend may be at or above the 2½ to 3 percent average annual rate   achieved back in the late 1990s Consequently, given the weakness in labor markets, we may be   facing a situation where productivity growth remains high enough in relation to wage growth to   cause unit labor costs to fall persistently going forward, which again in my view would   compound the risk of disinflation  To avoid this outcome, aggregate demand would need to   grow at least as rapidly as productivity on average in coming quarters to stabilize labor markets   and contain the decline in unit labor costs  But obviously that won’t happen if the current   weakness in business investment persists or consumer spending softens or both  If aggregate            May 7, 2002 45 of 81  demand growth did fall behind productivity growth, labor market conditions would continue to   deteriorate, and the disinflation risk would intensify    I’m well aware, as a number of people have said, that our current funds rate target may be   as much as 3 percentage points below the rate consistent with long-term sustainable   noninflationary growth when trend productivity growth may be as high as 2½ or 3 percent or   even higher As I think Jerry mentioned, if the recovery gains momentum and households and   firms become more confident that the expansion will continue, firms at that point may rush to   hire workers and rebuild stocks in a way that could threaten inflation  But given our current   credibility for low inflation and our demonstrated willingness since the mid-1990s to tighten   policy promptly and significantly when we need to, I think we have leeway to wait until that   need arises much more clearly than it has to date  So in short, I can accept the risk of being   insufficiently preemptive on inflation to address what strike me as substantial downside risks in   the current recovery Don’t misunderstand me  I’m not arguing for a shift in the bias back to   ease, but I do think we definitely should not make any move toward a tighter policy today    I’d just like to make a quick pitch, Mr Chairman, to have this   “perfect foresight” simulation in every Bluebook  I find that very helpful because it allows us to   consider short-run policy alternatives in the context of a longer-run strategy that really is focused   on our goals If we have more discussion of it along the lines of Bob’s comment, I think that’s   all to the good But if we could have something like that in every Bluebook, that would be very   useful    I concur    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First on the region, our District economy   clearly lost momentum in recent weeks  Both factory shipments and auto sales were flat in July   after rising significantly earlier this year  More broadly, our business contacts from the furniture   industry and other principal regional industries tell us that demand is weak and hence factories   are reducing output and hiring All of this, not surprisingly, is affecting capital spending plans  I   probably had twenty or more people in various manufacturing companies tell me that whatever    little capital spending is going on now is aimed almost entirely at increasing productivity rather   than enlarging capacity So the manufacturing sector, which of course is a big part of our   District economy, clearly is showing signs of weakness, at least for the moment     Not all of the news in the region is gloomy, though  Housing activity in our District, as   elsewhere, is still strong pretty much across the board  But business expectations overall in our   area are clearly more downbeat and pessimistic than they were at the time of the last FOMC   meeting  These expectations were summed up rather well, I think, by a comment I heard   recently from a guy in the furniture industry  He said the good news was that a recent survey   they had done showed that 67 percent of American households had definite plans to buy   furniture The bad news was that they didn’t know when  [Laughter]   Turning to the national economy, the period since our June meeting was a remarkably   unsettled and, in my view, unsettling period  Financial markets were obviously nervous and   pessimistic, and much of the latest economic data—such as the 10 point drop in the new orders   component of the ISM index and the decline in weekly hours in July—rather dramatically   confirmed the reluctance of both businesses and households to make future spending   commitments  Taking all of the quantifiable negatives into account, the staff has revised its   forecast for the second half down a full percentage point, to 2½ percent  I think that’s reasonable               August 13, 2002 43 of 92  under the circumstances  But the softening in the economy in the projection is expected only to   delay the recovery not to derail it  The problem, of course—and I know the staff is well aware of   this—is that there are currently an unusually large number of significant downside risks in the   outlook that are very difficult to quantify and to incorporate in a forecast  Those risks include,   for example, the possibility of a renewed and perhaps sharper drop in stock prices than we’ve   already seen, a war in the Middle East, financial collapse in Brazil, or another terrorist attack in   the United States  There are positives in the picture  Structural productivity growth still appears   to be running above 2 percent The Fed has now achieved price stability, and we have in place, I   would argue, a highly stimulative monetary policy as indexed by the zero real funds rate  But   these positives may be insufficient to shield the recovery if one of the downside possibilities   were actually to materialize   Broadly, the challenge for policy in this situation is that the tentative character of the   current recovery—and “tentative” is the word I would use to describe it—makes it very   vulnerable to negative shocks, especially with the nominal funds rate near the zero bound  Since   we’ve achieved credible price stability, I think it’s reasonable and natural for us to ask whether   we might ease policy today to speed the economy up just a bit and reduce that vulnerability to an   unanticipated negative shock   Last November I strongly favored a preemptive policy easing in the situation we faced at   the time  But I would not favor such a move today  I think there are significant differences in   the two situations Back in November we were still responding to the immediate fallout from   September 11  We had seen the fastest increase in the unemployment rate since the 1981-82   recession and a substantial widening in the output gap that threatened a big acceleration in   disinflation and, with the proximity to the zero bound, actually posed the risk of deflation  We         August 13, 2002 44 of 92  haven’t experienced another shock like September 11 at this point, and both the unemployment   rate and the output gap, at least for now, are relatively stable Again, the real funds rate is   already at or near the zero level Our experience with go-stop monetary policy in the past—and   this goes to a point that Tony made a minute ago—teaches us that the Fed isn’t likely to be able   to speed up the recovery by making the real funds rate negative without sowing the seeds of   future inflation We haven’t talked about that much lately, but that can happen  Too much   monetary stimulus could sow the seeds of inflation that over time could destabilize the   economy—maybe not in the near future but at some point down the road   I can think of circumstances where we might want to ease  If inflation drifts down, we   obviously should reduce the nominal funds rate to prevent the real funds rate from rising  If the   disinflation were sharp enough, I think we should consider reducing the real funds rate below   zero temporarily to preempt deflation  And if we experience another substantial negative shock   that disrupts financial markets, then too we should consider making the real rate negative to   preempt the widening of the output gap that again would pose a risk of deflation  But we’re not   faced with any of these conditions yet, as I see it  Thank you    Mr Chairman, as I said earlier, I don’t favor easing policy further   today I would not favor moving the tilt either at this stage  To me the key factor—and many   people have made this point—is that policy is already very accommodative  The real funds rate   is already very close to zero if not at zero  Since we haven’t experienced another really big   negative shock that threatens the stability of financial markets to the extent that the September 11   shock did and since we’re not facing significant further disinflation or a real threat of deflation   yet, I would ask what we expect to accomplish by signaling an increased probability of further   easing at some point fairly soon  I’ve thought about this, and the only thing that comes to mind   is that we want to show the public that we feel its pain or share its fear and that we’re not   insensitive to the downside risks in the outlook  I can certainly understand that  But I don’t   think that’s a persuasive argument in the current circumstance, given how accommodative our            August 13, 2002 77 of 92  policy already is Moreover, and this is the key point I would make, I think there’s a cost  I   believe that changing the tilt today could cause some confusion  In my view, many people when   they think about the economy are focused on whether or not it is going to move back into a   recession I think that’s more or less the issue that they see us dealing with here  And if we   move the tilt, that is going to suggest to a lot of people that we are putting higher odds now on   the economy dropping back into recession than we  probably as a group really are, even though I   know we’re less optimistic than we were  I worry that by trying to use the tilt to sort of create   the appearance that we’re doing something actually might reduce confidence rather than bolster   confidence So that would be my take on it    I have a question for David  The staff forecast certainly seems   reasonable to me, David, but obviously there are always risks of error on both sides of a forecast   such as this In that context, I always find the alternative scenarios provided in the Greenbook   helpful and useful to think through  With that in mind, I would ask, Have you considered an   alternative scenario that combines  several of the downside risks covered in your simulations or   maybe even adds a couple?  One could think of a situation where investment remains weak,   housing activity stops, and there is heightened fear of a terrorist attack because of some event   somewhere in the world that keeps consumers out of shops for a while  One could perhaps add   in for good measure a further slump in the stock market  What I’m trying to get at here is, What   kind of conditions would be required to push us into a deflationary situation?  And if we were           September 24, 2002 20 of 115  confronted with such a situation, how persistent would that be and how responsive would it be to   the policy actions we might take?    Thank you, Mr Chairman The first sentence of the Beige Book   summary says that economic activity has slowed in most Districts but with considerable   variation across sectors of the economy That describes my District very well  On the weak   side, just to give you a bit of the detail, manufacturing activity has clearly softened appreciably   lately That includes the furniture industry, a fact that is a bit disappointing because one might   think it would be stimulated to some extent by the continued strength in new home construction   and sales I spoke to the CEO of one of the larger North Carolina furniture companies, and his   theory is that younger families are stretching so hard to pay the elevated prices for new homes   that once they move in they have to sleep on the floor!  [Laughter] The other really weak sector     September 24, 2002 49 of 115  in the District is agriculture Of course, we’re not the nation’s breadbasket, but like you folks in   the Kansas City District and elsewhere in the midsection of the country, Tom, our farmers are   suffering mightily from the severe drought we’ve had on the East Coast  Those are the   comments I would make regarding the weak side     On the brighter side, as I suggested earlier, housing activity is still quite robust across our   region Ditto for new car sales It seems as if all the Reserve Banks met with their small   business councils in the last couple of weeks, and we did too  I had at least one favorable report   out of that meeting  One of our members reported that a power tool company that had earlier   moved a plant from South Carolina to Mexico recently had moved it back to South Carolina  My   council members speculated that this was because most of the Mexican workforce has now   moved to the United States and a lot of them are living in South Carolina  [Laughter] Seriously,   with respect to the sectors that are perhaps most problematic for the national outlook, despite the   weakness in manufacturing we do hear some reports of a gradual pickup in capital spending  But   my sense is that most of this involves equipment replacement, driven by the shorter useful lives   of much of today’s equipment and the tax incentives that were introduced earlier in the year  It   doesn’t seem to us to reflect any significant, increased optimism among business people about   the near-term and intermediate-term outlook  And finally on the District, our labor markets   remain generally soft pretty much across the region  So we see a mixed picture in our region   overall, leaning on balance to the weak side for the moment   With respect to the national outlook, personally I am reasonably comfortable with the   Greenbook forecast I believe it’s plausible and, frankly, while it’s not a roaring forecast, under   the circumstances I think it would not be a bad outcome if it materialized  But as I said earlier   when I asked that question of David, as always there are risks in the projections on both the        September 24, 2002 50 of 115  upside and the downside Of course, most of the focus currently is on the downside risks, and   I’ll come back to that  I would say, though, just to cover the full range of possibilities, that I   think—and I guess I differ with Jack Guynn a little on this—there is still some potential for an   upside surprise given what in my view is an accommodative current policy stance  Of course,   that is recognized in a couple of the alternative scenarios you put out, David  And a number of   Jerry Jordan’s comments resonate with me  I think there’s an upside possibility   What seems to be damping the recovery now is a quite pervasive caution in the business   sector Firms are reluctant to make commitments for fear that a sustained expansion is not going   to take hold and because of the uncertainty regarding Iraq  But if growth picks up as the   Greenbook projects, this caution and the headwinds it creates could dissipate  The point I would   make here is that it could dissipate fairly quickly at some point in a manner similar to what   occurred in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994  In that event we would need to react promptly   and preemptively as we did in 1994  I believe we would do that  So unlike my concerns in the   past, I think we’re pretty well covered on the upside at least for now   Again though, as several people have pointed out, most of the focus now does seem to be   on the downside risks That certainly seems to be the sense of the majority of comments around   the table this morning, and it was the sense at our last meeting when we moved to the tilt toward   weakness in our statement  Broadly, my view is that our current stance, which again I think is   quite accommodative, is sufficient to handle what I would term garden variety downside risks,   like persistent longer-than-expected business caution, somewhat weaker-than-anticipated   consumer spending, or perhaps a moderate deceleration in housing activity  What worries me—   and this will really make you comfortable, Jerry—is a very serious downside scenario featuring a        September 24, 2002 51 of 115  sharp further drop in household and business confidence and spending and a credible threat of   deflation that will bring us face to face with the zero bound   Let me just add a quick footnote on that  We discussed this issue at length in our special   topics session in January I thought it was a very good and complete discussion  I didn’t have   the sense, though, that we reached much, if any, consensus regarding how we would respond in   practice, operationally, if such a situation emerged  It appears to me that currently the Federal   Reserve is quite appropriately doing extensive contingency planning with respect to a number of   our operations around the System  Ironically, I’m not at all sure that this Committee is fully   prepared to deal with a zero bound contingency if we’re suddenly confronted by it  And that   strikes me as a fairly glaring omission in the System’s overall current contingency planning  I   don’t know exactly the best way to tackle this problem, but in general it seems to me that we   should perhaps consider bringing together the right people to review the options we have if a   situation like this arises  I think we laid those options out pretty well in the discussion in   January I would like to see us determine what the most credible options would be and then have   that group help us think a bit about how we would implement some of these options if we were   suddenly in a position to have to do that Thank you    Mr Chairman, I strongly support your recommendation  I want to   make clear that what I was talking about earlier was contingency planning—thinking about what   we would do if we hit the zero bound—and that’s a different issue  But with respect to the   immediate situation, looking at the whole probability distribution around the forecast and not just   one tail of it, I think staying with our current stance is best for now   I would make one other comment  Ned Gramlich made the point that when you’re in the   vicinity of the zero bound and you see weakness, it’s important to move in order to avoid getting        September 24, 2002 95 of 115  there, and I certainly agree with that  But what I’ve taken away from what I’ve heard in   conferences and read about this topic is that in such a situation  the central bank has to move very   aggressively and decisively to establish credibility for our ability to undercut the deflationary   impulse  I don’t think a small move of, say, ¼ point would do that  That, in my view, would   smack a bit of fine-tuning  So to me it’s not so much a matter of timing as of amount  As we go   forward, if we see evidence that the economy really is beginning to weaken, given our proximity   to the zero bound we might want to consider a move of more than ¼ point  I think that’s an issue   that we ought to have on the table at that time    I guess I’m a little surprised, though not a lot, by the strength of the   expectation that we’re going to move the funds rate down today  Looking at your first chart, I   just want to make sure I understand how that evolved  It appears that expectations began to   change sometime around October 20 and that the John Berry article tended to lock in that view    Is that the way you would characterize it?    He sort of iced it, I guess    Mr Chairman, I still think the best substitute for Treasury securities   is no substitute, but I’ll leave it at that because of the reaction I got the last time I tried to push   that view I agree with others who support the further study of Ginnie Maes  That certainly   seems to be a natural thing to do  They’re essentially equivalent to Treasury securities    Personally, I have strong reservations about the auction credit facility either as a   complement to Desk operations in normal times or as a substitute in an emergency  This is in no   way a comment on the staff study I thought the study was very helpful, Rick, in our efforts to   think through these issues Clearly, this kind of facility would have an advantage if we were in a   situation where we had to add a lot of reserves to the system, given the limitations on the volume   of Ginnie Maes available for purchase   The ACF would be an alternative; I recognize that  But there are at least a couple of very   significant problems and, obviously, they were cited in the study  First and foremost for me, I   think an ACF could seriously compromise the ability of our supervisory staff to downgrade a   larger institution when that might result in its loss of access to an ACF facility  I think, in   practice, it would be very, very difficult to keep adverse information on a banking institution   confidential  So by establishing an ACF we would be creating potentially a “too big to   downgrade” problem, which is a situation I don’t think we want to get into     To me, this is a serious enough problem that I would not want to pursue this course   further Frankly, with the reemergence of federal deficits, I don’t think anyone expects a lack of   Treasury debt to be a problem any time in the foreseeable future  And if the facility were   available, I think it would be tempting to use it for other purposes  In particular, we might be   tempted to use it if the economy weakened sharply and we were either at or near the zero bound               November 6, 2002 106 of 122  and needed to add a substantial quantity of reserves in such a situation  But it would be precisely   in that kind of environment where significant danger would arise if we were reluctant to   downgrade problem banks     With particular reference to the proposal about a contingency ACF for emergency   situations, at this point I don’t see any great advantage in that if I understand it correctly  We   have this new Lombard facility coming in with a provision that would allow the Reserve Banks   to drop the discount rate to the funds rate in an emergency situation  So I guess I don’t see what   this facility would add to what we would have in place once the new Lombard facility is   introduced    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The information we have suggests that   our District economy, like other regional economies around the country, softened in October   from an already quite moderate pace over the summer months  Some of this weakness in our   region reflected unusual special circumstances  We do a monthly survey of District conditions,    and it indicated that retail sales and shopper traffic both dropped off very sharply in the month of   October That almost certainly reflected the sniper shootings that kept people in the   Baltimore/Washington/Richmond corridor away from malls during much of that month  But   there had already been signs of some slippage in retail sales earlier, in September  And the   survey I mentioned suggests that activity is more sluggish now than it was several months ago in   a number of service-sector industries, especially in the northern part of our region     In manufacturing, according to our survey information, factory output held steady in   October, but new orders declined in both September and October  In our region as in yours,   Cathy, the anecdotal information for the most part is pretty bearish  There are some bright spots,   though, in the information we’ve received most recently  One particularly interesting comment I   heard was made to me by the chairman of the CSX Railroad, who simply because of the nature   of his business has a broad range of contacts across a number of manufacturing and other   industries He told me that his sense from the conversations he has been having is that, barring   further big negative shocks, the recovery is poised to accelerate by early next year  So at least   somebody has some sense of positive animal spirits out there  As a number of people have   mentioned for their Districts, housing activity still shows no signs of decelerating  So that’s the   news on the region   On the national economy, for most of this year it seemed reasonable to think of the   economy as moving forward with a relatively small and more or less stationary output gap          November 6, 2002 36 of 122  Especially since the middle of the year, aggregate hours have been flat, and the growth of   demand has been pretty much matched by the continuing strong growth of productivity  In this   situation, at least until recently, I thought it was plausible to expect that with the real funds rate   near zero, disposable personal income growing at a reasonably strong pace, and profits showing   some signs of gradually increasing, an adjustment process was in place  And it seemed likely to   me that, given time, this process would help overcome the reluctance of business firms to invest,   eliminate the output gap, and put the economy back on a solid and reasonably balanced growth   track The information we’ve received in the last several weeks, of course, has called that view    into question After having been very mixed for most of the year, the latest data are speaking   more uniformly, and they suggest that the output gap is, if anything, growing rather than   shrinking The growth of consumer spending has decelerated  The expected rebound of business   investment now looks further off than we had hoped All of this, of course, is reflected in your   forecast, David, which suggests that the output gap is likely to grow through about the middle of   next year before it finally begins to narrow  So the downside risk in the outlook clearly has   increased, and I recognize that That said, and I may be the lone voice in the wilderness, I think   we need to be careful not to exaggerate the increase in the downside risk or to overreact to it  I   think monetary policy, and here I would disagree with you a bit, Cathy, is still quite stimulative    Moreover, it is expected to remain stimulative for some time, and that expectation is holding   longer-term interest rates down    Productivity growth, as I think you mentioned, David, is likely to remain robust for the   foreseeable future That may restrain both job growth and wage increases temporarily, but it   should help to increase corporate cash flow and equity valuations and provide at least internal   financial resources, which at some point, hopefully not too far down the road, may help business            November 6, 2002 37 of 122  firms overcome their reluctance to invest  You also mentioned that the stock market was   showing some signs of stabilizing; some of the imbalances that we’ve been grappling with   appear to be diminishing  And while I know there are a lot of difficulties on the docks, as Bob   Parry has described very well, that kind of longer-run uncertainty may have been resolved to   some extent  Further—and I think especially importantly for monetary policy—while we may be   experiencing some further disinflation, currently it does appear to be pretty mild     So I think we should take the time to assess the persistence of the recent slowing in the   recovery and its likely cumulative impact on the output gap before we react to it  I know, of   course, that the markets and the broader public expect us to reduce the funds rate this morning   Consequently, if we didn’t do that—if we disappointed those expectations—there would be some   short-term cost  But I believe there is also a longer-term risk that adding additional monetary   stimulus now to what we already have in place could create doubts that we will be prepared to   reverse course promptly when the economy eventually begins to strengthen    Mr Chairman, I think we face a different situation from the one we   were facing a year or so ago when I made the comment that you referred to  So, if I had my   druthers, I personally would continue to be patient a little while longer than Jack Guynn and   Tom Hoenig suggested  But if we ease—and I have thought through this as I expected that the   Committee would ease this time—I have a strong preference for a ½ point reduction rather than   only a ¼ point reduction A 50 basis point drop would be decisive  I think it would give us a   fighting chance of preempting the downside forces that you discussed and that I recognize   certainly exist in the economy  To me a ¼ point move would be the worst of the three   alternatives laid out in the Bluebook because I think it probably would raise the most doubts and   uncertainties about monetary policy going forward  So I’m comfortable with the 50 basis points    I think we need to act decisively rather than tentatively     On the tilt, I must say I’m a little ambivalent  I wish I had more time to think through   this issue of the risk statement, but my instinct is that we ought to leave it unbalanced  I say that         November 6, 2002 91 of 122  mainly because, if we’re going to ease and accept whatever longer-term upside risks may flow   from that, I’d like to maximize the chances that this policy action is going to do the job   completely  This is not an issue that I would fall on my sword over, but I personally would have   a preference for retaining the tilt toward weakness    David, as you’ve already said, a key factor in your forecast, which I   think is a fairly optimistic one, is strong structural productivity growth  Looking at the way you   break that down on page 9 in the first part of the Greenbook, the strong growth in multifactor   productivity is a big part of that  That has been accelerating, and you expect it to continue at a   significantly high rate of increase for the next couple of years, throughout the projection period    I don’t think we understand a whole lot about multifactor productivity, and I’m wondering if that         December 10, 2002 21 of 87  expectation is basically an extrapolation  Or do you have some more specific thoughts on which   to base it?    Thank you    You may remember that last month I reported that the economy in   our region had softened in October, and I attributed that at least in part to the sniper shootings in   the DC area that were keeping people at home  Activity does appear to have firmed up a bit in               December 10, 2002 37 of 87  November according to some of the preliminary numbers we have from the surveys that our   Bank conducts But aside from housing, which for the most part is still quite robust, I would   characterize the overall picture as very, very sluggish in our region  Factory shipments and   orders were a little stronger in our November survey than in October, but my sense is that   manufacturing remains quite weak    Not surprisingly, given the generally soft economy, capital spending in our District—   both current and prospective—is very restrained The comments I’m hearing are very similar to   those Tony, Jack, and Cathy have mentioned already  Some service-sector firms have plans to   upgrade their computer equipment and software, but most manufacturing companies are already   plagued with excess capacity They don’t expect any significant new investment  Some   companies in the paper industry, for example, are actually spending at less than the depreciation   rate, so they’re trying to reduce capacity in that industry  I think that’s true in a number of other   industries as well So that’s the news on the regional economy   On the national economy, the Greenbook’s forecast for GDP growth over the projection   period has been revised up, reflecting our rate cut and the assumption of additional fiscal   stimulus  Under the circumstances, I think it’s a fairly optimistic forecast in that it calls for a   steady acceleration of growth over the next four quarters to an annual rate of about 4 percent by   the end of next year In addition to the stimulative policy assumption, the forecast is based on   the view that an adjustment process is now in place that, if given time, will bring the economy   back to a balanced growth path A key driving force in this adjustment, as I see it, is that   structural productivity growth is expected to exceed 2 percent in each of the next two years  The   strong productivity growth in turn is expected to generate rising profitability, strong cash flows,   and firming stock prices, which are supposed to help revive investment spending next year          December 10, 2002 38 of 87  Further, the recently higher equity values and strong growth in real wages are expected to bring   forth the real consumption expenditures necessary to underwrite growth in GDP of roughly   3¼ percent in 2003 and 4¼ percent in 2004   I consider this projection eminently reasonable as a central tendency  In fact, I think   something like it is the most likely outcome in the months ahead  But I still believe that on   balance the risks in the forecast are skewed to the downside  Let me quickly list four of the risks   that I think deserve particular attention  The first, which goes back to the question I asked David   earlier, relates to productivity growth The optimism regarding overall productivity growth   reflects an assumption that multifactor productivity is going to rise at a rate of about 1½ percent   in 2003 and 2004; that’s slightly above even the recent relatively high realized rates of growth in   MFP I am personally optimistic about productivity, but there’s no guarantee that we’ll get that   kind of growth As we noted earlier, there is a lot of uncertainty here  And productivity is not an   area about which we know as much as we’d like  That’s the first risk I would point out   Second, and I think this is an important point, the Greenbook assumes that the Fed is   going to keep the funds rate at its current level until mid-2004  This expectation gives monetary   policy a relatively big kick in the forecast since it pulls long-term interest rates down  A risk   here is that the markets may not believe that the Fed will leave the rates so low for so long,   probably in part because we removed the tilt at the last meeting  So the actual term structure   may not in fact reflect the degree of stimulus that’s built into the forecast   Third, the Greenbook is projecting a strong upturn in business fixed investment—quite   strikingly strong, I thought, in looking at the numbers—beginning in the first quarter  It may   happen But there’s not much direct evidence that it has started yet, and we’re only about three   weeks from the first quarter at this point         December 10, 2002 39 of 87  Finally, the rise in the unemployment rate from 57 to 6 percent in November raises the   possibility that this recovery, like the recovery from the Gulf War recession, may turn out to be a   jobless recovery Unemployment may rise further  And if it does, the Fed may have to cut the   real funds rate further next year, as we had to do in the latter part of 1991 and in 1992     I don’t think any of this warrants a change in policy today  But it may be constructive to   find some way to signal the markets and the public that we’re at least aware of these risks and   are prepared to move decisively to deal with them as needed    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  Following up on the   exchange between Bob Parry and Dave Stockton, I do worry a little about the disconnect   between our policy assumption and market expectations  So if there were an opportunity in the   statement to recognize that, with a term or a phrase, it might help to bring these diverging views   back into better alignment  That perhaps would reduce some of my concerns about the downside   risks, although I recognize that my view on that is clearly an outlier at this meeting     I had a question, Mr Chairman  But first I wanted to thank Karen   very much for the memo she sent out a couple of weeks ago  That was very helpful to me in   March 18, 2003 17 of 101    understanding some of the obstacles to adjustment overseas in particular, and it related to some   of the things you just said  My question, Dave, is about the tax cut assumption  I don’t know   what it means to say “other things being equal” these days, but you retained the assumption that   the tax cut will be passed  My sense is that the probability that it will not be enacted, or that it   will be pared down significantly, has risen recently  I just wondered what that might imply for   your forecast     Thank you, Mr Chairman  For a while in January it looked as if   activity was strengthening moderately in our region, especially in the manufacturing sector  That   made us something of an outlier in the commentary in the Beige Book, but we fell back in line in   February  Our monthly index from our survey of the manufacturing and service sectors dropped   sharply for the most part last month  Some of that obviously was related to the heightened war   anxiety and concern about rising gasoline prices  The severe weather in February, particularly   around the Presidents’ Day weekend, hit our District especially hard and clearly played a   significant role in the apparent softening  That is good news, I guess, if it suggests that at least   some of the softening was transitory rather than persistent  Unemployment rates were below the   national level in several of our District states, but the rate in North Carolina, which is our largest   state, was at almost 7 percent in December—the latest month for which we have data—because   of the weakness in manufacturing there     Not all of the news in our District is bad  There have been a few fairly substantial plant   expansions in our region, indicating at least some increase in business spending  As for housing   activity, the national report for this past month was weak  I don’t recall what the regional profile   was in that report, but we don’t see any significant weakening in housing activity in our District    Also, let me mention one particular bright spot in the manufacturing sector  The Fifth District is   one of the world’s leading producers, if not the leading producer, of duct tape  [Laughter]  That   industry is doing very well, thank you  We gained our duct tape prominence because the original   March 18, 2003 25 of 101    fiber used to give the tape strength was cotton  Jack Guynn’s people grew it, and we   manufactured it  So that’s a little Southern economic history lesson for you this morning at no   charge!   Turning to the national economy, I would describe the Greenbook forecast as easy to   love, all things considered, and I hope we get something that’s at least in the neighborhood of it    The question, of course—there are a lot of questions, but this a key one—is whether we can   reasonably expect such a relatively favorable outcome with the funds rate at a sustained   1¼ percent level, as is assumed in the baseline forecast  Obviously, no one knows the answer to   that in the current highly uncertain situation but my own view is that the Greenbook forecast is   plausible  Clearly, the economy is struggling currently under the weight of all the uncertainty,   and the downside risks are obviously material  Nevertheless, in some contrast to my neighbor   Cathy here, I think it’s easy to exaggerate both the current weakness and the downside risks in   the outlook, considerable though they are  I certainly recognize that they are considerable  As   the Greenbook points out, a persistent increase in oil prices could lead to a significant slowing in   economy activity  But as we’ve said already this morning, futures markets are not expecting   that  If we don’t get a persistent increase in oil prices, I think that significantly reduces the   likelihood that the most recent weakness in labor markets and retail sales will cumulate and   worsen  Moreover, looking through the recent data, the prospect of continued robust trend   productivity growth should eventually produce some revival of investment and should support   commensurate growth in household spending  The stimulative monetary and fiscal policies that   are already in place both support the adjustment process  We’re already seeing at least some   revival of investment in some sections of the tech sector     March 18, 2003 26 of 101    Finally, our credibility for low inflation means that neither rising actual inflation nor   rising inflation expectations pose much of a risk for the recovery  So I think we have a solid   underlying base for recovery  To be sure, we may experience some sort of disinflation if the   economy continues to adjust to the higher trend productivity growth  That could pose some   complications in the transition, and I think we need to monitor that carefully  Outright deflation   doesn’t appear to be a strong threat at this point  But I continue to think that this Committee   should be prepared to deal with the risk of deflation if unfavorable developments such as a   protracted war in Iraq or some negative shock or succession of negative shocks—like a series of   terrorist attacks, for example—force us closer to the zero bound  I’d like to come back to that   later for just about a minute when we have our policy go-around       Mr Chairman, I can accept your recommendation  I have some of   the same kinds of reservations and concerns that Bill Poole just expressed  I understand your   rationale, and I think it makes sense  But this is a change, and I’m nervous because I don’t know   how the markets and the public more broadly are going to accept it  So when we write our   statement, I think the choice of language is going to be very important      I agree     If I could, I’d like to follow up briefly on the conversation you were   having with Ned a minute ago  I would urge the Committee to think a bit more fully about how   we would deal with the risk of deflation, and especially public concern about deflation if that hits   us, should we get into a situation where we’re closer to the zero bound  I personally don’t think   deflation is a major current threat  I’m probably one of the more sanguine members of the group   here in that regard, and maybe it’s odd for me to be the one making this statement  Looking   ahead, however, I do think that deflation is arguably a more serious potential problem than   inflation for the intermediate term, and I don’t think we can assume that the confidence the   March 18, 2003 83 of 101    public has in the Fed to contain inflation necessarily carries over to deflation  We don’t have a   very good track record in dealing with deflation     That’s right     In any case, while I don’t expect this, it’s not hard for me to imagine   events unfolding in such a way in the current period of volatile situations that we could find   ourselves approaching the zero bound  Actually, I think it’s easy to imagine a situation where   the funds rate moves below 1 percent fairly abruptly  I’m not anticipating that, but it’s certainly   possible to imagine it  If the funds rate moves below 1 percent, the public’s concern about   exactly how we’re going to deal with a deflationary situation is going to intensify quickly  We   need to be prepared to answer those kinds of questions and assure the public that what has been   happening in Japan is not going to happen here  While we at the Federal Reserve have made a   couple of public statements regarding deflation, we haven’t said very much  I think we’re going   to be pressed to say much more if we get in this situation  For our own benefit, among other   things, I think we need to consider how we would measure the stance of policy and discuss   policy operationally in the neighborhood of the zero bound  For example, one question is, will   we have an operating instrument that will be a substitute for the funds rate if we are at zero or   very close to zero?  If so, we have to have some way of instructing the Desk on how to   implement policy  I don’t know what that instrument would be, so we need to think about   whether we are going to have one and what it would be     My own view is that it would be helpful, to me at least, if the staff could give us a “think   piece” that might suggest in some detail what a Bluebook at the zero bound might look like    March 18, 2003 84 of 101    What kinds of alternatives would be presented there?  In any event, I think getting out in front of   this issue would help us avoid making policy mistakes and also help prevent public confusion   and fear that might make the situation worse than it needs to be  We may think we have time to   do this, but I’m not sure we do  We could find ourselves in a situation like this relatively   quickly      No   May 6, 2003 9 of 115      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve been trying to think of a term that   best describes our District’s economy and the best I can come up with is “treading water”  I   don’t have a sense that the economy is sinking, but I don’t see much forward momentum either   Our latest monthly surveys on activity in the manufacturing, retailing, and nonretail   service sectors in our District were conducted in mid-to-late April They are not complete yet,   but we have most of the results, and they indicate that both manufacturing and retailing are quite   soft currently  Part of the weakness in retailing may have to do with the unusually cool and wet   spring weather we’ve been having in our area  The results from the nonretail service sector   May 6, 2003 51 of 115    survey—which covers trucking companies, business service firms, much of the tourist industry,   and so forth—are a little better  They suggest a bit of firming in some of these industries, as I   think I mentioned on the last conference call  The tourist industry along the coast, for example,   seems to be doing better than might have been anticipated  But again, other than a couple of   exceptions like that, there’s not a lot of forward momentum   These more or less stationary conditions in our region I think mainly reflect both   household and business attitudes about the near-term outlook  I would describe those attitudes as   skeptical or still mixed, with a fair amount of lingering pessimism despite the early and   successful conclusion of the war  A lot of people in our area seem to think that the sluggishness   in activity is due primarily to the remaining slack in the economy that was created by the reversal   of the boom of the late ’90s  They figure that it cannot easily be corrected by low interest rates   or tax cuts but just has to be worked through—for lack of a better phrase—however long that   takes  One bright side of this is that attitudes about the outlook could improve quite rapidly if   people get a sense that this working-through process is nearing completion  In that regard, any   upward bounce in activity that eventually does result from the successful completion of the   war—and despite the lack of clear evidence now I think we could get something like that—could   be helpful if it’s taken as a sign that this process is nearly complete     Most of the recent data suggest that the national economy is also treading water  By all   accounts real GDP continues to grow moderately; but hours worked are still contracting, and the   output gap appears to be widening further  In this context, to me the most striking recent   development is the behavior of core inflation—a point a lot of other people have commented on   already  I think the Greenbook put it very well, David, noting that in the last few months core   inflation has entered a range that, given the measurement bias, really approaches zero inflation    May 6, 2003 52 of 115    A deceleration of inflation would have been regarded as desirable in the past; a lot of us thought   that  But as the Chairman aptly put it last week, today substantial further disinflation would be   an unwelcome development  I thought that remark was something of watershed, Mr Chairman,   because it confirmed very nicely that we truly are conducting monetary policy in an environment   of price stability now, with risks on both sides of the coin going forward  Specifically, just as we   faced the risk of rising inflation momentum in the past—and undoubtedly will again in the   future—we now also face a meaningful risk that disinflation may acquire momentum and create   deflation and a zero bound problem, with adverse consequences for the economy and for   monetary policy     With this in mind, the crucial question today, as I see it, is whether the recent further   actual disinflation indicates that the risk of growing disinflationary momentum has now reached   the point where we should act to preempt it  I’ve struggled a great deal with that question, and   the deflation exercise in the Greenbook didn’t raise my comfort level a whole lot, David  I think   it’s an exceptionally close call  But on balance, recent developments suggest to me that we’re   not quite at the point where we need to act  As others have noted, the real funds rate is at or near   zero and has been in the vicinity of zero for some time  Oil prices are falling, the stock market   seems to be strengthening, profits appear to be rising again, credit spreads are continuing to   improve, and the Greenbook is projecting substantial additional fiscal stimulus in coming   quarters  Given these developments, I think we can prudently wait a little longer before acting   and try to get a clearer idea of whether the economy is going to get a postwar boost or not  I   don’t think we really know the answer to that yet  Waiting would also have the advantage of   ensuring that we won’t undercut any revived optimism that the end of war might stimulate in the   near term   May 6, 2003 53 of 115      Mr Chairman, I would like to start off with where I was before I   saw this draft statement and then react to the statement  At the risk of some repetition, to me the   key policy issue this morning is whether we want to act today to preempt a buildup of   disinflationary momentum or whether we want to wait a little while to see if the economy   May 6, 2003 90 of 115    strengthens and that risk diminishes  As I said earlier, it’s an agonizingly close call  It was for   me before I saw the statement, and it still is  But on balance the recent improvement in at least   some of the data—and you added a few more in your earlier comments—had convinced me that   staying where we are was the best way to go  So I favored leaving the rate where it was,   reintroducing a bias, and making it a neutral bias  My preference for a neutral bias was based in   part on my view that introducing a downward bias at this point could undercut the renewed   optimism we’re hoping for, for which I think there is still some basis  I don’t want to frighten   the markets and the public into thinking that the deflation problem, even though it may be more   immediate, is greater than it actually is  In this statement we’ve unbundled the risks in one place   but rebundled them in the final sentence of the third paragraph  In a sense this statement still   suggests that we have a downward bias; that’s the bottom line  I’m not sure I’m comfortable   with that for the reasons I just stated     I was going to suggest something slightly different  Let me just throw it on the table   briefly  Clearly, we do need to recognize the disinflation risk one way or another because it’s   very real  I was going to suggest that one way to do it would be to reiterate in this statement the   concern that you expressed—I thought very effectively—in your testimony last week  But in   addition to that I would state clearly in the announcement that core inflation is now at the lower   end of the range that we are willing to tolerate on any sustained basis  I recognize that this   would be a departure from what we’ve done before and a different kind of departure than we did   last time  But that is in fact what we’re talking about now, and I think it could serve us well in   trying to deal with what is a very difficult policy choice today  A statement like that wouldn’t   pre-commit us, but it’s hard to imagine circumstances in which we would want the flexibility to   May 6, 2003 91 of 115    allow a sustained inflation below 1 percent  So that’s another way of going  I don’t know   whether I’ve made it clear or not     I would just respond, if I may  I know we can’t guarantee in any   short period of time that we can put a floor on the inflation rate  But I would hope that over any   reasonable period of time we could do that with monetary policy     Mr Chairman, could I just associate myself with the preference for   eliminating that sentence?       David, to what extent do you think that the recent and presumably   prospective fuel price increases might offset the tax cut effect in the next six months or so?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance, economic activity has   picked up a little in our District over the past several weeks  Consumer spending appears to have   accelerated at least a bit  Tourist-related activity, in particular, has shown some renewed   strength in our region despite the wet weather—somewhat in contrast to what you said about the   Southeast, Jack   Maybe all the tourists are visiting the Fifth District for some reason!    Residential construction and sales are still strong, and there are at least a few signs of a pickup in   August 12, 2003 41 of 110    business capital spending, although a lot of this involves replacement of computers and related   high-tech equipment rather than something more fundamental   Perhaps most significantly though, a development that is striking in our region is what I   would call a fairly pronounced shift toward greater optimism about the near-term outlook among   our business contacts despite the recent run-up in long-term interest rates  For example, one of   our Baltimore directors, who regularly surveys 10 to 12 people in the heavy construction and   industrial sectors of the economy, told us at the last Baltimore board meeting that his contacts   were more optimistic than at any time in the three or four years he has been on the board  And   the manager of a restaurant that my wife and I frequent made a point of coming over the other   night to tell me how great business was  On several occasions recently, spontaneous comments   like that have been made to me  I suppose that reflects at least to some extent the initial impact   of the tax cut  It’s a little eerie, though, because when people make those types of comments to   me they seem to be looking for confirmation from me that happy times are either already here or   just around the corner  I did buy a more expensive glass of wine that night, [laughter] but that’s   as far as I would go     The one sector in my area where optimism is still scarce— actually   nonexistent—is the old-line, traditional manufacturing industries such as textiles and furniture in   the Carolinas  Most recently, the Pillowtex company based in North Carolina folded, wiping out   about 5,000 jobs in that state alone, which I think was the largest job loss from a single event in   the state’s history   The total number of layoffs amounted to about 6,500  That company sold   towels and a lot of other soft goods under the Cannon and Fieldcrest labels  I inadvertently   referred to the company as “Pillow Talk” during a staff meeting the other day, which was an   August 12, 2003 42 of 110    indication of both my age and my bad taste in movies  [Laughter]  But it’s no laughing matter in   the communities where that company had plants—mostly in central North Carolina   On the national economy, the Greenbook forecast is certainly plausible, including the   considerable step-up in GDP growth going forward that the staff continues to project despite the   downward revision in the projection  Like other people, I’m impressed by the more positive tone   of some of the recent data and the anecdotal commentary that I just mentioned  My main   concern, and others have expressed this concern as well, is that the additional 25 basis points of   further disinflation projected for 2004 in the Greenbook could turn out to be too optimistic  I   would cite three reasons to be concerned, and some of them have been mentioned already  First,   the latest employment report does suggest that the output gap is still growing; that is in the nature   of a baseline fact as I see it  Second, given the substantial total job loss in the economy since   early 2001 relative to the trend growth in the labor force, I think the 62 percent unemployment   rate may not be fully conveying the downside impulse that’s coming from labor markets into the   economy  Finally, the continuing surprising strength—almost amazing strength—in productivity   growth suggests that trend productivity growth may well turn out to be higher than expected,   along the lines of the first alternative scenario in the Greenbook, which I thought was especially   interesting    On that last point, in the late 1990s rising productivity growth had a powerful effect on   demand because it was extrapolated—producing excessively optimistic expectations of future   labor and capital income growth in that period that caused spending to grow even faster than   potential output  It would be nice if we could get something like that now  But things could well   turn out differently in today’s environment, where the public’s view of economic prospects is   much more subdued, obviously, than it was in the late ’90s, given the continuing job losses and   August 12, 2003 43 of 110    excess capacity in a number of industries  Rising productivity growth today, in contrast to the   late ’90s, could well cause the output gap to widen further if spending does not keep pace with   potential output     As the Greenbook alternative scenario indicates, that outcome would obviously put   additional downward pressure on inflation  We would have to move the funds rate below   1 percent just to keep the real funds rate from rising  Indeed, in such a situation, we might well   want to reduce the real funds rate below zero  In those circumstances, I think the zero bound   would become a serious practical problem, not just a theoretical issue, because it could   undermine the public’s confidence in our ability to provide the required stimulus with monetary   policy  Obviously, if that kind of situation developed, it would involve a disinflation risk  We   would have to make a convincing case that we could in fact provide the stimulus ultimately by   expanding our balance sheet to whatever extent necessary in those circumstances, if they arise   Let me say again that I, too, think economic prospects are looking at least a little better   now  And in my view the probability of deflation and the risk of hitting the zero bound are still   relatively low  But the high productivity growth scenario, which in some sense is the most   favorable scenario from the standpoint of longer-term growth, does involve a significant   disinflation risk in the near term  So I agree with what I’m hearing from several others around   the table that it’s too soon to sound the “all clear” signal  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I support your recommendations, Mr Chairman  I must say I’m   attracted to Bob Parry’s suggestion  I’d like to think about it a little more, but on the face of it   his suggestion makes a lot of sense to me, and I’m looking forward to our communications   discussion next month     Just to weigh in on this, I tend to have the opposite point of view   from Governor Bernanke  I support Cathy’s position for a lot of the reasons that have already   been stated  I just don’t think this is going to buy us that much  I don’t think we need it, given   the language in the preceding sentence  Also, I’m a little concerned that we have been criticized,   maybe unfairly, for trying to manipulate markets, and I think putting this sentence in is going to   revive some of that sentiment  We don’t really need that  We are going to talk about this topic   next time  So for me the tradeoffs are such that I favor pretty strongly not putting it in this time     Mr Chairman, I would approach this a little differently  I found   Vincent’s memo very useful in organizing my thinking about this  So, I’d start with his five   principles, and I would add a sixth, which is that in communicating with the markets about   policy and expectations it’s important not to put too big a burden on the statement—or try to do   things with the statement that are not feasible  I think we might have tried to do that a bit in this   period, and I believe that might have been part of the problem  One can argue that point, I   suppose  In particular, I personally feel that it’s important to resist any temptation to use the   statement to try to engineer expectations in the marketplace about what’s going to happen to   policy settings or to the funds rate at some point in the future  I don’t think we can do that   consistently  Even if we’re not trying to do it, I believe we need to do what we can to avoid   giving the impression that we might be doing that     Let me emphasize that in saying this I am not arguing for reduced transparency but for   being transparent about the things that really matter and about which we can be confident  With   that in mind, it seems to me that the place to start in reducing the burden on the statement is to be   more explicit and clearer about our inflation objectives  For example, we could announce our   intention to hold core PCE inflation in a 1 to 2 percent target range while continuing to take   account—as we do today—of both inflation and real output  I recognize that the proposal to   introduce inflation targets has been controversial in this Committee  But in view of some of the   problems we’ve had with communications lately, it seems to me that there’s an argument for   taking another look at that approach  If we tied inflation expectations down firmly with a target   range, then markets could routinely and continuously make informed judgments about how   sentiment in this Committee—whether inflation is a concern or deflation is a problem—is   evolving over time  Market players could assess that by just looking at the behavior of actual   September 15, 2003 32 of 78    inflation in relation to the target range  We might need to add something to our policy statement   about how we intend to get inflation back in the neighborhood of the target range if at some point   it moves away from the range  But we would not need to rely on ad hoc additions to or deletions   from the statement that run the risk of being ignored or amplified or generally misunderstood in   the markets   What that means to me is that we could have a statement that is more formulaic in   character, along the lines of what Bob Parry was just saying, which I personally think would be a   good thing  Also, just as an aside here, your suggestion for making the statement the basis of   what we vote on is a good one     Among the five alternative models you’ve shown here, Vincent, I suppose my approach   would be closest to the Bank of England model  Obviously, clarifying the inflation objectives   and expediting the minutes would take the pressure off the statement, which could then be   reduced to its essentials  But it would put a burden on the preparation of the minutes  Norm and   Carol are good friends, and I don’t want to lose their friendship  So I would hasten to add that if   we were to go in this direction, we would have to augment our resources for preparing the   minutes to whatever extent necessary to make that a feasible and manageable process  I think   the additional burden in that area would be justified by relieving us of the need to use the   statement to send detailed—and at times potentially complicated or confusing—messages to the   market  The market would be making its judgments based on a crucial, central phenomenon that   it could observe in the context of a very clearly stated objective that we have announced     Can we get that in the minutes?  [Laughter]  Could I just make one   response to that, Mr Chairman?  I certainly hear your comments, and I must say that I don’t   think that explicit inflation targeting is a silver bullet or that it’s going to solve all the problems   we face  But in the context of this discussion, I would like to use an example—and maybe I’m   violating the admonition not to get too close to the current situation  Suppose we currently had a   range of 1 to 2 percent for the core PCE  We are now at the lower bound and may be pushing a   bit below it  Again, having an announced target wouldn’t solve all the world’s problems, but I   think it would add something important—namely, that the markets and the public should have a   very clear understanding that the risk in the outlook with respect to inflation is on the downside    They would know that it clearly would be a conditioning factor in some way in our policies   going forward  It would eliminate any need for us to feel that we must elaborate our statement in   an ad hoc way—I don’t know that we’re necessarily doing this now—at some point down the   road  I would be very concerned about the longer-run type of steady-state communication   relationship between the markets and the Fed that such an approach might create     But we had to make an explicit statement to that effect     Well, I don’t want to take more than my share of time, but I would   like to respond to a couple of things you said  The objections you raise are why I said inflation   targeting is not a magic bullet; there are problems  If we were explaining why we use inflation   targets, I’d say, yes, there would be issues and we would have to deal with those  As I view such   use, though, we certainly wouldn’t be reacting to one month’s data  Presumably we would be   looking at a longer period of time than that  To continue with the current example, in answer to   a point you raised, if the measure moves back above the 1 percent lower limit—presumably it’s a   little below that by some measures now—that doesn’t mean that we would have to react   immediately to bring rates back to neutral     Because the inflation measure would still be close to the lower limit   of its range  There would still be a risk  This would give content to the statement     I don’t think we’d necessarily have to do anything in that particular   scenario     I think we could easily explain that     Dave, an element of this forecast that interests me a lot is that, even   though you’ve revised upward the output gap, you still have some marginal further disinflation   going forward  I think I would benefit from a little more understanding of how you arrived at the   inflation forecast  I know you look at output gaps and labor market gaps, and I know the two are   related; but what I’m really trying to get at is the confidence interval around this forecast  In   particular, what is the risk of a significantly greater disinflation in the context of the way you   arrive at this projection?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to spend most of my time today   on the national economy  I won’t say very much about the District because not a lot has changed   in our region  Activity appears to be picking up in several sectors such as textiles and apparel    Furniture manufacturers in the southern corridor of the District are still laying off people  I agree   with Jack and Jamie that a lot of the job loss is structural, but I think some of it at this point is   probably still cyclical as well  The comments we hear from our business contacts, as others   around this table have said about their Districts, are generally more optimistic than two or three   September 16, 2003 54 of 106    months ago  But I would characterize business people as still quite cautious and wary  Of   course, speaking of wariness, we have a hurricane bearing down on our District  So we’ll see   what that does to us  It may reduce excess capacity in the District!  [Laughter]       That’s right  It probably will reduce the disinflation pressure on our   District’s economy    With respect to the national economy, to me the most striking feature of the current   Greenbook is that, even though the projected path of GDP has been revised up—actually fairly   substantially—in accordance with the stronger economic data, the path for potential GDP has   been revised up even more  That implies that the output gap is even greater now than it was at   the time of the August meeting  The Greenbook projects that aggregate demand growth will   accelerate from here, overtake the growth of potential output, and begin to close the gap next   year, with only marginal further disinflation  I think that’s a plausible scenario, and I would   agree that it is the most likely particular outcome among the array of possible outcomes     But I still believe, as I did at the August meeting, that there’s a significant downside risk   in the outlook, especially a risk of greater disinflation or conceivably even deflation going   forward  The weak August jobs report seems to me to highlight the need to remain alert at least   to this risk  In this regard, I think it’s helpful to try to understand as clearly as possible the   process that has produced the disinflation we’ve experienced recently  As we all know, in the   mid-1990s productivity growth also accelerated sharply and that held down increases in unit   labor costs and inflation  But that really was not disinflationary because labor markets in that   September 16, 2003 55 of 106    period were tight  Consequently, the upward pull of higher productivity growth on real wages   showed up to a significant degree as increased competition by firms for workers, and nominal   wage increases were reasonably high in that period  Of course, productivity growth again is   increasing strongly in the current recovery, but this time it’s accompanied by very weak labor   markets  As a result, the upward pull of rising productivity on real wages hasn’t led to as much   nominal wage growth  Instead it has shown up mainly in increased competition in product   markets, and actual declines in unit labor costs have been passed along to households through   lower prices for both goods and services but to a large extent in prices for goods, especially   manufactured goods     For me at least this background is helpful in understanding and appreciating the   disinflation risk in the period ahead  The Greenbook forecast is predicated on the view that firms   have been reluctant to hire to meet rising demand because they’re worried that the expansion is   not going to be sustained  The Greenbook assumes that, as time passes, firms will become more   confident and that by next year they will be hiring at a remarkably robust rate—at least according   to the projection  In this situation, measured productivity growth goes down from 4½ percent   this year to 1½ percent next year despite the upward revision of projected structural productivity   growth  With demand forecast to grow 5 percent next year, the output gap closes relatively   quickly—not immediately, but relatively quickly and steadily—and there’s only a little further   disinflation  Again, I think this is all plausible     But there’s an alternative outcome, which may have a lower probability, that I would   argue is also quite plausible  In this alternative scenario, structural productivity growth is even   higher than in the upward-revised projection in the Greenbook, which as I recall is 26 percent   for next year  That’s a lot higher than the average productivity growth rate over the period   September 16, 2003 56 of 106    between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, but it’s not terribly different from the average rate of   productivity growth in the US economy over the last century or so  If structural productivity   does turn out to be higher than projected and if demand growth in the currently subdued—and I   would argue, still cautious and distinctly nonexuberant—economy comes in a little weaker than   anticipated, the output gap would close more slowly or possibly widen even further; and   disinflation could continue or conceivably even accelerate  This outcome may have a lower   probability than the Greenbook scenario, but in some contrast to you, Tom, I would argue that it   would be an unwelcome outcome  So in the spirit of your Jackson Hole speech, Mr Chairman, I   think it is a risk that needs to be managed carefully       Mr Chairman, I’m fine on the funds rate target and on the   substantive aspect of the balance of risks  But on the press release statement I’m very much in   Jack Guynn’s camp  He expressed my concerns very well  I just don’t know how this additional   language is going to be interpreted  I’ve been trying to think about that  In my view, the   September 16, 2003 90 of 106    additional reference to disinflationary forces may well lead people to think that we are more   concerned about further disinflation now than we in fact are as a group  Actually, that language   fits my own personal view, but I don’t know that it matches the sentiment I’ve heard around this   table  More broadly, this new wording is another ad hoc change, and that’s what is going to get   the attention in the marketplace; and I don’t know how market participants are going to interpret   it  So while I understand the logic, in terms of the reasons that you want to put those words in, I   think it may be expecting more than is reasonable of the ability of markets to parse this language    The bottom line here is that sooner or later, as others have said, we’re going to have to take the   word “considerable” out  That’s going to be the key point, and in my view it’s going to be very   difficult for us to smooth that transition very much  I think that is just going to have to be faced   at the right time  So my preference is to leave the wording unchanged from last month     Mr Chairman, the first thing I would say is, Jack, when you eat an   oyster you really ought to chew it  That’s what brings the flavor out  [Laughter]  When I think   about communication, to me what makes a communication good is that it’s direct, clear, and   October 28, 2003 101 of 126    understandable  On that score, Ned’s suggested wording has a lot to offer  It’s direct, and of the   alternatives that we’re considering today, I think it is in some sense the clearest and most   understandable  It also has an accountability dimension to it, and I like that  I find the   benchmark attractive  The one issue, Ned—and we talked about this a little before—is that the   use of employment as a benchmark concept is something I have to think about  I would have to   get more comfortable with that  I’ve spent a lot of time over my career arguing for a price   stability mandate  I know I’m pushing my luck here, but in that regard if we had a more explicit   target—or let me say a firmer inflation anchor—I could be more comfortable with something   like Ned’s proposed language  I think it could work  That’s about where I am on the alternatives   we have before us     I agree with Jack and Tom that we need to think this through carefully  We need to take   whatever time is necessary  Certainly we can wait until January; I think the language we have   now will be satisfactory until then  The other point I would add is that, once we make a decision,   the decision itself may warrant a more prominent announcement than we’ve typically made   when we’ve made changes in the past  We may want to release an extended press statement that   lays out the reasoning as to why, for the foreseeable future, we are going to use this new   language  If we are a little more communicative on that score than usual, I think that would help    That’s where I am     Thank you, Mr Chairman I would describe the information that   we’ve received on our District’s economy recently as generally mixed  Of course, a hurricane   hit us shortly after our last meeting The storm uprooted a lot of trees, caused extensive power   outages, and forced some business closings for a while, but I don’t think it has had any   significant longer-term effect on the regional economy  Again, the overall information we’ve   received is mixed  I would say that many service industries seem to be doing reasonably well at   this point but manufacturing activity, which appeared to be improving a little during the summer   months, has softened most recently according to our latest monthly survey  Both shipments and   new orders have been declining at a number of facilities, and additional layoffs have been   announced at several textile and apparel plants     I’d like to focus for a minute or two on the anecdotal information we’ve received as   opposed to the recent data  We’ve talked with a number of people in recent weeks, and I would   October 28, 2003 52 of 126    say that on balance they’re probably a little more optimistic than they were at the time of the last   meeting but not much  Most of our business contacts are still more than normally uncertain   about the outlook, and hence they’re still hesitant to commit to significant new investments or   workforce expansions  We had a joint meeting of all three of our boards—the Baltimore and   Charlotte boards as well as the Richmond board—here in DC a couple of weeks ago  I thought   the tone of the economic discussion at that meeting was remarkably restrained, given all the   media hype about the possibility that the expansion is beginning to accelerate  If those board   members could see the Greenbook projection, they probably all would be surprised  Some of   them would be encouraged but I think a few at least would think we’ve been smoking something       I withdraw that statement!  Turning to the national economy, the   lead story in this Greenbook, of course, is the 2 percentage point upward revision, to 6¼ percent,   in the third-quarter growth rate  Given estimated potential GDP, there’s a chance, as we all   know, that the output gap has shrunk from around 3 percent in the second quarter to below   2 percent in the third quarter  In the staff projection, the gap has been marked down to about ½   percent at the end of next year  Incidentally, I think it’s very helpful to have that number in the   Greenbook explicitly, and I appreciate your putting it there  In any case, it’s obviously a very   encouraging projection, as we’ve noted already in our discussion     But it’s important to note that, in the third quarter, firms met the stepped-up demand with   continued high productivity growth and actually slightly lower aggregate hours worked than in   the second quarter  So in that sense the job market weakened further in the third quarter, and   what one might call the employment gap actually widened further since aggregate hours need to   grow at an annual rate of around 1 percent to absorb the normal increase in the labor force  So   October 28, 2003 53 of 126    there’s a tension or divergence, whatever the right word is, between a narrowing output gap and   a widening employment gap in the third quarter that’s going to have to be resolved one way or   another   I’m really looking at what we’ve been talking about in just a little different way  The   Greenbook resolves the divergence by assuming that the recent exceptionally high productivity   growth reflects the extraordinary reluctance of firms to hire and rehire workers  The Greenbook   projection assumes that this factor starts to abate next year with productivity growth slowing   dramatically as firms begin to hire very aggressively to meet rising demands  Demand grows   fast enough in the forecast to reduce the excess supply of labor by the end of next year   But there’s an alternative resolution that’s worth considering, and I guess this is one of   those dark thoughts that you mentioned in your briefing, David  If productivity continues to   grow as rapidly as demand next year—either because productivity grows more rapidly than   expected or because demand grows more slowly than expected—the consequence in this   alternative scenario is that the job market remains weak  The weak job market, in turn, gives rise   to a bigger decline in unit labor costs than projected in the Greenbook  As a result, because firms   tend to pass persistently falling unit labor costs through to prices, there’s more disinflation in this   alternative scenario than in the Greenbook baseline  So we wind up with a slower narrowing of   both the output gap and what I call the employment gap as well as more disinflation  Also,   monetary policy might have to be a part of the resolution of such a scenario  Conceivably, we   might have to lower the nominal funds rate going forward either to keep the real rate from rising   or to reduce the real rate in order to stimulate the economy     So in sum, I like the Greenbook forecast  It’s very easy to love, and I don’t think it’s   implausible  But we need to keep in mind, at least for the time being, the less favorable   October 28, 2003 54 of 126    alternative scenario that I’ve described and that others have described in different ways here   today, as we think about policy, the statement, the wording of the announcement, and all the rest    The risks with respect to price stability as I see it are still decidedly on the downside, and I think   we need to indicate that clearly in our decision and our announcement today     I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I like Tom’s   metaphor     Could I just ask one other brief question?  I know we’ve gone on for   quite some time, but this is just a quick question for Karen building on the same theme  Karen,   do you have any sense that any of the weakness in the dollar may reflect concerns in foreign   exchange markets, and especially on the part of foreign investors, that US monetary policy is   too accommodative?  In other words, is there some sense of inflation expectations that may not   be showing up in the other indicators you look at?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As for the District economy, things look   fairly good, as appears to be the case elsewhere in the country from the comments we’ve heard   so far  Based on our service-sector and manufacturing surveys, activity expanded strongly in   October  It appears that activity may have slowed a little in November, but conditions are still   very healthy in the District  Factory orders and shipments in particular strengthened further,   indicating some strength in demand in manufacturing for the first time in a while  Employment   in manufacturing is still soft, but the pace of layoffs appears to have slowed noticeably recently,   December 9, 2003 58 of 133    including in the basic manufacturing belt in the Carolinas, where the problem has been centered   in our District  Residential construction is still very robust, and for the first time in a while we   are seeing a few signs of life in nonresidential construction  One of our directors is a member of   a REIT board  He reported recently that absorption rates in the office sector have risen in several   area markets  Another director, who owns a large number of so-called necessity shopping   centers, which are anchored by grocery stores, indicated that his occupancy rates have increased   recently  Like Bill Poole, we have several trucking companies based in our District  What we’re   hearing from most of them suggests that shipments are increasing in a fairly marked way  So   conditions look fairly strong in our District  Every silver lining has a touch of gray though, as   Jerry Garcia once reminded us  The good news is that another new company opened shop in   Charlotte recently  The bad news is that its business is helping other companies outsource their   activities to India  [Laughter]   On the national economy, in the spring and summer of this year some of us were needling   the staff about being too optimistic; they were much more optimistic than other forecasters  But   let the record show that they got it right—at least in terms of the broad direction if not all of the   details  The third-quarter growth rate in GDP, of course, exceeded even the October Greenbook   projection, which at the time seemed to be a very optimistic forecast  Earlier Greenbooks also   had predicted that employment would finally begin to grow, and it has, if less robustly than we   might have hoped  Given the recent improvement in business fixed investment and the   persistence of solid household spending, it seems increasingly likely that this recovery is going   to develop into a balanced expansion  The principal risk in the outlook at this point, as I see it at   least, is that the output gap may not close soon enough to avert a further fall in inflation  Weak   wage growth and strong productivity growth in the third quarter combined to deflate unit labor   December 9, 2003 59 of 133    costs at an annual rate of about 6 percent  We probably won’t see anything like that kind of   decline in the current quarter, but the Board staff is projecting a further small decline, and it   could be larger than they have forecast     From my standpoint there is just no way to get around the fact that this kind of unit labor   cost performance constitutes a moderate disinflation risk in the outlook, at least for now  I   recognize that, with economic activity clearly accelerating, there is now an upside inflation risk   as well as a downside disinflation risk  This is clearly going to be a tricky passage for monetary   policy over the course of the next several months  But given that we are now at the lower bound   of what I’ll call—for lack of a better term—our inflation tolerance range, I think we should   continue to be concerned primarily about preventing a further decline in inflation  We should   have ample time to react to any evidence of incipient inflation pressures, and I just don’t see such   evidence at this point     Mr Chairman, I support your policy recommendation  I especially   liked what you said about preemption and particularly the issues we could face now in that   regard versus what we faced when the inflation rate was 3 percent or higher in past periods  I   could accept Don’s edit regarding preemption, but I like the general thrust of what you said  I   think it’s especially relevant     I can accept your recommendation with regard to the language  My own preference   would have been to leave all of the statement unchanged under the circumstances  I understand   the intuition, but I personally don’t see a compelling reason on the logic, given what I understand   December 9, 2003 100 of 133    to be the facts, for making a change today  But I can accept it  I’m very glad that we’re going to   leave in the “considerable period” reference  I think that’s where the public focus is going to be    For me the key point, as I mentioned earlier, is that we had an extraordinary decline in unit labor   costs in the third quarter  We may be looking at further declines, and that is a key determinant of   inflation going forward  Again, the actual and prospective inflation rate is at the bottom of what   I think most of us see as the desirable range for the longer run  Given that situation, I would not   want to send a signal to the market that I think a significant modification of the language would   have sent  That’s my feeling, so I support your position     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think our District’s economic picture is   not unlike Cathy’s  There is certainly some good news in the latest information we have   received, both in the data and the anecdotal reports  Activity continues to expand at a fairly good   pace as best we can tell, at least for now  Manufacturing, in particular, is in much better health   March 16, 2004 34 of 107    now than it was a year ago—or even six months ago, I think it’s fair to say  We do a monthly   survey, and its latest readings indicate that factory shipments and new orders were very robust in   both January and February  Consumer spending has also been reasonably strong in this period,   according to both the monthly survey we conduct and anecdotal information    At our board meeting last week, all three of our class A banking directors indicated   robust growth in both business and household credit loan demand  And one of our directors,   who is the CEO of a broadcasting company that has TV and radio affiliates not just in our   District but in a number of major market areas around the country, indicated that recently there   has been a sharp upswing in ad revenue in her business  So we currently see some positive   indicators in our regional economy in general     Moreover, there is at least one positive development in District labor markets, which is   that factory employment is now stabilizing after declining for many, many months  I made that   point at our last meeting, and as far as we can tell it’s still basically the case  Obviously, though,   after so many months of decline, manufacturing employment is stabilizing at a very low level,   and it is stabilizing only; we don’t have any evidence at this point that it’s really moving up    More broadly, I don’t have a sense of any significant firming in the job market overall in our   region, and I think that is beginning to have a negative impact on confidence  I don’t want to   overstate that, but I hear indications of this impact in some of the comments I am getting from   our business contacts   Turning now to the national economy, the soft February jobs report got my attention, as it   did everyone else’s  In all my years in this business, I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a monthly report   receive more attention than that one  And it provided what may well be a healthy reminder that   this expansion does not yet have full momentum; in fact, I think there’s some possibility that the   March 16, 2004 35 of 107    momentum is diminishing  The Greenbook has revised down fairly considerably its projections   for real GDP growth for the first half of this year and to a lesser degree for the year as a whole  I   think that was an appropriate revision, given what we know now, and as a result the projected   output gap has increased appreciably  The wider gap presumably would put downward pressure   on core inflation, other things being equal, but the Greenbook expects this effect to be offset in   part by some spillage from higher energy prices into the core inflation rate  Of course, the   weaker dollar also probably played into your overall inflation forecast, David   I think the wider projected output gap is important, but I’ve always thought that a really   important determinant of inflation and disinflation trends in the short and intermediate term is   unit labor costs  So, when I try to assess the inflation risk, I tend to focus at least conceptually   on some measure of the gap between actual and potential employment and on whether that gap is   narrowing, staying constant, or widening  The last several job reports imply that the   employment gap has been widening, given that job growth as measured by the payroll survey has   fallen well short of most estimates of the growth of the working-age population  The Greenbook   doesn’t report its estimate of potential employment and the employment gap, so I don’t know   exactly what the forecast implies for that gap as we go forward over the forecast period  The gap   may narrow  But it’s not clear how sizable the narrowing will be if potential employment is   growing at something like the growth of the working-age population    Beyond this, as Bill Poole has already noted in his question, there’s a wide range of   plausible estimates of actual productivity growth over the forecast period  And obviously if   productivity growth doesn’t slow as much as expected, the employment gap would be   commensurately higher for any given growth rate of GDP  There is, of course, the hopeful   possibility that at some point rising productivity will produce a sharp further improvement in   March 16, 2004 36 of 107    expectations of future income and that, in turn, will give an upward boost to the growth of   aggregate demand  But I don’t see any compelling evidence that this kind of shift has occurred   yet     So bottom line, I come out in the opposite camp from you, Cathy  While the   Greenbook’s projections of the growth of aggregate demand seem quite reasonable to me—and I   think the staff’s overall forecast is the most likely outcome—the labor market considerations I’ve   just summarized suggest to me that we may not be giving enough weight to the downside risk on   inflation  I think Bob Parry’s questions had a sense of the same sort of concern, and if others   feel that way, I would hope that we could find a way to reflect this in our policy setting later in   the meeting     First, Mr Chairman, let me associate myself with Tony’s comments   about the Bluebook  I also felt that it was very well thought out this time, but I would be   comforted, Vincent, by your putting in all three options, which would indicate that we’re   expected to have action alternatives most of the time going forward   On policy, Mr Chairman, I may be an outlier even in the Kohn camp  In fact, after I   finish my comments here, I might be kicked out of the Kohn camp!  I guess I have an extreme   view, but let me just express it because I think it needs to be said  As I look at the economic   situation, it seems to me that the evidence we have on the labor market to date suggests that the   slack in that market is not diminishing but increasing  To me, that is fundamental  I’ve been   thinking about what is going to happen to the inflation rate and where the risks lie on inflation   going forward  In my view Don made a very good point that there is limited evidence, at best,   that disinflation actually has ceased and some evidence that it may be continuing  I was also   impressed by Roger’s comment in the economic discussion that, with the kinds of imbalances we   seem to have, there is a likelihood of increases in some relative prices  I don’t discount those   price increases entirely, but in this environment the risk that they will generate a quick   acceleration of inflation still seems to me to be less than it would be otherwise    So, I don’t think we’re giving enough weight to the disinflation risk  After long   reflection, I have concluded that we ought to give it greater weight, so I’m basically in an   alternative A mode  I realize I’m defining the extreme of the range of views here, but I wouldn’t   be satisfied even with the language in alternative A as far as the assessment of risks is concerned    March 16, 2004 84 of 107    The statement there is that the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation has   diminished in recent months  I don’t know whether I agree with that  I’m not at all sure that’s   the case    Therefore, my own preference—and, again, I realize this is an extreme view—is, first of   all, to get the possibility of an easing in policy in the statement, or at least to recognize that   possibility  That has been off the table now for a long time, and I think it’s time to consider   putting it back on  So the way I would write the two sentences, if it were my call, would be   something like this  “The probability of an unwelcome further fall in inflation has risen   modestly in recent weeks and once again appears to be somewhat greater than the risk of a rise in   inflation  Consequently, while policy eventually will need to become less accommodative as the   economy improves, somewhat greater accommodation may be appropriate in the interim”     In July 1973, I’m told, Mr Chairman  But I don’t remember    [Laughter]     It made a big impression; I was just too nervous to remember     Right, August 1     I’ve got more time for a last shot then!  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to depart a little from my usual   practice here and go directly to the national economy and the overall forecast  Frankly, recent   developments in our District don’t deviate much from what appears to be happening at the national   level, so I don’t think I would add a whole lot of value this morning by going through specifics   about the regional picture   With respect to the national economy, I don’t recall many times over the years—and   certainly not recently—when the incoming statistical data over an intermeeting period have changed   my view of the near-term outlook and the balance of risks quite as markedly as in this most recent   period  The flow of data that David reviewed, from the release of the March jobs report through the   first-quarter GDP report, finally provides some fairly compelling evidence that the economy may   now be moving toward a balanced growth path and reasonably full employment  The growth in   aggregate demand seems to be broadly based, and productivity growth has now slowed to a point   where further increases in demand will stimulate additional job growth  Moreover, the core   May 4, 2004 23 of 112       inflation data over the last few months suggest that the disinflation risk that has worried me and a lot   of other people around the table recently may now be behind us     At the same time, along the lines of some of the cautionary remarks you made, David, the   employment gap and the output gap are still sizable  Unit labor costs are still behaving reasonably   well, so I’m not yet alarmed about inflation pressures, especially since I think our credibility for low   inflation is still high  So it looks like a balanced and, at this point at least, still noninflationary   expansion may finally be taking root  But as we all know, in this policy business when we begin to   get comfortable that things look good, that’s when we have to be careful  So I thought I would use   my remaining time—building on some of the comments that have already been made—to talk about   how recent developments in the foreign sector, especially in China, could create some risk for the   US economy going forward  I should mention that my comments will reflect conversations I’ve   had with Marvin Goodfriend, who just returned from an IMF mission to the Peoples Bank of China    We’ve had some very interesting discussions, and I’d like to share some of our thoughts with you    It appears that the recent firming in core US inflation reflects importantly the end of   deflation in durable goods prices When one disaggregates the data—and some of our staff members   have done that—this reversal in turn appears to be related at least in part to the strong global   demand for manufactured goods, especially in China  China’s overall trade balance has apparently   now moved into deficit  Clearly, China’s boom is outstripping its capacity to produce manufactured   goods, and the effects of that are now spilling over to the economies of its trading partners,   including to some extent this one, I think  We see effects, for example, on textile producers—  especially of industrial fabrics—in the Carolinas  I’m talking not only about business going to   China but business coming from China to their companies     May 4, 2004 24 of 112       The problem, of course, is that by all accounts the boom in China is unsustainable  Money   and credit has been growing at an annual rate of around 20 percent for a couple of years  That’s   about twice as fast as productivity growth there, as I understand it, so it’s not surprising that the   deflation of a couple of years ago in China is now giving way to inflation, which I think is currently   about 3 percent  I’m comforted by Karen’s suggestion that inflation in China may now begin to   back down; but looking back to their last boom, which I guess was in the mid-1990s, inflation   reached about 20 percent in that period  The Chinese economy now is a lot larger than it was then   and therefore has significantly greater potential to affect the US economy  Moreover, investment   is a much larger part of Chinese GDP than it is in the United States  And investment, of course, is   the most cyclically active GDP component   Unfortunately, as I think we all know, China still does not have institutions in place that can   easily deal with this situation and, in particular, that can easily meet the monetary policy challenges   they are already facing  They don’t have a strong independent central bank  They don’t have a   healthy commercial banking system  They don’t have fully flexible interest rates  They don’t have   a floating exchange rate  The authorities basically have had to use controls to deal with these kinds   of issues in the past, and they haven’t worked very well  With the economy now much larger and at   least in the process of transitioning to a market economy, those controls may be even less effective    So, while we may be getting some slowing in inflation in China at this point, the boom could   continue for some time and ultimately create a very high rate of inflation there  On the other hand,   the authorities could intervene more rapidly and aggressively than they have in some past cycles and   precipitate an early recession  We just don’t know yet  But it seems to me that the upside risk in the   situation is probably the greater risk   May 4, 2004 25 of 112       Bottom line, against this background it seems to me that the Committee should make a   special effort to determine as best we can the degree to which instability in the Chinese   macroeconomy could affect the US economy and potentially US monetary policy going forward    I’m sure Karen and her staff are already working on this  But if the potential effect is found to be   large either currently or not too far down the road, I think the Committee may well want to include   in its review of global developments an assessment of stabilization policy in China—at least from   time to time, and if the situation looks serious enough, perhaps on a regular basis  I won’t be around   to hear it, but I think it would be a good idea for the Committee to do that  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Mr Chairman, I’m very comfortable with your recommendation  I feel   very strongly that we should use the “measured” language for all of the reasons you have listed  I   also agree with Roger’s and Don’s points—and Cathy’s as well  Fundamentally there’s still a   considerable amount of slack in the economy, as I see it  Also, and this is a point I would   emphasize, I believe that we still have credibility for low inflation  This is not late 1993 or early   1994, when we did not have credibility  I know there is some survey evidence of rising inflation   expectations, and there are a lot of anecdotal reports as well, but I don’t see any really dramatic   recent change in inflation compensation or in spreads for indexed bonds in financial markets,   especially in the longer-term five-year to ten-year area  Basically, I believe that we need to think   differently about the potential benefits of a preemptive tightening of policy—or what might be   perceived as a preemptive tightening of policy—in a situation where we have price stability as   distinct from a situation where we were at the last stage of ending a twenty-five-year war against   inflation  In my view, the language indicating that we can remove policy accommodation at a   measured pace would be consistent with these considerations   May 4, 2004 93 of 112       Earlier, Mr Chairman, you told me that I could have about thirty additional seconds to talk   today  If I may have about five seconds here, I’d like to quickly share a little anecdote that you may   enjoy  Some of you may recall that at the last meeting I was pretty much at one end of the   spectrum—even beyond the Kohn camp [Laughter]  I paid for that at the hands of my colleague,   Jack Guynn, a few days ago  Jack, of course, is the President of the Atlanta Fed, which is the Sixth   Federal Reserve District  But as some of you may know, he was actually born in the Fifth Federal   Reserve District, in the Shenandoah Valley  He has a nice younger brother named Doug, who is a   very prominent attorney there  I had to make a speech in that area a couple of weeks ago, and Doug   very kindly invited me to stay with him  Jack happened to be there as well  Doug has a wonderful   house overlooking the mountains, and he gave me a beautiful room to stay in, and for the first time   in my career, there was a bouquet of flowers in my room  But Doug kept asking me to look   carefully at the flowers  I couldn’t understand why until, eventually, I saw that in the flower   arrangement there was a carved wooden dove sent by his brother, Jack  [Laughter]  Jack, that really   hurts!  I hope you take some comfort that I’m a bit closer to the center of gravity today
