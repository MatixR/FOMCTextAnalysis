4628,1992-03-11," I'm here Good morning  Thank you  This is Jerry Jordan in Cleveland I have not had a full briefing yet on conditions in the District since arriving, but my first impression yesterday was how incredibly cold it is here! Part of the District, though, is not different--  -12-    3/11/92  Very good news Conditions here certainly are not different from what is being reported for other Districts around the country One statement that we can make is that it is not getting any worse and that there has been a very tentative improvement In fact, retail sales in February were reportedly better than expected though there is not a lot of confidence about how sustainable that is yet "
4654,1992-03-31," May I ask one clarification?  Something out of my past struck me here about the BIS Twenty-odd years ago, in an environment of a weak dollar, the Germans were intervening and acquiring more dollars than they wanted to put into US Treasuries, especially special certificates of indebtedness, at very low yields So, they were making deposits at the BIS for a period and that gave rise to a phenomenon that later was labeled ""rabbits out of hats"" When the Bundesbank realized what was going on, they drastically cut their deposits at the BIS, forcing a contraction of dollar credits by the BIS I would want to be assured on this that we're not making the same mistake in reverse by putting DM on deposit there and having them extend the DM credits They are not a central bank I don't know what the full set of transactions is that they are doing, and it struck me as interesting that we're sort of reaching for yield on our foreign portfolio but not on the domestic portfolio Every dollar's worth of DM we hold in CDs at the BIS is that much less US Treasuries that we hold  But in lieu of other sources funds to the BIS will not [unintelligible] their balance sheets?  Let me first characterize my thoughts about the economy in the last couple of years to put things in the context of where I think we are now When the economy doesn't expand, I look for the depressants because I think there's an inherent tendency for the economy to expand and that [if it does not], something is either causing it to contract or have sub-par growth or preventing very rapid growth Two years ago there were many depressants, but two certainly stood out and are still with us today One was the cuts in defense spending, and that [depressant] may even be increasing in some local economies The other was the unwinding of commercial construction That has not been a depressant in the Fourth District but it's still there in some parts of the country, though lessening I think A third was the oil shock, as brief as it was Nevertheless, I think that was the factor that did push us into negative GDP for a couple of quarters, but that is now reversed Except to the extent that falling energy prices may be a very mild depressant--energy is weak--I don't think we're getting any depressing impulse there The fourth is monetary policy There were occasions in the last couple of years when I thought that it was too restrictive But I don't think that now; I think it is adequately stimulative And the depressant that has emerged or been reinforced over the last several months is the one that Jerry Corrigan mentioned also, the fiscal side I think that is feeding into the psychology affecting longer-term interest rates in the bond markets And concerns about the lack of fiscal discipline in  -23-    3/31/92  this country are either direct threats to the economy or indirect threats to the actions we can take through monetary policy  Where I come out is that I don't disagree with Mike Prell's description of the economy in 1992, but for 1993 I would be a little stronger than he is The arguments for why [growth] is going to slow [over the course of] 1993 I don't find satisfying at this point  At the District level, we held a small business roundtable discussion and advisory meeting ten days ago We had twelve bankers from around the District All parts of the District were represented and all but one reported better conditions They said their local economies were improving One banker in northwest Pennsylvania said that the economy was still pretty much flat The others seemed to think that their situation had improved over the last few months There was a general sense of optimism, of things getting better Residential construction, including even some commercial construction, [was up] and all reported that retail sales were better, though there was not a lot of confidence that it would continue so Capital goods manufacturing has been quite strong The recession that we went through a couple of quarters ago was the mildest in Ohio in the postwar period Always in every recession before Ohio has had a sharper decline in employment than the nation That didn't happen this time So, the contrast between Ohio in my District and Michigan is really dramatic Ohio didn't have the stimulus of commercial construction before so the state didn't have the depressant of it going away And the state had the benefit of good export demand and probably more importantly import substitution, taking back domestic markets previously lost for capital goods industries The general mood in that part of the Great Lakes region is very [upbeat]  Over the last couple of months we have had the steepest yield curve in several decades from bills to bonds And putting bills on a coupon equivalent basis so we can understand what it is [and say] anything with any confidence at all about the future would indicate that the yield curve tends to flatten as the expansion progresses so that most likely later this year, or a year from now, we'll get a yield curve that is flatter than it is today And I hope very, very much that it comes from the long end In fact, if I were still in the private sector I'd probably be willing to bet that that  -38-    3/31/92  flattening will occur at the long end as concerns over fiscal policy tend to dissipate and people become comfortable with the idea that expansion can not only occur but may even be robust without any kind of inflation But I am concerned about what has been happening to the yield curve in the last several weeks The flattening has been occurring starting at the long end and kind of rolling down the curve, first with the 10-year note moving up toward the 3-year area and rolling down to the 3-year area And David Mullins's comments about the forward rates I thought were very perceptive [unintelligible] market So, we have had a flattening from 3 years on out and a considerable steepening from 1 year to 3 years, and at the same time a shift up in the 3- and 6-month and 1-year bill rates  I was interested in the go-around on the economy to hear about the false start last year and concerns that it might happen again But one of the differences today is that we have a bill rate above the funds rate and it has been so for some weeks That hasn't happened in a couple of years If that continues with the flattening or rolling down of the yield curve toward the shorter end and we get upward pressure on short rates, especially from the bill rates pushing up relative to the funds rate, then I would like to know what the implications for Desk operations are going to be if the funds rate is held firm at the 4 percent level I think, if we're right about the outlook, that the funds rate at 4 percent is too high as inflation expectations subside and as the long end rallies back down But I'd be concerned about not having the leeway to allow the funds rate to be pulled up if these bill rates start to be under a lot of upward pressure in the spring months So, for that reason I'd like to see [the language] symmetric in either direction "
4680,1992-05-19," I'm new to the process and didn't participate in your discussions before, but I like the direction The desirable level, I think, is so far below $20 billion deutschemarks that I'm perfectly comfortable with getting down there  May I follow up on that question?  In the Greenbook, Part 2, on page III-3 you list the indirect effects of Larry's question You say ""velocity rose further despite declines in opportunity costs Recent weakness in M2 occurred in the face of still small opportunity costs"" You refer to a chart and so on But then I flip over to page III-5 in the paragraph at the top of the page where it says ""the lack of aggressive pricing for these deposits evidently has encouraged investors to move from retail CDs into stock and bond mutual funds in order to take advantage of higher anticipated returns"" That says, at least for some components of M2, that the real opportunity cost is not the short-term yield change in the chart on the prior page but rather these longer-term yields and that those components of M2 are more like investments instruments than they are like money instruments So, that paragraph says that you've got the wrong opportunity cost, at least for those components of money  But the reason for asking comes back to what Mike was saying [about whether] what the Greenbook says this month is right The Greenbook says long bond yields have come down because of lower inflation; Mike termed that very appropriately [unintelligible] very hopeful outlook for 1993 I'd like to believe it But the question was What are the risks to the forecast? Can you connect up what is going on with these components of money and [say that] part of this optimistic outlook on inflation reflects the economy or is there something a little stronger than that to tie it to? Part of it, I assume, is also because of slow growth of M2 Given this reason for slow growth of M2, how comfortable can you be with that?  With symmetric risks?  To comment exactly on that point, the commercial bank I was with conducted eight auctions before I left They were all in the Southwest and on the West Coast But the process was Once we  -11-    5/19/92  did the first auction and generated the interest that there is a market out there, each one went better than expected and better than the prior one because it was clear that there was a core market left; [we started] in Texas and then we went over to Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado It appeared to us that there were a lot of people who had been waiting for the bottom, figuring that this was going to be the buy of the century in commercial real estate, in particular Some of it was raw land but most of it was in structures As they saw each successive auction going better, with greater interest than the prior one, they became concerned that they had missed the low point and it tended to feed on itself with great success  The first one was about 18 months ago, and then about 4 months elapsed before we tried the second one And from that point it picked up in pace  Well, just over the last 10 weeks the sense around the Fourth District is that things are definitely improving The comments from all parts of the District have been of a uniformly upbeat nature The negative tones come in on the lack of robustness-- not on the direction but the vigor--and still with expressions of concern about the durability or sustainability of the expansion There are frequent references by full-time directors and members of our small business advisory and small banker advisory councils to having been disappointed last year when they thought the recovery was under way, and they are concerned now that we could have another false start Most of the durable goods manufacturers, especially the capital goods firms that have the ability to export, are experiencing very strong order books Some are exporting to Canada and some to Europe with some surprise at the strength, especially in Germany, in their capital goods [orders] A number are expressing pleasure at having recaptured domestic markets, especially those in the auto sector who now are able to start selling to Japanese transplant companies and finding success against foreign competition in that area  To catch up a bit with you on where you are compared to where you thought you were I don't know what you were looking at in terms of alternatives in your midyear review last year but you mentioned an easing in policy since last summer If at that time you had run your model contemplating a drop of 200 basis points in the funds rate over the next nine months, what would you have been projecting for the Committee in terms of monetary growth?  With your past experience with the model, what is the probability you would assign of an offsetting error going forward? Is that a tendency you have any confidence in?  Okay, that answer suggests a one-time level adjustment on M2, a mirror image of what happened in 1983 when MMDAs were introduced  We got double-digit growth of M2 for about a year We all recognized it as a shift of the level and then resumed [with] what a model [would predict] afterwards  Is that the way you would characterize this period?  I always have to translate what I think it really means when people talk in terms of raising and lowering the funds rate in the sense of tightening and easing policy I've come to understand that easing in the sense of the funds rate doesn't mean we are more stimulative necessarily and raising the funds rate doesn't mean we are more restrictive We have difficulties [not only] in communicating [that] outside this room, but translating it inside  I was pleased that Governor Lindsey mentioned the 1930s in that context of easing and tightening because otherwise I would have been shy about mentioning something that relates to 60 years ago I read that period a little differently in that, first of all, asset prices historically have always risen in advance of output prices and the reverse, taking the stock market as the measure of asset prices And, of course, in that earlier period asset prices were falling very sharply; and it turned out to be a good indicator of what was going to be happening to output prices, deflation Governor Lindsey mentioned how money shrank by one-third in that period as interest rates fell, so was policy tighter or easier? I think it was tight The money measure, though, was a very narrow measure, even narrower than today's published Ml And today the very narrow measures, ie, reserves, Ml, [unintelligible] are growing extraordinarily rapidly And I think we interpret those as biasing our actions in the direction of stimulus to the point that, if credit demand grows and short-term rates are under upward pressure, a higher funds rate would be interpreted as a tighter policy I would view it as stimulative if we were lagging behind the market I think there is a risk going forward as the economy gains momentum that we could lag behind the market and our actions would be stimulative while raising the funds rate would have the label ""tight"" on it If we should get a good rally in the bond market--something I hope very, very much for--and a flattening [of the yield curve] from the long end, and if that should carry with it downward pressure on the bill rate on a full-coupon equivalent basis toward a level well below the funds rate, then I think it would be appropriate to lower the funds rate and not hold it up artificially If the bill rate were rallying down we would have to drain reserves and contract monetary growth, and I wouldn't like to see that So, I come down on the side of symmetric with a bias in the direction of up, especially promptly up, if credit demands so warrant "
4705,1992-06-30," That logic has a chicken and egg problem if the idea is that you want a stronger currency to help asset prices, but what is going on in that market [relates to] this purchasing power parity in tradable goods, neglecting asset prices The dominant factor is what is going on in that system--weakness in real estate and equity and other asset prices--and the idea that they can do something with the exchange rate to turn around asset prices doesn't wash  I was monitoring the ""Call"" this period and was struck by a couple of things There were at least two occasions when the projection was for a need to add reserves but the funds rate was    6/30-7/1/92  trading down toward 3-5/8 percent So, even though the projection would have called for adding reserves, at least tentatively the program was to drain reserves in order to avoid giving a false message to the markets as to our intentions And then there seemed to be some gaming going on in the Street by some banks that were bidding up the funds rate just at the ""Call"" time Whatever it was they were looking at, they were thinking ""Uh oh!"" and trying to keep us from doing what we otherwise would have done  What is your reaction to that kind of heuristic action-reaction? We would have wound up doing something in reserve supplying operations that really wasn't consistent with what we wanted to do because of this perception And then they would have a perception on the other side regarding what we might do and try to game it in order to prevent us from doing it  You could now be in [a similar] position in the opposite direction With the funds rate at 3-7/8 percent if you saw a need to drain, [you would] feel compelled to add reserves--to do something that is not really consistent with supplying reserves--in order to avoid giving a wrong signal  So, maintaining the funds rate is more restrictive than lowering the funds rate given where the Street [thinking] is?  Well, [I mean] in terms of reserves We have to supply less or drain more in order to maintain the same funds rate, given where the yield curve is  Not quite because I don't really interpret tightening in terms of where the funds rate is I really don't care [about that]  I do care about reserve operations If the yield curve is under downward pressure, wouldn't you drain more reserves or supply fewer reserves than you would have otherwise in order to support the same funds rate [objective]? In this recent period when the funds rate was trending down you were saying you saw a need to ease but you actually were going to have to drain reserves to maintain the same funds rate  Back to that comment about inflation I'm very sympathetic to the latter part of your presentation and your responses to questions I think this issue of the transition costs and how they are related to the credibility of our commitment to price stability deserves a lot of attention That's a very difficult issue but a very important one, and I think we need to keep reemphasizing it But I found Chart 14 very disturbing Whatever the model or theory we have [to explain] those kinds of relationships [as they may relate to] progress toward actively reducing inflation, it gives rise to the perception on the part of the public at large and political people that credibility of that the commitment is tied to our ability to withstand political pressures, in other words the willingness to [unintelligible] Credibility of the price stability commitment is tied to tolerance of slack, a gap of actual output below potential, or an unemployment rate above the natural rate So then it becomes a contest of political wills, which I don't think any of us believes is embodied in what we're doing To tie together the progress toward reducing inflation to any kind of real magnitude [in] explaining what monetary policy has done or is doing shifts the nature of the discussion, I think  I understand  But even that response--saying that slack gives [impetus to disinflation]--may be based on a model that says the appearance of slack is information that people use in forming their expectations I don't know how people form their expectations Some people will cite budget deficits; some people will cite the past; some will cite politics But by saying that it has to do with slack or unemployment being above what is perceived to be an acceptable rate may be simply something that helps people form their judgments about future inflation But that again ties it back to a tolerance on the part of this group to that slack or unemployment--and I find that very troubling--rather than the more straightforward way of saying that what we're talking about when we talk about inflation is the purchasing power of money over time And, therefore, one would talk about it in terms of money growth  Well, I don't disagree with the dynamics that you're describing, given the institutional context and the rest I'm just hesitant to explain to anyone that I think inflation will come down because of the high unemployment rate  First, I have some comments from a District perspective Traveling around the Fourth District and getting acquainted with bankers and business people all over the area, I'm most often meeting people for the first time It's been very helpful, very instructive In manufacturing, which is very important in the District, the general sense is that things are improving modestly The headlines will be something like ""British Petroleum lays off 300"" That's front page news But Ford Motor Company recalling 800 or planning to add another 800 doesn't make the news; or Goodyear, Reliance Electric, or Piedmont Corporation adding workers, if it shows up at all, is back on the third or fourth page or buried well inside  -22-    6/30-7/1/92  the paper When I talk to business people about their own views they tend to convey a sense of ""well, we're doing a little better but we're worried about the national economy"" And they're worried about the national economy either because of the budget deficit or because of national politics and concern about what kind of leadership we have, believing that the long-run outlook for the economy depends very much on political leadership rather than institutional factors But they do not reconcile in a way that's clear to me what they are seeing or feeling as they personalize their own businesses with what they think about the economy at large The retailers comment about how slow sales have been and usually attribute that to weather, which carries with it, of course, the expectation that sales are going to pick up with better weather So they could easily be disappointed if better weather comes and they don't see sales and order books picking up  When I quiz people about their inflation outlook, consistently manufacturers and retailers say that it's not a question of inflation, it's a question of deflation They ask How do we manage stable prices or a decline in prices? But they think that the national inflation rate is going to be 4 or 5 percent Very rarely do I find somebody who is talking about something less than 4 percent over a 5- to 10-year horizon, even though in their own businesses they don't expect to be able to increase prices So there is a disparity [between] what they face or feel they are contending with and this national [view] When I ask why they don't believe us about going to price stability and what that world would be like in terms of interest rates and other things, they often cite the budget deficit or national politics or [what they see as] the outlook for easy money-- that sort of thing There is no real substance to why they feel that way  A few other comments on sectoral developments We see strong increases in bookings at hotels throughout the District; the convention business in the Fourth District is really doing quite well, maybe in part because it didn't have a boom so it didn't have a bust and kind of moved right through this When I try to elicit sympathy for how tough things are in southern California where I'm from, I get no sympathy at all They think it's well deserved! [Laughter] There have been reports of a pickup in residential activity throughout the District; we're seeing some new home starts pretty well throughout the whole area One banker reported commercial lending up 12 percent year-over-year; he happens to be in an area where Ford Motor Company is recalling workers and adding workers That's balanced off against bankers in the more agricultural areas expressing concern about a third year of drought; [they say] they're going to be getting a lot of keys if we do have a third year of drought But they have carried [the farmers] this long; they need rain and there's nothing they can do about that  When I talk to bankers about interest rates and inflation, consistently without exception they talk about higher interest rates and higher inflation I asked them why we don't see more growth in time certificates of deposits They say it's because their customers are waiting for higher rates and don't want to get locked in Why are they waiting for higher rates? [They reply that] when we get the higher inflation, we're going to get higher interest rates And I asked them why they don't tell their customers that that is not going to happen They say because it is going to happen; we are going to get higher interest rates because we'll get higher inflation as soon  -23-    6/30-7/1/92  as we get [more economic] growth I've asked them to consider a world in which we have roughly stable inflation and what that means and what they're going to pay on their checkable deposits and their regular savings--what it was like, say, in the early 1960s And they simply say they don't believe it [will happen]; they're not willing to lower checkable rates or regular savings rates and make their customers, especially their older generation customers, unhappy because they will just have to raise them again as soon as growth picks up or as soon as inflation picks up  Turning to the national economy, I don't disagree significantly with the Greenbook I guess I would be a little more optimistic on real growth--on the higher end of the [Committee members'] range--but not any different at all, really, on the inflation outlook for the near term The comment that Mike made about capital goods was consistent with what I heard throughout the District; I heard the same kind of phrase about the pickup in capital goods being far from spectacular Most of our capital goods suppliers say they are getting more orders; the transplant plants especially are picking up business from the foreign producers and taking back domestic markets But they all would characterize it as ""not spectacular growth""  I have two questions One is particularly to help me understand some of the terminology Would you say a little more about what you meant when you started off about using the aggregates as an information variable? Aggregates have been used as an indicator in two different senses sometimes to underline the thrust of monetary policy actions influencing economic activity and sometimes as a more timely indicator of information about what is going on in economic activity compared to national income account information or other reports Is there a tendency on the part of the staff at this point to go one way or the another as to how you use these as indicators?  I've agonized quite a bit over this issue of uncertainty about the velocities and control in hitting targets versus the information to the public at large--the need to announce the targets and how that is stated I would not like to see targets announced in such a way that we are lowering the ranges and the headlines read ""The Fed Tightens Policy"" without [our action] being tied to some other things that would condition that perception I go back to what Bob Parry said yesterday afternoon in the first go-around as he concluded his statement about the importance of making our longer-run intentions clear With the uncertainty or the discomfort over what is going on in the legislative and executive branches of government and the current political situation, it is not the right message for this institution to say ""Well, if you thought that was bad enough, we've lost our compass as well and we also are not sure about the future and the outlook""  The monetary aggregates, especially M2 with its long historical record despite all our uncertainty about M2 as currently put together, are still the best guide that we have for communicating to people what the long-run outlook is And we have to do what we can to say this will still serve for the foreseeable future I was not a part of your deliberations not to lower the target range this year, so I'm not in a position of either saying ""I told you so"" or having to defend something now that was done without the considerable advantage of hindsight I thought it was useful information to the public at large that the target ranges were gradually lowered year-by-year, with either the upper or lower bound or both being brought down Had that  -41-    6/30-7/1/92  sequence been continued this year you would have [established a range of] 2 to 6 percent, which I think would have been very desirable, and we would be looking at 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for next year and 1 to 5 percent for the year after that and would be serious about it And that would help people in thinking about the long run We've been in the situation very recently of being at the bottom end or even below the bottom end of the range, and people are wondering if we really are serious about the Ms I thought the action in April couched in terms of M2 was a useful beginning toward saying we're really serious about it in a symmetrical way; if we're below the bottom end of the target range, we'll do something about it and try to get [money growth] up so that people understand that the opposite is also true Therefore, if we were at the top or above the top end of the range, we'd also be serious about that, so people would know that we are committed to moving toward a growth rate of money that is consistent with price stability So, I would like to see the range reset this year at 2 to 6 percent, where I think it should have been anyway I'm in-between alternative I and alternative II To go all the way to 1-1/2 percent now and leave it there for 1993 would lose some information that I think is important But if we leave the bottom end of the range at 2-1/2 percent this year and have 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent again next year, then I think that we are bound to say ""Here's what we're going to do to make very certain that [M2 growth] is at least within the range rather than at the bottom end,"" and couple that with [appropriate] short-run actions  Just to cover what I would really like to see right now [I'd favor] a very unusual event that should not necessarily be a precedent for the future I'd announce the ranges well in advance of the hearings--[the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings] being the customary way to do it--coupled with a strong statement that we are serious about being within the range and are willing to engage in reserve supplying operations consistent with an expectation of lower interest rates [associated] with the lower monetary targets for '93 And especially important to me would be that this be done in a way that the Committee is viewed as being solidly behind both the short-run action and the long-run action I'm very troubled by the perception of the press that changes in the funds rate up or down say something about our long-run commitment to growth versus inflation or the Phillips curve [tradeoff], or that sort of thing So, [I'd suggest] an unusual press conference approach announcing the ranges and the interest rates expected to be associated with them And I'd not do that on the day that the employment numbers come out so that we disassociate the action and the announcement of what we want from a measure like employment or unemployment  I appreciate that uncertainty Presuming knowledge that we don't have is very troubling to me I think that what you have described is the case I agree that we're in some kind of transitional period to an environment that we will all easily recognize 10 years from now, looking back upon the period as maybe an early 1960s [type of] world in terms of inflation and interest rates and various relationships It is also a risk to see things like total bank reserves down for the month of June and M1 or M2 or [some other] measure down The whole array of [monetary measures] is contracting and we are not taking action to do something about it I'm afraid that if we back away from the aggregates generally, especially M2 in the way it has guided this Committee in the past, that we will simply be looking through the aggregates to real economic activity And--  I've taken some comfort previously from the fact that M2 was at the bottom of the range but Ml was off the top of the charts, the monetary base was growing very rapidly, and bank reserves were growing very rapidly Given that, I concluded that probably the truth was someplace in between; M2 was probably understating stimulus and Ml and other [measures] were overstating it Now, it's only one month of information, and I don't want to put too much [emphasis on] that, but I am uncomfortable with the idea that [all the monetary measures] seem to be contracting all at once  That's why I was suggesting coupling them on just this one occasion While they are independent in some respects, as I said, I wouldn't be happy to see a headline that says ""Fed Tightens Policy"" if we lower the ranges; but I also wouldn't be happy to see a headline saying ""The Fed Caves In"" if we cut the funds rate  Putting the two together and announcing the range and an expectation of lower rates in order to achieve these [monetary growth objectives] is an important message about the future  I have both a question about how this would be explained and also a recommendation But before I get to either I have a couple of comments that may sound like digressions but to me at least they have a point First, I'm in somewhat of an uncomfortable position having written in 1982 very positively and glowingly about the good relationship between Ml and nominal GNP and the stability of M1 velocity over the prior 20 odd years just at about the time it was breaking down So, I am hesitant about riding a horse that is in the process of change Some 20 to 25 odd years ago or more, there was a lot of discussion in this Committee, in System committees on the directive, and in academic circles about technological change and innovation--what was going on in the financial system--suggesting that the relationship between the narrow aggregate, Ml and economic activity would break down because of velocity growing extremely rapidly due to things like sweep accounts, point-of-sale transactions, automatic transfers, credit card utilization, and so on The idea was that the demand for some narrow measures of transactions liabilities, maybe even currency, would decline and so velocity would [grow] Well, we had exactly the opposite in spite of all that wisdom that went into what would be wrong with Ml  In the late 1970s there was a great deal of work done, some by the Board's staff, some by staff of the Reserve Banks and by  -54-    6/30-7/1/92  economists of commercial banks--the ABA advisory committee was very active in it--assisting in the effort to try to improve control of the narrow monetary aggregates That wound up in the 1980 omnibus legislation The way we got to the single uniform reserve ratio on all transactions liabilities was that we wanted to crown M1 We wanted to reduce the variability of the multiplier so that when balances shifted from Reserve City banks to country banks, members, nonmembers, savings and loans and on and on, we stopped getting all the noise we were getting We entered into this legislation with Bob Weintraub's help [unintelligible] That may have helped in the very short-run sense because nothing happened with Ml; [that] would do us no good at all in terms of M2 My question first before the recommendation is If the targets were not changed for '92 and '93, would that be accompanied--in addition to a statement that we're studying this and we're comfortable being below the target range pending results of studies and we're not going to do anything--by a fairly clear indication that we're not going to lower the range and we are going to [take] actions intended to bring the growth back within that range?  Given that response, I guess I come out where Bob Parry suggested in that he doesn't see what the cost is of--  My recommendation then is that we indicate in addition to the point that we are very seriously studying these relationships that we also are going to do more than just study this and we're going to be making recommendations in order to enhance both their control and maybe their relationship with economic activity My preferred recommendation for some time on that idea is to move to a  -55-    6/30-7/1/92  system, which would require legislation, of a single very low reserve ratio applied to all non capital liabilities On M2, we don't want a single reserve ratio as we currently have only on transactions liabilities and not on nontransaction liabilities We have this oddity of unbound banks and surplus vault cash and on and on which confuses the issue even as to what total reserves are in the usual way of thinking My guess is that [the single reserve ratio] would be well under 5 percent It would both correct the competitive inequity problems in the banking industry today caused by the way FDIC insurance is assessed in combination with Reg D and the way we impose reserve requirements whether they're domestic oriented or funded [unintelligible] pay the higher tax or franchise fee than does a wholesale bank or money center bank  With the advantage of whatever hindsight there is in the last few months, if you felt very strongly about 1-1/2 percent for growth of an aggregate in the second quarter--and it was talked about a couple of months back--would an experimental model have suggested that if there had been a sufficient cutting of the funds rate it would have produced that kind of growth? And would we know about which components of M3 are going down [unintelligible]?  It seems to me that there are only two ways we're going to get stronger M2 growth If there is either a pickup in loan demand and banks bid more aggressively so that the yield curve on their liabilities shifts with the offering rate on time certificates versus regular savings and so forth; or if the banking industry decides to drop sharply the zero maturity deals At some point there will be yields between zero maturity liabilities from checkables and regular savings and money market deposit accounts, versus time certificates [that] compete with other nonbank liabilities  If balances shift from reservable liabilities to non-reserveable liabilities, we're going to see either a contraction in bank reserves--Desk operations will be absorbing reserves--or a build-up, temporarily at least, in excess reserves And the banking industry is going to be working to try to get rid of those excess reserves  Exactly  So, we'd have a situation where bank reserves are going down with a constant funds rate and the interpretation would be that policy is unchanged while bank reserves are contracting?  I took your reference to 22 moves to be cuts in the funds rate over a period of time and then you made a reference to [that] coming to an end If we're still on a track toward at least a lower inflation environment if not stable prices, measured somehow, then it shouldn't be the end of the moves because 3-3/4 percent is still too high whether one thinks in terms of real rates or [unintelligible] The one reason that might be given for either going back to an asymmetric directive or to cut the funds rate now or in the future that I would oppose is weakness in the economy If we're going to do something, that's the wrong reason to do it because it reinforces the idea that we try to fine-tune policy actions to  -72-    6/30-7/1/92  influence things we can't influence Whatever uncertainty we have about the aggregates, I have more confidence in their giving us and the public at large information about the long run [unintelligible]-- where it's going to be next year and the year after--than the latest numbers produced by the Commerce Department or the BLS or the purchasing managers or realtors or any other particular group We have a lot of uncertainty about those numbers [as well as] a tremendous amount of uncertainty [about] M2, but we can signal that we have more confidence in the [money] numbers by changing the funds rate based on them Not doing it based on the Ms, I think, is not helpful to our longer-run case in terms of credibility  I'm in a difficult position because we are below target on M2 and the decision has now been made not to lower the range for this year or next year To be consistent then, given the model that we use for influencing the aggregates, we should be lowering the funds rate in order to show how serious we are about coming in at least at the bottom end of the range That's so we will be credible when we say that the opposite is also true--that when we're at the top end of the range we're not going to hesitate then either So, failure to cut the funds rate, given what is going on in the markets today, is in my mind a relative tightening policy action compared to the market, and I don't see any basis for that Reserves are falling and all of the aggregates [are weak], and I think that's something we should not be willing to tolerate But at the same time I would resist cutting the funds rate on a signal of weak economic activity I'd like to do it today, but I wanted to do it today coupled with an announcement that we cut the target ranges for the long run at the same time we cut the funds rate and then let the analysts figure out whether we tightened or eased  I am missing something here because the prior sentence refers to June through September  -75-    6/30-7/1/92  And the latter sentence says that their relationship to the long-run objectives is uncertain Uncertain with respect to what? Is that compared to before or compared to something that we're less uncertain about?  The previous sentence says ""The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with"" Is that where the uncertainly is? The last sentence suggests, though it's not clear to me, [not] what is consistent with reserves but what it means for the long run  But I thought it was the uncertainty about the Board staff's model and what interest rate and reserve conditions  -78-    6/30-7/1/92  would produce certain aggregates There are two separate things There's a velocity issue and-- "
4742,1992-08-18," I have a number of comments As far as the Secretary's remarks, I remember that a decade ago we had a Secretary of the Treasury who was very emphatic in saying that we would not intervene and we would sell the foreign currencies that his    8/18/92  predecessor had bought; this always intrigued me Bill, you emphasized surprise a number of times both in your prepared remarks and in your response to Dick Syron and that suggests to me that the rate effect was the key consideration In fact, your last comment that it wouldn't work last Thursday suggests that the criterion is whether something is working or not working with regard to the rate effect And I think President Forrestal's remarks about whether the intervention is sterilized or not becomes the key criterion It seems to me that for this Committee to say on one side that we're in the mood to see our inventory of foreign currencies reduced, as reflected in some of the discussions since I've been here, and at the same time to raise questions about intervening or selling of foreign currencies would not be consistent If the general attitude is that we would like to see our inventory of foreign currencies diminished and we're willing to communicate that we welcome opportunities to reduce US holdings of foreign-denominated currencies, would that reduce the element of surprise--the benefits that you see to surprising the markets? Would the benefits be diminished if we are very open and acknowledge that when the market is receptive to our selling foreign currencies, we would do so? Also, one small point In your first remark about our intervening with Canada when the European markets were closed, you said we ""bought"" DM I think you meant ""sold""  Okay Also, I understand why traders talk in terms of buying and selling dollars, but of course we're the central bank and we can't really buy dollars So, when you ask for approval and say that we purchased $385 million dollars I would far prefer that you say we sold so many deutschemarks, but give the equivalent in dollars for the actual amount of the deutschmarks I'd prefer that we talk in terms of buying and selling foreign currencies because we, of course, pay US dollars  In the last Greenbook you were more optimistic than private forecasters about long-term interest rates, though not quite as optimistic as what in fact has happened since the last meeting On one side, given the sharp downward movement affecting intermediate- and long-term rates, I would have expected that to show through in economic activity The other side is--at least from all the anecdotal reports I've heard and probably everybody is hearing-- that there are more complaints about lower interest income to savers rather than [happiness about] lower interest expense to borrowers Once again you have a projection that's more optimistic than private forecasters, [which is a view] that I share I still think the 73 or 74 percent bond yield is much too high to be consistent with what is embodied in a [forecast of] 58 percent nominal GNP growth, [out] over a year and a half or so [unintelligible] From this point how do you sort that out if we get a further substantial downward move in  -14-    8/18/92  intermediate and long rates versus if we get a significant backup and we give back what we've gained in the last six weeks?  Are you saying that even though this forecast is somewhat weaker--and I read it to be weaker than the last Greenbook-- it is stronger than it would have been if we hadn't had the rally in the bond market?  Well, after listening to Bob Parry's report, it sounds as if I chose a very good time to leave California! It also turns out to have been a good time to go to the Midwest If I were to go through and talk about sectors and industries we've been in contact with, it would sound very similar to what Si Keehn has said There's really no difference there The manufacturing area is doing quite well, much better than the nation as a whole in terms of employment Industrial production, whether it's trucking or auto-related, is doing well Residential housing, which I think is related to people's confidence and jobs, is very positive Some areas in east Kentucky that had suffered very greatly for a long time in the '80s have virtually boom conditions now, with 4 percent unemployment, and are doing quite well Agriculture had come through two very bad years and    8/18/92  farmers were very worried coming into this season But we're getting such good volume numbers that it's dominating the price effects, and even the ag sector bankers are much better these days In spite of all of that, attitudes remain lousy When I confront individuals, especially nonbank business people but to some extent the small bankers as well, and ask why, they keep telling me about good numbers and then complain They cite the political situation, mainly at the national level but sometimes at the state level Companies continue to report ""My numbers are good, my orders are up, my sales are good, I've cut my costs, my profits are at a record, and I feel lousy about it"" And they don't see much that can help them  I have been struck by the difference in attitudes about inflation between the bank and the nonbank sectors The nonbank side tells us that inflation is simply not an issue Large and small businesses are saying that they have no expectation of raising their prices It's a question of what the smallest declines are that they can get away with and if they can match the price pressure they're feeling with productivity gains and other cost reductions One major company advises a great many smaller companies in the District and nationally and has told them all that any well-run business can reduce its prices by a percent given the gains in current productivity They say they only want to buy from well-run businesses, so everybody should come in with bids that are no more than 5 percent less than before or else they shouldn't bother bidding The bankers, though, continue to worry about inflation Whether they're citing declines in short-term interest rates from easy policy or the fiscal side, which is more often the case, they're persistent in believing that inflation is heading back up and, with that, interest rates When I asked if there was anything we could do to persuade them differently, they said ""no"" They're just not willing to be persuaded The bankers will tell us that commercial loan demand is weak but consumer loan demand, especially for auto financing, is very strong throughout the District  One of the positive things that I see happening in the adjustment process is that bankers in their search for lending opportunities are finding some very innovative ways throughout the District for doing minority housing lending, including enlisting the clergy as loan officers--conducting seminars and teaching them how to evaluate people's financials--and then making contributions to the religious organizations for every loan that is based on that They also are reducing the amount they contribute on a formula based on delinquencies or default A lot of volume is being generated by the activity, with a lot of good sentiment developing in the communities about how available the bankers are for exploring opportunities to do that kind of lending  One major home improvement supplier said that we have a national boom going; people who aren't doing anything else are apparently remodeling their homes And that is consistent with a story that I could take as another very positive development There was an article saying that people, in a search for alternatives to what were characterized as the lousy yields one gets at the bank, in addition to doing home improvements are trying to start up new businesses They gave a lot of examples of people opening restaurants or engaging in other distribution-type or light manufacturing activities because it's better than just leaving the money in the bank  -28-    8/18/92  earning 2 percent And I would think that that is part of the adjustment process we would expect from price stability  In helping us to choose among these, let me make a couple of comments about what I've heard and observed over the last few months From the standpoint of an outsider, in the 1980s it seemed to me that you were in a pretty good position on two counts Having had pretty good results both in getting a model that helped to alert the Committee on what M2 to expect and [thus] hitting the target and on interpreting what it meant in terms of velocity, P*, and so on Recently, at least since I've been here, we've only had two problems One is that we don't know how to hit [the target]; and two is that we wouldn't know what it meant if we did So, if you have to indicate a relative confidence, would you have greater confidence in your ability to indicate what money growth would be, given the funds rate or whatever, or what it means in terms of the velocity? Where are we supposed to indicate that we have more confidence? If we put in the statement about velocity, it implies that we have more confidence in that than we do in something we are supposed to hit  To me it is two different questions But that's a matter of a framework or a model or control versus--  I interpret that to mean that you're more comfortable explaining the misses rather than putting the weight on hitting the target?  -36-    8/18/92  Following up on what Wayne Angell said earlier in his remarks about the rally of the market affecting the intermediate term Don, I would have expected you to come back and say that in view of the market developments since the last meeting our model is now showing a lot stronger M2 growth So, one of two things [must be true] Either other things weren't equal or I was wrong in guessing which way that goes  -37-    8/18/92  I have a question I know this is a Board matter, not an FOMC matter, but in terms of using ammunition With the projection for seasonal increases in reserves in addition to the continuing trend of reserveable deposits growing very rapidly, would the Board consider using the ammunition it has, ie the bullet of lower reserve requirements?  The statutory limit is 8 percent and I don't understand the operating point Peter tried to explain this to me, too, and I simply don't understand it But the legal ammunition is that you can go down to 8 percent without seeking new legislative authority  I feel a lot more comfortable with several [recent] developments the rebound in July in reserve growth, in the monetary base, and in Ml, whereas everything was negative in June And I would want to see that--especially [the growth in] reserves-- continue to be positive I wouldn't want foreign operations to show up and drain reserves Partial analysis, of course, [indicates that] they do, but I would hope that would be offset, or sterilized, consciously or not either way I would be with John LaWare on preferring symmetric language at this point because I think things are in motion except--and this is not a policy issue but a communications issue--if we went with symmetric now, when that is released in the middle of October after the next meeting I would expect that the headlines would read that the Committee had tightened And that is enough to dissuade me from changing the directive even though my preference would be to do so "
4769,1992-10-06," Earlier this year we heard some things about the difficulties the Germans were having with sterilization and their desire to see us diversify    10/6/92  and so forth What were they saying during September about their problems with the other countries? And was that a constraint on our options?  So, our actions would have appeared to be trying to hold the ERM together?  And they didn't want to hold it together  Your remark about [intervention] giving us domestic problems Was that because if you're selling deutschemark- denominated securities you are going to be sterilizing them by buying domestic-denominated securities?  The psychological effect is one thing, but the idea is that if you sold deutschemark-denominated securities, you'd be buying US Treasuries  And that would be helpful Given the position of other central banks now with deutschemarks and given our desire to reduce our holdings of deutschemark-denominated assets, do you have an opportunity to do off-market sales of some of our deutschemark holdings and, the counterpart, to buy more Treasuries?  One last question Going forward, if we do start to get more stability--even firmness--of the dollar, what is your attitude going to be toward moving into the market and still reducing our position in deutschemarks?  Do the traders look at any of the various measures of bank reserves, the monetary base, or monetary aggregates in forming their expectations about Fed actions?  What would it take to get them to move away from focusing on the perception of a weak economy to looking at some kind of monetary indicator in determining what we do?  So, at the moment, if miraculously M2 and M3 started to soar as in Germany and if Ml and the base plunged--again as in Germany--the Street wouldn't react to it as long as they thought we were going to react to unfolding real economic indicators?  One more question How do you reconcile the perception that in the long run we have big problems--fiscal stimulus, inflation, and all of that--with the constant drumbeat of the need for us to ease because of weak economic conditions? What is it they want us to do? Do they want us [unintelligible] or don't they?    10/6/92  But that dichotomy suggests that it's not necessarily inconsistent, given what is going on there, for the perception to be simultaneously that we're too tight and that we need to ease and we're in the process of inflating  As a response on that, I don't think there is any empirical evidence about the people who already are living on interest income, but I've been testing the attitudes--this is all purely anecdotal--of people who are not yet at that stage Bankers tell me that their customers who are looking ahead to retirement have a threshold in mind of interest income they're going to need And what they've been doing is raising the amount of assets they feel they need in order to achieve their desired interest income as we move to a lower rate structure  No, they're just raising the amount of assets that they feel they need to set aside  I have a couple of questions for Mike involving quotes from the Greenbook Some of this may already have been covered in the questions and responses but I'm still looking I have two different questions, really One is about the linkages, the model that you use in assessing the effects of policy on the outlook That's still not clear to me On page 23 in Section I of the Greenbook it says at the bottom of the first paragraph ""The rise in short-term rates in 1994 is assumed necessary to prevent aggregate demand from gaining so much momentum that noninflationary levels of resource utilization are subsequently exceeded"" There's a gap in there but also an implied linkage from nominal interest rates to GNP, I suppose; you've already responded a little to that in your answer to Tom's question Then the Greenbook says ""Long-term rates are expected to edge down further as expectations of inflation continue to recede"" So, the long-term expected rate of inflation is somehow influenced by observed actual inflation Now, all of this taken together implies that real short-term interest rates are rising even if nominal rates are not But you're saying that the rise in real short-term rates is not sufficient in your framework to keep the economy on a noninflationary path and so you need an increase in nominal rates as well as real rates since obviously inflationary expectations are coming down and real rates are rising  Meaning further increases in real rates; the natural increase is not enough and you need further increases in real rates in your framework But it also depends on a linkage between nominal interest rates and nominal spending  Well, I know you have said that in your presentations from previous months and in the arguments I have listened to about inflation expectations, the inflation [component] in the long rates, and what's coming down based on experience But when I talk to business leaders and people in small and large businesses regarding their inflation forecasts, or look at the Michigan Survey or  -18-    10/6/92  [that of the National Association of] Business Economists they have this persistent 4 to 5 percent inflation range or higher No one mentions the gap between current [and potential] output or the unemployment rate If they mention anything at all, they mention the budget deficit or they say ""I don't know, but that's what always happens--inflation goes up"" But you are in effect saying that inflation expectations are going to come down, bringing long-term interest rates down in spite of these perceptions, [and] that eventually experience with lower prices grudgingly will dominate their view about [the effects of] fiscal impulses on inflation  But in this transition until the expectations of private decisionmakers come into line with where we think policies are taking inflation, we do have these very substantial transition costs on the economy Does all of this suggest that you're not relying on any version of the P* model anymore in forming your inflation outlook?  I've met with a number of people throughout the District in recent weeks, and the general sense is that our area of the country is now fully recovered from the 1982 recession    10/6/92  [Laughter] We didn't experience the 1990-91 one Employment growth has been better than the nation; industrial production has been better than for the nation; jobs are up about 1-1/2 percent since the beginning of the year The unemployment rate hasn't come down as much because labor force growth is very strong Other people following me could be moving back from southern California to the Midwest In many respects it's somewhat of a reversal of what we saw in the '85-'89 period when I was out West  We have a large number of major national retail organizations headquartered in the District In talking with them they say this September was better than they had expected, better than earlier months, and better than they [had first] thought There was a bigger pickup in sales post Labor Day We're running retail sales increases in our District of about 6-1/2 percent versus 4 percent nationally, but they say they are seeing better numbers across the country than they had expected and they are raising their expectations now about Christmas retail sales They say home-improvement related items and furnishings have been extremely strong--double-digit increases People aren't getting any yield on their assets in the banks so they put it in the brick and mortar of a patio or something  We're the second largest auto and auto-related manufacturing District in the country And while the auto companies report flat sales and some concerns, the auto suppliers are more optimistic because they've been getting orders from the transplant companies They feel that they are very competitive with imports They're taking back some market [share] they previously had lost Heavy truck orders are much better than expected just a couple months ago [and the truck manufacturers] are feeling very good about their backlog Home sales and home starts are strong throughout the District, going along with the better employment and labor force that we have in our area  The Fourth District round table economists--mostly nonbank business economists with a few bank economists in there--met recently and they are more optimistic than the Greenbook They have 3 percent real GDP as an average forecast of the group for 1993 There has been some improvement in their inflation outlook; it's still up around 3-1/2 percent but trending down More people are talking about inflation going under 3 percent than just three months ago when the group met So, we've had a little movement there  Our banks are even better than Tom Melzer's banks We have the strongest banks in the country Aggregate market capital is second only to New York; without Morgan and Bankers Trust we beat them all None of the banking assets in our District are owned [by banking institutions] outside the District Our banks are looking for earning assets; they're giving incentives to go out looking for loans My head examiner was in to see me worried about the banks looking too hard for loans; I said ""Don't worry about it yet"" They're also looking for opportunities to inject capital into banks in other Districts, so you will be hearing from them a lot in 1993 as they seek opportunities to spread their skills and their capital  Talking with business leaders about their strategies for the '90s has been very interesting They characterize the past as having been an environment of counting on rising sales where they hire people, order some stuff, mark it up, and they make money Their new  -36-    10/6/92  strategy is not to expect increases in sales in the '90s but basically to view the situation as one where all increases and earnings are going to come from cutting costs reductions in the work force and productivity increases When I asked both large and small businesses about their inflation expectations, there was a contradiction [in their responses] They say they can't raise their prices at all; they have no expectation or plans to raise their prices and in some cases they talk about how rapidly the prices would be cut in the future But they expect nationwide inflation to remain high So, when I question them about how they are going to handle that with their labor costs or what their employees think of it, they say ""It has to come from productivity or we're in a deep stew"" Dick Syron asked about the [economy's] engine I look at what both households and businesses are doing; they are basing their plans on the expectation of higher inflation in the future, with the idea that it is transitorily low [now] and is going to rise And we're engaged in policy actions that say ""No, inflation is not only down but it's going to go even lower"" That inconsistency between what is out there in the marketplace and what we're doing is creating this drag Now, there are two ways to reconcile that Either we simply conform our actions to their expectations or we try to do whatever we can to help accelerate the process of their adjusting their expectations down to where we intend to go on policy I ask business people why they don't believe us when we say we're going to zero inflation I tell them the budget deficit or other things they worry about don't matter; it's what the central banks does that determines that They just sort of shrug and say they don't believe it They say we keep easing policy in order to promote growth, and one of these days it's going to wind up in higher inflation I point to slow M2 growth and how we're all trying to work toward a stable price environment, and they tend just to shrug it off I think the issue we have to attack is the credibility of our commitment; we as a Committee need to convey in the clearest way we possibly can that we are going toward zero inflation That's what we should tell them about how to gauge our policy  I wish I had more confidence about what indicator to look at to gauge our policy But much more so I wish the private decisionmakers had more confidence about how they will be able to gauge our policies in the future because it's our future policy actions that are going to influence their decisions most It struck me in recent weeks in looking at the turmoil in Europe that the Germans have very slow growth in their narrow monetary aggregates and very rapid growth in their broad aggregates and they chose to gauge their policy by M3 They have a sharply inverted yield curve at a very high level of nominal interest rates and what we would generally regard as high real interest rates and an extraordinarily strong currency We have had a very steep yield curve, very low short-term interest rates relative to long rates, [low] recent inflation, extraordinarily rapid growth in the narrow aggregates, which is disturbing, and almost no growth at all in the broad aggregates, M2 and M3 And we tend to characterize our policies by the broader aggregates as having been restrictive, which is not consistent with our weak currency The markets seem to be saying--looking at a lot of indicators, including surveys--that our policies have been and will continue to be expansionary and that the Germans' policies have been and will continue to be restrictive  I'm not sure the Germans are right in looking at M3, but they keep saying they are going to persevere and people believe them I'm not sure that we're right in saying M2 is the right measure, but people are not believing it and do not believe that we are going to persevere Don Kohn in his remarks mentioned the risks about how to  -43-    10/6/92  perceive what we do and why If it's clear that it's due to a weak economy and that in the future we're going to maintain slack in the economy, then maybe the markets would take it okay But that casts this Committee as being anti-growth, and I'm not anti-growth I'm not comfortable with the idea that we're going to maintain slack and slow growth as the method of achieving price stability I want price stability because I want fast growth  I would prefer at this point to take Committee action to complete what we suspended on July 1st, and that is setting targets for 1993--what I argued for then but didn't succeed in getting I'd suggest that we announce a reduction in the [M2] target range for 1993; my preference would be a full percentage point I think we should have been at 2 to 6 percent this year and I think we should have 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for next year I'd go ahead and announce it and couple it with an immediate action to inject reserves and probably to cut the discount rate because of the necessity of a press release in order to say we are taking action as a Committee to achieve the minimum of our target range in monetary growth I'd say we are not satisfied with being below the target, we want to get growth up [within the range], and we're at the same time lowering our target range for next year because we're not going to let [growth exceed] the top end of the range either We should take this step, coupling what is perceived as an easing action in the short run with an announcement of lowering the target range for '93 as re-enthroning M2 because it's the only horse we have to ride to gauge our policies at this time Until such time as the Committee is ready to say we are going to restructure M2 or switch to some other aggregate, we have to stick with M2 because it's what we have, just as the Germans have to stick with M3 with all of its faults I wish we had their credibility  I'm still working on it! [Laughter]  The reason I have a problem with ""B"" asymmetric is that no matter what we think it is we're doing [any action] will be the result of real economic indicators and reinforce the idea that we ease policy when the economy is soft and we are going to tighten policy when the economy is strong I have a problem with that So, I would prefer either to act today and do it because of weak money growth and make it very clear that we're trying to get short-term money growth up and long-term money growth down or, if we don't do that, adopt ""B"" symmetric but without the discretion of judgment for the future "
4796,1992-11-17," How many countries do we have swap lines with?  So, it's all of the European economies that are linked to the deutschemark?  Well, I recall what we were doing when these swap lines were [activated] in the 1970s, but it's not clear to me these days when actions really involve the dollar, the deutschemark, and the yen why we would want a swap line with the Dutch for guilders for instance  From the District perspective, things are continuing to move forward in a general way We have some pockets of considerable strength There is an area called the golden triangle down around Cincinnati to Lexington and over into Tom's Melzer's District in Louisville that is very strong, with very low unemployment They talk about labor shortages and attracting people from other areas Around Columbus, Ohio, business conditions are very strong Even in the areas where we still have notable layoffs--300 people, 500 people--we still see some [overall] growth in employment  -16-    11/17/92  There are other non-notable increases, the non-headline catching kind of things, that are producing jobs to offset the contractions we are continuing to see at big firms  In talking with small business people around the District, I have noted a general improvement in their tone Their exports are doing well and they feel their order books are solid When I ask them about inflation expectations, that group consistently tells me that they see no inflation in their businesses, and that's reflected in their wage packages They're talking about 2 and 3 percent increases in [total] compensation, matched they hope by productivity because there is no price increase factored in When I talk to the banking community, though, the talk is consistently about pay increases in the 4 to 5 percent range, reflecting their view that inflation is going to stay in the 4 to 5 percent range And I think the difference between the inflation rate people are basing their actions on and what we are seeing in the numbers is the critical challenge for the period ahead  We're getting pretty good retail sales numbers not only in the District but from all those major companies headquartered in the District; the latter reported very strong numbers in October as we now see in the national statistics They also report improving optimism about Christmas There was a recent slump in retail sales, though In the first 10 days of November there was a surprisingly strong and uniform drop in retail sales; no one has much confidence in saying whether it was a temporary thing or something more serious We are continuing to get pretty good housing activity around the District So, overall, the tone has generally been pretty good  Turning to the national side, I'm not sure I have anything to say about the future because I'm still struggling to understand the past--the last year and a half or so at least--both in terms of what is perceived in the economics profession and especially by the incoming Administration and the new Congress about what the role of fiscal policy has been and what the role of monetary policy has been and, therefore, the conclusions they come to on what policy should be in the future The discussion about fiscal drag has been interesting, that is, the deficit problem and how it has retarded economic activity through various channels that have affected overall aggregate demand and maybe certain sectors or regions Now, the idea is that there's going to be some type of fiscal stimulus Especially if it's viewed as aggregate demand--increasing total spending in the economy rather than affecting a specific region or sector or target industry, which it certainly could do--I'm not sure in my own mind how that will come out and [what its implications are for] monetary policy  The monetary [side] is much more intriguing for us in that since the ending of the Gulf War there seem to have been two major rival conjectures about what the economy otherwise would have done and what the role of monetary policy has been One of them is that the economy was poised for a cyclical recovery and a normal kind of expansion after the Gulf War and was held back, especially by a monetary policy that was not sufficiently accommodative That is the [conjecture of] people who had the view that a broad measure of money --M2, M3, or something--retarded total spending The alternative conjecture is that the economy was subjected to a number of very major depressing forces, including possibly fiscal policy--the unwinding of the defense buildup of the '80s--the winding down of commercial  -17-    11/17/92  construction employment on the two coasts in particular, and the balance sheet adjustments going on in business and households alike In that view monetary policy was actually quite expansionary to prevent an even more severe contraction [which would have occurred] had monetary policy not been cushioning these down-draft effects That suggests either that monetary policy is best summarized simply by how far short-term interest rates have dropped or by how rapid growth in the narrower measures of money growth has been If this latter view is correct, then the critical thing for us is to ascertain when these depressing forces are starting to attenuate so that we know when is the right time to pull back on this massive amount of monetary stimulus that that hypothesis implies Whereas if the former [view is correct]--that the broader measures best summarize the thrust of monetary policy actions in regard to the retarded economic activity-- then the challenge still is to get within our target range so that we're not a negative force affecting the economy Some think that those are [ir]reconcilable, but I think our challenge now is to reconcile them and to set our objectives for '93 in some clear fashion, based on which of those views we believe  First, I thought the Feinman-Porter study was very, very good It serves the Committee very well, giving us good input Also, in terms of the broader discussion, I am very happy you are making the study public because a lot of the issues [of concern] in the profession will be helped along by having it available, and that's very constructive I'd like to ask a couple of questions Have you tried to simulate the Greenbook expectations about longer- term interest rates and what it would imply for monetary growth?  So, you get 1/2 or 3/4 of a percentage point--  I'd like to ask Bill McDonough about views in the markets At the time of the last meeting longer-term rates were well along the way in the direction of moving down as the Greenbook has been suggesting, consistent with the idea that inflation expectations were coming down with observed lower inflation rates Since then we've had some backing up in rates explained as fiscal fears which somehow feed into bond markets That's one version of the explanation I'd be very curious as to what you think the people out there dealing in the markets are thinking One version is that the fiscal package per se is somehow inflationary so people build that into bond yields Another is that the fiscal environment causes monetary policy to be more expansionary and more inflationary and that gets built into the bond market Another version--a few people have been commenting in this vein--is that longer-term prospects for real growth are improved, so with increasing real incomes and real productive capital there will actually be an increase in real rates, in which case we shouldn't expect to see them coming back down Finally, there is the ""tomato"" theory of the bond market that the increased supply of the new crop of bonds coming with bigger deficits will depress prices, and because this bigger deficit has to be funded we will have higher interest rates Would you comment on which among those [explanations] you think dominates?  Given that view, then, the only thing that can help bring those expectations down is first to see the fiscal package and then to see that inflation doesn't pick up, which means we can do very little but wait for it I imagine if there were immediate action by the Committee on rates right now, it would be a surprise to the market and have a subtle effect of some type  On the other hand and separately, if there were a decision by the Committee to lower the target ranges for next year, by itself that might have very little, if any, positive effect and maybe none at all If the two were coupled, would that tend to have any kind of neutralizing effect? Would the potential negative effect of lowering the target range, with perceptions of more restrictive policy, [be offset by] the ""lump of sugar"" of near-term easing action and make [action to lower the targets] more acceptable in the Street?  Well, I think the range should be lowered to 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for next year but I think the center should be 3-1/2 percent instead of Wayne's 3 percent  But a large part of [my reasoning] is that I think that's where the range should have been this year and that we would have been subjected to at least somewhat less criticism because M2 growth would have fallen within that range on the low end I would like very, very much to see us within our announced target range next year, so we should choose a range for next year that we think M2 is going to be within Clearly from what we've heard so far, it's a little more certain that we'd be within a 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range than within a 2 to 6 or 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent range Yet, on the shorter-term policy, I'm still partial to the idea of trying to [achieve] the target for this year to show that we have the resolve to stay within the upper and lower bounds of our ranges And since we're below the target range for 1992, that justifies immediate action by the Committee coupled with lowering the range for next year  I don't disagree with what Don Winn said about the role of a dedicated staff person, but I think that at most is a necessary and not a sufficient condition for what we see going on I think these things need to be cyclically adjusted The difference between our situation and that of the Bundesbank is that they enjoy very wide general public support as well as political support for their objectives So there's not the same degree of interest or curiosity in the method by which they achieve them Whenever the Hill or the media or others are dissatisfied with the results, however much they understand the forces at work, they're going to be more interested in knowing what the inputs were rather than being satisfied with the output Our focus still needs to be on the results and the objectives and to get their attention off the process I did not disagree with what Jerry Corrigan was saying about the negatives; I certainly agree with what he said about the way it would change the meeting in ways that, in effect, would destroy the process But I don't like to play defense I'm always in the mood whenever possible to play offense because I think that is a good defense; so I'd move in the direction of turning the discussion to the objectives of monetary policy and away from the process by which we get there Their interest should not be in our discussions but in our decisions And if we have more complete and timely release of information about our decisions, then I think we can take the focus away from the discussions that went into producing those decisions  -51-    11/17/92 "
4818,1992-12-14," This is Jerry Jordan I think you are right that Chairman Gonzalez does not have any idea what information is currently available, and I'd suggest in your letter that you might also note that a number of Reserve Banks regularly, and for long periods of time, have done ex-post reviews of the FOMC [decisions] in the prior year For students of the subject there really is a lot of information available "
4831,1992-12-22," I've been following this sort of seesaw market psychology and monitoring the Call during this last intermeeting period, including how we responded to and interacted with that shifting market psychology Through the summer and into the beginning of October, the dominant view seemed to be that the economy was weaker than had been expected Confirmation of that weakness in the various statistics that came out would lead the bond market to tend to strengthen We tended to go with that strengthening Then from October 1st until, say, on or about the first Tuesday of November, there was a significant backing up in market rates As I understand that, the psychology was that it was increasingly likely that Clinton was going to be elected and that we were going to get a fiscal package that would be too expansionary and, therefore, it was adverse to the market Then something started to shift at that point I don't know    12/22/92  whether it was before or after our last meeting Now we've been in a period where even strong economic news does not cause the market to sell off as it was doing before Previously, any signs of strong numbers on industrial production or anything that would come out would tend to get an adverse reaction in the market Don Kohn referred to this one morning on the Call as the ""new Clinton effect"" The idea now is that strong economic news means we're not going to get a big fiscal stimulus package Therefore, it's a reason to rally whereas before it would have been a reason to sell off If that's a good characterization of what has been going on, how much more potential is there for that kind of effect if we continue to get strong economic news going into the new year? Do you think the market is poised for a further relief effect [based on the view] that we're not going to be getting a massive dose of fiscal stimulus or maybe something worse like a deficit-neutral package?  The steepening that did occur in that period from October 1st into early November was in the 2- to 3-year range Most of that has not come back out, whereas at the longer end we've had some flattening  It depends on its ultimate incidence How much is borne by the workers in lower real wages and how much by the shareholders--it could hit the stock market harder than the bond market--versus how much is passed on to the consumers as prices But we don't know enough to answer that  A couple of questions First for Ted, regarding your comments about the effects on [the United States] of [what is happening in] Europe and elsewhere around the world Isn't it somewhat of a recursive process? I saw a press report about OECD raising its forecast for the United States By the time that group gets together for the next Working Party Meetings in Paris they will hold up the prospects of a stronger '93, incorporate that in their numbers, and raise their numbers  But in their summer and fall estimates, wasn't it the case that as the prospects of [growth in] the United States came down these other countries were revising down their forecasts?  Let me turn to some questions for Mike about the US economy I was looking back over the last year--I haven't gone back further--trying to understand the dynamics of the forecasts as they are put together and the subsequent revisions A year ago at this time the prospects were for the first quarter to be very, very weak It came in considerably stronger than expected The change there, of course, between what had been expected and what occurred was the most dramatic--much more so than even for the third quarter--and tended to have the auto-regressive effect of raising the prospects out into the future The second quarter then came in considerably stronger than expected At that time you revised down very sharply the third-quarter numbers; I think we were all feeling in that August- September period that things were very, very much weaker than expected Now we see that the third quarter came in considerably stronger than those numbers, raising not only the reported number for the third quarter--what we have so far--but the forecasts for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 1993, which also have been revised up That worries me a bit If you look back at the third quarter in particular and the reasons for having revised [your forecast] down sharply, with the advantage of hindsight, were there things that would have told you that it was still going to be quite a strong quarter despite the news [indicating strength] in the second quarter? Could that forecasting error have been avoided if we had looked at the right things?  Let me shift this in a slightly different direction I'm still trying to understand the interaction between what we do and how that works in your thinking about the economy in the Greenbook exercise In the beginning of the Greenbook, the first page, second paragraph gives two alternatives The first one says the upside surprise in the second half is confirmation that cuts in short- term rates can still be a potent stimulative force even in the face of various financial strains and so on As I understand it, that's kind of a linkage in your model At an earlier point nominal interest rates rose, representing a restrictive policy And with a very long lag inflation is coming down In the meantime nominal interest rates    12/22/92  also were declining, giving some positive effect on the economy But at some point [in your forecast] nominal interest rates stop declining, but [for a while] inflation continues to come down so real interest rates start rising So, the reason you have 1994 real [GDP growth] slowing with the same nominal interest rates or even slightly higher nominal interest rates is mainly because inflation continues to decline and real interest rates go up  But if I read it right, isn't that the primary factor slowing real GDP growth in 1994?  Just to be clear You have been saying that the modest increase in nominal interest rates you built in or the increase in real interest rates resulting from lower inflation has its dominant effect in '94  The reason I ask the question--and I don't know how to incorporate the international effects that Ted referred to--is that there seems to be a crosscurrent in our discussions between the concept that the economy tends to expand in the absence of various depressing forces that are retarding economic activity, and somehow policy may work against those adjustment constraints, versus the view that the economy tends to stagnate in the absence of stimulus to make it go forward I'm trying to get at how, at least in the Greenbook projections, what we are doing with respect to policy comes to bear on the forecast  Well, the situation in my part of the country brightened considerably on two occasions since the last meeting when the sun came out very briefly It hadn't happened since September It did improve the mood of the place  Like some others have commented around the table, the shift in mood is striking People were reporting their own situations as not so bad but we were getting this disparity between what they saw nationally and how gloomy they were versus their strong order books, their backlogs, their goods production, and so on So, at the time of our October meeting when the downbeat mood was so pervasive--including here--I was hearing the same thing from all the business groups and directors and others That has totally vanished Nothing has changed in what they say about what is going on in their own situations Housing is still good; retailing is good As Si Keehn reported, [sales of] heavy trucks are very strong--about the best in five years We assemble a lot of light vehicles--small trucks and vans that people use as cars--in our District and they are also very strong The gloominess comes from the large international corporations that have foreign operations The negative commentary is very, very strong about Canada and Europe I don't know whether to give more weight--  Yes, they are including Canada because of labor costs and the political situation; they're still very worried about the cost of benefits One major manufacturer who has a very large operation up there says that by far his most productive, efficient plant in the technical sense is in Canada, but he cannot get contracts in the United States because people do not trust having to depend on a Canadian supplier  Turning to the national scene, I don't know whether to give more credence to what is now an upbeat note in the outlook than I would have to a downbeat note three months ago My bias is to think that the economy does tend to expand As Gary Stern was saying, the history would say that once the economy starts in an upward direction, revisions tend to feed on themselves, as we've seen this year so far The numbers come in stronger than anticipated and the revisions generally tend to be in an upward direction I think that has sustainability I don't think it's symmetrical; there's a natural bias in an upward direction So my own national outlook would probably be stronger than what the Greenbook says  This question of when the time is going to come to change the [funds] rate--especially in an upward direction--and the criteria for doing so has been on my mind a lot, and I'm sure it has been in everybody's thinking This is my seventh meeting, and I thought it was time to go back and review the last year and to look at what actually has happened in terms of all kinds of economic indicators--monetary as well as economic indicators, nominal and real indicators--and Committee actions to see if I could deduce an implicit model I read the newsletters, as I'm sure everybody does; and [unintelligible] and I don't see it in the numbers, it's certainly not inflation It's not the various money measures Ml, M2, the base, or bank reserves I don't even think it's real GDP I put together a table--a big matrix of every forecast for as many quarters out as the Greenbook does it--for every meeting for the last year What struck me was that it looked as if we were on a de facto nominal GNP target When nominal GNP is at or above expectations, the funds rate is held stable; but when nominal GNP comes in below what has been expected, we cut the funds rate Do you want to comment?  Well, I've read the things that academicians have had to say about nominal income targeting Despite some sort of theoretical appeal to some people, in this context I would be concerned that what could cause nominal GNP to grow significantly faster than currently expected in 1993 would be real output There's very little likelihood that it's going to come from the price side So, to have a de facto nominal GNP target would put the Committee in the position of being characterized as anti-growth, if it's perceived that we're tightening because of faster real growth  But then you have to have a theory or model about what causes inflation that's coherent or else you're going to run into some trouble  Compared to what? That is the problem It's not that I would prefer interest rate targeting I'm mainly concerned in this environment that the thing that would cause this Committee to raise the funds rate would be real GNP growing faster, being reflected in faster nominal GNP in the current environment  Mine wouldn't be anything I'd want to look at what the money supply was doing  The monetary base But I would be concerned about the Committee reacting to that factor--nominal GDP caused by faster real growth--as though we needed to maintain slack in the economy to bring downward pressure on prices I still would prefer ultimately a price level check, but we can't control the prices directly by anything that we do  I think I can reconcile--  A couple of comments and thoughts about the first part of your remarks I think these fundamental structural technological things are very, very major I am concerned about whether the national income accounts conceptually are appropriate for capturing [what is occurring] Even the definition of what is output is going to have to be rethought at some point as is how we measure and assess productivity One of the fastest growing employers in my District is in Lexington, Kentucky They've doubled their work force --it's not a big number--from 30 people to 60 people in a year; it is moving along pretty well The Lexington area has 4 percent    12/22/92  unemployment The problem is finding people who have the skills they want, so they [attract] them in from southern California or somewhere I don't think that sort of thing shows up very well in the way we put these numbers together  During the Little Rock Summit, Governor Clinton raised the question of whether it would be desirable policy to have as a goal trying to move manufacturing employment from where it currently is at 16-17 percent [of the workforce] up to 20 percent because our major trade [partners] often have 30 percent I think an issue that is going to have to be addressed at some point is what is manufacturing employment These companies don't want to hire people to get their hands dirty They want to buy the software from somebody else So, a lot of economists think public policy is going to have to address those kinds of issues  Turning to monetary policy, I want to comment on this issue of money and economic activity and my view of it Both Governors Angell and Mullins in their remarks said that the growth [in GDP] is not a result of--Wayne said M2 and Dave said money--and I'm not sure that that's at all true I can interpret what has happened this year as the lagged effects of the very slow growth we have had in M2 for some time, which has brought down inflation Wayne talked about the stimulative effect of lower inflation, but what caused low inflation? I think it's the lagged effects of the much slower growth of M2 And at the same time we have had very rapid growth in the narrow aggregates M2 has never been a good indicator of turning points in economic activity; it has never been a predictor of real output or even that good a predictor of nominal GNP It is an indicator over a three-to-five year horizon of basic inflationary pressures I still think there's validity in the P* model My emphasis on M2 has been two-fold One is the idea that the long-term objective for the monetary policy part of total financial economic policy is to move to price stability, and that means we emphasize M2; the second is that M2 is what this Committee has been going to the Hill and announcing as our target, worrying about the credibility of the Committee if we announce the target and then don't take action to try to hit it  But in terms of shorter-term effects on real output or especially on total spending, nominal GDP, I have always thought the narrow measures, M1 or the monetary base, are a better gauge of the thrust of our actions I tend to accept the view that monetary policy as reflected in the narrow measures of money has been countering more of the headwinds or process of down drafting or it would have been much worse Monetary policy in fact has been very stimulative, and the critical thing would be to back off from that kind of short-run stimulus in the narrow measures before we do see the future inflation I think we can reconcile what has happened to our narrow and broad measures just as the Germans have with the opposite situation They have had extraordinarily slow growth of Ml, until very recently, and very rapid growth of M2 with high inflation For them, M3 goes along with high inflation The slow growth of Ml and the inverted yield curve and all of that go along with no output growth So, I think these disparities can be put back together Currently--being this close to the end of the year and not knowing how we're going to rebase the targets for 1993--I wouldn't have a basis for dissenting on the grounds of trying to hit an M2 target There's nothing that we could do now that would have any effect on that So, in the current    12/22/92  situation I would simply support alternative B symmetric really by default--not knowing what else to do "
4874,1993-02-02," I was monitoring the Call from the November meeting through year-end As the news unfolded about the [domestic] economy being stronger than before versus Europe and versus the rest of the world, I had no sense on a day-to-day basis that we were positioned [correctly] for the environment we're going into If you didn't have the inherited position, would you wish to have a larger position in foreign currencies or different currencies or a smaller position? Do you feel you're positioned with the right portfolio for this environment?  Yes  If I could follow-up on that comment I suppose the analysis as to whether we had the right amount or not would be quite different on the domestic portfolio than it would be on the foreign currency portfolio--assets denominated in foreign currencies You would not make the same after-the-fact judgment about whether we had the right amount or not  John LaWare's comments reflected the kind of things that I've been hearing over the last couple of months in conversations with directors and others around the District In the fall, during the latter months of the campaign, there was this attitude--reflected in the media, of course--that we were not getting all the government we were paying for, that something was wrong and  -24-    2/2-3/93  nobody was fixing it And now there's a very sharp increase in concern that we may in fact get all the government we're paying for and it's not good The numbers look not so bad to me The attitudes, if anything, have deteriorated I'm not sure yet I have not been in Cleveland a full year and in traveling around the District I don't know whether I have to seasonally adjust them; maybe it's simply impossible to [be optimistic] at this time of year in that region of the country! We have had very good employment numbers recently When I point that out, people say ""But it's not the right kind of jobs It's minimum wage jobs; we're losing high-wage jobs for low-wage jobs"" We had very good sales numbers in December; everyone was very pleased by that; they expected sales to fall off in January and they did not fall off Again, there's no comfort in that, but concern that the pickup still is not sustainable I look at initial claims numbers In January we were 32 percent below a year ago, indicating a better job market; but none of the business leaders among my directors or the labor leader on my board point to any of these things with any encouragement The headlines are still dominated by stories of layoffs all over the District Maybe it's a part of being an old manufacturing District that is still restructuring, so the news about whatever's going on in motor vehicles continues to pervade everybody's attitude Even the small businesses do not indicate a willingness to talk in terms of employment increases They talk about their productivity gains and they talk about improving profitability without price increases, but they do not talk about adding workers  When I discuss the issue of inflation, and I tend to be on the more optimistic side [expecting] lower inflation, I'm met with total skepticism As for the idea of price stability being where inflation does not enter into the decisions of people, it is certainly entering into the decisions of these people They believe that inflation is going to pick up And I certainly haven't had any success in persuading them that anything can and will be done about it There's an inconsistency, especially among small manufacturers and [a] few of the large manufacturers outside the motor vehicles industry where they say they see no prospect of increasing prices in their businesses They are not worried about their cost side, especially from labor However, they believe national inflation is going to go up In banking, consumer lending was very good in the last couple of months C&I continues to be flat; there's nothing there In fact, some banks are still indicating declines in C&I volumes Mortgage lending fell off after the boost in the fall  When I look at the national forecast in the Greenbook, my main problems with it are on the [underlying] assumptions I tend to think the inflation outlook is going to be better than the Greenbook We probably put a little more weight on the P* kind of relationship than what's built into this But I have trouble with the velocity assumptions When I look at the conditions of a year ago versus today, we were coming off two quarters of very little growth in the second half of '91 If I look at the yield curve, the components of the various aggregates, the M1s and M2s, or the level of interest rates, I don't see any of the conditions that I think contributed to the rise in velocity that we had in 1992, so I'm simply not comfortable with that set of assumptions That is, if we were to get the kind of outlook shown in the Greenbook, especially in terms of nominal spending growth, I think it's going to be associated with faster growth in money If we have the kind of broad money growth  -25-    2/2-3/93  that's suggested by the Greenbook, I am skeptical that we're going to get the nominal GDP growth  Reading this and then listening to your opening comments about this table on page 8 of the Bluebook and where the economy is, I was struck by the emphasis on how close we are to potential output or full employment, in part because it reminded me of some of the discussion that we heard in the late 1970s about heavy reliance on the gap of potential and NAIRUs and all that I also was struck [by the fact that] in this table we get this after just two years of 3-1/2 percent real GDP growth, [which] suddenly drops to 22 percent under the alternative III with the idea that [unintelligible] after 2 years or so of that kind of growth It looks rather modest In view of all the discussion that we've been having in this group and  -36-    2/2-3/93  discussions among members of the profession, over the last year or so anyway, about the restructuring that's going on, the information technologies, the tremendous amount of churning especially in the industrial sector of the economy, how comfortable are you talking about potential output or where the NAIRU is?  I have a lot of sympathy for a number of things that have been said here as far as descriptions of the way the Committee functions, [including] some of Larry Lindsey's remarks, Tom Melzer's, Dave Mullins', and your own comments about it I don't really care at all where the debt or M3 targets are set because, with the tools available, I can't imagine any action by the Federal Reserve being influenced by whatever they do What a central bank does is to set the discount rate, reserve requirements, and open market operations to peg the funds rate, letting that be endogenous When I look at what actually is done, even M2 does not seem to have any relevance to what the Committee does or what the [Board of] Governors does It would seem to me [reasonable] in the circumstances, [given] a sense of efficient markets and trying to improve the quality of information to decisionmakers, to say that we're going to put out an M2 range but it's not a target at all It's a staff forecast and the FOMC has no intention of doing anything to try to stay within that range I can imagine a set of circumstances, without putting a probability on it, where the yield curve could flatten dramatically, we could get 1 percent M1 growth and 8 percent M2 growth, and as long as we were getting something close to the central tendency [of our forecasts] or the Board staff projection on nominal and real GDP this Committee wouldn't do anything It's inconsistent in my view to say ""Here's a target for M2"" and not seek institutional arrangements that help us hit it It's not a target if we don't try to do something to hit it So, why not explain that this is not a target and that we don't really have targets We can set up monitoring ranges for M1 and the base, which might be useful for some purposes [in terms of] where we think they may fall, but they're not targets for the Committee What is a target is either nominal GDP or various real indicators And for better or worse, if that's the way the Committee is conducting its affairs, then I think that ought to be explained  In the earlier go-around I was commenting more on what I think is Now, to be normative, I will comment on what I think should be And that is that we should take monetary targeting seriously I don't disregard what Wayne emphasizes about the commodity index, but I also don't disregard what P* and long-run relationships between M2 and the price level are telling us The latter would suggest to me that we ought to find a way to do something to avoid a contraction of M2  I thought the outline was an interesting piece for indicating the pros and cons of some things, but what didn't come out clearly was the ultimate criterion for information that we provide Even the purpose of the Memorandum of Discussion [published]  -67-    2/2-3/93  with a long lag is not to foster PhD dissertations but studies that help improve the execution of policy to achieve ultimate objectives And that's the criterion that should be used for announcing whatever In the short run it should be that it helps us achieve our two objectives I don't see how announcing the federal funds rate would do that In fact, the way the Committee is operating right now, I don't see what would be useful to achieve the objective of price stability "
4897,1993-02-18," This is Jerry Jordan I reacted the same way Jerry Corrigan did, and I think the confusion comes from making a reference to adjusting policy as opposed to actions to achieve our policy Our policy isn't to raise and lower the federal funds rate Our policy is to move toward price stability And I think the way we communicate our objectives as opposed to the actions we take in the short run needs to be fairly clear It's our actions that we adapt to what the fiscal impulse is, not what our policy [objective] is "
4917,1993-03-23," A few questions, Mike For some time now you've had a more optimistic outlook for the bond market than the Blue Chip forecasters or some other private sector analysts, and that was hinged on a better inflation outlook The idea is that as they come to realize our inflation outlook is right, then the bond market will adjust The Blue Chip pattern has been that from this point forward interest rates and inflation will rise; that has been [their view] over the last year And here we are today with bond yields lower than even your optimistic forecast and you have them going down somewhat further Yet, as recently as the January Greenbook we were looking at a CPI for the first quarter of about 2-1/2 percent; and now it's closer to 4 percent So, the actual numbers have gone in one direction vis-a-vis your earlier forecast versus the Blue Chip, yet the bond market has gone the other way or even faster than you hoped and ahead of the Blue Chip How do you reconcile those?  I'm left a little uncomfortable with part of your explanation about expectations of short rates as they relate to long rates Earlier this year, and beginning last year, some academics testifying in Congress argued that the reason intermediate and long rates are as high as they are was the fear that the Fed was going to raise the funds rate They said all we had to do was take the pledge that we wouldn't raise short rates and bond yields would fall  That's starkly in contrast to the view that longer-term expectations about debt monetization and inflation--  But if they do fit together, then having 48 percent [GDP growth] in the fourth quarter and the CPI numbers we have in the first quarter gives you a problem because it says we're getting that real strong growth and now we're getting the CPI popping up This worst fear is confirmed and yet the bond market has rallied further  The other question that I still struggle with is how monetary policy, what this Committee does, feeds into the outlook over the next couple of years The funds rate is currently at 3 percent You talk about it staying more or less at that level through the forecast horizon You have nominal GDP [growth] slowing to about a 5 percent rate for most of that period while the Blue Chip forecast apparently has nominal GDP rising in a 6 to 6-1/2 percent range out through as far as they go, about 4 or 5 quarters, and short-term rates rising 70 basis points So, they have higher short rates, higher real growth, and higher inflation What do you say about the Greenbook forecast versus the Blue Chip forecast given those policy assumptions?  How confident are you that a 3 percent funds rate for the next 6 to 8 quarters produces 5 percent nominal GDP?  Thank you, Mr Chairman As for the District, conditions are very similar by sector and industry to what Si Keehn reported for the Seventh District I won't repeat those kinds of observations except to add a couple of observations One is on steel While the orders are good and the production level is very high, and while there is a comfort level over the recent price increases and hopes for more, there is no confidence after midyear There is a real concern that they've borrowed on subsequent activity What they can see and what they can report are coincident or lagging indicators; there's nothing to suggest what [demand] might be out in the future And that's similar for nonferrous metals; there's a lot of caution They say the current situation is very good but that they don't know about the future Motor vehicles are strong in a general way but in a specific way it's the Big Three that are doing quite well in the District, recalling workers and adding new labor The transplants, the import manufacturers, are not doing well; their inventories are extremely high The overall inventories look pretty good but that's because they're low for the Big Three Their sales are good both for trucks and cars, but sales at the transplant firms are much, much softer As for heavy trucks, they came into the year with a very good backlog but they say the rate of new orders has dropped off sharply recently They're working off what they carried before A bicycle manufacturer, a very major manufacturer, says they came through the fourth quarter quite strong; December was excellent and they came into January feeling good, but the orders just collapsed As far as employment goes, state revisions are going to be different for us We were reporting a decline in the state of Ohio for the 1991-92 period  -21-    3/23/93  and that's going to be changed to a plus 1/2 percent So, we never did have a decline in the recession period  In our meetings with small business groups, the capital goods producers are all reporting quite strong markets, especially those that sell labor-saving equipment They say their backlog is good, both domestic and foreign The services firms are in reasonably good shape, especially those in civil engineering and software supply; and the communications-related firms are in quite good shape Most, though, when they say they have to hire put it in that sense of ""have to"" There is a great reluctance to add workers, especially low skilled And they say they'll do everything they can to maintain their higher-priced labor and get rid of their low-cost labor It's the entry level positions they want to automate out of existence Now, there is a sophistication about what their true total cost is and what government policies are doing to their cost that's partly coming through A concern frequently noted by the homebuilders recently is lumber prices and what they are doing to costs; the increases are extremely large and there is no reason to expect prices to go back down  On the national scene, there's certainly a mood of caution in the District One major firm whose business is national--repair, maintenance, and renovation of aircraft, rolling stock, buses, and rail cars and so on--said that they had a very good backlog through the fourth quarter and coming into the year and then in February the phones stopped ringing They feel it is because of concerns about national economic policy They're hoping that turns out to be wrong or that it goes away But they say there's just nothing new going on; they're working on what they have and they're extremely cautious I subscribe more to the view about the 50 mile an hour head winds, which were holding us back before, rather than the view of at least some academics that it was restrictive monetary policy somehow measured that was holding us back In my view what we've seen in recent months --through the fall and into the beginning of this year--is the dissipation of those head winds And we shouldn't misinterpret that as sustained momentum if it is a one-time release from negative forces I have no confidence that current monetary policy is geared right for that environment--that a 3 percent nominal fed funds rate will promote the kind of environment for growth that's in the Greenbook And I worry that the head winds that were coming from all the restructuring--all those things that we talked about--are now being replaced by a fiscal head wind that is decidedly negative I see no way to interpret fiscal policy other than as a negative shock to the economy  Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd intended to ask a question to Dave Lindsey but your analysis and the factors you cited just punctuate what is my concern about the decision that needs to be  -37-    3/23/93  made and the criteria at this meeting and other meetings back to last fall Specifically, I want to refer to the table on page 8 of the Bluebook and the associated analysis and to put it into a broader [perspective] I don't know whether this is a question for the staff to answer or for the whole Committee to address itself to I remember seeing this kind of table 20 and 25 years ago and it hasn't changed a whole lot What role it serves is not so clear to me The various monetary and reserve aggregates that are shown in the little matrix have changed over time It's still a puzzle to me how this serves to guide the Committee in formulating a directive on a meeting-to-meeting basis In the discussion before our break and in your own commentary now, I thought it was very interesting, with all of the discussion about inflation concerns and all of the other things cited, that there was virtually no reference at all to M2 or any other monetary dimension to that problem I take it that the purpose of this table or the commentary in Dave Lindsey's presentation or Don Kohn's presentation when he's in that seat, is to guide the Committee on a tradeoff of selecting higher or lower fed funds rates and what we are to expect associated with that But nobody is talking about reserve and monetary aggregates And there was your own response to Senator Sarbanes in the last question of the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings about having your staff work with his staff to move away from M2 in terms of Humphrey-Hawkins or at least to supplement that by looking at other things And I don't know whether--  Supplement, right I don't know what those other things are  Well, in the meetings during the fall I thought the discussion was clearly over real economic activity, output, nonfarm payroll employment, and jobless claims, with very little reference to where we were compared to money [objectives] as to whether we ought to lower the funds rate or not And today it's a question of concerns over inflation with little reference to money and reserves as to whether we ought to raise the funds rate So, does this serve any useful purpose at all or should we recast the input to the Committee that we get from staff in the Bluebook?  For Don Kohn maybe, but he's away "
4941,1993-05-18," In reading the Greenbook for this meeting and listening to your comments and then thinking back over the analysis in the Greenbooks over the last 8 or 9 months and the swings in sentiment and developments as reported in various statistical [measures], it's tempting to have a sense of security that we're in a sort of fail-safe zone That in the longer term nothing much can really go wrong even though we get surprised in the short run We entered the fourth quarter with an expectation of a quite weak quarter in nominal GDP and real GDP with a 3 percent funds rate And the surprise was that it was a much, much stronger quarter than expected During that quarter as we were looking ahead to '93, the first quarter in particular, there was an expectation of fairly strong nominal GDP growth and real output growth; the surprise was that real output growth [in the first quarter] was much weaker than expected And by some measures prices have been much higher than expected, yet we still have a 3 percent funds rate When I look at your forecast through '94 in terms of nominal growth, real growth, and inflation it assumes a continuation of the 3 percent funds rate It is still the right number in spite of all of these developments It seems to me--and this is where I'd like you to comment on the way your model works--that when we have a development like the first quarter and real output comes in weak and inflation is reported to be much higher, it's not something to be concerned about because it means that the real interest rate has fallen or the natural rate or something because of the higher inflation and that will take care of the weakness in real growth But  -13-    5/18/93  out in the future because of the slack, the gap, the NAIRU or something, inflation will decelerate; that will raise the real interest rate so that no matter what happens it's going to turn out that the 3 percent funds rate is the right rate I'd be curious as to what it would take to persuade you that it's either too high or too low! [Laughter]  Can I follow-up, though, because you mentioned the fiscal drag Isn't the argument that if the fiscal program is adopted, we would get a lower inflation premium and more stimulus coming from private investment and the household sector, even housing, because of lower nominal interest rates than otherwise would be the case? And thus the net effect of the fiscal action could be presumed to be not restrictive at all  As things started to thaw out in my part of the country after our last meeting, it seemed like a good time to do a great deal of traveling throughout the District in large and small communities to hear what people had to say I found it an increasingly depressing experience as the weeks wore on Had I just stayed at home I could have given you a much better report because the numbers really are not bad But the mood is totally sour  Our agricultural sector is in good shape Planting got off to a slow start, but it did dry out and by the beginning of May  -29-    5/18/93  [farmers] were closing the gap on getting the planting accomplished As of last week they said they were very close to finishing their seasonal planting Farm equipment sales--implements of all types--are the strongest in years but that doesn't seem to be driven as much by confidence as by fear [that induces people] to go ahead and get it done Land prices are up sharply, 10 to 20 percent for agriculture There is talk of prices up to $1900 an acre, which cannot be sustained by current [crop] prices  Manufacturing is in good shape if one looks at the numbers; new orders and backlogs are quite good The metals are strong; auto parts suppliers are in good shape and are taking market share away from imports, especially by selling to the transplant firms but also to the domestic producers Capital goods also are strong both on domestic sales and [exports]; they feel they are able to take market share back from where they dropped before A telecommunications equipment firm also reports very good sales, with good export sales to Latin America in particular Coal production is down 13 percent in the first quarter but [our contacts] don't know whether that was weather-related or not I spent some time touring these coal- producing areas and mostly they're in a shrinking mode; their strategy is a gradual longer-term exit, with a decline in capacity that is planned  Employment wasn't too bad in the District, but there is no sentiment to increase employment The areas where we had been getting some increases, especially health care, are totally frozen Staff levels are ""replacement only"" in major communities for health care One large hospital group said that it had cancelled all openings for doctors and has no plans to fill the openings it previously had listed  Nothing is going on in commercial construction in the District, but in industrial construction there is replacement of capacity No expansion is planned, but [firms] will build where they need a facility to replace something that is obsolete The residential sector is pretty strong, both in sales and in construction  When I starting hearing about business loan demand picking up at banks, that seemed to be an element of encouragement But I was quickly dissuaded from that by bankers who said ""No, it's people coming in whom we haven't seen in a long time saying that times are going to get tough so they had better get friendly with their banker and [arrange] lines of credit because they are going to need them somewhere along the line""  On prices, the two types of firms that are able to get price increases are those related to capital goods or motor vehicle companies that are experiencing demand But the others are those that are shrinking [production]; they feel they're ""right sizing"" their operations So, it's really a shift of supply and a shrinking of their overall capacity Some of that is defense or aerospace-related and some is in electronics  When I think about the national situation, I still cannot persuade myself that we've entered a period of accelerating inflation [and that] the erosion of the purchasing power of the dollar is  -30-    5/18/93  worsening [But] I don't know a single person outside this room who agrees with [me on] that I've heard over and over again talk about inflation, whether people relate it to the deficit or overall fiscal policy or health care concerns To me health care can raise costs and redistribute [income], but I try to persuade people that it doesn't mean a sustained erosion in purchasing power and money And people tend to snicker at me; I have zero credibility My own daughter was telling me why she was buying a town house at a fixed-rate mortgage in southern California and I was trying to explain some things about southern California's economy She said I was being totally naive I explained that I'm a central banker and it's important that I talk about price stability and controlling inflation She said it was time I had a reality check! [Laughter] She said ""Why do you think inflation is not going up? You're just wrong"" And I found this same sentiment among bankers and people in small and large businesses They have persuaded themselves that inflation is going up and there's not anything anybody can do about it So, even though I felt relieved by the March numbers coming in much better than those for January and February and I thought we were okay--and I still have some reservations about how reliable the April numbers are--I don't think that's the issue The issue is not whether we really have inflation; I think we have inflation psychology We have people acting on the belief that future inflation will be higher That's what we have to address no matter what the statistics show  May I ask a question that relates to that uncertainty and trying to reduce it? If an action that results in a higher funds rate, which would be the first increase in I don't know how many years--  Well, we haven't changed it since September 4th [of last year]  So, if it's the result of an action by the Committee after a full set of deliberations, I don't know that it would raise many questions in the minds of people as to what happened [It would be clear] that this Committee looked at a whole lot of things and in its collective wisdom decided to raise the funds rate But if it's done as a result of an asymmetric directive, which involves discretion, then what it was that triggered the increase is going to be very important  I had started off this year hoping that inflation would be less than last year; but much more importantly I believed that inflation this year was going to be less than last year It has already been mentioned that it would take [an inflation rate of] 26 percent or something like that for the rest of the year [to achieve the staff forecast for inflation] But I had been thinking more that 2-1/2 percent nominally should be a goal that was doable this year for the whole year, which would have been an average of 2 for every month of the year Now, if it averages 2 for the remaining eight months, that still is going to hold inflation only at last year's level, and I find that unacceptable So, I think there is already enough information, that nothing else needs to be learned, and that an immediate action is warranted "
4964,1993-07-06," I have a couple of conceptual problems that relate to what Larry and Mike were just discussing One has to be very careful about the distinction between the value of a dollar and the value of assets denominated in dollars Even if we have no net inflows, if we have an environment where we're stabilizing the purchasing power of the dollar and the inflation premium and interest rates are coming down, we can have a capital gains that would indicate policy is expansionary when in fact it is anti-inflationary and the reverse If we got into a period where people expected the value of the dollar to decline and interest rates to rise, the value of these funds would fall, indicating policy is restrictive The comment about it being an accurate picture of the thrust of policy comes from relating it to nominal GDP But if the Committee is accepting stabilizing the purchasing power of the dollar as its objective, we measure policy as a central bank from that objective--not targeting GDP but stabilizing the purchasing power of the dollar and not assets denominated in dollars  I agree But even if it were, I'd have a problem with it  Your question implies a reversal of the signs because traditionally we would have said that wealth enters the demand function positively, but you're suggesting that this is a substitution effect  Right  It certainly goes against our theoretical framework  A couple of things First, a comment on your exchange with Larry Lindsey on the cost of capital The major computers buy millions of instructions per second generally And if you compare the price of a million instructions per second on a 1980 computer with the 1982 computer when [unintelligible] chips came out it's a factor of one-one thousandth in the cost But the problem is worse than that because we don't include software in capital stock generally; it's a perishable factor input And a lot of software we're using today didn't even exist in 1980, so we can't even make that comparison And businesses' real costs of that kind of capital, at least versus labor costs, has fallen far more dramatically than 40 percent  You can say it that way I think a part of the problem is that you're not measuring output the same anymore You're focusing just on the input part  But you also have a problem on the output part The other comment is really a question to Mike I want to go back to the questions that Ed Boehne and Dick Syron asked earlier about secular and cyclical inflation and your response to them If I look at your numbers, the implications of the central tendency of the bond yield, essentially you're saying to us that compared to '92 or a couple of years in here we may have a cyclical increase in inflation but that we are still on a secular downward trend Whereas it would appear from household behavior and other things like forward rates that businesses and households are assuming that we have seen a secular low in 1992--holding aside whatever cyclical peaks and troughs from this point forward--and we have not only a cyclical increase [ahead] but probably a secular increase Households and businesses also seem to be assuming that we have seen a secular low in tax rates beginning with the '90 tax rate, whatever is going to happen after So, if you make the assumption that businesses and households alike are acting in the belief that from this point forward we will have a generally higher drift of both inflation and tax rates, how do you factor that into your split between your kind of growth and inflation?  Wouldn't you say that mortgage refinancings and corporate debt issuance, quite aside from the surveys, are at least consistent with the view that the household and business sectors are assuming we've seen the secular lows?  And the same holds for taxes  Even if you cannot do it formally in your model, wouldn't you say that at least theoretically that should be factored into a forecast of the growth in output and the composition of that growth?  Thank you I've continued to tour the District, visiting not only with bankers but with a lot of their customers, mainly small businesses, and staying away from the big guys because they all continue to shrink anyway What has stood out in all of this is the extraordinary increase in the utilization of technology [in areas] that I would never have imagined It's one thing to see a very high level of software development and computer usage in something like titanium hip replacement parts and to see how strong their market is on a global basis, how much their volume is increasing, how much their prices are falling, how proud they are of having reduced their work force, and how determined they are to do more of the same But we've also visited turkey processing plants, agricultural feed products, and an egg-laying operation producing 350 million eggs a year with 70 workers and a bunch of 486 PCs Again, the emphasis of all these people is on the reduction in their work force--how many fewer people they're able to get by with than they were five years ago When people talk about a perceived shortage of something, they talk about people with the right software to [fix it]; they say they know they could automate if somebody could just get the time and learn how to do it with the software What stands out in this somewhat casual impression that everybody's emphasis is on substituting [technology] for labor is that if this period is in time generally viewed as something comparable to, say, a third industrial revolution, as some writers have already started to argue, then trying to measure the economy in terms of jobs and the number of people employed is going to lead us far astray of what's really going on out there  At the beginning of this century the largest employer in North America was the US ice trust Had we had the emphasis on preserving jobs at that time we would have made a terrific mistake for the national economy It might have precluded air conditioned houses and offices, which might have helped out on the side of the government but otherwise probably would have held the economy back very considerably So, I think we have to be very, very careful in interpreting all of the output numbers because we're having more difficulty in just conceptualizing using the 19th century framework, which is based on tons and numbers of things when we look at output We have to be careful about productivity The whole retail trade sector is shown to have had negative factor productivity for more than a decade mainly because its output goes to the benefit of the consumers, these optical scanners and so on And I think it defies all reason to think that the retail trade sector has negative  -22-    7/6-7/93  productivity gains given what they're doing; [the same goes for] the banking industry and so on  Turning to just a few sectoral comments about the District, our agricultural sector is very strong Our farmers are delighted with the floods and problems in the Mississippi valley area They're looking forward to higher prices; they have their crops in and they look for good volumes The disturbing aspect is that some bankers-- and this is not farmers themselves talking so I don't know how much reliability to attach to it--are talking in terms of the price of an acre being up as much as 25 percent from a year ago Some of the prices they quote--what they say they're getting on loan requests-- look unrealistic to me related to the values of the crops associated with [the land] Our contacts point out that these prices remain well below the peak of the agricultural bubble back a decade or so ago, but they are still very, very sharp increases in land prices  Confidence of the smaller businesses I would say is still very, very negative; [it stems] from their perceptions of Washington In our discussion in May there was a question as to whether this was just political bias--usually these small businessmen are Republicans-- but my sense of that now is quite the contrary John LaWare was with us at our joint board meeting in June and he heard one of the comments made by one of the directors who comes from a district where the Democratic registration is 8 to 1, and they are the most upset [The mood is beginning] to take on a jilted lover effect; those who had high hopes and aspirations and expected the most from this Administration are the ones who are most angry So, I don't think it's politics when they tell us how upset they are about things  Other conditions in the District generally have not changed It's still probably the strongest region in the country The retail sector is very good; exporting is very good; auto sales in our area are very good There's really nothing there of a negative tone I do want to comment and ask a question, too, about the Greenbook and these FOMC central tendency projections on Chart 16 Maybe I misunderstood what they are When I look at the Wall Street Journal's summary of everybody's forecast or any of these other [forecasts], it's one thing that [unintelligible] is going to happen I don't think in terms of [a forecast] by the central bank when it comes to putting down numbers for inflation; rather I think of these as our objectives because it's our policies that are going to produce these [outcomes] And [it bothers me] to see the Committee raise the central tendency for this year and also to have the central tendency for next year the same as it is this year and above where inflation came in in 1992 Am I to understand that the consensus of the Committee is that inflation is not going to go down anymore because we're not going to try and produce lower inflation? Is this an objective or is this a prediction?  How do you handle that then when it says that the Committee's policies are related to inflation? Our objective is to go to price stability, but we're predicting that the rate of inflation is going to be sticking in the 3 to 3 plus percent area  Don't you announce them at the same time you announce our policies?  Well, there are a couple of things [I'd say] about that One, the numbers that we provided are not a prediction of what is going to happen When we put down a number [for inflation], such as the number [we gave] in February, the way I interpret it is that it's the intent of policy to try and achieve a downward trend And I think it's different than unemployment or real GDP or anything else like that because those are not part of the ultimate objectives of our policy Our ultimate objective is to stabilize the purchasing power of the currency  I agree, but in a one-year ahead [framework] like this--  Well, one final question Are the ranges [showing the central tendency of our forecasts] for 1993 and 1994 to be taken as acceptable to the Committee?  You raised a question a few minutes ago about what the chances were of a sharp velocity decline I had looked at the Bluebook table on page 8 and noted that the numbers imply significant velocity declines in 1998 I was trying to think my way through what set of circumstances could produce that result even out then, let alone this year and next year We may not know much about what should or shouldn't be in M2 or what's going on with its velocity, but we do know that debits still equal credits--the two sides of the balance sheet are still equal--and that will help guide us a little In order to have negative velocity, given that there is little further potential for running off non-deposit liabilities of the banking system and there is substantial potential for running off security portfolios in order to accommodate loan demand, we somehow have to imagine that total intermediation through the commercial banking system--the total assets of the banking system corresponding to those liabilities--have to rise relative to total spending in the economy the way we measure things I'm having a terrible time imagining that circumstance coming about no matter what the yield curve is doing So, I think that we could put aside the idea of a velocity decline even out in 1998 I [unintelligible] something to fill that case  As for the ranges for this year and next year, very early in this discussion Al Broaddus asked a question about credibility and Mike and Don referred to that footnote on page 9 A part of what we are trying to do is establish some credibility of a regime in which people believe that any increases in inflation and interest rates are temporary and they'll go back down so that the central bank [unintelligible] them to do that I don't see how it helps us to start building on that credibility if we are below our target range and are not trying--or claiming that we're trying--to do anything to be within the range So, whether we call this a target or a forecast of what money is going to do, it's just arithmetic at this point for 1993 We have to lower the range and be willing to make these  -60-    7/6-7/93  [unintelligible] as they may be, just as a step to get our own credibility up When the focus is on this ratio of GDP to M we call velocity, a lot of the discussion is about the denominator; in earlier remarks, especially Larry Lindsey's remarks, it was that we were using the denominator as a handle to try to hit the numerator Well, I don't think that we should be targeting nominal GDP, [unintelligible] total spending I have enough trouble with what's in the numerator in measuring economic activity in today's world to think that we should fiddle with the denominator to hit the numerator A lot of this discussion about velocity gets us off track Instead we ought to get out [the message] more clearly that [our goal] is price level stability--that we're going to stabilize the price level at some point in the future Whether we're fiddling with the fed funds rate or fiddling with various reserve or money measures, [the message should be] that we haven't lost our focus on stabilizing the price level And all of these other discussions about where we are on the Ms or their velocities are sort of distractions  I also am not happy about the fact that inflation this year is not going to come in where we talked about last February, and the judgment has to be that our policies are not at the moment moving us in the direction of our long-term objective We ought to correct that  Part of what I was thinking Bob Forrestal already referred to When I read the Wessel piece I thought of the Administration I think you're being generous to Wessel's IQ If he had said people familiar with the way the Fed deliberates, I would have come to the conclusion you did But he said ""familiar with the Fed's deliberations"" in both of these articles I interpret that to mean somebody who claimed to be in a position of knowing what happened at that meeting [unintelligible]--  Yes, but if it's not a Fed official--if it's an Administration official--  Well, whether it was a Fed official or not, I associate myself with Wayne's point about ""for the record for background"" Having worked in this town in '81 and '82, I took the position then that one just does not do off-the-record statements You either do it on the record or you don't say it But the trouble with this town is that not many people agree with me And people in the Washington press know that, and people who work-- "
4993,1993-08-17," Reports from businesses, large and small, and from banks in the Cleveland District continue to be good--better than they previously expected--[but they are] associated with a pessimistic outlook There is this continuing tendency to feel that whatever good sales volumes, good backlogs, or earnings are being experienced are not going to be sustained Maybe it's that people are unaccustomed in the Fourth District to performing what they perceive as better than other places in the country Certainly what they read about other parts of the country is more negative than what they're feeling in our District Agriculture is good; both corn and bean crops are good; what's important is better prices and good farm incomes for the third year in a row So the banks in the ag regions are feeling that farm credit is in very good shape Land prices are firm to rising; agricultural equipment sales are very strong both within the District and nationally; Si Keehn commented about that The auto supply companies are doing quite well, though they are nervous about the outlook They've had a much better year than they thought they were going to have but continue to worry about the future Our small communities are quite strong A lot of the smaller cities around the District would describe their conditions as bordering on a temporary boom for them; there's construction of single-family housing, shopping centers, and some government buildings But also there is a belief that this is temporary [and they should] enjoy it while it lasts because [business conditions] are going to weaken in the future  I formed a new Small Bank Advisory Council that had its first meeting last Friday After they had a very extensive briefing on economic developments, including a variety of measures of inflation, various measures of money, narrow and broad, nominal and real interest rates, credit flows and so on, I asked them to characterize monetary policy as they currently see it in view of the fiscal package and local conditions and what they're seeing in their banks [Views] were about evenly split between those who said that they consider policy about right or too easy Not a single banker was willing to characterize it as too tight They consistently think inflation has already hit its low and is going to move up We do feel we've had some success with both small banks and small businesses around the District in talking them into lowering their expectations about how much inflation is going to rise, especially as that feeds into their plans with regard to labor--their own salary budgets and their projections of what kind of increases they will be granting into 1994  -18-    8/17/93  But they still [see inflation] in an upward direction from where it has been  As far as the national outlook, I don't know whether the Greenbook forecast for inflation is a good forecast or not, but I do think it's unacceptable  I have a general aversion to the idea behind asymmetric, discretionary directives And after listening to Don Kohn's explanation of the meaning of switching back to symmetric, I felt it left me with no choice but to prefer asymmetric if that's what it means to move to symmetric But when I think about leaving the funds rate at 3 percent in view of the Greenbook projection on inflation, it implies that the Committee says either that projection is wrong or it's acceptable I didn't hear any comments about whether it was either wrong or acceptable to the Committee, which leaves me puzzled about the comments about declaring victory Those comments are suggestions that the Greenbook projections on inflation are in fact wrong rather than acceptable, I think So, I'm not sure where I come out "
5018,1993-09-21," The funds rate has been unchanged for a little over a year now So, it seems to me useful to look back over the period to see what else has been unchanged or what has changed and in which direction and to try to make some sense out of it In reviewing the successive Greenbooks in the period since a year ago, one of the things that struck me was how little your forecast of nominal GDP for the second half of 1994 has changed A year ago at this time you [extended the forecast] another year, so I am curious as to what your 1995 projections will look like once we get those, but that's not my main question now The funds rate has stayed at 3 percent and [your forecast for] nominal GDP growth still is on the order of 4-1/2 percent or a little more for the second half of 1994; that hasn't changed much even though a lot of other things have changed in the    9/23/93  meantime in successive Greenbooks Then, I see that your estimates of potential real output have been revised up, partly because of the new benchmark numbers Actual output has been somewhat below where we anticipated and it continues to be projected on the low side in '94, so you've got a bigger gap There are two essential elements to your framework One is that the gap says something about future inflation and that nominal and/or real interest rates say something about real output growth Bond yields are lower than you had anticipated earlier; I don't know about real rates, but at least nominal rates are lower Short rates are the same and inflation [is higher], suggesting lower real rates So, ex ante, one would look at this set of things and say Well, your forecast should have implied that the split of nominal GDP would be less inflation and more output Instead, we get the opposite We have a bigger gap yet we have lower output growth by almost a percentage point in 1994, and with that bigger gap we have higher inflation I'd be curious [to learn] what other things must have changed, because other things equal we would have gotten the opposite We would have expected more output, less inflation So, what were the things that changed in your framework to produce this combination of higher inflation and lower output for the same GDP?  Can I follow up? I expected you to put a little more stress on the fiscal package    9/23/93  It raises some interesting implications for the Committee's policy because on the second page of the Greenbook summary you say ""Achievement of this middling expansion path may require maintenance of relatively low real short-term rates--to counter the contractionary effects of fiscal restraint, uncertainty about government policies, and, at least in the near term, slow growth of foreign industrial economies"" That's a stronger statement--I would call it advocacy--of monetary policy than we typically see in the Greenbook The Greenbook is typically a little more neutral in terms of an assumption of monetary policy And if it's the case that the real output projection is being influenced by fiscal actions, and if it's the position of the Committee generally that monetary policy cannot be used to correct mistakes of other parts of the government sector, and if you advocate a monetary policy in the future that is different than it would have been in absence of the fiscal package, then that is saying that monetary policy is being adjusted because of the fiscal regime  Even though it has been a fairly short period since the last meeting of the Committee, I would not characterize the situation in the District as better than the nation anymore The mood coming back after Labor Day for large and small businesses was less positive for the District than I thought it was before Objectively, the numbers look still pretty good Unemployment has been declining in our District, even if it hasn't nationally The auto sector is doing quite well, mainly because of a larger domestic share, the transplants and all of that One of the things that I hadn't considered before about the transplant companies raises an interesting problem for them This came up with the recent Honda actions They cannot effectively sell essentially the same car that's produced in Ohio and produced in Japan at different prices So, the exchange rate is forcing them to make choices between pricing that's appropriate for an import or pricing that's appropriate for a domestic car, with considerably different implications for volumes depending on which way they go It's quite different for a company like Honda that has a very substantial domestic production relative to their total versus some of the other foreign manufacturers  Retailing was disappointing The major retail companies headquartered in the District that operate nationally said that the back-to-school selling season was less than they had hoped, but they remain hopeful about the holiday selling season In a joint board meeting last week, large and small businesses made reference to the idea of expecting leaner times--that '94 would be weaker than '93  -18-    9/23/93  And they talked about the general pattern of what they call ""making small downward adjustments"" in spending habits and expectations in order for it to get soft in the region One director in doing a roundup for me of minority businesses in the major metropolitan areas said that there's a general sense that minority owned businesses are being more negatively influenced by government actions than non- minority businesses because of the way the tax laws and the health care proposals affect them  Turning to the nation and the Greenbook, a number of comments are being raised on some issues that concern me First, this discussion about long-term rates and the backward-looking model and the forecast part of that seemed to me like a debate a long, long time ago, involving the views of Ptolemy and Copernicus The Ptolemaic model did work well apparently, but that didn't make it valid What we do know is that in the very long run there is a relationship between the quantity equation and the Fisher equation [That's] because the real return on productive assets and the real return on financial assets are going to approximate over time the real growth the economy is able to produce, and one would expect that inflationary expectations in a sustained steady state world are going to approximate inflation In the 1953 to 1963 period nominal GDP growth averaged about 5 percent, what the Greenbook projects out toward the end of '94 And, of course, in that period long-term rates were substantially lower than they are today But at that time I think we had a regime where people believed that increased inflation and interest rates were temporary and bound to go back down, whereas today we still have the opposite And what we're trying to do is change that regime It's not an inflation objective in terms of numbers, but rather a mind set about what the natural order of things is  And that brings me to some [points] about fiscal policy and the way it was raised both in the projection and discussed in the Greenbook Mike said in his response to me that it's not advocacy to say ""achievement of this middling expansion path"" But that to me implies that real output is an objective of monetary policy, assuming we know how to measure the thrust of monetary policy actions on nominal or real magnitudes I'd say a couple of things This month is the 25th anniversary of a study completed on various ways of measuring fiscal policy at the St Louis Fed; that's a long time ago and I don't think we've learned a heck of lot since then about how to gauge these things The notion of characterizing current fiscal policy as restraint is about like the Lyndon Johnson surtax of 1968 I would worry about that being allowed to influence monetary actions as it did at that time If we maintain that the objective of monetary policy is price stability, somehow measured or viewed, and if we accept the Greenbook projection that inflation is now higher than we previously thought it was going to be with the current stance of policy and if that policy is [deemed] acceptable, then that says that we have either changed our objective or the time horizon for achieving that objective or that we think the Greenbook is wrong on its inflation forecast or our policies are wrong and they need to be adjusted  Don, on the chart package--I guess everybody got this yesterday--the last two pages have M1 velocity and opportunity costs and M2 velocity and opportunity costs The Committee has had some discussions in the past about what is going on with the relation between M2 and alternative variables I don't recall any discussion about M1, its velocity, and opportunity costs Looking at this, it struck me first how close the relationship still appears to be visually And I started thinking about some other things that I once was more familiar with than I am today, the empirical models of money demand on the monetary base and M1 that use intermediate- and longer- term interest rates Over the last year we've had double-digit growth of M1 and the base, on the order of 10 to 12 percent, about twice the rate of growth of nominal GDP And the decline that we tended to get in long rates is consistent with the elasticities in those earlier studies I don't know what you have in your opportunity costs, but using either version of that, I can think of four possibilities for the future It would be interesting to get you to assign probabilities to the possible outcomes One, of course, is that the relationship simply breaks down One would be that nominal GDP accelerates to double-digit rates At least the Greenbook doesn't have that! That would at least establish the relationship of velocity A third would be that M1 and monetary base growth are essentially cut in half in the next year, down to about 5 percent or so, consistent with nominal GDP growth And the fourth is that we continue to get a plunge in opportunity costs Since I don't know what yours are, I don't know what those implications are; but for long-term government bonds that means a yield of approximately 4-1/2 percent a year from now Comments? "
5057,1993-10-15," This is Jerry Jordan I don't object at all I think that's appropriate I thought what Tom Melzer said was appropriate I would support what Bill McDonough proposed earlier But I want to re-emphasize what is awkward As was mentioned earlier, the FOMC is legally a separate body from the Board of Governors and the Banks Some members of the FOMC who happen to be members of the Board of Governors knew about the transcripts Other members who happen to be Reserve Bank Presidents didn't know and now have  -21-    10/15/93  submitted to Washington statements saying that they didn't know And that's going to come out on Tuesday and that's awkward "
5121,1993-11-16," Thank you I like your idea of explaining the position of the Committee before the Congress and I hope you will pursue that as a way to explain all the dimensions of this As for the past, frankly, I think it's wrong ever to release transcripts of meetings that people didn't know were being made at the time, but that doesn't seem to be an option So my first choice would be along the  -26-    11/16/93  lines suggested by Tom Hoenig's question that we prepare Memoranda of Discussion for the past and release the raw transcripts to the Archives after 30 years If that doesn't give us protection--if the judgment is that that's not going to do it--then your proposal on lightly edited transcripts is sort of a third best if that's what we're stuck with  Going forward my first choice would be enhanced minutes with no tape and no transcripts, Don's number 2, but frankly I think the chance of getting away with stopping the taping and transcribing now after we've been doing it for 17 years or more is not likely to be successful So the question then of Memoranda of Discussion versus lightly edited transcripts released after a lag I think has to be decided along the lines that Dave Mullins suggested, as to which one is most likely to withstand protection without legislation And if that comes down to the side of lightly edited I would favor that; otherwise I would favor Memoranda of Discussion Certainly if we had legislation, I would prefer Memoranda of Discussion  My first choice would be lightly edited without, and my second raw with, annotation  Thirty and five  Enhanced and MOD  The last time we had discussions about reciprocal currency arrangements either late last year or early this year--I don't recall--the response to a question about these swap lines was this That we had a new Administration that had been either just elected or just inaugurated and until they had been there for a while and we could get acquainted and find out what their attitudes and moods were, we couldn't really address this, so for the time being we would go ahead and just continue what we were doing before We've never had that report It's a report I still look forward to getting as to what is the attitude and what is the [purpose] of even having these kinds of arrangements with all these different banks If we could, I'd really like to have that discussion  The Vice Chairman might recall that [as] the then Manager [with oversight] for foreign operations in response to a question about under what circumstances he could foresee implementing a swap with certain minor central banks said that he couldn't imagine any He also said that he thought it was an appropriate topic to address once the new Administration was in place and conversations had taken place [Unintelligible] to hearing the report  I think that is the question  At meetings I attended in 1992, there was a public or outside perception that the Committee implemented its policy actions in the short run based on what the monthly nonfarm payroll employment numbers were doing And I thought that that was undesirable and had implications that could be troubling down the road We've gotten away from that and I think it's very healthy and very desirable that we've gotten away from that But when I looked at this Greenbook and the one before--it's emphasized more in this one--I was concerned about this input to our deliberations And Mike's response to Bob Forrestal enhances my concern On page 1-13, with the first look at 1995, you say ""We have assumed an increase in short- term interest rates that we believe sufficient to hold real GDP growth to 2-1/2 percent"" I've never thought that the role of monetary policy is to put an upper limit on real growth It was troubling to me in past times when the idea was that the role of monetary policy was to foster or stimulate certain kinds of real GDP growth And it's just as troubling to suggest that the purpose is to put an upper limit on it The next sentence says ""With continued slack in labor and product markets, core inflation"" Again, the idea that we're directing monetary policy with the intent of maintaining slack is very troubling However we come out on our discussions about deliberations in the future, as I understand it the Greenbook is released to the public with a five-year lag And this exposition about the criteria for implementing monetary policy I find very troubling  There are still some areas of the District that are reported to be flat but they're what I would call fairly isolated Most of the District reports growth There is no new information of a negative nature, of things being weaker than before or weaker than expected There are a number of aspects that are positive and strong --stronger than before, stronger than expected--especially real estate, commercial lending, and manufacturing generally, particularly capital goods industries And of note is that while at one time the machine tool industry in the Great Lakes region was thought to be headed to oblivion, they're feeling pretty good; there's quite a bit of optimism starting to build in machine tools  Turning to the national [economy] and the Greenbook, when I look at the nominal and the real GDP [forecast], based on the experience of the fourth quarter of last year I think the Greenbook is wrong I just have no idea in which direction or how big And when I look at the inflation [forecast] it's unacceptable in that progress on inflation has been pushed out over 48 months The current number for the end of '95 is above the number for a year ago as of this time So to go out to the end of '95 and still have inflation above where it was projected a year ago to be at the end of '93 I think has to be viewed as unacceptable  Even if I wanted to choose alternative A or alternative C, I could not do so based on the criteria set forth in the Bluebook because it says the choice of alternative A is based on unacceptably slow real growth and alternative C on unacceptably high real growth And I think those criteria are relevant for making the decision between ""A"" and ""C,"" so I'm stuck with ""B"" "
5152,1993-12-21," I have a couple of questions for Mike When I look back at the Greenbook projections for '93 starting from a year ago, on balance they are very encouraging Even though the intra-year pattern on growth as currently reported is different, we all know that's going to be revised away anyway, so let's not pay too much attention to that But the cumulative effect over the year is that real growth this year, even if we get 5 percent in the fourth quarter, is going to be about what was projected a year ago And inflation is probably going to come in slightly less, as measured by the consumer price index, which looks pretty good But then when I look at your current projection for 1994 versus a year ago, output growth is now projected to be slightly less than you thought a year ago for next year but inflation quite a bit more--1/2 to 3/4 percentage point more on consumer prices I've read what you have written and I've listened to what you have said and it's still not clear to me why you think that inflation in 1994 and into 1995 is going to be at a higher level than you thought a year ago  Let me follow up on that because everything I've seen, including Ted's report, is that outside the United States virtually everything has been, if anything, much, much weaker in '93 than was expected as of a year ago So in the global marketplace in your model, your framework, you should have more slack, more excess    12/21/93  capacity than you thought a year ago that you would have at this time And so in a global economy you would say there is less price pressure than a year ago you would have thought at this time  Okay, one more point, which may just be a technical question Historically the gap between the GNP deflator and the CPI has been about 1/2 percentage point, and I noticed that you [widen] it to about a percentage point in '94 and carry it out through '95 at almost a full percentage point What's giving rise to that?  Translate that for me as to which one is wrong  Generally economic activity through our District by sector and the various industries wouldn't be much different than what Si Keehn reported for the Seventh District, so I'm not going to go through them in different detail It's basically quite positive Some parts of the District would describe themselves as being in boom conditions, especially down into central Kentucky around the Lexington area A lot of it is driven by motor vehicle-related things because both the domestic companies and the transplant companies are doing quite well, and trucks as well Also, there's an increasing tendency for banks to report to us that business loan demand is picking up Earlier this year that was rather selective; it comes almost without exception that the banks say they are getting business loan demand Residential construction has been strong, [as has] commercial construction, heavy infrastructure kinds of construction all over the District And the ag sector had a better year than they thought they were going to have--the best they've had since [unintelligible] We also see rising farmland prices and more reports of a pickup in interest there Through all of this, though, we've only had what we would call marginal employment growth Anecdotally, most manufacturing-type businesses report very substantial increases in productivity They talk about their increased volumes, increased output without adding to the work force, and I point out that that's contrary to national policy! The passage of NAFTA was interesting in that it was, of course, very controversial There was a lot of organized labor activity in the District, very intensive activity But once it was passed it almost disappeared as an issue [The feeling seems to be] okay, it's basically positive for the area; and  -14-    12/21/93  labor organizations just simply have not been a factor I cannot  It looks like mortgage refinancing activity has slowed dramatically The strength on the consumer side is auto-related  On the national scene, I can't differ with the forecast put out in the Greenbook But if the assumptions about policy in the Greenbook were to produce the kind of inflation projected, especially out into '95, I would find that very unacceptable So either the forecast has to be wrong or the policy is wrong  Your remark suggested to me something about communicating our actions which I hadn't considered before, and that is if the next action were to be communicated as easing the degree of accommodation, it would be an easing move I think I'm increasingly troubled by the rhetoric on the outside--by people looking at what we do--and sometimes even within the Committee of the notion that growth per se reduces the purchasing power of money And it puts us into a way of being perceived, and maybe we perceive ourselves, that says if we're anti-inflation, we're anti-growth I have a lot of trouble with    12/21/93  the slack model, with the Phillips curve kind of tradeoff that calls for a forecast of things like capacity and all sorts of things that I have trouble with But even for people who operate from that framework I would suggest being careful about saying that we want to maintain a degree of unemployment or idle capacity or sub-potential growth or something because--  What I would like to see us be doing is setting some objective out some four or five years In fact, I hope the Bluebook for the February meeting gives us a longer-term indication of a price level path My belief is that if we have both an objective of moving to price stability measured somehow in, say, four or five years and conduct our actions in such a way as to achieve that objective, the level of output and the standards of living of people would go up more than if we operate in such a way as to maintain the past rate of inflation I don't know whether the staff projections would show that or not, but that's my conviction We talk at times in our speeches and articles as though the reason for moving to price level stability, stabilizing the purchasing power of money, is in order to enhance standards of living and growth And then we conduct our affairs in a short-term way as though we are trying to restrain growth and that we're worried about [our economy] growing too rapidly So it's partly a conceptual and theoretical issue and it's partly a communications issue  As far as short-term actions, I agree with your suggestion to be symmetric now I would not like to see an asymmetric directive because of the critical nature of this move But also I agree with the comments that Governor Mullins made about not waiting for certain data to trigger [an action] And there I take some issue with the suggestion that Bill McDonough made about the [January] release of [fourth-quarter] GDP and the February release of nonfarm payroll [employment data for January] If those numbers are going to come out strong, the last thing that we would want to do is to be perceived as reacting to strong numbers and to knock it down If we think those numbers are going to be strong, we had better move ahead of those numbers "
5182,1994-02-03," All those issues including the ""warehousing""?  I have some comments on that  Warehousing is a loan by the central bank to the Treasury That issue is one that's general not only to this central bank but to central banks around the world Central banks around the world are moving toward more arms length dealings with Ministries of Finance Certainly, the ""accord"" between the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury over 40 years ago had that in mind As I understand it, warehousing was proposed by Secretary Bill Simon in a letter to Chairman Burns about a week or so before the Ford Administration left office, and I can't for the life of me imagine why he did that I haven't asked him yet, but I am going to ask him what was he thinking when he did that Subsequently, in 1979, there was legislation providing for temporary lending in effect by the Reserve Banks to the Treasury because of so-called liquidity problems having to do with debt ceiling limitations and all of that That authority was controversial at the time; it lasted for only two years It was decided that it was a bad idea and Congress let it lapse Yet warehousing continues as a practice, or at least the authority is still on the books for us to make a loan to the Treasury Department when it was generally agreed going back 80 years that that should happen only under very, very exceptional circumstances I would take the latter to involve conditions warranting a full discussion by this Committee So I think it's not appropriate for us to have a standing authority for a line of credit for the Treasury to get us to lend to them up to $5 billion And I think we should not authorize this  No  I want to get some guidance on how to interpret the last table You made assumptions about policy without any indication of the appropriateness of that policy  Okay, well that's helpful For '94 for instance compared to '93--from the very preliminary numbers we have for '93-- you have nominal GDP increasing a little faster, actually a lot, but the CPI a little faster Based on your chart on page 8, I understand your core rate of inflation for '94 would be slightly below this 33 percent that you have in here and then for '95 you have a deceleration of nominal GDP, real output, and the CPI--again with the core rate being slightly below Our objective for each year's inflation is to be below the previous year Of course, in the last two years ex-food and energy the rate has been above that for the previous year; you've got it slightly above, so we're back to the 31 percent Then when I look at the submissions from the Committee members, I'm puzzled because in the memo we got from Gary Gillum our instructions were that the projections for 1994 and 1995 should be based on the assumption of what in our judgment would be an appropriate monetary policy Then I see projections of nominal GDP this year with a range up to 7-1/2 percent, a CPI up to 4 percent, and nominal GDP for 1995 with a range up to 6-3/4 and the CPI up to 4-1/2 percent I have to interpret that as being a submission based on somebody's assumption of what an appropriate monetary policy would produce Is that your interpretation?  But you said you did read the minds--  In spite of my own doubts about the matter, I consistently run into the expectation throughout our District that eventually it will thaw out! It's an the area of the country where severe winter weather seems to have absolutely no negative effect on people's mood and outlook  We also hear the stories of shortages of certain classes of labor and the difficulty of hiring Some of our major manufacturing areas are reporting under 4 percent unemployment I hear the same expressions of reluctance to hire that others apparently still are hearing although Ohio, for instance--whatever the credibility of the data--showed a 3-1/2 percent increase in employment last year So, they ""reluctantly"" hired a lot of people The last time I saw both these kinds of numbers and this rather pervasive mood of ""everything's okay and getting better"" was when I lived in southern California during the roaring boom in the latter 1980s before the bust Si has already mentioned a lot of the region-specific and the sector-specific developments that also relate to our area I'm not going to go through those in detail One thing that I could add on the motor vehicles side, after calling around to various plants in the District, is that they are estimating that the weather reduced production by some 60,000 to 70,000 vehicles in the quarter and not all of that will be made up Industry contacts tell us that some of the plants, by running overtime, can make up lost output by the end of March; others are telling us that their production schedule for the quarter was already such that they are not going to be able to make it up; they view these as permanent losses in production Some of the plants were shut down totally for as much as four days All of the lenders in the District are talking about very strong credit demands--commercial, consumer, and residential I haven't heard any reference to the notion of a credit crunch in some time now  On the national side, my forecast is that the numbers for the last two years will be revised substantially and that once we get that revision three or four years from now and look back on the period, a lot of these intra-year patterns will go away A smoothing process will indicate that we didn't have a weak first half last year and a boom in the second half, but more or less that the economy in the last couple of years has grown somewhere in the 3 to 4 percent range, and that won't look quite so odd When I look at year-ago expectations about 1993 and then look at the numbers that we had on balance, abstracting from the intra-year pattern, real output growth was about what was expected a year ago and the CPI came in about as was expected Yet during the course of the year, the numbers for 1994 generally continued to show an upward revision for inflation And now the numbers for 1995--we've only had a couple of forecasts that go out to 1995--are already showing higher numbers In fact, the numbers we now have for 1995 are higher than the numbers we had for 1994 a year ago; 1993 similarly was progressively moved up So, it's a pattern  -24-    2/3-4/94  that implies becoming accustomed to accepting no further progress on inflation, and I find that very disturbing If those numbers are accurately based on current policy or the assumption about what policy will be, then I think the conclusion would have to be one of two things Either we have changed our objectives with regard to inflation or we have to change our policies Otherwise we're going to send the wrong message to people who look at these numbers to gauge the Committee's real intent  I thought your Congressional testimony last Monday was well constructed and made the points that you needed to make in the right way I was initially quite discouraged with the wire service stories as they came out, which seemed totally to miss the point you were trying to convey But then the stories that came out in some of the major dailies restored my confidence that maybe we're making a little progress in conveying our views I thought both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal--or at least one of the Wall Street Journal pieces--treated it as we would have hoped Based on what you said there and the way that went, I would trust that you wouldn't be saying that ""the Committee tightened,"" using that kind of jargon but rather that because of the nature of the change being contemplated--and it doesn't matter whether it's tomorrow or at the March or May meeting--the next move is undoubtedly going to be in an upward direction on interest rates And it's not just that it would be the first change since September 1992; it's the first change upward in some five years Without repeating all the discussion that we had in December about the importance of a rate increase being clearly  -31-    2/3-4/94  understood as being an action of the Committee, the rationale for it as a growth-sustaining move is extremely important Only by putting out a statement can we get that message out there, or at least make an effort to say that this is not an anti-growth move but one that is designed to enhance the longevity of this expansion  For some time, just viewing things from my District, I have started to get the feeling that it's not a case of worrying about head winds but rather of building tail winds And after listening to the discussion yesterday, it sounds to me as if that's true to some extent around most of the country now For any of you who have ever tried either to pilot a light aircraft or sail a sailboat, you know that trying to steer with a tail wind is much more difficult and much more dangerous than with a head wind And if we let tail winds build up, where we wind up on the course is more problematic So, I think an adjustment now is appropriate I would come down on the side of 50 basis points even though Bill McDonough's argument about that being viewed as a one-time adjustment followed by the ""Fed on hold"" is interesting The other side of that would be that 25 basis points would be viewed clearly as the first of a series of moves And if the market quickly built in pricing and expectations of the next 25 basis point move, then the equilibrium rate would move at least as much as our move, implying de facto that we eased conditions relative to where the market is if it's ahead of us I don't know what the timing might be as to market expectations, but if it's a fairly short horizon--maybe no further out than the next FOMC meeting--we may find that 25 was not enough to restrain reserve growth and that we would have been better going 50, or will need to give them the other 25 fairly quickly I would also support Tom Melzer's suggestion about references to reserves and narrow money measures as contributing to why we think a move is appropriate at this time  Would your preference be for 25 basis points and symmetric language or 25 coupled with asymmetric?  Well, just to follow up My own preference is always going to be for symmetry, and what I would like to see done would be to do 25 now but with an understanding that there may be a conference call if conditions seem to warrant another 25 even before the March meeting  I'm willing to defer to your judgment on the market reaction, but the logic of that position is that if 50 basis points really would be the correct move except for constraints of the market, then once we've done the 25 basis points and overcome any concerns about market reaction we would come in with the second installment fairly promptly  What is your intention now for implementation?  A couple of questions, Don, about your table on page 8 I realize the risk of making too much out of these projections, but the first question relates to the Chairman's remarks about the ranges As I understand your M2 projection in the outer years, under all three of these alternatives M2 is in the upper, upper half of all of them, even the 1 to 5 percent That would assume that if we went to your alternative II, 0 to 4 percent for M2, we would at some point have to raise the range if the idea was to have the range center around what we would wind up with in equilibrium  -62-    2/3-4/94  When I look at your nominal GDP projections and the M2 out at the end of your projection, I notice your velocities are zero for all three It's the constraints that you impose; you've assumed that by that point--  Okay It struck me, when I looked at the top and the bottom of the federal funds rate projections for the out years and the top CPI projections, that you have under all three alternatives either 4 or 4-1/2 on the funds rate That means the funds rate--I don't like the words tighter and easier so I won't use them--on the less inflationary path is above the inflation rate  And even substantially above the nominal GNP In Street jargon, policy is becoming relatively more restrictive going forward in that the inflation rate and inflation expectations are coming down more than the nominal yield and you're leaving the funds rate above nominal GDP six years out  Well, there's no doubt the lack of credibility has effects on this But the last time we were running for a sustained period at 2 percent or less on the CPI--as in the period from 1997 through 1999--we had a lot lower short-term rates than you are suggesting here  I prefer the 1 to 5 percent range on M2 I don't have a clue about the debt number; I never did While in principle I prefer publishing not only the 1995 numbers but beyond that, I certainly wouldn't want to publish these numbers! [Laughter] I'd like us to publish CPI objectives out through 1999, but I sure don't like the numbers that are companions to them So, I'm stuck with saying Don't publish 1995 unless we come up with some better numbers! "
5206,1994-02-28," This is Jerry Jordan in Cleveland I agree with the analysis of the way forecasts feed additional new forecasts in the private sector Certainly, we have to backtrack to the way private sector analysts put their numbers together They use the fourth- quarter numbers plus whatever expectations they have about the first quarter after they account for the weather factor I think the revisions are going to be mainly in an upward direction To the extent that they think the first quarter is adversely affected by weather or the earthquake, they will simply push that growth to later in the year and overall they'll see 1994 as stronger than they previously projected just a few months ago And in that sense in a de facto way, our current policy stance is more expansionary than it was even before we acted when people had expectations about a less robust economy I do not see the benefits that come from having the other shoe hanging over the market We sort of tested that idea, and I don't see that we gained anything; it's still there And there's a risk as we go forth to the next meeting that the expectation will build that we will act at the time of that next meeting and maybe afterwards I don't know that that is constructive; this environment lends itself to a whole lot of rumoring and speculation and even of what could be perceived as leaks that are not healthy for us So I    2/28/94  wish we had gone ahead and done the full 1/2 point at the last meeting I would like us to go ahead and do the other 1/4 point now and not leave it until the next meeting I don't see what we're going to learn in the next three weeks that's going to change anything "
5222,1994-03-22," First, just a small item of clarification In your memorandum you say Canada's line would be increased to between C$1 billion and C$2 billion, but it is already C$2 billion so I assume--  Okay  Our own with Canada?  With regard to Mexico, I have very mixed feelings On the one hand, I have trouble with all the swap lines, their utilization, and the conditions I'm still not satisfied in my own mind as to what is or is not an appropriate use of swap lines per se And in that respect there is no reason to treat Mexico as a second class partner versus other countries; they are a very major trading partner of ours and I assume in the spirit of NAFTA there is a sense of bringing them into the big leagues Now, whether they really ought to be on the same level with the Germans and the Japanese I'm not so sure On the other hand, when I look at the utilization of our swap lines with Mexico in the past, it's a very troubling pattern It tends to occur at six-year intervals, including 1976, 1982, and 1988-- very questionable utilizations And now it's 1994 and I would predict that if we do this, the line is going to get used and we are going to have trouble saying no It might get used with a supplement even if we don't approve a permanent increase and there are going to be some very serious questions about the appropriate use of this facility in that kind of political environment  The questions I had in mind have been largely answered by your remarks just now and by Bill's remarks before, putting this matter into a broader context I think your remarks are extremely important The reason is that the way we conduct ourselves this year with regard to this issue and how that's viewed when it gets scrutinized by others could tell us a lot about whether this is or is not a desirable thing to do We need to know if it is accepted on Capitol Hill, at the Treasury, and by others subsequently  One other comment is that I'd be very careful about going too far with the linkage of the timing of this with other developments I think NAFTA was a wonderful development, as I'm sure everybody else does, and what the Mexicans are going to do on April 1st I think is terrific But I wouldn't want to link this too closely to that because I don't know whether Costa Rica or Chile or who will be next in line or when But to say that joining the free trade agreement and broadening participation in this sort of thing means that as soon as they make the central bank independent they can join the swap club is not a message we want out there  I attended my first meeting of this Committee two years ago at the March meeting Over those two years I've been tracking the migration of the staff forecasts on nominal and real GDP, prices, and so on meeting to meeting And at my first meeting in March of 1992, the projections for 1993 that the staff had at that time were for lower inflation than is now forecast for 1995 We started getting forecasts of inflation for 1994 in August of 1993 and through March of 1994 the forecasts for 1994 were below the current forecasts for 1995 And now I look at the forecast that we have for 1995 and this trend of inflation in the out years revising upward worries me If it's causal, then maybe I ought to leave the Committee and these forecasts will go back down again!  In trying to understand this and how you make assumptions about policy that go into putting together the forecasts, Mike, you've said in the past that you try to read what the Committee is saying and thinking with regard to its objective, in order to try and ascertain a policy consistent with achieving that objective So I went back through last year's Greenbooks to review the comments with regard to inflation, and what caused me to do this was something that was missing from this Greenbook Beginning in March of 1993 the Greenbook's statements with regard to inflation were as follows ""we expect it to slow over the forecast period;"" in May of 1993, ""resumption of disinflationary progress;"" in June, ""lead to some further disinflation;"" in August, ""tempering inflation expectations and downward pressure on wages and price inflation;"" in September, ""disinflation trends reemerged;"" in November, ""further progress reducing core inflation;"" in December, ""progress toward price stability;"" and in January of 1994, ""movement over time toward price stability"" None of that type of phrase appeared in this one In fact this one, very pointedly I thought, shifted instead to ""holding on a track consistent with containment of inflationary pressures"" Is that a deliberate, very significant shift, or maybe a new reading of what this Committee has as its objectives?  Before commenting on the District, I want to report on the presentation I heard yesterday on small businesses I think most of you know the National Federation of Small Businesses has over 600,000 members I normally don't pay too much attention to their surveys, which they do once a month, but I was struck by the extraordinary upward movement in a number of indicators recently Most of the indicators started to turn either in July or by October and they have moved quite sharply As an indication of the thinking of these small businesses the levels are quite impressive Planned capital outlays are the highest since 1989 and 1990; job openings are the highest since 1989; plans to hire are the highest since 1990; and plans to raise prices are the highest since 1991 With regard to the general outlook for business conditions, the response chosen was that now is as good a time as any since early 1990 I have no idea about the statistical reliability of that survey, but I thought it was so upbeat across the board that it was notable  Turning to the District, everything there also tends to be uniformly positive; in fact, it would be hard to find something that stands out in our District that is of a negative nature What is interesting to me is what is not there A year ago, I was still hearing, and I think many of you were hearing, a lot of talk about anemic recovery, sluggish pace, use of the term ""recovery"" more than ""expansion,"" and worry about its sustainability That's completely absent in the commentary I'm hearing now The talk is more about how much more up side there is There was another question in the small business survey about various concerns the firms had taxes, regulations, and so on A couple of years ago one of the highest concerns was demand for their products, and that has pretty much dropped out of what is being reported now And that's consistent with what I'm hearing in the District In the Greenbook, it was said that motor vehicles production would add 1-1/2 percentage points to growth in the first quarter, but that that stepped-up production is transitory and would be fully reversed in the second quarter That's not what we are hearing in our District The auto companies in Ohio and our part of Kentucky are not indicating in their reports to us that a drop-off is imminent Maybe that has something to do with seasonality; I don't know  On the national level, I have the same kinds of concerns that Al Broaddus expressed about the use of higher real interest rates both in the Greenbook and in Mike's presentation To say that we are counting on higher real interest rates to damp aggregate demand and then try to talk about what we mean by these higher real interest rates just doesn't square with past experience Normally, we wouldn't expect in partial analysis a steeper yield curve to be associated with a less expansionary monetary policy In fact, the contrary We normally would expect that as an expansion matures, the yield curve would naturally flatten and very often invert before we get to the end of the expansion To say that we have moved to a much steeper yield curve recently and, therefore, policy is more restrictive, I think  -28-    3/22/94  needs more explanation If we say that the run-up in interest rates is too big to be explained by an upward revision of inflation expectations over 10 years to 30 years, we have a similar problem of saying that the expected real return to real productive capital over the next two to three decades has been revised up by 80 to 100 basis points So what we wind up with is that we are using the term real rate to include things other than real rates of return to real productive capital, mainly risk And we really ought to make three separate distinctions there the inflation premium, what really is a real rate in one sense, and what is simply a risk premium that may be fostered by people's concerns about policies, political developments, and whatever else And that's a different way of looking at things than you were telling us  Don, in the early part of your remarks, you made reference to the credibility of the Committee's commitment to, you used the word, ""contain"" inflation, and later in your remarks you said, ""to contain inflationary pressures or to reduce them further, if that is your objective"" So, again, you were using the words that Mike used earlier in his remarks about containing inflation, and I don't know what happened to the rhetoric about the objective of reducing inflation, a route moving toward price stability If it's the staff's interpretation that this Committee has changed its long- term objective based on what we submitted in the February meeting, then I think maybe in our May meeting we ought to schedule a discussion as to what are the long-term objectives of this Committee to give you guidance as to what kind of policy input we need  Did I read too much into your expression ""or to reduce further, if that is the Committee's objective""? It sounds to me as if you are doubting that that is our objective  Thank you With regard to the early part of your remarks, I agree very much that we need to think differently about what influences the purchasing power of money It has never made sense to me to think that growth per se reduces the purchasing power of money That's really a phenomenon of the last few decades, when we got into this notion of demand management, which I have increasing trouble with as the way to think about how monetary policy or fiscal policy influence the purchasing power of money Of course, I have a lot of problems with Phillips curves and gap or slack type models When we think about individual sectors of the economy, agriculture being the most notable, if we have a spontaneous increase in output--what we would call bumper crops or economists would call an exogenous increase--that reduces prices of agricultural products That's true, really, with most sectors of the economy Otherwise we call it a productivity increase--something we can't explain is called a productivity increase That's the nature of a capitalist system; that's what you would expect to happen in the market economy That is, the inherent resiliency to expand, removing the depressing forces, does not mean per se that the purchasing power of money should erode at a faster rate  That view says to me that we don't want asymmetry if there is a possibility that asymmetry would trigger an action related to growth because it would characterize this Committee as basically not liking growth We see the economy growing fast, and therefore we are going to react against that; I have a lot of problem with that I thought Mike Kelley's remark about caution in interpreting where we are was very useful; it's very worthwhile to think about that Mistakes are  -48-    3/22/94  made in conducting monetary policy Occasionally, somebody has to say ""Oops"" We know that's going to happen; policy mistakes will be made So it comes down to a question of which mistakes we find most easy to correct or least damaging to the economy once we realize that we have made a mistake That's similar to the comments that Ed Boehne was making about where the risks are If we assume that the economy is on a satisfactory path now, a gliding path toward some notion of its capacity and inflation is not accelerating and later we find out we were wrong, that is a very costly thing to correct Whereas if we assume that we have stayed too easy too long and we need to move very quickly to get to this ideal neutral policy stance, and we find out we were wrong, that's a relatively easier thing for us to correct, politically and in other ways  In a world where we do not have monetary aggregates to guide us as to the thrust of monetary policy actions, we are kind of groping around just trying to characterize where the stance is I don't know where neutral is But if I were out in the northern part of Gary Stern's District, I wouldn't know where the border between Canada and the United States is For that matter if I were in a sailboat in the middle of Lake Erie, I wouldn't know where the border is located But that doesn't mean that it's not a very useful idea to think that there is a border there And it's a useful idea to think that there is such a thing as a neutral policy stance I feel very strongly that we are nowhere near a neutral stance and that we ought to be aggressive in moving toward it The only way I would be comfortable with 25 basis points is if I were assured that it was going to be accompanied by an action of the Board on the discount rate Absent that, I think it would be a mistake to go 25 basis points at this time And I think it would be a mistake to go to asymmetric in any case  I support the subcommittee's recommendation And I think the latter part of Tom Melzer's remarks are right on We could say that this is twice in a row, that it's not permanent and it's just not a precedent, and that we have still have a card to play and we might not do this in the future Nobody would believe it  Are we going to have that package by May? Otherwise, we are going to be faced with maybe three meetings in a row of saying that this is a temporary procedure and it's not--  It's eight weeks until the next FOMC meeting It's the longest period we experience between meetings  Yes "
5275,1994-05-17," This is really a follow-up question A coordinated intervention like the one in which we participated on May 4 carries with it the message that there was communication taking place about fundamentals Everybody knows there was intervention with coordination Can you share with us what the nature of that communication was among the central banks and ministries of finance, and whether the market correctly perceived what that communication was about?  I assume that market participants don't know the magnitude of the intervention I don't know how well they can guess at those things, but when I saw the amount that the Germans did and a statement by Mr Issing, I read that as a lack of enthusiasm for the business  There was a press commentary after the May 4 action--I don't remember its precise contents--but people in the Treasury and in the Administration more generally supposedly viewed the action as an alternative to domestic monetary policy actions  Before February when we started to announce our actions, it was standard practice in the daily program to protest a federal funds rate move away from the intended rate, maybe sometimes going against what you saw as the reserve needs of the current maintenance period Since February we've announced our decisions three times, but in monitoring the Call over the eight weeks since the March meeting there were at least a couple of occasions where it appeared that you still needed to protest a rate to indicate that policy had not changed even in the absence of an announcement It sounded like the Street still thinks that there is a possibility that we could change the funds target without announcing the change and therefore your daily program still has to account for that Is that right? And what would help to clarify the situation for you?  Are there still people out there who think we might change the intervention level on the funds rate without an announcement?  If they've come to believe that all increases in the funds rate will be accompanied by an announcement, then the absence of an announcement would seem to lessen the need to protest A protest action would occur if you saw a need to drain reserves but you felt you had to add reserves because the funds rate was too high Shouldn't the absence of an announcement, which would indicate that the funds rate target has not changed, have the same effect as your protest move? When you do your protest move you're going to have to wind up taking more back out than you otherwise would  Well, what's the difference between our failure to issue a press release and a protest action by the Desk?  I would hope that over time one of the benefits of announcing would be the leeway to allow the funds rate to move on a daily basis over a little wider range without worrying about an incorrect perception of current policy  First, to follow-up on Bob Parry's question about the inflation statistics, the first four months of 1993 were initially reported as averaging 43 percent We use a thing that we call the median CPI as an alternative to the CPI less food and energy to try to monitor what these numbers are telling us as the year unfolds We were getting 36 percent for those first four months versus the official 43 percent Now that they've revised the seasonals, they're reporting the first four months of last year at 34 percent; that brought it back close to where we were For the first four months of this year, we're getting 29 versus the 23 percent    5/17/94  So as an exercise as to what the seasonals did, I had the staff apply last year's seasonal factors to the first four months of this year, and that would have produced a 31 percent rate for those months, the same range as where the median is That tells me that 8 would have to be redistributed over the subsequent eight months of the year if we were still operating with the last year's seasonals Now, I don't know whether the new seasonals are truth or not, but I do know that other things the same in the raw component, the final eight months of the year will have a higher inflation rate, and I don't know which months the seasonals stole from But it biases me toward saying that it's more likely for higher inflation numbers to get reported rather than lower from this point  Right, I don't disagree; it's closer to the median, though  Well, I think that the median and the so-called ""core"" track very well, within a couple of tenths, most of the time and furthermore over longer periods of time the median and the actual CPI come out to be virtually identical, but the median for these four months currently is running 29, and I have more confidence in that than I do in the 23 that was reported for the first four months because the core is 27 for those months  Well, not quite because remember last year we got the dip in the latter months of year as initially reported; those got revised, too If the median is telling the truth and we have had four months of 23 and it's really going to average out 29 over the year, then it's going to have to be running a few months up in the range of 33 to 34 We just have to expect that that's the way the numbers will work out This is not saying what's right or wrong but that this is the way the statistics were kept  The other question is about the Greenbook I try hard to assess what I think about the economy versus what the Greenbook says and use the latter as a starting point to understand the logic of how policy plays into the numbers that you provide us with And I have gotten sort of comfortable with the familiar reversion pattern that whatever happens--the surprises in the fourth-quarter of 1993 and the  -10-    5/17/94  fourth-quarter of 1992 were on the up side but we had a weak first half of last year--there's a tendency for real output to revert over some period or horizon to some idea of potential capacity And that goes in both directions; it's symmetrical The CPI projections tend to revert to something under 3 percent out there someplace, so that gives us nominal As I read this Greenbook the logic of the policy linkages seemed to be clear, but I want your response on two things One, am I getting it right? Second, where is the vulnerability? That is, increases in short-term interest rates hold down, you say, bond and equity prices which in turn influence real output, namely investment spending including residential and nonresidential investment spending And as people see the effects of that long rate on output, that influences inflation expectations as the economy converges on potential, and that finally influences what actual CPI inflation turns out to be So is that a correct characterization of the linkages and, if so, where is it vulnerable?  Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District is performing in a fashion much more similar to the Seventh District than the Third District It's a pattern of fairly uniform strengths that are getting stronger The ag sector is looking forward to a third very good year overall It's early to tell whether they will meet that expectation, but they've had two good years and there certainly is a lot of optimism in the ag sector and the ag banks In processed foods especially, capacity is up a lot One county on the western side of Ohio reports an increase of 7 million ""layers"" in the past year--turkey processing plants That means a lot of new capacity  Motor vehicle plants are going flat out, and a lot of them are running above what would be sustainable long-run capacity But a lot of new capital spending is occurring, a very significant amount by the major manufacturers That is adding a lot of optimism to people's assessment of the current situation Capital goods overall are booming; and the return of the machine tool industry, notably the higher value, high-tech end, is especially encouraging to people in such major communities as Lexington, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh; all are reporting that the high-tech firms are doing quite well The one sector that I would note where there is consistent weakness and talk about layoffs or cutting back is health care We have some very large health care operations in the District, and they continue to be pessimistic  I might note a couple of anecdotal things that need to be paid attention to going forward One is the continued strike at Allegheny Ludlum Steel; they've been on strike since before Easter This is a governance kind of issue Management is saying that they are going to see this through and tends to talk in terms of months rather than days or weeks before it is settled It's important nationally because they provide the stainless components for the exhaust systems for General Motors There is no alternative  -22-    5/17/94  domestically at this time General Motors has indicated that they are now preparing to go to Japanese stainless steel by month end if they can get it The other alternative would be to go to carbon steel components and promise buyers that they will subsequently recall the vehicles and put in the stainless components GM says that they are not going to shut down production based on this labor stoppage The other thing that stainless steel is critical for is transformers and electric power operations There are no alternative sources So, Allegheny Ludlum has--  Yes, and it's a tough one for us, and it's adding a degree of pessimism to the Pittsburgh area especially The other more or less anecdotal report relates to residential housing What we are hearing in the District is that the problem is not the cost or availability of funds but the cost and availability of building materials The Ohio Trade Council Union has become a developer of medium- and low-income housing and  complains about escalating costs of production and that is what he sees as the source of inflation, not the cost of funds  Turning to the national economy, my reading is certainly influenced by conditions in the District It's not a question of encountering any kind of head winds; rather, it's the buildup of tail winds that I think is of increasing concern I no longer feel that it's a case of simply backing further off the accelerator but that we may have to start contemplating tapping on the brakes fairly soon I don't know where neutral is, but I think that we are well shy of a neutral policy and getting there may not be enough The Greenbook projections depend critically in my assessment on the deceleration of nominal GDP growth It's the nominal spending where I have my concerns rather than the decomposition of that into its real and price components In 1992 we had growth of over 6-1/2 percent for the full four-quarter period and that was more than had been expected There was some deceleration in 1993, even with the robust fourth quarter, thanks to the weakness in the first half of the year, but growth for the year still was 5-1/2 percent Growth this year is looking like another 5 to 5-1/2 percent But for the forecast to work, it is important for nominal GDP to decelerate to under 4-1/2 percent in the next 18 months I don't see what will make that happen I have no confidence that the kind of policy assumptions in the Greenbook or the linkage of working through long-term bond yields are going to produce that deceleration of nominal GDP The way I now tend to think about where we are is not that we are entering the fourth year of the expansion, but rather that we are someplace in the first year of a classic expansion As it looks to me, the period of about 2 or 2-1/2 years after the end of the Gulf War was one of economic restructuring in a lot of sectors and a lot of regions The talk about it being an anemic recovery was because it wasn't a recovery, in a sense, but rather a period of restructuring Some time during the course of last year we entered into what would be more of a classical recovery from recession If that interpretation is right, then we should be thinking in terms of a year to six quarters of 5 to 6 percent real GDP growth Yet, most of us are saying that we don't see that the economy has the capacity to handle that many quarters with 5 or 6 percent real  -23-    5/17/94  GDP growth without way overshooting If that's an accurate assessment of where we are, then monetary policy is well behind the curve  Don, I read the Bluebook as saying a 4-1/2 percent funds rate is neutral and here's an attempt to produce that kind of policy stance All of your commentary was in terms of the ""C"" versus ""D"" alternatives, a 1/4 point versus a 1/2 point increase You didn't discuss the pros and cons of going immediately to 4-1/2 percent, assuming that that is a neutral policy stance, nor did you discuss the possibility that 4-1/2 percent is too low rather than too high A lot of your remarks were in terms of ""Well, we're not sure it's 4-1/2 percent; it might be 4-1/4 percent and there's even a possibility it might be 5, 5-1/2 or 6 percent"" Even if we went to 4-1/2 percent immediately, or in the next six months, and if there were no movement at all in bond yields, no effect at all, you'd still  -30-    5/17/94  have 300 basis points between the funds rate and long rates What historical experience would lead you to believe that a 300 basis points upward slope in the yield curve is a neutral monetary policy?  Your initial remarks I think are very important We can learn a fair amount if we think more about what's going on with relative yields Normally when we think about a relative move it's either by quality spreads, by currency denomination, or by maturity At one time I studied the behavior of interest rates in periods of crisis atmosphere relating to an international event Suez, the Bay of Pigs Cuban missile crisis, the Yom Kippur War, Iraq in 1990, and so on The yield curve always steepens very sharply as portfolio managers shorten their horizons As the uncertainty dissipates the yield curve flattens That's quite different from the cyclical behavior of the yield curve as an expansion matures I think that we're closer to conditions of 1978 than we are to some other historical episodes In April 1978 President Carter said that there was no danger that excess demand would spill over and raise prices just when the latter were about to explode And through 1974, 1975, and 1976, as you recall, the economy was fairly tranquil; wages were fairly well behaved Some of this started to change a little in 1977, but nobody saw it coming At least I certainly didn't The Administration had misread the situation in 1978 because they looked at things like wages; they looked at a lot of things and said there was no problem with inflation, and they were wrong They never saw it coming And I'm concerned that we may be wrong again It struck me in the go-around earlier that at least some of you looking at the world from inside the beltway--Governors Kelley, LaWare, and Phillips --have a different feel of the economy than what I sense from the other twelve of us Certainly I thought this was a marked difference, and I'm not sure quite what to make of that  I'm not troubled with the idea of saying we're at neutral and we're on hold If a very powerful move had to be made, we would act anyway None of us is going to know in advance whether any 25 basis point difference is significant or not, whether it's to 4-1/4 or 4-1/2 or 4-3/4 percent But to me it's quite different to say we're at 4-1/2 percent and we think that it's just as likely the next move is down as up sometime out in the future Being neutral implies an equal probability that the next move will be down as up; we never know this If this group walks out of here today saying we're at 4-1/4 percent and most people's commentary is, as it has been after the last couple of meetings, that we've got more to go, I would find that troubling  -37-    5/17/94  I would much rather if everybody walked out and said we're at 4-1/4 percent and we don't know whether the next move will be down or up To me that's a lot different than the majority of people responding in the weeks ahead, as we get queries about this, saying ""Well, we're not quite at neutral; we've got more to go"" That adds uncertainty to the bond market that I don't view as constructive I would rather have a stronger statement that we don't know when we're going to move again and if we do, it might be down or up If people are not comfortable with that 4-1/4 percent, let's go to 4-1/2 percent and do a full point on the discount rate I'd rather do more than less "
5299,1994-07-05," I can agree with everything the Vice Chairman and the Chairman just said and still feel uncomfortable with this particular operation Let me first ask Peter a follow-up question to the response he gave to Governor Lindsey about the 100 level on the yen and a floor and so on Now, the rate is something under 99 and the market is still functioning Is there another number that's magic?  Part of the reason I asked the question was that one of the things that troubles me is taking action because of a psychological barrier The market participants now say, well okay, that level is not going to come back again, so as far as magic numbers--  But Peter argued it wasn't our view or even the Treasury's Rather this was in the minds of the participants in the market  That was creating this situation that forced our hand And if it was, we might call it irrational  Focusing on your reference to market participants, the magic number, and psychological aspects, I want to follow-up on something that Al Broaddus was referring to--the perception of success or failure In a technical sense, it doesn't matter to me whether you sell $800 million of assets denominated in yen and deutschemarks and Joan Lovett rather mechanically buys assets denominated in US dollars of the same amount in order to maintain the funds rate So, what happens is that the Fed is just going to make the portfolio substitution But people don't see Joan's actions; they see your actions Suppose the perception is that our objective was to influence the rate--that we had a price objective and were trying to prevent the dollar from falling further or to cause it to rise, not trying to do something as Governor Blinder mentioned about disorderly markets But the dollar now is not consistent with the objective If we have a repetition of those, it makes the Federal Reserve look impotent because markets see what Peter does but they do not see what Joan does And if we have several of those over a period, our image of being able to influence markets will be tarnished  I have a couple of questions for Mike In your initial oral presentation, you remarked on the role of long-term interest rates at current levels in maintaining growth of real economic activity in line with the economy's potential You might recall that we had a discussion at the May meeting about the linkages in the model of short rates to long rates to residential and nonresidential investment, measures of aggregate demand, inflation and inflation expectations In this month's Greenbook, on page I-2 of part I relating to key assumptions, that same idea is back again I want to see if I understand what this says The sentence I want to focus on says that ""maintenance of adequate overall financial  -14-    7/5-6/94  restraint,"" and I take that to mean long-term interest rates, ""thus seems likely to require at least some further tightening of money market conditions"" That says that the fed funds rate is the target and long-term bond yields are the indicator of the thrust of policy actions Am I correct in interpreting this to mean that if we were to maintain the current funds rate, long-term bond yields would fall, possibly significantly?  Well, I guess I am more puzzled than before!  But a liquidity premium can come out from either end of the yield curve, and you're trying to stay away from saying that if we don't raise the funds rate, long-term rates will fall or that the yield curve flattened from the long end because of the short rate But at the May meeting, there was a lot of discussion about a 4-1/4 versus 4-1/2 percent funds rate, policy neutrality and all of this, and some uncertainty about that Now, we have a much stronger statement in both the Greenbook and Bluebook that policy neutrality is 5-1/4 percent What changed between May and now that it went from some uncertainty as to whether it is 4-1/4 or 4-1/2, and now it is 5-1/4 percent?  I can comment on a number of things in the District that might add to what has been said so far Generally,  -31-    7/5-6/94  people feel that the District economy is stronger than before and better than some people were projecting earlier I have no conviction at all as to whether this is even a coincident indicator, let alone a leading indicator A regular recently completed quarterly survey of almost 500 businesses in the District indicated that 42 percent of the companies expect to hire full-time permanent workers this year versus 33 percent when that survey was previously taken; 43 percent now said they are going to increase capital outlays; 37 percent said that earlier  Energy used by the industrial sector is said to be booming by one of our companies, up very sharply in the first half Some segments like cement are up 35 percent, while nonresidential construction is flat Overall, residential activity is up in the District, and we continue to hear anecdotal comments about shortages of skilled workers and certain kinds of supplies My contacts tell me that lumber prices appeared to have stabilized, but copper is so volatile that builders can't get firm bids on electrical work for future projects Various aspects of communications are quite strong Firms in the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Lexington areas claim to be operating at capacity levels and increasing employment One director referred to explosive growth in the high-tech area Throughout the District, though, medical care is down, and that's a big segment of the Pittsburgh area economy; it's large but relatively not as large in Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland Our contacts in medical care all say that they are shrinking their payrolls That was really the only sector that was cited as being weak Interestingly, contacts in eastern and central Kentucky say that conditions are the best in over a decade, and they're talking about planning to do away with coal dependency and produce other things, especially wood products given the problems in the Northwest, and interestingly poultry Western Ohio and Indiana have done so well on poultry that Kentucky people have decided to enter into the glut of chickens, eggs, and turkeys  We visited a Toyota plant outside Lexington, in the Georgetown area They are going to add a new model to their production line They employ 5,200 workers now and are going to add another 800 by year-end They say their biggest problem is that the workers have to commute 1-1/2 to 2 hours to the plant because there simply is no housing and no schooling in and around the Lexington area close to where they work Also in the Lexington area, people say that apparel is booming, that it's easy to raise prices, and that several thousand workers have been recalled  There were a lot of reports of price increases in the District I don't have any sense that they have anything to do with inflation, but still people talk about prices going up The coating business people said that their backlog is at an all-time high and getting even longer They have seven-day, 24-hour operations for the first time ever, and they put through chemical price increases on intermediate products of up to 9 percent on July 1 The strike at Allegheny Ludlum that I reported on before has ended They settled on a package of four years with a total increase increase in compensation of 11 percent plus profit sharing The manager said he is running his operations quickly back almost to capacity Demand for his products, both domestic and foreign, is very strong He said exports of specialty steel to China, India, and Poland are growing very rapidly He was looking for price increases of anywhere from 5 to 9 percent for  -32-    7/5-6/94  the balance of this year He complains about the rules that give the government veto power over his business Plastics also are reported to be the strongest in six to seven years, with record orders especially for equipment for plastic manufacturing That applies mostly to plastics used for medical supplies and appliances They also are talking about their ability to raise prices later on I got contrasting reports from auto parts suppliers One supplier, representing a huge company that operates worldwide, was berating me because he said that I didn't understand that it was global capacity that was preventing increases in the prices of their products Another almost as large company said it was very easy to raise prices sharply because of the level of the dollar and the related fact that domestic auto companies and transplants were regaining domestic market share He was talking about his need to pass through higher input prices--chemicals, metals, etc He thought he could do it; other contacts thought he couldn't  On the national outlook and the Greenbook, I had a lot of problems with the inflation projection--I guess this spills over into the Bluebook discussion for tomorrow--that the 3 or 31 percent inflation rate in the staff forecast continues into the next millennium because it seems to me that the basic model is consistent with a constant rate of inflation That sort of analysis says that whatever the rate of inflation is at the time the economy hits the NAIRU, that is then the inflation rate we live with forever unless we are willing to cause unemployment by raising interest rates To me the projected inflation numbers that we are looking at--whether or not they reflect reliable model results--should be unacceptable to this Committee if we are going to maintain the wording in the directive that our objective is to move toward price stability When I submitted my projections for 1994 and 1995, I took literally the instruction that they should be based on what would be an appropriate monetary policy It seems to me that an appropriate monetary policy objective should be one that leads to a lower rate of inflation And so that's what I submitted  I was going to ask whether this is the time to talk about the 1995 and 1996 projections, or will you have a separate go-around about that later?  In principle, I would be in favor of publishing information on the inflation objectives out to 1998 But if a forecast of higher inflation is what we are going to produce, again, I am in favor of not even publishing 1995 I think it is a mistake for this Committee to put out numbers saying that we expect the inflation rate to go up in the context of what we think is an appropriate monetary policy--one that will result in higher inflation in 1995 than in 1994 The central tendency of our forecasts also has 1995 unemployment above where it is currently So, we have both rising inflation and rising unemployment in 1995, let alone 1996 I don't think we ought to be putting out those kinds of numbers I am pleased that our 1994 forecasts are below where the Committee collectively thought they were going to be in February on both inflation and unemployment But from here on, we see things getting worse in both respects I don't see why we would want to announce that  Yes The numbers are as Don indicated  That is right  I wouldn't change them and I don't see what is wrong with letting the journalists write stories about debt If they want to write the stories about the governors having green peas for lunch on Thursdays and that is the key to monetary policy, I don't see the harm in that They have to fill up the space anyway So I don't see a problem  I really don't care about the debt aggregate  In fact, could I say one thing? I'll speak for myself, but I think it does reflect the mood of the Committee and the actions we have been taking since February With regard to 1996, had we not been moving this year so far in the way that we have to establish our current policy stance, by late this year and 1995 inflation would probably be worse and inflation psychology would have been escalating sharply, necessitating a policy response of such a magnitude that it would have depressed output and raised unemployment in 1996  Right, and characterizing 1996 The uncertainty about 1996 is the effectiveness of our actions in 1994 If we are successful in what we are doing in 1994, then we are going to have higher output and lower unemployment in 1996 And that is the difficulty in giving them a forecast of what 1996 is going to do  Thank you I agree we shouldn't act on the basis of strictly international considerations because ultimately the foreign international market's purchasing power for currencies is going to reflect what we are doing domestically I don't have a sense that within the marketplace today the problems we are seeing in the international markets are the result of concerns about future domestic purchasing power If I thought the source of the dollar's weakness was the US inflation problem, then I would feel differently I would not want international developments to be a constraint if I thought a policy move was the right thing to do for domestic reasons, but right now I don't see that domestic reasons call for a move And I agree that if we needed to move in support of the dollar, it would have to be a very, very large move  The story that Bill McDonough told last night at the UK embassy dinner about the deflation in Japan is correct, important, and needs to be developed more fully It's partly the curse of double- entry bookkeeping They have a huge current account surplus, yet they have a large number of banks and institutional investors trying to repatriate capital This creates problems that have a price effect That is not going to go away, and I don't know where it's going to settle down It's going to keep coming back over and over again We need to try to get people to understand that the politics of Japan as well as a lot of forces at work in that country are going to result in a turning inward and a need for domestic investment,  Yes  I don't think you can answer in part because you need to know more fully what is happening on the trade side Japan as we know is one of these economies where the net value added is all labor inputs because they import everything else So their imports of raw materials, energy, and all of that give you the price effect of a lower dollar I find that a very difficult story to unwind, but I don't think it's going to end soon I don't know if the yen will go to 90 or 80, but I think we need to articulate the story that this is not a problem of the United States nor a concern about our inflation and our other economic problems as much as this is about Japan  Regarding our policies, I expect to see some bad CPI numbers during the second half of this year I have no reason to disagree with the Greenbook on that We talked about this before If the staff is right that the CPI less food and energy is going to come out around 3 percent or so this year as the Greenbook specifies, we are going to run into several months with the CPI getting up in the range of 3-1/2 to 4 percent annual rate And that being the case, there probably will be adverse market reactions to the superficial reporting of those numbers If we are going to act at some time in the second half of this year, I would much prefer to see our actions coincide with adverse price developments rather than strong real numbers, whether it's employment or output or industrial production or anything else It would take a couple of months of bad CPI numbers to make a case for saying we need to act to show our resolve to bring the inflation trend back down again That says to me that before the August meeting, we are unlikely to have conditions that I would think would trigger such a move So, I would be inclined to stay where we are at the moment I would not be inclined to go asymmetric I wouldn't dissent against asymmetric, but I'd prefer to stay symmetric with the expectation that we will reassess the economy in August and see how the price numbers develop  As for the announcement, I think Ed's point is right Had we previously set forth what our policies were, we might get away with no announcement at all if we had said that that was what we were going to do But under the circumstances, I think we have no choice but to put something out this afternoon "
5339,1994-08-16," Mike, I'm interested in your confidence levels for various parts of the forecast Where are the surprises likely to be? If one starts a year ago, in your assessment in August and September as to the year ahead, at that point one of the things you talked about was a middling expansion and maintenance of the low interest rates necessary to support it You were more optimistic about long rates coming down than was the marketplace Your forecast for growth wasn't that much different in real terms than the Blue Chip or others, but you had more confidence on inflation and long rates What's happened since is that we had a lot more real growth, a lot more employment growth, and a much different structure of interest rates, yet your inflation forecast has come out very close What happened to inflation in between has been very close to what you were saying a year ago it was going to be even though the other circumstances associated with that inflation didn't obtain If you now project out a year from now, what in your thinking is the most likely vulnerability of the forecast and where do you think the surprises are going to be--on the real side or the inflation side?  We contacted some of the retail operations headquartered or having significant operations in the Fourth District and asked them about inventory situations Basically, the pattern was that everything is okay said they had only a very small rise in their national operation inventories and it was all intentional; they felt they entered the third quarter on plan had a very large increase because they said they were operating too far below desired inventories, and they now feel that they are only slightly below They entered the second quarter 11 percent below where they wanted to be, and after a very large buildup and good sales, their inventories are only slightly below where they want them to be said that they wanted to have a big inventory buildup, but they didn't get as much as they wanted because sales growth turned out to be stronger than they had expected--in the double-digit range  had a more modest increase in inventories, about 4 percent, and feel that they are comfortable So, we got no negative stories from the retail side on inventories The steel sector is quite strong They put through a 5 percent price increase at the beginning of July and it has held They are now looking for a further 3 percent increase in the first quarter They are operating basically with a 90-day delivery schedule and running at capacity Nonresidential construction is picking up and that is helping to push up steel demand as well Companies are saying that those construction managers that are able to compete in the dollar-based foreign market, mainly Latin  -20-    8/16/94  America and Asia, are getting significant increases in construction contract awards, and that is helping exports also, especially capital goods Overall, capital goods and machine tools are quite good, both domestically and exports Residential construction is characterized as having leveled off in most of the District, but at good levels of activity  The bankers talk about big increases in C&I loans--double- digit increases Some of that is inventory financing; some of it is business expansion; but they also report that consumer and mortgage lending has dropped sharply Smaller banking companies increasingly talk about being loaned out, and the bigger banks are happy to hear the small banks say that As Bob Forrestal reported for the Southeast, we had an advisory council meeting a couple weeks ago involving a variety of companies from all over the District and the same kind of stories was coming from all of them about the difficulty of hiring unskilled or semi-skilled workers Companies that provide temporary workers said they have a lot of available positions that nobody applies for On the other hand, upper-end positions--one company said that they were looking for a new chief financial officer, and they got 300 applicants They also were looking for truck drivers and warehouse workers and got virtually no applicants; maybe the financial types ought to drive trucks High-tech employment continues to be reported up, offset by healthcare employment which continues to decline in the major metropolitan areas  Regarding the Greenbook and the Blue Chip forecast, the Blue Chip is higher for the next year, as it typically is, for nominal GDP, real GDP, inflation, and interest rates All I can say is that I hope they are wrong on some parts of their forecasts and I hope the Greenbook is wrong I am still troubled by the idea that increased employment or increased output causes inflation I think if you went back a year ago and took most of the forecasts, whether it is the Greenbook or the Blue Chip or the Wall Street Journal forecast, and if they had forecast the job growth and output growth that we have had, they would have said we were going to have a lot more inflationary pressure than we have seen This idea that we need to see a slowdown in the growth of output and jobs in order to avoid price increases--I am very skeptical of that  When we look at the relationship between the narrower monetary aggregates and the opportunity costs--the Board staff occasionally gives us a chart on this using M1 and we can do the same thing with monetary base measures and so on--a year ago we were in a situation where the historical relationship was holding up very well Looking ahead, we had four possibilities the historical relationship that simply stopped functioning; a 25 percent drop in intermediate- and long-term interest rates--that didn't happen; the other two possibilities were a sharp acceleration in nominal GDP growth or a sharp drop in narrow money growth We had actually a combination of those The historical relation today still holds; there is simply nothing that has broken down Now we have a very sharp deceleration in reserve growth, the monetary base, and M1, and with the kind of interest rate increases we already have had let alone any further increases, that leaves me with a feeling that we may be closer to our idea of neutral than some of the other comments that I'm hearing would imply I think that the question of whether we have moved early and substantially isn't as easy to answer as one might think I happen to  -21-    8/16/94  think that the National Bureau's timing of July, 1990 as the cyclical peak was simply wrong, and that without the Gulf War, we might not even have had what qualifies in the usual sense as a contraction or recession Much of the last three years, four years now, has been a period of, first, the Gulf War and then this restructuring phenomenon Then coming off a level of 3 percent federal funds with the kind of inflation that we are experiencing, a 125 basis point increase is substantial in what in a different way of thinking is an early phase of the cycle  Don, I interpret the recommendations you make vis-a-vis the arguments that go with it as implying disagreement with  -28-    8/16/94  the Greenbook The reason I say that is because if you accept the Greenbook projections--the output and the inflation numbers through 1995--the objectives of the Committee and the logic that we are at or close to capacity and the NAIRU and that a 5-1/4 percent funds rate is neutral in the sense of maintaining the inflation rate let alone bringing it down, that would lead you to recommend 100 basis points today, and you don't do that  I came in on the fence between ""B"" and ""D"" I never did like ""C"" for the reasons that you described I'm not at all convinced that the 100 basis points is ultimately necessary My staff is more convinced, I guess along with the Board's staff, than I am, and I think going 50 basis points now with the kind of package you are talking about reduces the probability that ultimately we will have to go the full 100 basis points And so for that reason I support the 50 basis points "
5363,1994-09-27," Joan, for most of this year I have been trying to understand the behavior of the yield curve, in particular the part between the 1-year and 2-year maturities After our February action, we saw a sharp steepening over the next several weeks between the 1-year and the 2-year rates After the mid-August tightening action, we saw a complete pass-through initially on the short end--everything shifted up--without the 2-year moving In fact, we even got a rally from the 2-year maturity on out So we got a flattening of the yield curve between one year and two years Now it has widened back out again to the point that last Friday we had a 100 basis point spread between the 1-year bill and the 2-year note So, the 1-year rate, one year forward, is 7-1/2 percent I look at that and shrug my shoulders I don't know what to make of that discontinuity in the yield curve From 2 years out to 30 years I don't see anything odd about the yield curve; under one year I don't see anything odd But I can't make sense out of the 1-year to 2-year sector Can you?  The District economy is quite strong overall In fact, there really isn't an area or sector of the District that I would call weak Tourism has been very good; maybe it's a spillover from New York, I don't know, but everybody talks about having had a record year of tourism, especially in northeast and northwest Ohio Agriculture had its third good year in a row, which means all the ag sector banks have done very well In fact, all of the banks in the District are reporting that they are in very good shape; this is the strongest year in decades Residential construction is very good We have had some reports of increasing house prices, but we hear mostly about increased building activity and not concerns about prices Nonresidential construction has picked up a fair amount and that relates to capacity issues that I want to come back to in a moment Motor vehicle production essentially is at capacity, whether it's trucks or autos All of the suppliers as well as the assemblers are saying that they are at capacity levels and expect to stay there for at least the balance of the year Retail sales were quite good through Labor Day but then dropped off for the balance of September-- not in a way that worries people, but there was a noticeable slowing of activity Labor markets generally are characterized as tight throughout the District Even some areas that were complaining before about being sluggish or soft now say that there has been a pickup In some communities, people associated with retail or fast food operations actually complain about a shortage of teenagers, if you can imagine such a thing! [Laughter]  We were especially interested in the question of capacity in the manufacturing sector and put the question directly to a broad array of manufacturers--the whole spectrum whether it's capital goods, machine tools, motor vehicle-related, and so on Consistently, reports are that they are at capacity and are looking to expand capacity Then we turned the question to pricing, and we found no pattern at all In fact, it was the rare exception where somebody said that price increases were going to be a response to capacity limits and backlogs They really want to increase their ability to meet the demand that they see through output, not price increases That led me to be very curious about the Wall Street versus the Main Street attitudes When we look at bond yields, mortgage rates, the price of gold, the exchange rate--all these sorts of things suggest an inflation premium So, we asked people--directors, small businesses, large manufacturing companies, other nonmanufacturing businesses-- whether they were more concerned about inflation, less, or the same compared to two or three months ago And with only one exception out of dozens of business people we talked to, they said the same or down, with the majority saying down So from a Main Street standpoint, people are not acting or sounding as though they think that inflation is picking up In that sense, I don't think we have lost ground in terms of trying to achieve a situation where inflation is not a major factor in decisions of households or businesses  -22-    9/27/94  I'm puzzled by the international financial markets One way of reading them is that we are seeing a hike in inflation concerns and awareness in those markets  Regarding the national economy, I still am not inclined to think of what has happened in the past four quarters as a classic increase in aggregate demand fueled by monetary/fiscal stimulus or something like that A year ago, we had gone through a significant period, several quarters at least, of a disappointing economy And we were waiting for the rebound--waiting for economic activity to pick up--and were getting to the point of thinking it was not going to happen The Greenbook forecast for a year ago had a middling expansion out through 1994 We then got the pickup and we have had four quarters of fairly good growth But I choose to interpret the majority of that as having been the effect of a transitory increase in the level of economic activity in response to, if you will, the diminishing of the head winds--the depressants being less of a factor --rather than being fueled by aggregate demand kinds of factors as in the past There may be some element of that If so, we have to say with the advantage of hindsight that if we think this pickup basically has been demand-driven, then we overstayed our accommodative policies late last year and early this year--that we were fighting against the head winds longer than maybe was necessary and should have backed off the accelerator a little sooner  But I don't think that is the lion's share of the way to interpret this If I am right about what these last four quarters have told us, then as this transitory increase in economic activity is completed, the rate of change naturally will diminish Second derivatives have to go negative I don't see signs that tell me that we have to use the term ""tightened too little"" or necessarily even ""too late"" I would have expected that if moving up to the 4-3/4 percent level from the 3 percent level in the funds rate was behind the curve, then we would have seen symptoms of that in reserves, central bank money, demand deposits, other things suggesting that there was something in the marketplace moving equilibrium interest rates up much faster than we were moving I don't see that out there As implied in my question earlier to Joan, the yield curve may play a part in that Why does the yield curve from three months out to a year look okay? What we have been doing on the funds rate does not look to me like either too low a level or one that came up too slowly But I have problems with what happens between the 1-year and the 2-year maturities Why is the 1-year forward rate for the 1-year maturity 7-1/2 percent? It leaves me in a position of thinking that we should not totally neglect the information that is coming from reserves, money, and credit and debt measures that say that right now we are in a good position; give it a little more time  I'm comfortable with leaving the funds rate unchanged at 4-3/4 percent I don't prefer asymmetric directives I would not dissent from it, but I have two concerns about it One is that an asymmetric directive toward restraint tends to get the Committee associated with being anti-growth That's because we have to react to incoming data and the psychology of the market is driven by the perception of those data in a context that tends to cast the Committee as being anti-employment or anti-growth Since I don't think the purchasing power of money is reduced by more output or more employment, I have trouble with that My other concern is worrying that the asymmetry is going to wind up being cited prematurely in some publication or wire service as an indication that we have cocked the gun again, and if that happens, I won't be very happy about it  Yes I think it gets us into a lot of trouble because of the way it gets interpreted "
5389,1994-11-15," Peter, your remarks suggested that some traders view intermediate- and long-term US Treasury rates as not being at a high enough level That differs from a feeling that a policy action by this Committee to increase the funds rate will at least temporarily depress bond prices Which is it? Are they saying that the level is not yet high enough or are they waiting until that last shoe is dropped so they don't get caught holding an unwanted long position?  Mike, I've got two quite different types of questions The first one has two parts and it is about productivity What has been going on and what do you foresee going on? In the past four quarters, growth in manufacturing productivity is reported to be something on the order of 6 percent or so, and for the overall economy it is substantially less than that--the rest of the economy only running about 1-1/2 percent A large part of that is because we define output in such a way that we preclude labor productivity gains, at least for services Nevertheless, we wind up with some pretty good numbers for these past four quarters When I look at your forecast for the next year--the first part of the first question is how you read these numbers as to what happened with productivity gains in the manufacturing sector being four times what they have been in the rest of the economy Is it simply a measurement error in that we don't know how to measure productivity in the rest of the economy and how does that affect judgments about policy? Or do you take those numbers at face value? The second question is, what do you foresee going on in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing productivity to produce the slow growth of under 2 percent in output for four quarters starting next spring?  Just as a comment on it, I'm not hearing anything that suggests to me that businesses--manufacturing or others --foresee fewer opportunities for productivity improvements in the next year or two than they have had in the last couple of years What produces this quite dramatic slowing of productivity? I think this is troubling  The second question is more involved--sorry about this When I pair up what has happened in the last four quarters and your projection out to mid-1995, it looks like a pattern that says, because output has grown faster than projected, say, at this time a year ago and also faster than some ideas about potential, what we have to do is give it back so that, in the end, we wind up at the same level of output and employment as we would have otherwise Another way of looking at this same situation is to pair up this last year with the prior year Instead of matching off a year in the future, match off a year in the past We went through a period in 1992 and much of 1993 of downward revisions in forecasts--staff, Blue Chip, everybody else; the forecasting errors were on the down side in relation to expectations about what the economy was capable of doing If you do that matching up of 1993 and 1994, the level today comes out about where you would have projected it two years ago Then, if you don't have to give anything back in the future, the question is what is happening to growth in the future  In your framework, when you talk about inflation, you rely on excess demand I puzzle over what is producing this idea of excess demand Nominal GDP growth really has not accelerated that much In fact, it looks the same for the last four quarters as it looked in 1992 To put it into terms that I feel more comfortable with, I try to reconcile your forecast with what I think is going on with money and the desire to hold money balances At least conceptually, I can make equivalent an excess-demand-for-output model and an excess- supply-of-money model How well that can be done depends on what is going on in asset markets But conceptually, we can make the two the same A year ago at this time, I said that the opportunity cost model for narrow money, M1, or for the monetary base, was tracking very well; nothing had gone wrong We had had two years of double-digit growth of M1 and the base At that point a year ago, we had four options for the year ahead One was that the relationship would break down; we don't want to make monetary policy on the idea of the relationship breaking down, so put that one aside That left three possibilities One was a further sharp decline in interest rates It would have taken a 20-25 percent decline in interest rates from where we were a year ago to make the opportunity cost model hold up, given the kind of money growth we were getting and the forecast you had At that time, you thought that there was some possibility of further declines in bond yields and that the funds rate would stay at about 3 percent I actually would have leaned on the side of thinking that if inflation psychology improved, bond yields could have too I do    11/15/94  remember the Chairman saying he would have been shorting the bond market Of course, I probably would have been buying! That improvement didn't happen So that left the other two possibilities Either nominal GDP growth doubled, shot up to about 10 or 12 percent, or M1 growth and base growth collapsed What we got was a combination of the two with a small increase of 1 percent in nominal GDP growth and mostly a drop in money growth--M1 and the base The opportunity cost model still fit  So here we are now and as I look ahead, we've got four options One is that the relationship breaks down; hold that aside Second, I can come at it one of two ways I can look at your Greenbook forecast and the Prell path of policy and ask if this is reasonable for interest rates and money growth if the model still works That would say to me that if interest rates remained at today's level and your Greenbook forecast was right, M1 growth would decline a little over the next year--1 percentage point or so if the relationship holds Or, if your fed funds recommendations are correct, that implies that M1 growth has to drop about 6 percentage points in absolute level in the next year for your nominal GDP forecast to be correct Is that reasonable? What's going on in the demand for money balances for the velocity to have to increase about 10 percent?  If the money demand relation still holds on M1 and you get a 5 or 6 percent drop in the absolute level of M1, what does that do to your M2? Unless you've got non-M1 components of M2 starting to take off suddenly--  I'll say very little about the District In my District contacts, I raised two questions that I thought were of some use in the period since the last meeting One was about labor market conditions and the persistent comment about shortages, tightness, especially for unskilled, semi-skilled workers and so on I asked what they were doing about it, and the general response was ""hiring bonuses,"" with the exception of the construction industry That industry is willing to raise offering wages; others industries are not going to let higher wages go into the cost structure I asked them how they are responding to current retention requirements and again the answer was bonuses--one-time payments to retain workers that they are not willing to build into the cost structure In response to a  -28-    11/15/94  question about the outlook for passing through cost increases to higher prices, respondents, especially retailers and various consumer products companies, simply said ""impossible"" I noted in the supplement to the Greenbook that the Michigan survey of consumer sentiment indicated that household appraisals of car and appliance buying conditions deteriorated in early November I think that bears watching, especially in this post-election period Small businesses that I asked about their outlook for the next year versus their outlook for 1994 at this time last year were more optimistic last year than they are this year looking a year ahead That was before the election I have no idea what the election did to their optimism Also, the Michigan survey shows the mean and median values of expected inflation declining over the next five years to their lowest levels since 1990 So, we may not be as far behind the inflation psychology curve with real people as financial market indicators would suggest  On the national economy, as shown in the Greenbook, we have had four good quarters averaging 4 percent growth, and I have no reason to disagree with the staff projection that this quarter also will have 4 percent growth That comes after approximately eight quarters of subpar performance We had a rebound effect after the Gulf war in the spring and summer of 1991, and the economy then tended to go flat The staff forecasts overstated the economy's growth after that for about two years I don't view those two years as having been a result of the inadequacies of aggregate demand, but rather the real shock effects of a variety of depressants in various sectors and industries that were preventing the economy from performing very well Therefore, I don't view the last four or five quarters of good growth as being the result of pump-priming stimulus to aggregate demand by our monetary policy or fiscal policy or anything else Rather, I see them as the result of the dissipation of those earlier depressants In that sense, I view this growth in output and employment as having been a good thing, a make-up for the earlier subpar performance  I don't view that growth as being a precursor to future inflation because I don't view it as having been fostered by excessive money creation The subject of inflation to me is still the subject of the purchasing power of money I don't see that the growth of output and employment reduces the purchasing power of money I do think it would be helpful, as Al Broaddus was suggesting, for us to have credible, multiyear objectives and to seek a legislative mandate for achieving our price objectives In part, the reason is the problem that we now have with inflation psychology Here is where our own words cause us a problem If we talk about the purchasing power of money as having something to do with the NAIRU and potential output or something, then I think that we have no choice but to continue raising the funds rate and create some unemployment and some perceived slack The last time this Committee went through a tightening period in 1988 and 1989, it was being guided by the opportunity cost relationships of broad money and the P* model, which seemed to be serving the Committee fairly well including the behavior of the stock of money--we got about 5 percent M2 growth in that period We don't have that now The Committee lost confidence in staff estimates of the demand for money balances or the supply of things; we just didn't know what to make of that and we all fell into a pattern of thinking that we know a lot more about aggregate supply of goods and services and labor and aggregate demand for labor and output and how to influence demand for labor and output than I think we have reason to  -29-    11/15/94  know I don't think that we have reason to have more confidence in our ability to know what is really going on out there in terms of productivity, consumption, and investment patterns than we do about money supply and money demand There appeared since our last meeting a very good article in Business Week magazine on this problem of the quality of the economic statistics that we use to guide ourselves There was nothing new in that article for those of us in this business, but I think it was very helpful to have that in the public forum saying that there are a lot of very serious quality problems in those numbers We better be careful and not rely on them too much in deciding what to do about monetary policy We have been in a pattern since last spring where every time we come back, we need another 50 basis points to get to neutral Now the staff is at 6-1/4 percent I know where it is going to be in December; it will be at 6-3/4 percent and then in February at 7-1/4 percent--just extrapolating the trend At some point we have to have a different rule that says, enough is enough and let's coast for a while I'm not soft on inflation I want to go to price level stability But I also don't want to make the mistake of continuing to tighten too much, precipitating a downturn because I know what will happen This means we will go completely the other way and set the stage for more inflation  I can support 75 and symmetry at this meeting Regarding outside expectations of what we are going to be doing, though, it looks to me like we are in a trap Former Governor Angell was in Cleveland a couple of weeks ago giving a speech, and he said we will be at 775 percent on the funds rate a year from now We have this world of traders and Fed watchers, whether they are 25 or 35, that seem to be persuaded like many people that growth reduces the purchasing power of money As long as that is the perception, any output growth above around 2-1/2 percent or unemployment rate below something like the NAIRU is going to have these people calling for another 50, another 100, basis point increase At some point we have to ignore them  Mr Chairman, this to me is an exceedingly difficult issue and not one that this central bank or any central bank in today's world can solve by itself, whether by any unilateral declaration by us or even all the central banks Both your initial remarks and your response to Al's comment, I think, highlight what the problem is Since August 1971, this country has not had a policy toward its currency; it has had a sequence of policies, and sometimes they are consistent internally and sometimes externally Therein lies the problem It is not just the traders who don't know that sterilized intervention cannot produce results inconsistent with domestic monetary policy, but sometimes members of executive and legislative branches of the government, ours and other governments around the world, don't know that The hazard comes from having the power to do these things in the context of outside expectations, that we do not share, that they will work I remember being told that when President Nixon was confronted by his advisors--some of the outside  -52-    11/15/94  people--about the issue of wage/price controls, he said I don't believe in controls; I know they won't work; and you don't believe in controls; you know they won't work; but the people don't know that And so we got controls  In the late 1970s, we had a policy toward the currency externally that was inconsistent with what at least I would want for domestic monetary policy Earlier in the 1970s, as we were thrashing around for a policy, the Open Market Committee had a number of debates on the issue At one point, Arthur Burns made what I thought at the time was a pretty effective argument, that the only way to be certain that you absolutely have to intervene is to declare you are never going to intervene and you will get some asymmetric bets in the foreign exchange markets If you want to be in a position where you don't have to intervene in this institutional setting, you have to declare that you are willing to intervene massively and often to burn speculation and so on It reminds me of Charlie Coombs' beartrap arguments In the early 1980s, the Treasury tried out the idea of declaring unilaterally that we would never intervene However people viewed that experience, the Treasury Department abruptly changed our currency policy at the beginning of 1985 in association with the Plaza Accord and the Louvre Accord and all of that It is troubling to me that nothing has changed institutionally In going forward, we can again find ourselves in a position with an executive or a legislative branch view that we can or should have a policy toward our currency in the international markets that is incompatible with what this Committee thinks is appropriate for domestic markets We ought to attack that policy issue as something that our government in its totality needs to address  I have a reservation about Larry's suggestion about the linkage of a visible domestic policy action tied with intervention promoted by the Treasury That's because of the asymmetry that would be involved if we were to get into a world where confidence shifts around and capital flows were starting to put some very substantial upward pressure on the US dollar If we had a Treasury that decided they wanted to rebuild the cookie jar or the war chest, I certainly would not want to couple cuts in the fed funds rate with their mandates to intervene in the opposition direction  On this issue of how the intervention is perceived, the Federal Reserve does not issue statements at the time foreign currency actions are undertaken My feeling about intervention would be significantly influenced by what is said, and I hope that your contribution is significant not only in terms of what is done, when, and how much, but also what is said about it I don't have any problem with taking the capital gains from our previous efforts to short the dollar against foreign currencies I am not very happy about the capital gains we are going to take because the only way a central bank can avoid taking a loss on foreign currency assets is if its domestic policies have not produced stability and its currency has depreciated We have accumulated big capital gains, and I am willing to cover our shorts, take our gains, and limit our options to do that again in the future, I hope! "
5413,1994-12-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd like to nominate Mark Sniderman to be an associate economist of the FOMC  Mike, there have been a couple of threads in the discussion about 1994 the Greenbooks in the past, this one, and your remarks now On one side, we have had a lot more growth in output and employment this year than we--or anybody--had been anticipating and much larger increases in short-term interest rates than had been expected In your remarks, you made reference to questions about the demand damping effects of higher rates The other side is the greater underlying strength of the real economy Which has been the larger contributing factor that there is something else going on that has created more strength on the real side than we had anticipated or, as has been conjectured in the press, that monetary policy is less potent? To which of these would you subscribe?  There are a couple of things that follow from your remarks in looking into the year ahead and contrasting it with 1994 When I started looking at your Greenbook forecasts for 1995 and 1996, on one side I welcomed the continued discipline that comes from the concern about inflation and the overriding desire to contain it to achieve our longer objectives On the other side, though, I was reminded of the feeling that I have had in conversing with employees in Cleveland in the last couple of months; they keep telling me that the unusually warm weather that we have had in October, November, and December is not good because it means we are going to have an unusually cold January, February, and March There is this vindictive weather god out there that catches up with us What is it about the process you go through in putting together the forecast that says that favorable surprises in output and employment in one period must be matched with unfavorable developments in a subsequent period such that the level of output and employment always comes out approximately the same in any given forecast horizon?  Okay I expected that answer Let me follow up on it because it raises a big concern about our February meeting Some time between now and that meeting, we have to submit projections to you whose so-called central tendencies are to be published in the Humphrey-Hawkins report What I suspected to be the case and confirmed when I looked it up is that the numbers in the central tendency in February are almost the same, with only slight differences, as the prior December Greenbook projections The central tendencies, which of course exclude the outliers, tend to be a little more optimistic than the Greenbook on output, a little lower on unemployment--01 percent or so--and a little better on inflation But there is not much difference; essentially, the central tendencies are the numbers in the prior December's Greenbook If that turns out to be what happens this time, I am concerned about what we are going to be announcing publicly The Chairman has to go before Congressional committees two or three weeks after the February meeting and go public with these numbers The markets expect this Committee to take some action in February to raise the funds rate again Then the Chairman is going to be in the position of saying that what we expect to happen--actually I have never understood whether it is what we want to happen or what we predict is going to happen--is that output growth is going to drop under 2 percent, unemployment is going to rise, inflation is going to rise, and therefore we will jack up the funds rate    12/20/94  Thank you With regard to Orange County-type developments, before that drove everything else off the newspapers, we were getting a number of similar reports in our area Cuyahoga County lost $150 million, which they say is equivalent to a new football stadium, so we have a team for sale And it appears now that the state held $900 million of stripped bonds that are deeply under water So, we are going to see significant reductions in waste, fraud, abuse, and underemployed people on county and state payrolls! These people will be going to work, fortunately, because they are going to find a very good labor market  I focused this time mostly on manufacturing Manufacturing employment in our District is almost 50 percent above the national average; it's really the main part of the Fourth District economy With only one exception, manufacturers said that the NAM president does not speak for them Sometime people volunteered this to me; sometime I sought out their views If there is a NAIRU in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, I would say it's a lot lower than it is assumed to be for the nation because our unemployment rates are 4 percent or less in most of our metropolitan areas And yet I still don't sense any change in people's attitudes about what will happen to inflation in the future People talk about very tight labor markets I continue to hear the same stories about shortages of skilled and unskilled workers, yet it doesn't seem to be getting built into people's plans They may be looking to that reservoir of previously discouraged workers that was supposed to have existed, or the disguised unemployed that we are supposed to have inherited from earlier periods, or the otherwise underemployed people out there But if they exist, they live in other Districts and we are having to import them; we have reversed the population flows and are getting some in-migration Our manufacturers talk about paying hiring bonuses and performance bonuses based on having had a very good year, but they are not building pay increases into their wage bases in order to attract or to retain workers One of the states, Kentucky, recently suspended its program to attract businesses to the region because they simply view their labor market as so tight that going out and trying to steal companies from other regions of the country was not a very profitable thing to be engaged in The person who told me this was very disappointed because he heads up that program and he was not sure what he was going to be doing  -19-    12/20/94  I talked to the CEO of one of the giant companies that mainly supplies the motor vehicles industry, especially heavy trucks, and also produces other equipment With regard to his capital expenditure plans for the longer run, whether for increasing capacity or making productivity-enhancing investments, I asked him what assumptions he made about future price increases He said zero He was very adamant in saying that it would be irresponsible for any industrial leader in America today to assume that they can plan on any price increases for their output Instead, capital expenditure proposals are evaluated on the basis of their ability to achieve the productivity increases to match any cost increases in labor or other resources I thought this was at least one bit of evidence that what we are trying to achieve-- stability in the purchasing power of money--is beginning to take hold in the minds of our business people  Another industrial leader from a very large company that supplies paints and other chemical products approached me saying that we must have an immediate and very substantial increase in the federal funds rate And, of course, I was curious and asked him why he felt that way Was he concerned about inflation? He said absolutely not, because he could not increase his prices In fact, he said that he was trying to hold the line and resist pressure to reduce his prices because of increased competition But his costs were killing him and the Fed needed to raise the funds rate in order to reduce those costs  Small and large manufacturers in the District are doing very well in the export markets, especially exports to Mexico and Canada District exports have posted strong increases in the last two or three years, and companies that had never engaged at all or significantly in these markets are now finding them very attractive and are doing quite well I hear a lot of reports of plans to increase capacity in the next year or two as well as continuing emphasis on labor-saving investments  Turning to the national economy, I can understand why people who believe that the growth that we have had in 1994 is the result of prior demand stimulus would feel that we ought to take that stimulus out before it spills over into excess demand and therefore rising prices It is a legitimate point of view It is not clear to me why we didn't recognize that excess demand earlier and therefore make a better forecast for 1994 if we knew that that was what was going on Maybe hindsight provides the answer But I still think that we ought to consider an alternative interpretation of what we have been experiencing this year and that is that it is the dividend for prior restraint We should have expected that policy actions to reduce inflation and to build our credibility on the inflation rate would produce the type of output increases that we have had Therefore, what has been going on this year is not the sort of thing that necessarily spills over into rising prices and higher inflation in the future  I think the main part of our problem right now is inflation psychology It certainly reflects the lack of a nominal anchor It suggests that it would be helpful to have a politically supported mandate to attain and maintain a stable value of the dollar If somehow we could achieve the conditions of a true gold standard-- without gold but the steady purchasing power of money in the minds of people--over time it would make some of these short-term things that we go through a lot easier to deal with I also support Tom Melzer's suggestion about having a discussion but also having a long-term focus That may sound like a minor change but one that may be important in a communications sense because our long-term forecasts are often taken as long-term inflation objectives I still feel that the numbers we put together for the Humphrey-Hawkins process should not be people's predictions of what is going to happen with regard to inflation, but rather a reflection of what we intend to try and achieve by our monetary policy actions  There is some good news about what seems to be a consensus around the table that the rates of change of output and employment this year are unsustainable And as somebody said, unsustainable things have a habit of ending The question is whether it will end as a result of a natural process in which whatever dynamics produced it in the first place start to diminish so we get a deceleration in the rate of change toward something that's more consistent with trend Or is it something that we have to take conscious policy actions to force if it is not occurring naturally? I would resist the latter To the extent that the anticipated slowing in the growth of activity is supposed to occur because of reductions in capital expenditures for productivity-enhancing or capacity-increasing purposes, it is not to be welcomed It is implausible to me that investing less in capacity and productivity lessens the chance of inflation In fact, quite the contrary; we should welcome having more people invest in capital expenditure programs for capacity or productivity So if you're going to contemplate an action before the next meeting, with or without an asymmetric directive, with or without a telephone call, I hope that the numbers will be reviewed very carefully to determine whether what we are seeing is a result of still diminished head winds and the economy has a ways to go in a natural spontaneous process versus something that is read in the marketplace as a spillover of excess demand And that is going to happen if it isn't carefully done I wouldn't dissent against an asymmetric directive, but I would be very concerned if any action taken was interpreted in the marketplace as anti-growth for the sake of it "
5467,1995-01-31," I agree with announcing as we have done over the past year, including the indication as appropriate that the meeting has adjourned and there is no further announcement As far as the  -12-    1/31-2/1/95  substance is concerned, though, I think your characterization, Mr Chairman, of the message about the future is the important criterion That depends critically on the regime that we are in If we were in an era when people had absolutely no doubt about the ultimate objectives of the Committee--if we already had a totally credible commitment to future price level stability, or had announced something along the lines suggested in the Dave Lindsey memo regarding future objectives--and the only message was a matter of tactics in order to achieve those objectives, that is one thing In that case, I would be willing to be more forthcoming about how our action is intended to achieve the objectives However, the regime that we are in, as I perceive it, is one where there is some uncertainty about our objectives The message could get confused in the minds of the public as to what it is we are trying to achieve versus how we are trying to achieve it In that case, I would prefer the briefest possible statement to minimize that misinterpretation  Thank you If we did not already have the tapes, I am not sure that I would support initiating such a procedure,  -19-    1/31-2/1/95  but I don't see the possibility of terminating it at this time We have transcripts for 1994 They will be released five years from now, or sooner if somebody makes us That leaves us basically with two choices if we were even to contemplate turning the recorder off Either we announce now that we are stopping, take the storm now, or wait until the year 2000 and then say that we turned the recorder off five years ago Neither alternative is realistic That to me is just not something we can consider I would oppose turning the tape off even for non-monetary-policy parts of our meetings The principle that we have established of taping entire meetings, as we have done in the past year, is really the one we have to support One of the defenses we have against earlier release, whether we end up with four years or three years or one year or whatever, is that we do discuss sensitive matters We do discuss foreign governments and foreign central banks and individuals And leaving that sort of information on the tape is the reason that we can give as to why we have to have a five-year delay  I'm opposed to concurring statements because it seems to me the only way they can be used is to express reservations or reluctance to go along with the majority I think that is inappropriate for people to do If they feel strongly enough about a decision, they should dissent Otherwise, they should go along and keep quiet about it It is very divisive to publicize, even with a 45-day lag or so, degrees to which people are or are not on board with the majority I think it plays into the hands of people on the Hill and elsewhere in a very negative way In principle I just think that concurring statements are wrong  I think Al laid out very well the arguments as to why setting inflation objectives would be desirable and helpful for the Committee to do in accomplishing our mandate I took Janet Yellen's response as being a combination of implementation problems versus desirability issues, and those I think we need to discuss separately If we had Al's magic wand, what would we want to do? What we would want to do is wave it and have businesses and households in the country make their decisions in the expectation that any increases in inflation--and in associated nominal interest rates--are temporary and will be reversed I would argue that we want to return to a period like the one we had in the 1950s and early 1960s when people looked at the shocks that happened along the way as transitory That is because they were confident that the central bank would conduct its affairs in such a way that inflation rates would move in the direction of zero and associated nominal interest rates to low levels I believe that the Bundesbank is in that position today  Janet is right when she says that the public does not care just about high and variable inflation; what they care about is standards of living She is raising a different type of issue-- whether or not that mindset on the part of the American public would in fact achieve the kind of rising standards that they want They want to be as rich as possible over time If we believe that stabilizing the purchasing power of money achieves that condition of making people the richest possible over time, then that is what we want to do When I address the question of the appropriateness of monetary policy such as at this meeting today and tomorrow, I cannot do it thinking only about what is going to happen to the CPI or any other measure of the purchasing power of money in 1995 We all know  -45-    1/31-2/1/95  about long and variable lags I also cannot do it based on anybody's forecast or unfolding events as they occur with regard to output and employment I can only do it with regard to what is going to happen to the future rate of inflation, at the soonest in the second year and much more likely in the third and fourth years Ultimately, I come to a conclusion about what monetary policy is appropriate by asking myself what is going to happen to inflation in 1996 and 1997 If it is going back down, and if people have confidence that that is what we are going to produce and they make their decisions based on that, then I think that monetary policy is appropriate If not, then I say monetary policy is not appropriate I would think that the American public would want to have confidence in assessing our monetary policy objectives, as distinct from monetary policy actions, by asking whether we are going to produce a lower inflation rate sometime out in the future That is what an inflation objective does  PRESIDENT MINEHAN I think there are two issues here and they tend to get mixed up One is whether or not we should be explicit about our objectives over a reasonably long period of time The second is whether or not we should focus solely on price stability or inflation measures as a target of monetary policy Looking at the latter issue first, I would be very much in agreement with Governor Yellen that monetary policy should not focus on only one target We need to recognize the short-term trade-offs between inflation and economic growth, and we should not beholden ourselves to a single measure in judging our effectiveness as a central bank Getting away from focusing on a single target for monetary policy, is there a case for being more explicit about what we are doing over a longer time period? In thinking about that, I ask myself what problem are we dealing with here? I do not think the problem is that we have not demonstrated a commitment to inflation fighting We have committed ourselves to inflation fighting We went through a period of high inflation and high interest rates in the early 1980s--when I tried to get a mortgage and the terms were 19-3/4 percent and 5 points--and we weathered that period, but we paid a big price for it I think we have been fighting inflation very effectively since then while recognizing the short-term tradeoffs with economic growth  The problem we really have here is that we have a communications vehicle that we are required by law to use It involves the monetary aggregates, and there are not many people who believe that they are an effective communications vehicle anymore We need to think about communications vehicles that are appropriate in terms of explaining to Congress what we are doing over a period of time I do not think that Congress harbors any suspicion that we are not fighting inflation I think they have the suspicion that we are too willing to fight it, that we are too willing to sacrifice economic growth and employment in pursuit of inflation targets In my view, we should either leave well enough alone or we should adopt a series of multi-faceted targets that might be better communications vehicles to Congress than the monetary aggregates Janet described using two ranges or two kinds of gaps We also could use nominal GDP, if we wanted, as a target or range or something like that So that is how I come out on this Frankly, I don't know if we can really decide this issue This is a big issue We received a good paper, and I would be in favor of trying to refine our thinking, however we come out, and get something explicit on the table before we take a vote on this  -46-    1/31-2/1/95  I am not voting this year but if I were, I would oppose the package because of the warehousing Once this Committee is in on the warehousing, we are in and we are going to be in--  Okay  Mike, in both the Greenbook and in your oral presentation you remarked that you had reexamined the economic model that you use, the approach that you use, in bringing these forecasts together, and you concluded that your model tracks well enough It is within the confidence intervals for 1994 And as best you can tell, there is not enough evidence yet to say that the NAIRU is different from 6 percent Accepting that, I went back a year to see what the forecast was I am assuming that looking at things ex post is still the best way; the model itself of necessity had to be built judging this ex ante--hindsight does not help here A year ago the projected unemployment rate for the end of 1994 was 68 percent, and for 1995 it was 68 percent We are now at 54 percent I look at your current projection for the unemployment rate for this year and your projection for 1996, which we did not have a year ago, and I also look at the  -78-    1/31-2/1/95  CPI, which came in below the estimate for 1994 but is now projected to be 3 percent higher for 1995 than you had it a year ago So, if the model is still working, that means the lags are a lot longer than you estimated earlier and the projected outcome is someplace further out in the future, or it would cost 17 million jobs to reduce the inflation rate by 3 percent just to make the model consistent with a year ago  I'm still missing something If the difference between 8 percent above the NAIRU on last year's projection and 6 percent below it is only 3 percentage point in the CPI, how wide is your confidence interval around the NAIRU?  So the NAIRU is 6 percent plus or minus 1/2 percentage point?  Okay  There is not much I could say about the Fourth District to add to what we put in the Beigebook or especially to what Mike Moskow said about what is going on in the Seventh District In most respects, developments in our two Districts are very similar  We pay a lot of attention to manufacturing, both because it has been so strong in the Fourth District and because of its absolute share or relative size Manufacturing employment in Ohio, for instance, is twice the national average and is very heavily concentrated in motor vehicle production and related capital goods So, we pay a lot of attention to it Our average workweek last year was about 2 hours longer than for the country as a whole Our unemployment rate is much lower The rate in Ohio as a whole is over a full percentage point lower; and in certain metropolitan areas in Kentucky and within Ohio and western Pennsylvania, unemployment rates are much lower than that Nevertheless, we are not seeing an effect on manufacturing wages, which rose only 11 percent last year, less than the national average We are not hearing stories from people in the industrial sector about wage pressures We are hearing that they are planning to spend a lot more for a third year on expanding capacity or improving productivity A lot of them have plans to reduce their current work force through productivity-enhancing investments We have very recently heard some negative reports out of Cincinnati The phone company there has announced a very large layoff and Federated moved an operation down to Bob Forrestal's District; so we will experience a loss of about 1,500 jobs in Cincinnati  When I turn to the national economy, I do not know what to say about the Greenbook I like having the alternative in there It seems useful to have the staff draw up for us what they think an unchanged fed funds rate would imply and then an alternative But the baseline for this Committee always ought to be to derive the policy that achieves our objectives Unless the Committee has changed its objectives, the baseline should be producing a downward trend in inflation in the future, moving us toward price stability; an alternative forecast could be drawn from that So, I would have flipped around the baseline and the alternative that the Committee would discuss In trying to assess what I think about the two alternatives as they are presented, I have problems with such things as the assumptions about the fiscal policy It has always mystified me why shrinking the federal government by having it spend less, borrow less, and maybe even tax less has a negative effect on the economy I don't know what to make of the fiscal policy assumption I do not find the inflation outlook satisfactory even under the alternative forecast Either the model is wrong as to what it would take to get there or the objective should be viewed as unsatisfactory  Don, one of the alternatives you gave us in the top panel of Chart 4 of the Bluebook assumes the NAIRU is 5-1/2 percent If I understand this, the line labeled ""Tighter"" is not tighter compared to where we are It seems to me to be based on maintaining the fed funds rate where it is The bottom two panels tell me what your assumption would imply for the CPI and the rate of unemployment  Mike's response to me earlier was that if we knew the ""true"" NAIRU was 6 percent, that really means we can say with reasonable confidence that it is someplace between 5-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent This tells me that if we knew it truly was 5-1/2 percent, then we are really saying it is someplace between 5 and 6 percent  I do not have a clue where it is, but I am just trying to understand what these charts say  If we currently enjoyed a situation where there was no uncertainty on the outside about our intent to deliver a lower inflation rate in the years ahead, regardless of what happens in 1995, and to move toward ultimate price stability, then I would not move today Because we do not have that kind of credibility, because there is uncertainty about our policy objectives, because our staff and private forecasters have inflation going up--the last OECD forecast that I saw had the United States with the highest inflation in the G-7 --and because of the dollar situation, I think that we are forced to err on the side of tightness whether this is to be the last tightening move or not Without those things, I would not even do this today But with those things I think we are forced to continue marching in a way that may turn out to be too much tightening  I'm not sure how many pages are appropriate Tom Melzer used the term ""put,"" but is the Treasury committing to a legal obligation to take us out of this? You used the word ""take-out"" and I know what a take-out is Is this a take-out or is it not a take-out?  Last March when we entered into the agreement on the swaps, part of that agreement was that there would be a three- country consultation process quarterly and so on I certainly do not feel that I have had either the quantity or the quality of information as feedback from whatever consultation was taking place to alert us to the situation So, as long as this is outstanding, I would hope we get a lot better information It does not have to come at the Committee table, but whatever is being generated by the New York Bank or the Board staff should be sent to us so that we are better informed Part of the reason I say that is because I live on the south shore of Lake Erie Maybe if I had Bob McTeer's southern border, I would think differently about it But from where I sit, I worry about the political and economic situation to the north of Lake Erie very much If we are not getting good feedback on developments up there,  -142-    1/31-2/1/95 "
5509,1995-03-28," I am not sure why it is helpful to have access to Class I and Class II differ  All the things that Ted sent out ruined my weekend as well! I read all this material before, one time or another, but I always have to reread it because there is so much that I can't remember all of it I am satisfied that from a technical standpoint and a legal standpoint there is not really an issue to be discussed because the lawyers can always figure out a way to do whatever it is we think is good public policy to do So, the question comes down to whether or not it is good public policy  The current set of institutional arrangements was designed in a totally different era for a different purpose The ESF, swaps, warehousing--all of that--were intended to give us access to liquidity The ESF was designed when the dollar was not even the dominant reserve currency The other arrangements came into being when we had the Bretton Woods system If we did not now have the ESF and the capability of warehousing or have something like swap lines and we were dealing with a situation such as the one that surfaced in December with Mexico, these are not the institutional arrangements we would have designed to address those issues In today's world, given the role of the dollar and our arrangements with other central banks, we would establish a set of institutional arrangements to provide liquidity to other countries such as Mexico or, in the future, Chile, Costa Rica, whomever We would not set up something resembling what we have today  What I would like to see happen is for Peter Fisher to work with Board staff to think through what kind of institutional arrangements we would like to have for the 21st century and produce some kind of report by the time this issue comes up again next February At Fed speed I don't know if they could get that done between now and February In the private sector if they had such a problem they would give staff a mandate and get it done by three months from now But at Fed speed, we could ask that the staff come back with a set of proposals by next February as to the kind of arrangements that would provide international liquidity to these countries, especially those that are less developed and that occasionally get themselves in a mess The objective is for us to carry out our central bank role without getting into this possibility of people saying we are doing something that is not consistent with foreign policy objectives or doing something that is subverting a debt limit issue that may come up between the executive and legislative branches of government As in 1979 and 1980, we definitely don't want to get ourselves, as a central bank, in between the executive and legislative branches if they are playing a political game over something like the debt ceiling We want to be nowhere in sight if something like that happens again Warehousing leaves us open to be in a position of getting caught up in something that we don't intend to do So, I would just like to see this whole issue rethought  Peter, there's been some press commentary to the effect that the dollar's role as the dominant international reserve currency is on the wane, that we are following the pound sterling's earlier slide Yet the facts are, as you have reported, that central banks around the world have substantially increased their holdings of dollars and reduced their holdings of deutschemarks and other currencies These outside commentaries would suggest that central banks around the world are now holding a lot more dollar reserves than they really want Is that your perception?  One final question In particular, do you know how the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan feel about the exchange translation that has been eroding their dollar assets?  Mike, I guess I am a little surprised at your answer to Bob, and that intrigues me some because my question related to the almost ""too good to be true"" sort of pattern for nominal GDP growth through the next two years and the composition of prices-- whether the deflator or the CPI--and output If I understand it, your assumption is that the fed funds rate stays at 6 percent for the full eight quarters  You have long bond yields coming down somewhat further You don't say how much, but I assume you still have an upward sloping yield curve through the whole two-year period  -17-    3/28/95  Some liquidity premium in there?  So you have nominal spending rising at a rate of less than 5 percent for eight quarters and pretty much a flat pattern through 1996 It's not much different from the last several Greenbooks except that at least it's flat now whereas before it dropped this year and rose later So, to decompose nominal spending into its parts, you have real output rising a little less than 2-1/2 percent on average and prices also rising a little less than 2-1/2 percent, using the deflator anyway, to give you that nominal spending Yet, you have a structure of interest rates in which rates are 6 percent and higher throughout the yield curve for the whole eight- quarter period I look at that and say I don't know whether it's a good forecast or a bad forecast I certainly don't have a different one to propose, but in the sense of a ""reasonableness"" check, should I expect nominal interest rates to be in the 6 to 7 percent range while nominal spending is under 5 percent for a two-year period? Comment?  If I could follow up--one thing implicit in both the assumptions and the forecast and your responses to me and to Bob Parry earlier is that either the financial markets are embodying and maintaining a higher inflation premium for a sustained period of time than what we are observing or we have a higher real yield I take this as being a forecast of an economy that is operating for the next two years essentially at full employment or full capacity We are right at the ceiling over this whole period  Okay, but at least not below it  So you would say it is unlikely that the real yield embodied in financial instruments is higher than what the economy is actually churning out or capable of churning out Unless you have some sort of risk or uncertainty assumption in there, that implies that the market is maintaining an inflation premium Market participants are still looking out beyond this forecast horizon at a rate of inflation and that is still being embedded in nominal yields  Okay  The Fourth District is operating at a very high level of economic activity, though clearly the rate of change has slowed Directors and other contacts consistently report that business is not growing as fast as last year, but there are very few indications of anything declining in an absolute sense or even concerns of such Motor vehicles are quite strong However, the dealers are now telling us that they have as much in inventory as they want, and they are sending messages back to the manufacturers to slow the rate of shipments How the manufacturers will respond to that in terms of production is going to be determined in the months ahead We have a lot of exporting out of the District although, of course, a great deal of it is to Canada Ohio also has large exports to Mexico --Kentucky does as well--of auto parts So far, exporters in our District are not raising any concerns about Mexico as being a particular problem because, as our companies tell us, their other markets for exports are quite strong Canada continues to be a good export market for us Canada also is still, for better or worse, a strong source of investment funds coming into the region I am not sure why the motivations are all that attractive from a Canadian standpoint Both director reports and direct contacts with some retailing companies--these are companies that may be headquartered in our District and operate all over the country--tell us that there has been a slowing in the growth of retail sales, not absolute declines One area of absolute declines is in residential construction Generally, there is a pattern of new-start activity being below what it was in the recent past Inventories of ""for sale"" homes seem to be lengthening Commercial real estate construction activity has picked  -28-    3/28/95  up compared to last year Also, industrial spending, for both productivity and capacity increases, especially motor vehicle-related capacity, is growing Companies also tell us that steel capacity through 1996 and 1997 will be very substantially increased Since we have already seen reports of declines in steel prices, they say that we should look forward to some softness in the steel market in the next couple of years One area that is creating a lot of comment, but to me more uncertainty as to what it all means, is health care consolidation We see very large companies getting together People talk about the consolidations resulting in job losses, but we have not yet seen them materialize in any observable way  As for the national economy, the Greenbook's projection that nominal spending growth will slow to the range of something under 5 percent this year and next year looks to me like a very desirable forecast, as I indicated earlier I don't have any reason to quarrel with that If I didn't think that that was going to happen, and if I thought that nominal spending growth was going to continue in the range that it was last year, then I would be a lot more concerned than I am about the prospects for inflation in 1996 and beyond But if that forecast of total spending does materialize, then the question about inflation comes down to issues about productivity growth and the ability of this economy to expand I am not too disturbed about what might happen in terms of reported rates of inflation for 1995 I don't think that monetary policy can do much about that anyway At this point, I mainly would be interested in seeing that the rate of inflation in 1996 and 1997 resumes decelerating a percentage point or two from where it has been in the last couple of years Right now, I don't have any reason to believe that we are not on a track to achieve that result So I am comfortable with the national forecast  Thank you, Mr Chairman I thought Don Kohn's remarks were very useful concerning the problems we are going to be facing in making policy decisions I also found very useful your remark right now on the interplay with the marketplace and the need to change the rhetoric I don't know how it can be changed in a positive way We almost need a heuristic model for the markets as well as an econometric model to figure out what is going on The sort of things that you point to, these ideas about how we are seen as having some sort of knowledge that others don't have, has led me to the conclusion that at least for the time being it is impossible to say anything that is going to be interpreted the way we want it to be interpreted  If I thought that the New York Fed forecast that Bill McDonough presented was correct about inflation in 1996--if I could be convinced of that and I hope he is wrong on that forecast--I would say that we ought to tighten policy now because inflation is definitely going in the wrong direction I would agree with Governor Kelley that the risks in the forecast are more likely to be in the direction of more inflation rather than less What I don't know how to assess, though, is an inventory forecast that is the inevitable mirror image of last year's inventory cycle What we really are talking about here is that we are expecting sometime within 1995 to have inventory effects that are the opposite of those that we saw in 1994 We won't know and neither will the auto manufacturers nor all of these other people such as retailers know as things unfold whether it is the mirror image of last year or whether it is more of a cyclical development  I guess I am not far away from the use of monetary aggregates My own judgment is, as Don Kohn's remarks might suggest, that in principle excess demand for and excess supply of money balances can be translated into excess demand for and excess supply of output The problem is, given the imprecision of the econometric models and all of that, that it requires a lot of judgment We all have different judgments, so we may come to different conclusions But what makes the current environment different for me is that we have had a prolonged period of very slow growth in the various monetary aggregates We saw the narrow money measure not grow at all last year even though commercial loan demand was extremely strong and one would presume that compensating balances increased a lot Leaving out the growth of currency mainly for foreign usage and making judgmental allowances for what might have happened to compensating  -44-    3/28/95  balances on the corporate side, we have had very weak money growth and the Greenbook/Bluebook projections for 1995 imply to me that we are going to have a further absolute decline in desired money balances on the order of 5 or 6 percent or something like that  I look at that and say that my main concern now is not that there will be too much growth of output I really never worry very much about output and employment growing too fast, but rather about the growth of output and employment slowing too fast relative to the growth of demand I come back to the issue of what is going to happen to spending in the economy, the demand problem, whether it is for current consumption purposes or for adding to capacity or improving productivity As long as we can see that whatever framework we use tells us that we are getting a deceleration in the growth of demand, I think we probably are going to come out okay So, at this point, I certainly would not be in favor of the ""A"" alternative I think that it is premature to think about that alternative I am not uncomfortable with no change, but because of perceptions on the outside I think that the bias in the directive has to be that, if or when we act, it is more likely to be to tighten than to ease "
5541,1995-05-23," Mike, my questions are really along the same lines as those that Mike Moskow asked you earlier Your response to him frankly is not the response I would have expected from my reading of the Greenbook A year ago at this meeting we were talking about this issue of neutrality There was a fair amount of discussion then and at the next couple of meetings about what it means to be at a neutral level in some sense on nominal short-term interest rates and where neutral is So, when I read this Greenbook, I was led to believe that a neutral nominal rate for fed funds was 6 percent or slightly below 6 percent but that it could be a little higher There was a phrase in the Greenbook about the core rate of inflation moving up through 1995 and 1996 because that was consistent with an excess of aggregate demand over potential supply There was also a statement to the effect that the recent bond market rally had pushed long-term interest rates below a sustainable level and that from this point you thought rates would go up As I read the two alternatives of a higher/lower federal funds rate at the end of the year, the language used to describe each of those also left me feeling that 6 percent was about neutral or maybe a little below neutral So, your response that neutral was below 6 percent was not what I would have guessed To come at it from a slightly different perspective, let us assume that the rate got stuck at 6 percent--that we just pegged the rate at that level To help condition us a little to what we might expect in the midyear review when we come back in July, would you describe what you would expect to be the most likely set of numbers in terms of real output growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate over the next five years that might be associated with a fed funds rate stuck at 6 percent  A few weeks ago, in the last couple of days or so of April, I attended a meeting of over 100 business and civic leaders from northeast Ohio Martin Feldstein made a presentation to the group and answered questions His prepared remarks were about Mexico, but during the question-and-answer period, Marty was asked about the economy, the outlook, and policies He commented at that point that the unemployment rate was too low and we should continue tightening monetary policy until we raise the unemployment rate to about the 6 percent level in order to prevent inflation from accelerating from the current level After the session the president of one of the companies asked me if I still believed in zero inflation, and I told him that I did He then asked me how high I wanted the unemployment rate to be pushed up if Feldstein thought it needed to be pushed up to 6 percent to hold inflation steady Of course, I tried to explain that I did not want the unemployment rate pushed up at all but that the objective of moving toward price stability was in fact to move the unemployment rate down and maintain it at a lower level After that exchange and then talking with a group of business leaders last week, I was struck by just how difficult it would be to generate broad public support, let alone narrower political support, for the idea of price stability as long as we couch our argument in terms of putting a floor under the unemployment rate The idea of using a minimum level of unemployment as an instrument in order to achieve the objective of price stability simply is never going to be very popular with anybody  -21-    5/23/95  When I look at unemployment rates in Ohio and also in metropolitan areas and other parts of our District, I am puzzled about why those rates do not fit with the stories that we usually hear and see in print We have a lot of metropolitan areas that report their unemployment rates officially as under 3 percent When we talk to the people in the area, they say they have effectively no unemployment They usually do make the distinction that there are a lot of people who do not have any work to do, but those people have jobs--they work in the city governments and the school districts! The state of Ohio has overall unemployment of 4 percent, the lowest of the big eleven states, and our manufacturing employment is double the national average, measured as a share of total employment  If we have some idea concerning which we can be reasonably confident in terms of potential, it has to be generally in the goods producing sectors of the economy and more specifically in manufacturing That is the largest share of the Ohio economy and parts of the central Kentucky economy, down around Lexington and in that corridor And yet, we don't see that these reported levels of unemployment are being reflected in people's thinking about future inflation, let alone materializing in terms of wage pressures Our wage increases in the District are well below the national average Now, one conjecture could be that it is a good thing that there are a lot of unemployed aerospace workers in southern California, given the number of people working and producing motor vehicles in Ohio Otherwise, we would have a lot of inflation And if those people in Long Beach find jobs, I guess we are going to have to lay some people off in Toledo! I was in Toledo last week talking to about 100 bankers from within a 50-mile radius, and they were complaining that their unemployment is close to the national average They said it was around 57 percent, and they were trying to attract people into job- creating activities to lower their unemployment rate because--even though the rate is at the national average--it is quite high for this region of the country as far as they are concerned So I thought, well, if they are successful in lowering the unemployment rate in Toledo we will have to lay off some people in Dayton or Columbus, or else we are going to have too low unemployment and somehow this is going to influence the purchasing power of money  People that I listen to about what is going on around the District usually perceive the problems to be in somebody else's part of the country Yes, auto sales have fallen, but that is not affecting the production of cars here and so they feel employment is very good and our area is immune to whatever is happening in Tennessee or wherever The steel people, similar to what Mike Moskow reported, are experiencing very strong demand but also are planning a lot of additional capacity, especially the mini mills that will come on stream over the next couple of years One of our directors said that earlier this year he had been looking for a 3 to 5 percent increase in posted steel prices on July 1 He said that will not take place Even if the steel mills posted the increase, they would not be able to get it, so there is not going to be another steel price increase Builders report that residential construction is above where it was at this time last year Nonresidential construction is considerably above where it was before, so the investment side of the economy still looks quite good to us Agriculture is a different story, though In particular, there are a lot of concerns about grains It is reported that because of sharply higher fertilizer costs, fuel costs, and  -22-    5/23/95  interest rates, average production costs this year for the corn crop may be about 10 percent higher than a year ago, while prices right now are about 10 percent lower So, farmers plan to make that up on volume once it stops raining  Turning to the national economy, I have a lot of trouble with the rhetoric about a soft landing If all the commentary that we see in the press is going to be in terms of an airplane analogy, I wish they would talk about leveling off at cruising altitude That's because I think a landing should not be the objective at all to the majority of the American public; continuing to fly ought to be the objective Since I have a general view that a market economy tends to allocate its resources to their best uses in the absence of some real shocks or perverse policies, when I think about where the economy might stabilize in terms of growth rates I try to think in terms of what is going to prevent it--whether monetary policy, fiscal policy, oil shocks, or something else The one we are concerned with, of course, is monetary policy So, I ask myself whether I believe that what I see in the Greenbook is at least consistent, whether or not I think it is right And I have trouble with the assumptions about the interest rate structure, both the level of the funds rate and the rise in bond yields, and the associated growth rates of nominal GDP, real output, and all the component parts I don't know which one of those is wrong, but I think that one of them is Either the interest rate structure is too high or the forecast of output and inflation that the staff is presenting is too low, and at some point we are going to have to reconcile those--raise our assumptions about output and inflation or accept the idea that a lower structure of interest rates is going to be consistent with it  I agree with no change at this meeting "
5567,1995-07-05," Peter, I want to follow up on what you said about Mexico, because something went by me awfully fast there You said the Treasury has monetized SDRs to fund the Mexican drawing Can you explain that a little?  But we, the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, own our respective shares of these SDR certificates based on the capital of our banks?  How are we informed that we own them? How is my bank informed that we now have that in our portfolio?  You sterilize immediately so that our share of the Treasury portfolio goes down by the same amount at the same moment?  We reduce our earnings When you're clarifying this, another question is This is a repurchase agreement, right?  This differs from my understanding, then, because in February or March or whenever, my understanding when we were going to take yen or deutschemarks--  You are saying this is not warehousing, this is not a repurchase agreement? So, this is permanent  I didn't know that  Can I follow up on that? The same thing happened when we changed the price of an ounce of gold from $35 to $38 and then to $4222 The Treasury got a windfall of about $1 billion to $12 billion in both of those so-called devaluations So an issue on this is What was the dollar price of SDRs that we monetized? You say I have an asset on my balance sheet and I don't know what the value of it is    7/5-6/95  We do this at the official US Treasury price of gold?  I have been trying not to mention that publicly for fear that someone might want to do it  It will become known five years from now!  I have a couple of questions I'm not sure whether the first one is for Mike or for Tom Going back to Chart 8 on real interest rates and fiscal scenarios and so on and comparing that with a statement in the Greenbook, I'd like a little further elaboration You make references to what you call fiscal restraint I understand what that is supposed to mean But as you describe it in the Greenbook, fiscal restraint has the effect of lowering equilibrium real rate  Normally, most people would think that lower interest rates, real or nominal, mean easier monetary policy So, a tighter fiscal policy causes an easier monetary policy  Okay  Okay, and I have absolutely no problems with that I do still have a little problem with the references to bond markets being adaptive It's like saying If the bond market rallies enough, we don't have to lower the funds rate, and that gives me a little problem But let me hold that for a second The Greenbook says ""We have introduced a downward tilt in the funds rate This decline in rates, though, should not be interpreted as implying any impetus to aggregate demand,"" meaning that this downward movement would equilibrate I can read that statement to say also that because the natural Wicksellian rate or some equilibrium real rate has moved down, failure to move down the nominal rate would be a de facto more restrictive policy stance  So, whatever causes the equilibrium rate to move down--fiscal policy, or God, or something--you would say, even though the headlines may say a lower nominal rate is an easing, that failure to lower the nominal rate is in fact more restrictive  Okay  I want to draw out this conceptual aspect I do have a problem with this last point about the rally of the bond market, but that's because I translate it into supply and demand for reserves and what that might do in terms of quantities And that's because I have a different framework Let me hold that one, though, because I don't want to take too much time and I want to ask Karen to help me through thinking about something about Japan You used the word ""deflation"" and I know a number of Japanese commentators have denied vigorously that they have deflation I don't know what they mean by that, but the word deflation in the abstract means that the purchasing power of the yen is rising I'm not sure whether that is really what people have in mind when they say those things  -11-    7/5-6/95  If you go back to the beginning of this decade, commercial real estate prices were such that the Japanese would say such things as that the land under the Imperial Palace was worth more than the State of California We would say ""Yes and try to get it"" All the stocks listed on the Nikkei, if aggregated, would have exceeded the present value of GDP for the world We thought it probably wasn't true Or at that time a cantaloupe cost 70 US dollars If you think during the course of the decade that you are going to remove the impediments to the workings of the market so that the law of one price starts to operate in tradeable goods and asset prices and things like that, then one of two things has to happen The price of these things, converted into the equivalent of some other currency, has to fall either by a depreciation of the yen or by declines in absolute yen prices Whether it is proper to think about that as deflation or not, I don't know What else could happen? If the yen is not going to fall in value on the exchange market, then our economics would tell us that asset prices and goods prices had to move toward world levels How else could this adjustment possibly be made?  I didn't think you were being pejorative but I wondered about that policy conclusion I don't see how what you called fiscal stimulus, which I assume is more resources flowing through the government or less taxes, or monetary stimulus is necessarily called for If what is happening is a breakdown of the various types of impediments to the working of the marketplace in Japan, one should think of that as a wealth gain for the Japanese people And other things the same, something that produces  -12-    7/5-6/95  miraculously a wealth gain would not lead to the conclusion that you need an easier monetary policy  The staff at Cleveland did a survey of various companies across the District on the subject of inventories The main objective was to gauge business sentiment about current inventory levels In line with what Gary was just remarking, given their comfort levels with their order books and projected sales, our business contacts simply had no complaints about their inventories They might talk about problems relating to the mix of their inventories, sometimes referring to thin inventories in some lines that were balanced by too much of something else, but they did not have an overall concern And that was just as true of manufacturing companies as it was of retail companies and distributorships  What has changed in the last few months is that we have heard far fewer stories about overworked workers--workers complaining about too much overtime So to the extent that there has been an adjustment, our anecdotal information would suggest a change from something that was perceived as being unsustainable to something that is much more comfortable all the way around We recently had a joint meeting with all three of our boards and the reports were the most remarkably uniform that I have heard yet about how well things are    7/5-6/95  going from the standpoint of real activity The directors express puzzlement over what they read about the national economy, but I took that to mean that they don't understand the difference between first and second differences They think in terms of the level of their firm's activity compared to a year ago and it is uniformly positive in every respect They do not see things as we would in the sense of changes in the rate of change  There was one new development that I thought was significant and that was their expectations about prices Except for paper, which Bob Forrestal also mentioned--they say that paper is a serious problem--there was uniform agreement in line with their earlier views that prices are going to be less of a problem Steel industry people said that the July 1st price increases anticipated earlier simply did not happen, would not happen, and in fact that there would probably be some rollbacks in steel prices They reported that prices of carbon steel were already being rolled back Specialty steel people said that they had finished with their price increases for this year and were not planning any price increases even for the first of next year  said that he had come back from an international trade convention of their association, and he said that in the last few months there had been a dramatic shift in thinking about prices of paints and resins and that sort of thing-- from expectations that firms could get further price increases to expectations that prices would be flat for the balance of this year  On the labor markets, sometimes when I think about all that is being said about the minimum number of people that are not working and how we have to maintain this reservoir of unemployed people, I feel I ought to come to these meetings and apologize because we have so few people who are not working in our District There are ten counties in Kentucky and more than ten counties in Ohio that report unemployment rates of under 3 percent; some reports are down around 2 percent or even lower If we have so few people who are merely consuming the product of other people instead of producing something themselves, one might conclude that maybe we are going to have an inflation problem If I thought that this was going to lead to a problem of cost push, wage push, or rising prices I would be as concerned as anybody else, but I simply don't see it In trying to find inflation out there, I mostly get an indication that the productivity increases that are being sustained are warranting the kinds of demand for labor that our firms are registering It is not the kind of thing that I think people have looked at in previous cycles as a source of future inflationary pressures  Turning to the national economy, when I was looking at the Greenbook I was pleased to see the slight downward tilt in the inflation number for 1996 But then Mike gave us Chart 18 showing the ranges and central tendencies of the FOMC members' forecasts, and that leaves me still puzzled about consistency The Greenbook projects an upward tilt in intermediate- and long-term rates this year It suggests that the absence of some downward adjustment in the funds rate that is assumed in the Greenbook will disappoint the markets, and so longer-term rates will go back up But except for that kind of a linkage, when I look at the staff's nominal GDP forecast for this year and next year I don't understand why we should have higher intermediate- or long-term rates than currently--not with 41 percent nominal GDP growth this year and 45 percent next year If anything,  -28-    7/5-6/95  rates of 6-1/2 percent on 30-year bonds and 6-1/4 percent on 10-year issues are still a bit too high for any sort of sustainable equilibrium But when I look at the members' forecasts of nominal GDP for 1996, the range goes as high as 6 percent, and if that kind of forecast for next year and its mix of output and inflation are correct, then the consistency problem is in the intermediate- and longer-term rates, not in the short-term rates If the central tendencies of the members' projections--they are above the Board staff forecast--are the best guess as to what is going to happen, then I would think that the adjustment has to be in the shorter end I certainly don't sense any urgency on anybody's part--the directors of our boards and other people that we talk to--that we move toward something that would be perceived as monetary stimulus, with or without an idea about needing to offset some fiscal restraint Yet, I think that very few people would be arguing at this juncture that we ought to be moving to what would be a de facto more restrictive policy stance  I want to start off with a couple of comments related to what Al Broaddus was just saying This is the 20th anniversary of Concurrent Resolution 133 That resolution was adopted in the aftermath of the first oil shock as a device to put boundaries on inflation in keeping with the notion at that time that there was  -45-    7/5-6/95  some stability in the demand function for some measure of money and that constraining the growth in that measure would put boundaries around the rate of inflation I think that after twenty years we have learned a lot; we have unlearned a lot; and it is time to rethink the underlying premise of Concurrent Resolution 133, which was codified in legislation enacted during 1977 and 1978 We are still being hamstrung by something that simply does not fit our objective That objective is to give definition to the dollar and to maintain that in the minds of the people The Humphrey-Hawkins statute, as we call it, as was true of Concurrent Resolution 133, does not do that  For about 30 years the mean level of M2 velocity was about 165, with significant cyclical movements around that mean, but still it was a mean in which we had some degree of confidence The ranges were related to historical experience There is some very tentative evidence that the mean level has moved up to about 19, but that evidence is very tentative; and even if the new level is true there are still significant cyclical variations around it Right now, with the recent acceleration that is being observed, we basically have two choices of assumptions to make Either the mean level has shifted up and we are getting a cyclical increase in velocity and the recent growth in the aggregates should be very worrisome, or we should expect a substantial deceleration in the rate of change in M2 If someone wants to make the assumption that the level of velocity is going to shift back down to what it once was, then they have a bigger problem  As a device for communicating intentions to the public and Congress, I think the ranges can be useful if properly explained I don't think they are useful as a way of indicating to anybody how the short-run decisions about changing the funds rate will be made I look at a lot of indicators of all sort of things; I look at the price of gold; I look at exchange rates; I look at yield curves I would not want people to think that decisions on changing the funds rate from one meeting to the next are influenced by any single measure We would have what former Governor Wallich used to call the Goodhart's law problem if people started to attach our actions to a single measure So, I agree with the Chairman's initial remarks that changing the announced ranges of M2 in this environment, especially if we also decide to take action in the near term on the funds rate, could miscommunicate what we are doing A reduction in the fed funds rate or the discount rate at this point, whether we like it or not, is going to be interpreted as an easing in policy Whether we think it is a more stimulative policy or not is something else again, but we know how it will be interpreted Associating whatever explanation we give to that short-term action with our long-run objectives is what I think we should be doing and we should not associate it with where money growth is relative to some announced target range They serve two different objectives  I think the appropriate criterion for choosing a stance of monetary policy is whether we feel it is a move toward the objective of stabilizing the purchasing power of the dollar An inappropriate criterion would be either somebody's idea about what the impact of fiscal multipliers was going to be, assuming we knew how to measure fiscal policy appropriately, or some idea about a cumulative process of decline in the economy in the absence of some pump-priming to prop it up I do know that people outside the Fed, who believe in some kind of stagnation thesis and think that the economy contracts in the absence of fiscal or monetary stimulus, are going to interpret our actions differently than I would But I still think that there are appropriate and inappropriate reasons for our thinking about whether a policy adjustment is called for In Don's characterization of our move last February, one of his interpretations was that it is possible for us to take out some insurance, and I think that was correct The way I viewed it at the time was that if we enjoyed full credibility of our commitment to stabilize the value of the dollar over time and felt that we would achieve a stance of policy that in 1996 and 1997 would move us decisively in that direction, then I would not have thought that the action in February was necessary That is quite different from what I thought about our November 1994 action In my view that action was an adjustment that was necessary to move us toward price stability I did not think that the February action in a vacuum would have been necessary With the advantage of hindsight, I think the February action was necessary because of what has happened to the price numbers and the possibility of our objectives being misinterpreted had we not done that  The way I think about policy now is in terms of how much insurance we need against future inflation I would not want to be taking out insurance against a contraction because I think the economy tends to expand in the absence of adverse shocks or perverse policy So, it is a question of whether we should cancel all the insurance now and whether that would be appropriately interpreted, or in the alternative that we have a growing confidence that we are back on track with regard to the future value of the dollar and so we are going to cancel half the insurance now We can live with the ""other shoe to drop"" syndrome if it is interpreted that when we have further evidence that everybody agrees that we are moving toward stabilizing the value of our currency, we will then feel comfortable in canceling the other half of the insurance policy At that point I would pause "
5593,1995-08-22," A general characterization of the District economy, I would say, is the feeling that it is as good as it gets Certainly for the state of Ohio and for the part of Kentucky in our District, people would say that these are the best times that anyone  -18-    8/22/95  can recall, and they would have a hard time imagining it improving over that That would not be the case in western Pennsylvania where we have a number of counties that are still considered to have high unemployment and sluggish growth But I think the sense of optimism and confidence about the future is really extraordinary Yet, I don't see it being accompanied by the kind of imbalances or any kind of excesses or speculation that would worry me The mood I get from our small business advisory council, our small bank advisory council, our board of directors, and the business people that I talk to is one of a calm confidence that this is sustainable Near term, Cleveland in particular is looking forward to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opening on Labor Day They consider it to be a bigger event than the Atlanta Olympics [Laughter] followed very shortly by the all-Ohio World Series [Laughter] We have been sold out of baseball seats for over a month now; it is really extraordinary  The industry- and sector-specific comments that we hear would not be significantly different from what Mike Moskow is reporting from the Great Lakes region So, I am not going to go through them But I will relay a couple of anecdotal reports of note related to motor vehicles and specifically trucks One director commented that he had seen a very welcome reduction in the amount of overtime With some relief, the companies--auto suppliers and assemblers--feel that they will have fewer problems with labor now that they are able to cut back on the amount of overtime Talking to business people about their efforts at hiring, it has been very interesting to hear their comments about the lack of what they call unskilled workers and how much they are having to pay in order to attract unskilled people for entry-level positions One company that makes rubber products related to motor vehicles said that the nice thing about today's technology is that they can hire people who don't know anything at all and still afford to pay them $8 an hour even though they are unskilled in his view This says that there is something about the productivity of these people that is not consistent with usual notions about productivity If he thinks they have no skills and yet they are worth $8 an hour because of technology, that is a different way of thinking about what the labor market is contributing One of our small business people in the Columbus area said that people who are not working today in that area are people who don't want to work Bonuses are being paid and firms are competing for unskilled or trainable workers Another general comment from directors and advisory people is how much they are spending on training and how they achieve better results by competing for workers by offering training programs rather than by raising benefits or bidding up the wage structure  With regard to health care, some of our directors in that industry--including health goods and other health-related activities such as a managed care company in the Dayton area that is adding new members at double-digit rates--describe an industry that is so grossly mismanaged that any organization, even one like the Post Office, could improve the administration of hospitals and clinics I asked them how long the opportunities for improvement can go on, and they said the introduction of better administration and technology could take until well into the next century  -19-    8/22/95  Turning to the national economy, the productivity numbers that we see have interested me for some time Early this year or late last year, I saw Board staff projections of productivity that I thought were simply too low But since I also don't think that the output numbers mean much, it's hard for me to get too concerned about the productivity numbers The fact that those numbers are consistently coming in so much stronger than people expected may tell us something about the different nature of this expansion That is, it is not a demand-led expansion fostered by monetary and fiscal stimulus, but rather it is the dividend from a gradual improvement in the credibility of our commitment to price stability so that people are putting more into those things that improve efficiency or what we would call productivity To test that idea, I have been asking directors and advisory council members whether, if they were told that they could not increase their prices for the rest of this century, the cost increases they would have to incur--labor, benefits, raw materials, and so on--would put them out of business Almost all say, yes, we can make it But some go so far as to say that such a price outlook is the reality said that he is operating above capacity but he has not had a price increase in two years I asked him why he didn't raise his prices He said it is impossible to do so; he can rely on rising productivity He is increasing his work force and training it, and he is adding technology I believe we have made a lot of progress on what I think of as the issue of inflation--people's ability to compensate for cost increases without raising output prices We are seeing the benefits of that in rising standards of living  I agree "
5617,1995-09-26," I have a different response from the one Don gave to Susan's question about incentives for innovation As long as we maintain a distinction between liabilities that are called deposits and liabilities that are not called deposits, there are going to be incentives If we had a low, broad-based reserve ratio on all noncapital liabilities without the distinction between deposit and nondeposit liabilities, then that incentive would go away So, it depends on how we do it  Mike, I also have a couple of questions about labor markets--along somewhat the same lines One of the persistent stories that we have heard all year from large and small businesses, more so in what are described as tight labor markets than in markets that are not described that way, is how much businesses are spending for training Businesses tend to respond to perceived conditions by being willing to spend more on in-firm training programs whose cost as we all know is expensed; it doesn't add to capital stock There are    9/26/95  two motivations One, of course, is the use of new technologies that result in the need for related skills The second is that businesses do not respond to the need for low-skilled and unskilled workers by bidding wages up in an effort to get the workers they want, but by in a sense saying they are not going to pay more but will hire people and train them How does the staff think about that kind of business response in its analysis of potential output, productivity, the NAIRU, those sorts of things? Second, the staff responds to questions about subdued wage behavior by referring to the notion of job insecurity Is there any direct evidence of a shift in some variable in a labor supply function called ""worker insecurity?""  At a recent joint board meeting, one of our directors whose firm employs a lot of people in four of the states in the region listed a number of the major metropolitan areas and said the employment situation was very bad there I interrupted to ask him to clarify what he meant and his reply was that he could not hire anybody [Laughter] His firm runs ads and nobody applies There had been a general feeling in the spring, among large and small businesses, about what was described as the ""hitting the wall"" phenomenon, and that is largely gone People generally have overcome their earlier worries about the outlook We get reports that residential construction, both single-family and multifamily, is quite good throughout the District Commercial real estate is doing very well There are persistent comments about tight labor markets everywhere except in western Pennsylvania We even heard one report of bounties to hire people where employers tell existing employees that if they bring in somebody--a friend, a relative, or anyone--who applies and gets a job, the existing employee will get a bonus That's a novel approach for the labor market We have reports that college enrollments, both public and private, are at record levels, though there is some discounting on tuition in order to attract students to smaller private schools The only sector of clear weakness throughout the District is health care; there are continued comments about downsizing of the health care labor force  I want to make a couple of comments about the fiscal situation I don't know what the Wall Street view is--I'll leave that to Peter Fisher or somebody else--or the foreign portfolio manager view, but I think there is a different view on Main Street than in the financial markets If you were to walk down the streets of Wooster, Ohio and tell people that the government might decide to cut the growth of government spending, reduce the budget deficit, maybe with some tax elements in the fiscal package, and that this was going to have a bad effect on the economy and that monetary policy would need to do something to offset it, they would wonder what planet you came from! Whatever people in effect think about the size of fiscal multipliers, let alone what their sign might be or their timing, I think we need to be very careful not to communicate the idea that anything that is done on the fiscal side is somehow negative and that  -25-    9/26/95  this undesirable event will require an offsetting or compensating monetary policy action I don't think that is going to play very well out there on Main Streets across the land  On the Greenbook forecast, I have given a lot of thought to this issue of what the level of the funds rate implies with regard to either economic growth or inflation I have reviewed the experience of the last couple of years Two years ago at this point we thought that the head winds might be diminishing The federal funds rate was around 3 percent and as late as December 1993 the Greenbook was projecting continued anemic or subpar growth and actually an increase in inflation in 1994 Of course, what happened is that the funds rate went up a lot in 1994; real growth was very strong; and inflation came in below what had been projected in the Greenbook In August 1994, we increased the funds rate from 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent and many thought a rate of 5-1/2 percent might eventually be the right level In November we boosted the rate another 3/4 percentage point and last December's Greenbook talked about taking the funds rate up to 7 percent by the middle of this year just to try and keep a lid on things so inflation would not take off Of course, what has happened is that we have a funds rate that is over 100 basis points below that level and the inflation outlook is better than it was expected to be The lesson for me is that we can have errors in our forecasts of output growth and inflation in both directions, and they don't necessarily go together When I look at something like the Blue Chip forecast or other forecasts, they tend to indicate that the more growth we have, the more inflation That simply is not the experience; we are not in a world that says more growth causes higher prices and vice versa So, I think we need to be very careful about how we talk about the relationship of the funds rate and the growth in output and any implications the latter might have for the purchasing power of money I do agree with the emphasis of some people that this is the right time to keep a long-term focus and not be perceived as reacting to events either in the economy or fiscal policy  I said that for Don Kohn's benefit  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman One of the things that you pointed out in your comments at our August  -38-    9/26/95  meeting still needs to be kept in mind There is a risk--and different people can put different probabilities on it--of fiscal fizzle There would be a lot of disappointment if nothing happens here, and we could have an adverse effect on psychology across the country  I am not sure this issue is ready for prime time Certainly, the intent of Senator Mack and his co-sponsors is the very desirable goal of clarifying the role of economic policy and especially the role of monetary policy But it is not obvious to me that that is going to be the outcome of the hearings process Two years after we ended Bretton Woods in 1973, people went to instrument monitoring--monetary growth targeting--as a sort of interim device to try to set the boundaries for what economic policy, monetary policy in particular, was supposed to do I think that approach has certainly run its course, and it is time to move on to objective monitoring--to set an objective and initiate a process of oversight to see how well we do in achieving the objective  Listening to some of this discussion, however, just enhances my concerns about what will happen in the hearings We will have a lot of very well respected, well-known academic, Wall Street, and other private-sector economists appearing before the Congressional committees And instead of educating the members of the Senate and the House--and through them maybe the American public a little--about the contribution that a stable currency can make toward the full employment goal of the Employment Act of 1946, they will speak mostly about the notion that stabilizing the value of the currency depends on maintaining a minimum army of unemployed, or maintaining slack, or holding growth below some notion of potential As I read the legislation, I think it does not repeal the full employment goal of the Employment Act of 1946; in fact, the Mack bill clarifies that goal in very clear terms It says in Section 2, Paragraph 8, that price stability is a key condition to maintaining the highest possible levels of productivity, real incomes, living standards, employment, and global competitiveness Under the statement of policy, the bill says that an environment conducive to both long-term economic growth and increases in standards of living is fostered by establishing and maintaining free markets, low taxes, respect for private property, and  -47-    9/26/95  the stable long-term purchasing power of the currency So, I think that the intent of the legislative wording is that the contribution of monetary policy toward achieving the goals originally set out in the Employment Act almost fifty years ago is to stabilize the value of the currency I simply am afraid that that is not what people would be hearing from a lot of our colleagues in the economics profession because they have a different model in mind "
5642,1995-11-15," Peter, your description of the arrangements with Japan and the very unfortunate press reports and confusing stories relating to all that and now this discussion following Cathy's question just emphasizes in my view how obsolete swap agreements are in this environment In the case where a country has very substantial amounts of dollar-denominated assets that they want to convert into dollar balances, frankly, this ""ain't"" the mechanism to use Swaps were set up in a period when we needed to get access to some foreign currencies that we did not have or when our foreign central bank counterparts needed to get access to dollars that they did not have But in today's world we need a mechanism for them to be able to convert dollar-denominated assets into dollar balances I looked down your list of foreign central banks in our swap network and I see fairly small swap lines Norway, $250 million; and Denmark, $250 million What is the probability that we would draw on these swap lines or that they would be in a situation where they needed to draw on them to get dollars? If I recall correctly,  So, if in keeping with the original intent of the swap line network a central bank wants access to dollars because they don't have any, we don't want to give it to them Therefore, when and how is there an appropriate use of swap agreements today, holding the Mexico discussion for a later meeting?  Mike, I have a couple of largely unrelated questions I will take them one at a time Your projections in the Greenbook of nominal GDP for 1996 and 1997 have been revised up from the previous Greenbook Nevertheless, nominal spending growth, after accelerating a bit to a little over 5 percent in the third quarter, is on a downward trend to under 4 percent in the second half of 1997 That was true before and it is still true in the latest Greenbook where it is down to the 38 to 39 percent range for the second half of 1997 Your forecast now also assumes a 5-3/4 percent fed funds rate--and I will make some remarks about that not appearing to be as restrictive as previously envisaged--and the bond market has rallied because markets thought that we would lower the funds rate If you take that away, it says bond yields are now expected to go back up from current levels while both nominal growth and real growth are going down I am trying to imagine how those work out, especially how they would play out in the marketplace if people actually saw things that were reported along the lines of the Greenbook projection What that means is that in the latter part of the projection period, you would have nominal interest rates running 2-1/4, 2-1/2 percentage points or more above nominal GDP growth What kind of stories would you tell about the anticipated inflation component of nominal interest rates versus the reported inflation rates that you project, or the anticipated or ex ante real rates as opposed to the real growth rates in your GDP projections? I have trouble reconciling what you say about financial markets, nominal interest rates, and your projections for the economy  Right It implies de facto a progressively more restrictive policy stance  My other question relates to productivity I very much welcome the discussion of higher productivity growth that was in the Greenbook--a sort of level effect and rate of change effect, the way I read it--as far as it went But it didn't go so far as to change the perceived output capacity situation versus the inflation rate We have this 3 percent inflation rate; we just sort of drove to it Once here, it seems we can't get away from it I want to offer an alternative way of reading the numbers and get your reaction to it I read a little of this in the Greenbook, but it just didn't go as far as I thought it might We not only have had a lot of investment in business fixed investment, to which Bob Parry was referring, but also a very substantial increase in business spending on training, both internal and external The response to the perceived tightness of the labor market--the Chairman commented at an earlier meeting about the insecurity of capital over the life of a given technology--has led companies to increase markedly the amount that they are spending to train their workers Resorting for efficiency reasons to economic jargon, that says to me that the horizontal axis does not measure the supply and demand for labor in homogeneous units because the quality of the labor force is changing, perhaps especially at the entry level That says to me that the inflation potential that you would have thought associated with a given physical capacity has to be different It's not a one-time  -15-    11/15/95  level effect to the extent that there is this persistent investment in human capital going on coupled with the changes in technology Whatever you previously thought would be the inflation rate associated with some output potential, it has got to be lower I don't see, in the Greenbook discussion or the projections, any allowance for those kinds of dynamics to lead to a lower rate of inflation than historical experience would suggest  Just one follow-up thought You remarked that training is a cost that needs to be passed through to prices This is not the case if it really is improving the value of what workers do Even if it is remedial, to the extent that the value of the marginal product of the work--that's what I meant about the horizontal axis units are not homogeneous--you are in effect shifting the labor supply function Then, for the same ECI, you would not expect to see the same associated consumer price index that you previously would have associated with it I don't know how big that is, just its direction  Sometimes the District reports make me think about 12 pistons in a reciprocating engine, with some rising and some falling It's hard to cut through it and know whether the engine is well tuned and humming along or not The Fourth District is definitely a piston that is coming down I've been struck by how consistently the reports from our Bank's business advisory council, our directors, and the other people that we have talked to have been in the negative direction since our meeting in September People are pulling down their expectations, not only to finish out this year but also for the first half of next year It may simply be because the District is so heavily influenced by automobiles Our manufacturing employment as a share of total employment is running about twice the national average so that when autos and trucks and even agricultural equipment soften--and they are distinctly softening--everything else  -23-    11/15/95  and everyone's attitudes also downshift That's pretty uniform throughout the District with the exception of the area around Lexington and the Georgetown automobile facility that is still expanding Everyone else is reporting that it is much easier to hire than before Their order books are softening; their backlogs are down There are almost no reports of the type we were hearing for a while about commodity prices of various types being the source of new inflation Other than some pickup in residential construction around the District--and people say they think that is related to lower mortgage rates--we see people mostly pulling back on the previous optimism  I worry about these kinds of anecdotal reports adding up over time to the mirror image of two years ago when we started to sense that the head winds were dissipating In terms of the things that we are concerned about, that kind of information we have about real economic activity translated for me into saying in the context of two years ago that the real equilibrium interest rate was starting to shift up If we don't make some adjustment, we will wind up with a de facto easing of policy relative to where we think it ought to be  If I am right about things going in the opposite direction of two years ago, we should start to see a pattern of people being surprised that the economic indicators are coming in weaker than they previously had expected We are hearing it not only in consumer goods but also in capital spending I would call that a downward revision in the equilibrium real rate We would be in a posture of winding up with a more restrictive policy relative to what is going on in the economy than we may later consider to have been appropriate I don't make forecasts anymore, but I do listen to the forecasts of my staff They tell me with a fair degree of confidence that real GDP growth this quarter will come in somewhere between minus 1 and plus 5 percent [Laughter] I'm not sure what to make of it, wherever it falls in that range But looking to next year, I am very troubled by that persistent 3 percent inflation rate shown in the Greenbook If that's the most likely outcome, in the sense of being consistent with the forecast of economic activity and the assumed stance of policy, then it's unacceptable But I don't have any basis for saying that it's wrong and that it's too high If I were still in the game of making forecasts, I would tell people that it is more likely to come in below those numbers than above those numbers  We moved to the 6 percent level on the funds rate at the beginning of this year in the context of coming off a year of over 4 percent real growth The final quarter of last year saw 5 percent real growth Not only the central tendency of the inflation forecasts of this group for 1995 but also the forecasts of a large majority of business economists, the Blue Chip list, The Wall Street Journal list, and so on had inflation accelerating considerably in 1995 Now, if 6 percent was the correct level in retrospect to have prevented the overshooting and spillover of excess demand and rise in prices that some people were worried about and we have now downshifted into a period of slower real growth and maybe less adverse inflation consequences, then clearly the nominal 6 percent federal funds rate was too high or too high to be sustained It was the right level to foster the downshift, but it has become increasingly restrictive as the economy has decelerated toward growth in the area of 2 percent So, I thought the fed funds rate decline of 1/4 percentage point in July and the reason given for it were exactly right, namely that we were less concerned about future inflation  When I look at the Greenbook forecast and the assumption of a 5-3/4 percent funds rate for the next two years, I say these don't compute Either the nominal GDP forecast in the Greenbook--and some split between output and prices--is wrong, or that 5-3/4 percent funds rate is too high So, I would like to be able to decide when the right time to lower the funds rate may be--not to ease policy, not to make it more stimulative, but when to avoid having it become inadvertently more restrictive than it should be to get to our objective My problem is that the Greenbook's projection of inflation at a 3 percent rate forever doesn't give us a good basis for lowering the funds rate For us to lower the funds rate when the Greenbook projection is at 3 percent inflation--and it seems that a majority of this group thinks that's about right--would be to send the wrong message even if we are trying to maintain the same thrust of policy by lowering the funds rate So, either I have to argue that I am convinced that inflation is going to be lower than the Greenbook projection and try to be persuasive--which I am not prepared to do--or else I have to acquiesce and say that a 3 percent inflation rate is acceptable--and I am not prepared to do that either So, while I would like to be arguing in favor of lowering the funds rate I don't  -52-    11/15/95  have a criterion for doing so and I am stuck with saying leave it alone until we come up with a good rationale for lowering it "
5667,1995-12-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman The only new piece of information of an optimistic type coming from our District was a report that recent shipments and backlogged orders for candlewicks were at record levels [Laughter] I have not seen that indicator before, and I don't know if staff can attest to its reliability! One of the chief executives of a major company said to me that if we want to avoid a pickup in inflation, we need to ease monetary policy very substantially I asked him to explain that He said that recently his sales were off, orders for the first half of next year did not look very good, earnings were under pressure, and if things did not pick up, he was going to have to raise his prices This is one of those occasions where I regret that this job prevents me from shorting his stock!  -26-    12/19/95  Western Pennsylvania resembles what Ed Boehne was describing for his District; it had been relatively soft throughout this period of robust expansion in the rest of the Cleveland District But the other parts of the District including all of Ohio and especially central and western Kentucky that had been so strong have distinctly cooled in every respect, especially in motor vehicles, metals-related industries, residential and nonresidential construction, and on down the list One director reported that pre-Christmas retail sales were very disappointing A banker responded that they have been disappointing for the last forty years, and so that exchange didn't seem to add too much to our knowledge  Two years ago at this time, we were contemplating head winds and the extent to which those head winds had diminished sufficiently so that we could start to raise the funds rate and get our foot off the gas pedal so to speak Everyone inside and outside the System agreed that a 3 percent funds rate was simply too low at that time A year ago at this time, we were observing tail winds We were busily reefing the main sails to keep them from gaining too much momentum and trying to figure out how high it was going to be necessary to take the funds rate in order to prevent an acceleration of inflation As it turns out with the advantage of hindsight, 6 percent was sufficient Whether it was more than sufficient is debatable, but it was certainly adequate for this round That says that 3 percent was too low and that 6 percent was at least sufficiently high, so we have the range bounded We are talking about where the rate should be in between Currently, at least from my District, it feels very much like the tail winds are diminishing Two years ago, our anecdotal information put us ahead of the Commerce Department or even the BLS statistics about the need to start raising the funds rate A year ago, our own anecdotal information or observations around the System led us to believe that we were reaching the topping-out point well before most forecasters were saying that we were going to stop raising the funds rate Now the information from the majority of us around the table tells me that we are a bit ahead of the numbers in hand and that de facto policy has become more restrictive I think that a 5-3/4 percent funds rate is now more restrictive than 6 percent was last February because of what has happened in between The anecdotal information says to me that the equilibrium real rate has moved down, and what we do about the nominal rate has become a question of timing  Let me make a normative comment or two about the Greenbook forecast I like the real growth rate and the employment and unemployment numbers projected through 1997 If they turn out to be close to the mark, I would be very happy with that result As some others have commented, I don't like the inflation numbers, especially the CPI numbers What is puzzling is that if we were targeting nominal GDP, I think the numbers in the Greenbook would look pretty acceptable to everybody, with growth in nominal GDP getting down to a rate of about 4 percent in the second half of 1997 If nominal GDP is cruising along at about 4 percent, that ought to get us pretty close to where we think we want to be in terms of the purchasing power of the dollar But the CPI doesn't show that kind of progress in the Greenbook projection, and I don't think the Greenbook is internally consistent on the policy assumption and the numbers that are being produced there I simply don't believe that a nominal 5-3/4 percent funds rate out well into 1997 is consistent with the kind of pattern that is being shown for nominal GDP Like Al Broaddus or Tom Melzer,  -27-    12/19/95  I would like to have a forecast that would move us in the direction of price stability Current policy at best is going to be influencing inflation in 1997 and beyond I would like very much to have a forecast that shows inflation at about a 2 percent rate at the end of 1997 The reason we can't ask the staff to produce such a forecast is that it requires us to raise unemployment or contract output or hold it below potential Since I don't want to do that, I can't ask the staff to produce a forecast of inflation that I can translate into an objective We have to sit and wait and hope that we get lucky and find that potential output turns out be higher than we thought, and we get positive productivity surprises that produce lower inflation That would be true even if we were at 10 percent inflation In this framework, once we get to full employment and potential output, it doesn't matter what the inflation rate is We are stuck with it forever until we produce a recession or raise the unemployment rate I don't want to do that I don't know how to end this process and establish an objective of lowering the 3 percent CPI to 2 percent or 1 percent or whatever number we said we were going to accept I am uncomfortable with this forecast because I believe fundamentally that if inflation rates are not moving down, they are moving up Yet, we have an inflation rate that continues unchanged forever out there, and I find that difficult to accept  Don, ignoring lags and transition problems, in a future steady state environment with nominal spending expanding at a 3 to 4 percent rate, output growing at potential, and the economy perceived to be at full employment with price stability, in what ball park would you guess the nominal fed funds rate would fall?  Maybe you answered it with this matrix and your other remarks It is all very interesting Maybe I didn't understand what you were saying; I am trying to clarify it Starting from where we are today--the perception of full employment, an economy operating at capacity, the current funds rate, and the inherited inflation rate as it is reported--what is the transition mechanism for getting the funds rate from where it is to where it would be in a steady state environment without creating slack?  What are the conditions under which you would say, without economic slack occurring or being forecast, that we move from the 5-3/4 percent funds rate to that steady state funds rate?  Mr Chairman, I think that over time the evidence will accumulate that your hypothesis is correct I am concerned that that evidence will accumulate very slowly, judged in terms of being persuasive to everybody within the System and to others who need to think about these things The slow but eventual acceptance of the evidence and the hypothesis means that policy ultimately, ex post, will be viewed as having been too tight for the evolving conditions I support the move today, but I think we need to be prepared to be a little more aggressive "
5690,1996-01-30," First of all, our District has a very large facility that has recently been added to our idle capacity and will stay idle for a long time--the Cleveland Browns' stadium [Laughter]  I think Mike Prell made a remark that it was a bad January It's always a bad January in my District [Laughter]  In December, the Chairman remarked that the economy had the feel of a car that had its hand brake on I think the economy not only has the hand brake on, but it has a flat tire We may be talking about a 12-wheeler, not an 18-wheeler, at this table, but I know one of those tires is flat We hear from large truck supply companies that their consensus forecast for sales of large trucks is going to be down 28 percent from last year think sales are going to be down that much; they say about 20 percent Large truck sales set a record last year when they were 8 percent above the previous record in 1994 In any case, when activity in an industry of that size drops off that sharply, there is going to be a substantial effect I am interested in what Mike Moskow said about autos Maybe he will elaborate, because we are not hearing the same story from auto and auto supply companies in our District They are much weaker There are indications that firms in the steel industry are going to try post another price increase They posted one last July; it did not hold Even if a new increase holds, it will leave steel prices below their level in the first quarter of last year Steel executives continue to tell us about the new capacity that will  -9-    1/30-31/96  be coming on line this year and next, so at least some of the folks we have talked to in that industry are telling us that they think steel prices are going to be under downward pressure  One of the reports that caught my interest came from an executive of a banking company that operates throughout the region He has seen a fairly significant pickup in commercial loan demand over the last couple of months It turns out, however, that he does not see the pickup as a sign of economic strength but rather of weakness He sees businesses hitting their bank lines because of cash flow constraints related to growing inventories that need to be financed His conjecture is consistent with early signs of some deceleration in the District business situation that we are seeing and hearing about  Let me turn to the Greenbook I do not know whether to be encouraged or discouraged On the one hand, when I look at the 3 percent inflation projection out through 1997, I can't find it acceptable if we have an objective of price stability Either we have to have a different model because the current assumptions are not going to produce the result that we want, or we have to cave in on what price performance is acceptable Don Kohn's presentation at the December meeting of an opportunistic framework for policy--where the Committee waits for something to happen--is a positive note The last time there was a break in the inflation trend--from the 4 percent or so underlying trend rate that had prevailed for 7 or 8 years to a 3 percent trend rate--was in 1991 Our staff does a break analysis that says inflation has been on a 3 percent trend since 1991 My sense in talking with people, my staff in particular, and doing some reading about the 1990-91 period is that there was no indication at the time that a break was imminent Only sometime later could we say that the trend broke and we were now operating at a 3 percent inflation rate There is some tentative evidence that we could already be in the early stages of another break, but we are not going to know for a while Even though the central tendency of the members' inflation forecasts prepared for this meeting shows a rate a little below 3 percent, but in that range, and the Board staff projection is 3 percent, that does not discourage me as much as it might normally That's because I do not think we will be able to anticipate the next downward break in the underlying rate I would like to finish 1997 with an inflation rate around 2 percent, and I do not see anything that persuades me that that is impossible from here I don't really understand, using Don's framework of last December, how we can know when to be opportunistic and respond A part of the explanation as to why the 1995 inflation forecasts of a year ago, our own and the Blue Chip, did not materialize was that we had a favorable productivity shock If that is a good description of what happened, that we got lucky, there should have been some opportunity to lock in a break in the trend of inflation I don't see that opportunity yet in the forecast  In his presentation, Dave Lindsey mentioned the issue of the consistency of the central tendency of the members' GDP projections for 1996 with the alternative ranges for the monetary aggregates and whether we should move away from Alternative I But even if we were using the aggregates as an indicator variable of the thrust of monetary policy, we would need to know the numbers for 1997 because there would be lags To be consistent, we would have to say that here is the objective that the Committee is seeking and here is the monetary policy that would produce that result If you took the Greenbook projection as the appropriate forecast for nominal GDP, then you would have to project velocity and indicate what money growth in 1996 is going to be consistent with your objectives for 1997 I don't think that we know enough to do that I don't know what the staff's answer to that would be if we asked I don't believe we need to ask, because I don't think we know enough to say that it should be different from Alternative I So, the arguments about the merits of using Alternatives II or III simply are not persuasive to me I also believe that the arguments we used last July were right Moreover, it would be difficult to tell Senator Mack or anybody else that we need to change the law to focus on objectives and at the same time say to him that, by the way, we are changing the ranges for the monetary aggregates for this or that reason but we don't think the ranges are useful I don't think it is consistent to say that the ranges are not useful, but the law requires us to set them and we are changing them  It will be a long time, if ever, before a consensus emerges about the success or failure of monetary targeting over the last 20 years or so As far as I am aware, of all of the central banks around the world that have experimented with monetary targeting only the Deutsche Bundesbank continues to do so and continues to argue that it has been successful It does continue to be successful and German economists outside the Bundesbank also argue that way While this would be considered heresy by some of my professional friends, I think even in the case of the Bundesbank that monetary targeting was neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving the results that they obtained over a period of time What happened to the Federal Reserve was that monetary targeting was imposed on an unwilling central bank in 1975 and then again in legislation in 1978, whereas the Bundesbank adopted monetary targeting as a means to achieve a very clear, single objective There was some help for the Bundesbank from enabling legislation The Federal Reserve did not have that sort of help, nor did the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, and so on I think that a central bank that adopts a very clear, single objective for price stability has more freedom to formulate its policy and achieve that objective On the other hand, one that uses something like monetary aggregates ranges as a monitoring device or as a communications device without a clear objective is going to have political problems and even problems in formulating policy I think the most important thing is to emphasize clearly the single objective of price stability and to lay that out into the future It has to be a multiyear objective I think it's better if it comes from within the organization Yesterday, Vice Chairman McDonough mentioned the transition cost problems, but we don't know what those transition cost problems are because of the issue of credibility Nobody else can really estimate them either With regard to the numbers in the Bluebook to which Cathy referred, Don Kohn is quite clear in saying that they take no account of improving credibility  If we can enhance our own position, not only with regard to the Congress but with regard to the American public, by very clearly articulating and setting out a time path for achieving price stability and if--a big if--that is credible and people really believe we will deliver on it, we will minimize the transition costs of lost output As I said last year, I still worry about future Congressional hearings The very well known, well respected members of our profession will focus more than I would like on the transition cost argument--on lost output and how many people will be thrown out of a job in order to achieve the price stability objective That will distract from the underlying issue that achieving price stability is growth-enhancing; it raises standards of living That's why we are trying to do it I would rather see this Committee say, with or without the Mack legislation, that we have adopted a single objective  -40-    1/30-31/96  and that it is a way of achieving the objectives of the Full Employment Act I am not even sure that requires legislation  As I listened to Dave Stockton's remarks about downward wage rigidity, I was struck by how odd that sounds in the context of the last couple of years when people around this table and elsewhere have been puzzling over upward wage rigidity Why haven't wages been rising more rapidly in the environment that we have been in? The question, which doesn't really need to be answered but needs to be thought about, is whether the rigidity is symmetrical or not The inference has been that an asymmetry is involved but that is not at all obvious  On the issue of symmetry and credibility, a simple interpretation of the Bluebook would be that if we were to set an objective of raising the inflation rate to 5 percent, we could increase nominal GDP by 8 percent If we were to take that proposal up to Capitol Hill, some people there probably would say, ""go for it"" Does anybody around this table believe that, if we established a policy of raising the inflation rate and announced a policy of raising it to 5 percent, we would increase GDP? Well, of course not If the rigidity is symmetrical, that also says something about the costs of getting to lower inflation  In our discussions around the table, we talk on occasion about our ignorance, about how little we know about a lot of things such as lags, instrument variables, and so on But at times I am impressed by the collective judgment of this group in assessing what is going on in the economy and knowing how to make the policy adjustments that are needed Two years ago we started raising the funds rate well before professional economists in the business community, academia, and Wall Street were saying we should or even before our models and staff projections were indicating the need Had we listened to some of those Fedwatcher views or looked at Blue Chip or staff projections, we would not have begun to tighten when we did We tightened because we had information that told us, in the terminology that we use now, that the equilibrium real rate was rising, things were starting to move, and we made an adjustment that was appropriate  A year ago at this time many of those outside observers were saying that we were going to be pushing the funds rate up to something like 7, 7-1/2, or 8 percent Again, on the basis of our collective judgment we went to a 6 percent funds rate a year ago, but we said we were getting to the stop-out point I supported that move with the idea that it was an insurance policy I was not convinced that it was necessary, but in terms of potential errors it would be the least costly to correct And given market psychology and other factors at the time, I thought that it was wise to raise the funds rate to the 6 percent level so long as we were willing to retrace that move if that insurance turned out not to be necessary  So, I view what we did in July and December as simply having cancelled the insurance that we took out a year ago In the meantime, I have a sense that the equilibrium real rate has moved down from whatever it was a year ago Your description of household inventories--the stocks of real goods held by consumers--carries a counterpart in terms of attitudes toward financial assets and financial liabilities If consumers believe they have reached the saturation point for the moment in their stocks of certain consumer durables, the counterpart is that they are going to be trying to reduce their financial liabilities or to increase their financial assets They are adjusting their net financial positions, which is  -55-    1/30-31/96  also consistent with the idea that the equilibrium real rate has moved down  If I thought that the Greenbook/Bluebook projections were correct about a 5-1/2 percent funds rate producing a 3 percent inflation rate out through 1997, I would have to be arguing for raising the funds rate The only way I can support reducing the funds rate is to be consistent and say that I don't believe those projections I have to believe that we are in an environment where the inflation rate will come in lower than is indicated by either the central tendency of the Committee members' forecasts or the Bluebook/Greenbook projections If that turns out to be wrong, then I will be out in front saying, ""Let's get the funds rate back up because we simply were wrong"" For now, I am comfortable with the idea that it is appropriate to move the funds rate down and see whether or not inflation in fact comes in at a lower rate "
5714,1996-03-26," Mike, when you first gave us the projections for 1997 in the September Greenbook, the nominal GDP growth in that initial projection was a very hopeful path to me because it had nominal GDP growing just under 4 percent for the full year That seemed about right to me But in this Greenbook, your upward revision    3/26/96  of nominal GDP by a full percentage point for 1997 jumped out at me You now have it rising just under 5 percent, and I know your real output numbers have not changed that much Even the CPI is only about 01 percent higher than you had it before As I look at this puzzle and ask where the change is coming from, of course, it is all in the deflator What changed your thinking so that you now have nominal GDP growing a percentage point faster in 1997 than you were projecting six months, or even four months, ago?  By a full percentage point  Can I just follow up on that as regards further work? Mike, had you said in response to my initial question that you had been assuming a monetary policy indexed by a 6 percent funds rate --or, I guess, it was 5-3/4 percent at that time--and that the 1/2 percentage point drop since then is what did it, then we could have talked about that, or a change in fiscal thrust, or something Or, coming at it from a different framework, if you had said that monetary growth is now producing much more total spending, then we could have talked about that change So, the underlying question that has to be embodied in your answer once you come back to this is that at the end of the day we are still trying to decide whether a 5-1/4 percent funds rate is too high, too low, or just right  The Fourth District is in between Ed Boehne's and Mike Moskow's Districts, but so much for geography It is hard to get a reading not only on what is actually happening but on what is expected in our area for this year and the year ahead--the time horizon that is relevant for policy discussions--especially when the national statistics are so troublesome An optimistic note for the longer term from one of our directors--he called it an optimistic note anyway--was his report that applications for admission to law school this fall are down 20 percent In trying to filter all the anecdotal information, the Beigebook report for our District was definitely more upbeat than the previous couple of Beigebooks One director who has lived in the area all his life noted that this change in mood happens every spring Sometimes it is a reflection of how bad the winter was Since this was the second worst winter of the century, a rebound may not be too surprising That also may explain some of the resiliency of the national economy that both Governor Kelley and Ed Boehne noted, and I will come back to that in a moment  You may have seen the other front page article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal that covered the export industries, including those in Ohio, and indicated how that sector of the economy has served as an underpinning to overall economic activity to an extent that may not have received the attention it deserves Another issue that we have been looking into is retail sales Our region of the country is incredibly strong in retailing companies, companies that operate not only nationally but even globally There are consistent reports of much stronger catalog sales; their mail order sales are continuing to rise very sharply as a percent of their totals, often at double-digit rates This raises questions about how much of that is domestic and how much of it is what we would call exports, whether it gets reported that way or not A new phenomenon that people are citing, though it is hard to quantify, is Internet sales, ordering from these companies through the Internet for shipments abroad and bypassing the usual retail distribution problems that exist in Japan in particular but also in other places around the world The Commerce Department says that at this point they don't have a good handle on either the magnitude of this or what it is contributing to total sales They are pretty certain that they are underestimating total sales, but they can't quantify it  -19-    3/26/96  Because of the difficulty of interpreting the numbers, I made a special effort yesterday to get the first-quarter report of the National Federation of Independent Businesses that will be released in a few days Not unlike the comments around the table this morning, the report will be fairly mixed Employment plans are down somewhat from the earlier report while capital spending plans are up, which is contrary to the commentary in the Wall Street Journal column and the general concerns about capital spending Small businesses indicate that they will increase such spending this year to what would be a record level in the index  The inflation news is fairly good Fewer firms are now planning to increase their prices this year than in previous reports This still raises in my mind some very fundamental questions about the process by which an inflationary phenomenon is created I don't think of inflation as being rising prices In one sense, I am very encouraged as regards the national economy It is one of those stories about the water glass being half full or half empty Compared to a year ago, inflation psychology seems to have improved by about 1/2 percentage point A year ago at this time, the general forecast was that inflation would rise to about 3-1/2 percent The current expansion has now lasted several years and every year the forecast has been that inflation would go up Finally, we are at a point where the forecast is that inflation is going to remain the same this year It may be too much for us to expect people to say that inflation will go down next year So, we have to go through a transition period of at least no longer forecasting rising inflation to get comfortable with the idea that, even as we head into the sixth year of the expansion, inflation is going to remain the same The next step is for people to adjust psychologically to that, and in the future inflation actually will go down  I am trying to interpret what has been going on in asset markets and separate the real from the inflation components We have to be very careful in what we think we know about that What has been encouraging about all the commentary this morning and the reports we have seen about the resiliency of the economy is that no one is saying that this is a result of good old-fashioned, pump-priming monetary and fiscal stimulus, but rather it is what markets do When depressants are absent, markets tend to create a process by which an economy expands If that is a valid interpretation of the dynamics at work out there, then I don't think we have to be nearly as concerned about an increase in inflation as we would if we were concluding that either monetary or fiscal policy was pumping up aggregate demand That relates to my earlier concern when I asked Mike Prell about the Greenbook, but we will have to discuss that another time I am still not comfortable with the Greenbook projection of inflation for 1997; I would like to see it lower If I firmly believed that the Greenbook was correct and we would have yet another year of about 3 percent inflation, I would find that unacceptable So, I have to conclude by simply hoping that they are wrong  I agree with leaving the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at the present time But in the context of Al Broaddus's suggestion about monitoring the incoming information and deciding what to do in the future, I think we need to think more about what the yield curve is telling us and try to reach some consensus about it In his remarks, Don traced what was happening in the forward and futures markets I was on the Morning Call during this period and paid more than usual attention to daily movements in interest rates The yield curve at the end of January and in early February was priced off a 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent funds rate The only thing that was at 5-1/4 percent was the overnight federal funds rate The rest of the yield curve--3-month bills on out to the 30-year bond --was priced to be at least 50 basis points lower by Labor Day I don't know what people have in mind in the way of a transmission mechanism of monetary policy to real economic activity, but I thought that the markets simply were well ahead of us for whatever reason perceptions of a weak economy, inflation expectations, or whatever They simply readjusted to economic developments and that had to happen In that sense, we had a relative movement toward less stimulus even though the funds rate did not change, and it should not change for the time being But as we interpret numbers in the future and decide how to react to them, I think we need to be very, very careful about whether the market is ahead of us, behind us, or whatever "
5736,1996-05-21," The most noticeable change since the last meeting has been orange construction-site barrels sprouting all over the Great Lakes region Infrastructure construction is in full swing It was explained to me recently that Cleveland in particular has been benefiting greatly from such construction That is because, while Atlanta has the Olympics, we have a Bicentennial Year with a former mayor who is now governor and wants to be Vice President That does wonders for suburban infrastructure spending! The irony of prosperity is that everything is closed for renovation and repairs [Laughter] What apparently are not going to be sprouting in the region are crops In the last couple of weeks we have heard a lot of statements that are alarming They are in sharp contrast with what we were being told in March and April by bankers and individuals directly active in farming --farmers, equipment suppliers, seed suppliers--that high grain prices caused by the drought in other areas would make this the best year for the agricultural economy in memory for farmers in our region Now that our farmers have already sold in the futures markets the crops that they have not been able to plant, people think it will be the worst year for the agricultural economy in memory I do not know how pervasive the problem is, but I was told that as of last Friday, only 6 percent of the corn crop was planted in Ohio Farmers say that if they do not have the corn planted by mid-May, they will switch to beans or some other crops I am not certain how reliable that deadline is  Well, people are saying that there will be no corn harvest in our area, but I am not so sure about that Others are telling us that the Amish do not have any problem; their horses are not slowed down by the rain The stories also are very negative regarding the nationwide wheat and corn crops, and that carries over to chickens, hogs, and ultimately beef I am not sure what to make of it all Our bankers say that they are worried; they have a lot of farmers who were just too enthusiastic about selling crops for forward delivery, and that will result in a financial problem later this summer  I recently participated in a round of meetings with about 40 people on our joint boards of directors and our small business and bank advisory councils One of the questions I asked them was whether they were more or less optimistic about the economy than they had been at the beginning of the year Except for one software company, they were consistently more optimistic even though the almost universal belief was that there will be an extensive General Motors strike The auto supply companies and others are saying that GM has no alternative but to endure a lengthy strike if that is needed to adjust their badly  -25-    5/21/96  misaligned cost structure to everyone else's With regard to the software industry, there has been an increasingly strident claim that its growth is a bubble, that there is a severe downside risk associated with overpaying for these firms, and that one of these days we will see a very sharp correction in that industry  Let me comment on some of the discussions we have heard on national issues What the income side is telling us about the national income accounts in the economy is an important issue It may explain why sometimes when we listen to the regional reports based on anecdotal information, they sound like we have achieved the Lake ""Woe- begone"" economy where everybody is performing above average An example is the anecdotes that we hear about productivity When we ask them, people consistently tell us that their productivity improvements are substantially higher than those in the national statistics We have to be cautious about how we interpret those reports and how much confidence we can have in them  The exchange earlier today, which Governor Yellen also referred to, between the Chairman and Al Broaddus involves an issue that we all ought to settle in our own minds Early this year it was said that interest rates had dropped as much as they had on the expectation that the expansion not only was going to be weaker than had been anticipated earlier, but that the economy might even be moving toward a borderline recession The subsequent runup in interest rates occurred because the economy turned out to be stronger than people thought it was going to be But the runup in interest rates also implied that the expansion eventually would slow, which presumably would mean that interest rates would come down, which means the economy will then strengthen As to what that says about policy, it is pretty clear that at the beginning of the year and at least until early February, intermediate-term rates out to 10 years at least were based on an expectation of further reductions in short-term interest rates My own conclusion is that today's rates, about 660 percent on the 10-year maturity, are consistent with an unchanged level of the funds rate They are not based on the expectation that the funds rate will go up but rather on a reversal of the prior expectation that it will go down I think everybody should try to settle that issue in their own mind  With regard to the economic outlook for the nation, surveys such as those on consumer sentiment or the Blue Chip don't do much for me Early this year we saw a lot of stories about the severe winter weather--record snowfalls, low temperatures, and all the evidence that we are going into a new Ice Age Last week we heard evidence that we are in a period of global warming! I hope our judgments about the economy are more soundly based than those stories about the weather  I think that if people outside this room who pay close attention to these matters saw the Greenbook inflation forecast for this year and next year and heard some of the comments and concerns that people around this table have expressed about the inflation outlook, we would be sending a very bad message by not taking action today So, fortunately, outsiders don't see or hear those things [Laughter] If the minutes of this meeting, which will come out right after the next meeting, and comments that people make in the meantime convey the idea that we see a worsening of inflation and are not doing anything, I think that would provide a bad message If that is what happens, then I am going to regret that we did not take action If I believed the Greenbook inflation forecast, I would have to say that we should tighten monetary policy I would not want my views in that case to be taken as acceptance of the kind of inflation prospects that we are being presented with I think that outlook is totally unacceptable I didn't view the reduction in the  -34-    5/21/96  federal funds rate on January 31 as an insurance policy against the downside risks in the real economy The way I thought about it was that, on the basis of the information we were getting, the equilibrium real funds rate appeared to have moved down from what I felt was an appropriate level, and to avoid a de facto tightening of policy, the nominal funds rate needed to come down from the 5-1/2 percent level where it had been since November 1995 I think Don Kohn is correct in his assessment that more recent developments have reversed that decline in the real funds rate, and had I anticipated those developments, I would not have supported the 1/4 point reduction on January 31 But I also am not persuaded that this strength in the economy is likely to be enduring enough that we need to move the funds rate back up to where it was before January 31 So, I support a no- change, symmetric directive, though with considerable concern about how it will be interpreted  Don, when you use the word ""forecast,"" you immediately put me off because it is inconsistent with saying ""goals and objectives"" In principle, of course, I think we ought to provide numbers to indicate what we are trying to achieve in 1998 and beyond in order to maintain the purchasing power of the dollar It is simply inconsistent to have the Congressional Budget Office or the Administration publish inflation assumptions through the year 2002 on which to base a budget without any information as to whether or not those assumptions are acceptable to us in terms of the way we gear our policies If the numbers that go into that process do not come from us, they should at least be influenced by us I would like to put out numbers on inflation goals that we intend to achieve However, as we have seen in these discussions before, if the number is to be 3 percent inflation for 1998, I don't want to publish it I have a real problem with agreeing to publish a number if it is one that is going  -41-    5/21/96  to reflect somebody's best guess as to what the dynamics of this Committee and interactions from some models will produce rather than a clear and attainable goal for reducing inflation  My second problem, though not a new one, is the framework If we supply a number for inflation, my own number would be 2 percent for 1998, and then the staff puts together a matrix that indicates how many people would have to be thrown out of work and how much output would have to be sacrificed to get to 2 percent inflation in that year, I am not going to want to publish that either Perhaps the staff could at least humor those of us with analytical frameworks that differ from the gap or the NAIRU approach by including a reasonableness check It would say that to achieve a goal for inflation--I will use 2 percent in 1998 as an illustration--one would need a specified growth in productivity over the interval to 1998 The staff also would indicate what counterpart reduction in the natural rate of unemployment would occur and provide some idea of the rate of sustained economic growth that would be consistent with reaching the inflation goal without reference to the notion of a Phillips curve tradeoff or sacrifice of output Then, I and perhaps others could look at that analysis and decide whether it was a reasonable approximation of what was going on in the economy in terms of faster growth in productivity, the result of all of the investments taking place, and faster growth in capacity than allowed for in the staff model I could decide whether I was willing to base policy on it At least I would have a range in which to work  Not each one  No, but you could do it in terms of a range We are not talking about a GDP forecast The question is how much would productivity and capacity have to increase over and above what you have in your assumption to be consistent with moving toward 2 percent inflation--whatever unemployment rate falls out of that, perhaps a NAIRU of 4-1/2 percent or whatever, I don't know what the number is going to be--without sacrificing output and without creating a gap I know your framework says that given where we are, an objective of 2 percent inflation requires us to raise the unemployment rate above the NAIRU and to reduce output below potential to create a gap I don't want to do that "
5759,1996-07-02," Peter, I have a question about your domestic operations When I see something like a 50 percent fed funds rate, it catches my attention In your comments you made some reference to the inefficiencies and anomalies in the distribution of reserves yesterday and again today that initially led banks to think that the market for reserves was tighter than was actually the case What all that says    7/2-3/96  to me is that there is an inefficiency in the market due to the quality of the information Some of that information we have It is an infinite regression sort of thing We are trying to guess at what bankers' behavior is going to be over the maintenance period Their strategy is to run reserve deficiencies until the 14th day of the period and then look to us on settlement day as the reserve supplier of last resort We and they guess at what the total supply of reserves is in the market and its distribution, and on the last day of the period they come in to borrow from the Federal Reserve Can't we improve on that somewhat either in the quality of the information we give them or the way we operate to smooth out the availability of reserves over the maintenance period?  Will what you come back with address the fundamental issue of the current reserve settlement structure, which as I recall was set up in the early 1980s to improve the control of Ml? That was the motivation, which is no longer relevant, for setting up this kind of settlement procedure  Mike, I want to ask a question to get your response from the standpoint of the forecast, but I also want to get Peter Fisher's response from the standpoint of how the market would react You made reference to slight declines in longer-term interest rates; you used the 10-year rate in the chart As I think about your forecast for the next six months, I ask myself what is going to happen after real GDP decelerates from an indicated growth rate of around 4 percent in the second quarter to rates in your forecast of 23 and 19 percent in the third and fourth quarters; the monthly average for the CPI is an increase of 2 percent for the remaining seven months of the year; housing starts drop from the 146 - 147 million area; motor vehicle sales and production drop from a rate of over 15 million units to something below that; and job growth slows to increases of only 100,000 a month in the final three months of the year I wonder what the reaction is going to be in the bond market, if that pattern of economic statistics is seen as unfolding Is that consistent with only a slight decline in bond yields?  I will begin by saying that we seem to have ""weathered"" another price scare in agriculture At the May meeting, I reported on the wet conditions that were panicking the farmers in our area Many had sold crops that they had not yet planted, and because of the adverse weather conditions the day was getting very close when it would be too late in the season for them to plant a crop This was going to be a very big problem In fact, there is an article in today's Wall Street Journal about some of the problems stemming from that However, our farmers got a window of a few dry days, as we are prone to get every year in our region Because of ""no till"" farming, they are now able to get a crop in the ground in a few days that literally would have taken weeks before This raises some interesting questions about measuring productivity in agriculture What we would compare is a crop that was planted under old technology with one that was planted under new technology to see how much less labor was used But how do we take into account crops that simply would not have been planted under old technology because it was too late in the season to  -28-    7/2-3/96  do so? In any event, we are going to have a good agricultural year in our region even though our productivity figures are not going to show the real benefits of the new technology  At the March and May meetings, we were worried that the rise in energy and food prices would become more generalized throughout the economy and would therefore set a tone of broadly escalating rates of inflation It now seems that this has been another episode like last year's paper price scare when the concern was that we were going to have shortages of paper forever That fear has now vanished Before that it was metals Last year we also had to worry about Class 8 trucks being produced at unsustainable levels well above capacity, but now the production levels are down 25 percent from a year ago At one point we worried about escalating prices of lumber and other building materials as being the acorn that could grow into a generalized inflation One after another, these concerns have popped up and have gone away In line with Jack Guynn's remarks, I think that these are good reminders that generalized price inflation is not caused by isolated events As long as we keep an effective lid on the growth of aggregate demand, these price changes, up and down, are critical really to the efficient performance of the economy  I want to comment about the productivity issue Bill McDonough raised some questions about the labor productivity chart in the Chart Show and Larry Meyer also made reference to it When we look at a chart like that, we know that for a growing share of the economy there is no improvement in labor productivity because we measure the output in those parts of the economy by labor inputs and we define the latter as not having any productivity growth So, there is both a cyclical dimension and a secular dimension to that chart The cyclical relates to periods when there is a pickup in economic activity that tends to be concentrated in sectors of the economy, notably in manufacturing where, according to the data that we use, the proportion of labor having high productivity growth rises relative to labor defined as having no productivity improvement In such a period we would expect to see an increase in overall productivity and vice versa in a cyclical downturn But in the secular sense, we are moving increasingly toward a situation where labor productivity in that chart will have no growth at all If we define 99 percent of the economy as involving industries where there is no labor productivity growth, then the economy's overall productivity growth has to approach zero So, instead of saying that productivity has been stuck at 1 percent or 11 percent or whatever the number is, the question should be, why hasn't it gone down?  The anecdotal reports at the micro level tell us that productivity is booming, especially in manufacturing where productivity gains of 4 or 5 percent or sometimes even 6 or 7 percent are mentioned In order not to have one iota of improvement in productivity at the macro level, as somebody was quoted as saying, we have to have at least a sharp slowing in productivity growth in nonmanufacturing sectors of the economy if not an absolute decline Then the question becomes, is that credible given what is going on in the world today? Statistically, we know how it is happening We know that total factor productivity is measured as declining in such sectors as financial services,, because output is falling or there is less labor employed with more nonlabor factors As a result we have negative total factor productivity We add that to manufacturing  -29-    7/2-3/96  which has big productivity gains, and there it is, 1 percent productivity growth again But that is really masking the dynamics of what is going on in the economy We all know that at the micro level improved productivity means less inflationary pressure, but then somehow we get caught up in this loop that says increased productivity gets added together with labor This means more output and that somehow causes inflation That does not compute  As we go around the Fourth District asking questions about plans for price increases, the disconnect in the responses that we get is certainly interesting and I suspect a lot of business people think the same way as our contacts When we ask them what their pricing plans are for their products over the next five years, they say they are going to try to maintain their prices or reduce them as slowly as possible We do not hear anybody talking about raising prices The question for these people is whether they can assume that their prices will stay the same or how much they think they may have to cut them Then we ask them, what is their inflation forecast? They will usually give a number like 3 percent When we ask why, they say that is the CPI rate of inflation When we probe into this, we find it mainly means that that is what they think is going to happen to their labor costs Then we ask, how does this work? If you are not going to increase the prices of your products and your wages are going to go up 3 percent on average, how do you do it? Then they tell us productivity stories It is interesting in an ironic way that, for a lot of the economy, the more efficient the sector, the less productive it is estimated to be, if we can figure out what that means  We also ask people a lot of questions about what they worry about The frequency with which companies talk about financial stresses is interesting Generally, we hear comments from bankers and nonbankers alike who are worried about declining credit quality, slowing collections of receivables, and rising delinquencies and late payments Such comments are more frequent than Mike's charts would suggest or than the national data show Companies tell us that they were surprised at how good the first half was but also that their free cash flow is falling So something is not quite right In the second half of this year, if the Greenbook forecast is correct, we will have to be alert to the debt service burdens, which will be a growing problem because those Greenbook numbers imply that revenue and sales growth will be a lot slower We are going to see squeezes on earnings, as most firms expect and the national projections suggest We will hear more stories about the cost of carrying the inventory that apparently is being built up, and people are going to say that their financing is getting more burdensome So, I think that six months from now we may be quite concerned about more financial stresses in the economy than seem to exist today  Let me also comment about the labor markets There is good news/bad news in the Bluebooks I went back over the last six years of these semiannual projection exercises, at the beginning of the year and in July, that look out five years The good news is that the staff keeps notching down the unemployment rates associated with a given inflation path and the inflation path has not been notched up If anything, it is down slightly over those semiannual intervals I try to imagine what we will be looking at when we come back in January or February for the next semiannual review Currently and for the last year, all but four of the large eleven states for which we have  -30-    7/2-3/96  the data have unemployment rates that are well below the 5-3/4 percent staff estimate of the NAIRU Three of the four other states, as we heard this afternoon, have experienced rapid growth in employment California, Texas and New York Bill McDonough mentioned that unemployment fell to a five-year low in the fourth state, New Jersey The unemployment rate for the other seven states is below 5 percent What is going to happen? If employment continues to grow as rapidly as people anticipate and the unemployment rate moves down in some other states, especially those that produce motor vehicles--Mike Moskow mentioned Wisconsin and we know that very low unemployment rates already exist in Kentucky and Tennessee--will we talk six months from now about 5 percent unemployment and yet lower inflation? I hope so  I'm not sure I'm going to offer anything helpful in terms of how this discussion is progressing I may want to come back in a moment to the issues about productivity because I think that the incentive effects, on business decision-makers in particular, with regard to efficiency and productivity versus what Janet was citing about wage cuts are an important manifestation of what we are trying to do The Chairman's version does not affect business decisions  In my view, businesses and households make their best decisions about the future, whether personal investment decisions or business decisions, when they expect the purchasing power of the dollar to be the same in the future as it is today It may turn out to be somewhat more or somewhat less, but people make the most efficient decisions about the allocation of resources when they expect the value of the dollar to be the same later as it is currently If I could be persuaded that permanently eroding or conceivably increasing the purchasing power of the currency, changing the standard of value over time, somehow improves resource allocation and standards of living, I would be very interested But I am not persuaded If we can create a situation in which people say that the dollar will purchase the same in the future as it does today and they proceed to base their decisions on that expectation as the most probable outcome, we then would get standards of living that rise at their maximum potential We also would get maximum employment and the other developments that foster economic well being The question about an inflation objective versus a price level objective is relevant only if we do not have instant and total forgetfulness If bygones are totally bygones no matter what happened yesterday, and if all of prior history has no effect on people, and their best expectation for the future is that the dollar will buy the same later as it does today, then there simply is no difference between the two types of objectives They are identical A difference comes into play only to the extent that there is a credibility issue If there is uncertainty about the objective, people will treat yesterday's price shocks as something that we will or will not offset We then get a difference between a price level objective and an inflation objective If we are going to talk about the difference between those two, we have to talk about credibility and how we can achieve it  -51-    7/2-3/96  With regard to international comparisons, I too thought about Canada I have looked at it and tried to understand whether there is something useful for us to learn there or not Since I do not speak French and do not know what to do about the problem of Quebec, I usually focus on the other provinces Investment in British Columbia and Alberta is extraordinarily different from that in the Maritimes, for instance If I had to conclude anything about Canada in the last few years, given the separatist effort, I would say that I just do not find its experience useful for the United States I would rather say let us learn from New Zealand because they reduced inflation to 2 percent and had 6 percent real GDP growth But my guess is that other people would not find that the right place for us to learn from  If I were going to do surveys about wage cuts or increases of the sort that Janet reported on, one of the surveys I would want to conduct is to ask people as we approach the end of this century to choose between two things If the central bank had an objective of reducing the purchasing power of the dollar to 13 cents or 7 cents over the next century, which would you prefer? I would expect the majority of the responses to be, why are you going to reduce it at all? Explain to me why the dollar is not going to purchase the same at the end of the next century as it does today The difference between 13 cents and 7 cents is the difference between a 2 percent rate of inflation and a 3 percent rate of inflation over 100 years I think most people would view that as a silly alternative They would say, why not zero inflation  David, John Carlson on my staff has been doing some work with MZM [Money with Zero Maturity]; have you looked at that recently?  -69-    7/2-3/96  I think your analysis is right about the dangers of using MZM if something causes an acceleration of inflation so that we get a misreading of what that indicator is telling us But it is somewhat less interest sensitive than the old M1 We have the problem of sweep accounts with the M1 measure that we do not have with MZM So, I would suggest that you drop the Ml measure, continue to produce the charts and the opportunity costs because it will get more and more difficult to make sense out of these sweep adjustments, substitute MZM, pay attention to it, and let us see how it behaves over time Its opportunity-cost relationship is strikingly tight  Thank you I agree with your initial remark about the message that would be sent by changing the ranges and to me that consideration dominates But with regard to the substance of the    7/2-3/96  ranges that we announce and any information content they may have, we know that the lags are fairly long It is not just 1997 that we need to be thinking about, though that is what we have to announce, but 1998 and later If evidence should emerge that the velocity of M2 is stabilizing at essentially a zero drift or trend, we would then want to cap nominal income growth In Governor Lindsey's 2 plus 2 example, would we want to be considering a world in which nominal spending rises faster than 5 percent? I do not think so I think holding the range at 1 to 5 percent sends the message that we are capping total spending growth at no more than 5 percent, allowing for the real growth in productivity and making certain that inflation is still on a downward trend So, I think it would a mistake to shift from the current 1 to 5 percent range  Don, I want to ask you about your relative confidence level for variables used in your forecast But in view of your response to Tom Melzer just now, I am not sure whether I should rethink the question In your prepared remarks, you used the Philadelphia Fed survey of expected CPI inflation, but the Bluebook looked at the PCE to draw conclusions about the real rate The critical variables in the staff forecast are the assumption that the real fed funds rate is 2-3/4 percent, some measure of inflation and inflation expectations--the sort of thing we discussed yesterday--and the NAIRU versus current unemployment With the nominal 5-1/4 percent funds rate and with inflation measured by the PCE, one would say that we were at a 2-3/4 percent real funds rate, that inflation is in the zone of 2 percent, and that unemployment is whatever number is going to be reported on Friday for the month of June; it has been in the area of 5-1/2 percent So, what is the problem? The problem in this framework is that the inflation rate has to go up from where it is because current unemployment is below the NAIRU That rise in inflation will reduce the real fed funds rate unless we raise the    7/2-3/96  nominal fed funds rate The only way we can get from where we are to equilibrium is through that mechanism The confidence question is If you look at your key component variables, where would you say the weak links or the strong links are located? Is your confidence in the 5- 3/4 percent NAIRU instead of, say, 5-1/2 or 5-1/4 percent? Is it in the 2-3/4 percent real fed funds rate versus 2-1/2 or 2-1/4 percent? Or is it in a particular measure of inflation or inflation expectations?  What about your assumption regarding the real fed funds rate?  You have made me feel a lot more confident! [Laughter]  I think the reasons for a change in the direction of policy have to be even more convincing than for a change in the same direction as prior moves Our action in early 1994, which subsequently was viewed as having been correct by people on the outside, was very important in that regard If I were as convinced as some of the people around the table that the current stance of policy is too expansionary, I would not only support a 1/4 point change, I would say, let's move at least 1/2 point to get to where we need to be If I were as convinced as my own staff that the reduction in January of this year was wrong, I would want to reverse it I am not convinced of either of those things, and I am not at all convinced that an action in August will be warranted If the staff forecast is anywhere in the right ballpark, we will see in the second half of this year a lower rate of change in most of the price measures and a lower rate of growth in most measures of real economic activity housing, autos, real GDP, and job growth An action now at the beginning of a period when everything will start to show a significantly decelerating expansion would subsequently look like we came from a different planet  -94-    7/2-3/96  The asymmetry issue is troubling to me because, as some others have mentioned, I have a problem in principle as to what it means and the message it sends I would not want support of asymmetry to mean a predisposition to tighten policy in August But I am concerned about how going asymmetric now and going back to symmetric in August would be interpreted It is almost as if, once we adopt an asymmetric directive, we are forced to go ahead and take the action so that we can go back to symmetric again That is troubling But I would not dissent if you want to go asymmetric  Thank you I thought there was a general agreement in our earlier discussions that if we did not already have swap arrangements, we would not invent them, so the question looking forward was simply one of tactics for getting rid of them Cathy in her remarks raised some question as to whether we should invent them if we did not already have them Another issue is who is on the list Should we have a swap agreement with Denmark, for example, and under what circumstances would we use it or allow them to use it?  -101-    7/2-3/96  In one of our discussions last year, Mr Chairman, you made reference to the renewals of these swap lines as being like Christmas cards I went home after that meeting and cut all foreign central bankers off my Christmas card list! [Laughter] A problem with a swap arrangement, either a current arrangement or any new one, is that it is expected to be used and the question is under what circumstances and with what unintended consequences  I think none of us was happy with the further temporary increase in our swap line with Mexico and related decisions a year and a half ago It was messy; it was uncomfortable with the US Treasury; it was uncomfortable with the IMF It was difficult and uncomfortable with the Mexicans We would have been better off if we had not had the swap line I would hope that by the time the Mexicans hold their next presidential election we will not have this reciprocal lending facility That would be one criterion I would set up  Another relates to the fact that there are only a very few currencies that serve as major standards of value in the world and every other currency is defined in terms of those currencies One of those, the deutsche mark, is slated to go away in a couple of years I think the kind of arrangement that we have with other major central banks whose currency competes with the dollar as an international standard of value is one thing, and the arrangements that we have with everybody else is something else again Central banks are proliferating all over the world--in Tajikistan and places I can't even pronounce I hope that my worst fears about the new European central bank and the new euro currency prove not to be warranted, but I believe we need to think very carefully, starting now, about what kind of arrangements we will want to have with that central bank and what kind of transactions we will be willing to engage in with it There also are questions pertaining to those European countries that may be subjected to some severe dislocations by not being a part of the euro club and the European central bank What kind of arrangements are they going to want to have with us, and are they arrangements that we are going to want to have with them? I think this is an extremely important issue We do not have a lot of time, but we ought to put it in that context so that we finish this millennium with something quite different from what we have today "
5785,1996-08-20," I want to turn to domestic operations, Peter Looking at the daily information you reported and your problems over this intermeeting period, it seemed to me that there were at least three significant parts of the story that were not mutually independent But I could not tell from your reports which was the most important part of the story from the standpoint of this Committee A part of the story simply seems to be what is going on with sweep accounts and reserves, which created one type of problem We now have a survey to help us figure out the implications of the low level of bank balances in reserve accounts But I don't know what to make of the other two parts of the story One of them is the reference to foreign currency outflows, possibly Russian demand for US currency, which reduced the supply of bank reserves But it also seemed at times that there was something going on in the domestic economy such that the derived demand for bank reserves associated with the growth of bank credit was coming out differently than you expected That is quite a different matter If we failed to    8/20/96  interpret correctly the demand for bank reserves coming from the expansion of bank credit, then we would make the kind of mistake that was made back in the 1970s of misreading underlying forces That is exactly the opposite of a reduced supply of bank reserves coming from foreign demand for our currency If we failed to accommodate that, that would be the opposite type of mistake Do you have a sense or feeling of the relative importance of those?  Derived from bank credit growth  I have a question and a suggestion also In your recommendation that we put this aside for two years, could you elaborate for us on Mexico and maybe Canada too with regard to the arrangements that we have with them?  Okay Then, concerning what happens two years from now, I know this Committee cannot bind the Committee two years from now, but in the past we have been in the situation where the presumption was, it seems to me at least, that we would continue such arrangements unless somebody bore the burden of persuading the Committee that it was the time to end them At this point, I would like to have at least a presumption of a soft sunset provision that says the swap arrangements will be terminated two years or so from now unless somebody makes a compelling argument that they should be continued Such an understanding would reverse what I sense is the environment that we are in now I know it would not be binding two years from now, but it would help my comfort level a great deal if the general view of this Committee was that we should not renew the swap lines after two years  Good  I want to ask Mike Prell two questions But first let me comment on what we have heard on the strike issue from auto supply companies and competing firms in our area Maybe you have been hearing some similar or perhaps different things, Mike Our contacts tell us that for General Motors, if they decide to take a strike, it will be a ""no lose"" situation in the sense that they must be victorious or they will have to break up the company There is a very strongly held view among some of the firms in the industry that for General Motors this is a life-and-death situation because their costs are so much higher than Eaton's and TRW's and some of the auto supply parts companies that they absolutely must get concessions It really does not matter to them what Chrysler and Ford get GM needs significant concessions to survive in this view  I have two questions, Mike, and I think they are unrelated The first has to do with what Charles Siegman had to say about the    8/20/96  second-quarter numbers Typically when we get surprises and revisions of numbers there is one of these two responses Either they carry forward in the same direction or they produce mirror image offsets in the subsequent period What is your tentative judgment about the implications for the third quarter and the second half based on the firmer numbers you now have for the second quarter, which are different in some respects from what you thought they were going to be at the time of the May Greenbook? If you want me to, I will let you respond to that before I ask the second question  The other question, Mike, has to do with Greenbook projections for the period I was struck by the increase in nominal GDP of about 3 percentage point from the last half of this year to the end of 1997 with the same assumed federal funds rate I noticed that starting with the fourth quarter of 1994, your four- to six-quarter projections for nominal spending associated with an unchanged funds rate were remarkably stable This is the first instance where you raised nominal spending growth with a given funds rate I tried to find in the Greenbook or in your briefing this morning why you now expect, given an unchanged funds rate, spending growth to be more rapid for the next year and a half  I have thought about that linkage, but the problem with that response is that I cannot convince myself that it is not circular If you assume that we have had an inflation surprise, for whatever reasons, and you now think inflation could be higher than you previously thought--and as a result real interest rates would be lower than you previously thought--that does not necessarily lead to higher nominal spending growth In my framework, that means we could have higher velocity growth, and I do not see that happening from this dynamic of higher inflation and lower real interest rates  Then you are saying faster money growth  You have to have a budget constraint and central bank money in your framework, so you are telling me that velocity growth is going to be higher I don't see how that follows from this linkage  Thank you I had been thinking fairly positively, feeling pretty good, about things since our last meeting in early July Then, over the weekend, I got a call from my tenant in Los Angeles who said he had lost his job and was breaking his lease and moving to New Jersey Then I read the Greenbook and that depressed me further So, I am not quite sure whether the change in my mood since July is affecting my view as to what is the right thing to do at this point  -25-    8/20/96  In agriculture in our region, this will be a down year for farm income There was a fair amount of crop substitution Farmers were able to plant more crops than they earlier thought they would be able to, but the yields are going to be down and the price effect is not going to compensate So farm income is expected to be down, and the banks in the farm areas expect some pressures to come from that  One of the issues that we kept hearing about through the spring and into the early summer, even at the last meeting of our board of directors, was concern about speculative excesses, especially in the high-tech sector But with the sharp overall adjustment in the prices of high-tech stocks on the Nasdaq earlier this summer, that concern has pretty much vanished from the reports we are hearing We deliberately went out to see if we could find stories of other forms of speculation that might be symptoms of inflationary excesses in the real estate sector, whether with respect to construction or bidding up land prices, and we simply did not find evidence of that in our region We likewise have focused a fair amount of attention on the auto situation because of the very widely held view that GM is building inventory, that it wants a strike, and that it plans to take a strike to get some very significant changes in work rules But we also are hearing about a fair amount of militancy on the labor side as well I am not sure how all that will net out We asked people what was being done by businesses or by anybody in their communities in response to the possibility that there will be a GM strike A lot of our communities are very heavily influenced by General Motors The responses were that nothing was being done So, I am not sure what the effects of a strike would be if that assessment is correct  The steel industry says that its orders are flat Orders for steel-producing equipment to renovate and expand domestic facilities are down very significantly and are expected to decline further in 1997 because of what is characterized as looming overcapacity in the domestic flat-rolled steel sector of that industry However, exports of steel-making equipment are very good Our contacts also believe that the recent increase in steel imports will fall off so that domestic demand will be relatively flat going into next year  District employment is mostly expected to be flat at very low levels of unemployment, and there is little talk of wage pressures in spite of continuous reports of tight labor markets in large and small communities We have heard some interestingly mixed views about the minimum wage increase One surprising response from two different sources was that the perceived adverse effect on retail and fast-food companies, which would expand less or possibly contract in some cases, would be offset by increased applications for employment at other firms Contacts at investment and bank branching companies said they were looking forward to the minimum wage hike because it would mean that more people would be applying for their job openings In construction, a labor leader  said that union halls were empty but that was not leading to wage pressures He said the response of workers to this situation is not to look for higher compensation  When we asked what was happening around the region as a result of tight labor markets--and we confirmed the responses in other ways--we were told that business firms simply were postponing projects throughout Ohio in particular and also in central Kentucky and to a  -26-    8/20/96  lesser extent in parts of eastern Kentucky Businesses mainly are saying at this point that they are not going to get the projects finished anyway before bad weather sets in, so they are just planning ahead for next spring Their expectations now are that in 1997 construction will continue to be very good in our part of the country  In banking there are consistent reports throughout the region that loan growth is slowing, including housing and auto loans I don't know to what extent the auto loans may reflect the decline in auto sales that we saw in July--these reports may be lagged--but the reports provide consistent indications that bank lending has softened There also has been some deterioration of credit quality Both the bankers on our three boards of directors and our community bank advisory council have told us a lot of stories about poor credit quality Some banks were doing spot checks on credit ratings A consulting firm that is now offering this service went back and rescored all the consumer credit files of a bank and found a very sharp drop in the scores of the same individuals compared to two years ago The main reason for the drop was the credit card debt that these consumers had incurred in the interim All the bankers reported slower payments, higher delinquencies, increased bankruptcy filings, and larger allowances for chargeoffs as they finish out the year The thinking about 1997 is that the volume of credit extensions will be down, the quality of accounts will worsen, and bank profitability will decline So, they are in a negative mood about that It's the sort of thing that Governors Lindsey and Kelley cited as a potential development earlier in the year It seems to me from what we are hearing that such concerns are now becoming more common  Let me turn to some remarks about the national economy We have heard this morning about the hope that real growth will slow In one sense, I hope that real growth does not slow down If it turns out that the investment boom that we have had for some 3 to 4 years has strengthened productivity more than is being assumed, then we could enjoy more output growth without the concerns that we all feel about inflation But if we are going to experience slower output growth over the balance of this year and into 1997, then of course we need slower growth in the demand for that output The arithmetic of the Greenbook is that inflation is going to increase and that is why I was disturbed by the upward revision in nominal GDP Even though it is only 3 percentage point, the higher nominal spending growth continues for the next six quarters If we are right in assuming that output growth is going to slow because of capacity constraints and if the assumption is right that nominal spending growth is going to increase for whatever reason, then we have baked rising inflation into the cake and that is unacceptable  I agree with your characterization of the situation and the kind of decision that we are faced with, Mr Chairman, and I agree with the remarks that the Vice Chairman just  -40-    8/20/96  made I thought we were correct in our use of the installment plan to lower the funds rate the last three times we did so after it had peaked at 6 percent I do not think that we would be correct in starting off on an installment plan now because we would be saying that we misjudged the economy and the inflationary pressures--that we should not have been cutting the funds rate in the first place, and we have to roll it all the way back up to 6 percent That would be a very, very strong message  I want to explain to the staff of this Committee what it would take to persuade me that they are right about the outlook I will put it in the form of a challenge I will not blame you if you do not like the way I am going to characterize this, [laughter] but what you have said to me is that the minimum wage increase is expansionary for the economy You have said that raising the minimum wage and other wages carries through to higher prices, lowers real interest rates, and therefore expands the economy at a faster pace Thus, if we raise the minimum wage to $10, we will have a roaring boom This just defies credibility to me So, I have to judge my policy decision on the basis of a disbelief in the Greenbook forecast for nominal spending I do not even believe the real part, but the nominal part bothers me more because of its direction I cannot get away from the idea that the purchasing power of the dollar has something to do with the dollar and the supply and demand for it, and that what we are trying to do is to stabilize the value of the dollar I would like to have a definite time horizon for when we are going to stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar and keep it there When I see your recent numbers and the projection of central bank money growth accelerating, I have to be concerned But I have a great deal of trouble separating out what is going on in the demand for foreign uses of our currency, that component of central bank money, and the contraction in the reserve balance component of it I would have to assume that the demand for reserves is contracting even faster than the supply of reserves in order to conclude that we are seeing greater inflationary pressure I think there is no evidence for that If you have evidence and you can convince me, then I would change my mind "
5809,1996-09-24," Thank you I first want to comment on Bob Parry's point about the nonfarm payroll numbers because those revisions go in both directions as we have seen Currently, the BLS is using a plug of 140,000 per month for jobs created in new business startups In 1990, they were using 80,000 per month They subsequently decided that the number should be negative and wound up revising the employment data down By the nature of those plugs, they are always going to miss the turning points At some point, there is going to be a big revision in the opposite direction, just like last year's upward revision  Turning to the national economy, we got a copy of the August survey of the National Federation of Independent Business, which was also mentioned in some of the material we received from the Board staff last night I noted with interest that an expansion high 27 percent of the firms said that they have been increasing their compensation, and yet there was a decline in the percentage that said they were going to be raising their prices and an increase in the number saying that their earnings were improving That says to me that productivity is really quite good Plans for capital spending rose 4 percentage points, so at least from that sample of a very large number of small businesses, the productivity explanation of developments in compensation is being verified  On the strike situation, people in the District are very pleased with the outcome of the Ford contract and they generally do not expect GM to take a strike But the answers were not entirely consistent on that point We have talked to the large auto supplier companies who say the UAW's concern is not GM workers; it is UAW workers GM wants to sell some of their parts operations The UAW wants a say in who buys those parts operations because the union wants them to remain UAW plants under the new owners If that is agreed to, the UAW may go along with GM's outsourcing intentions The issue is not going to come down to compensation, and the big companies that we have talked to say that they do not expect a strike  In the District, we have had a number of meetings in the last few weeks with directors, advisory councils, and bankers We asked them about the kinds of capital spending they had seen and business plans for the future We asked in particular whether business firms were trying mainly to increase capacity or trying to increase productivity Most said that capital spending would continue to expand but at a slower pace through 1997 compared with what we have seen in the past three or four years, and it would be almost entirely    9/24/96  for the purpose of improving productivity I have only a few stories about firms that are actually increasing their capacity One director reported that the paper processing equipment now being installed uses 50 percent less labor than the equipment it is replacing Since the capacity of paper producing operations is growing, there has been some softness in prices, but he said the really extraordinary efficiency of this new equipment is what is driving the industry's investment decisions  We asked firms about compensation increases and whether in their judgment, or that of other firms they talked to, the increases were warranted on the basis of productivity improvements or whether they were seeing pressure on earnings and/or pressure for higher prices We did not hear any stories about higher prices We did hear some stories about pressure on earnings, but basically our contacts were saying that they were not going to be passing along higher labor costs or attempting to raise prices for the foreseeable future We did hear some reports that it is now easier to find people at the entry level than it was earlier, especially in Kentucky and Indiana where it had been very difficult One of the directors from western Pennsylvania simply said that business there was in the doldrums Steel and oil executives tell us that their production capacity is rising faster than demand, and they expect downward pressure on prices Basically, they said the investment in steel producing facilities in the last couple of years is starting to come on stream now and will continue doing so out into 1997 Accordingly, with foreign competition also increasing, they expect more difficulty in just holding the level of steel prices  We have continued to hear stories about rising delinquencies, late payments, bankruptcy filings, and therefore more charge-offs in the banking industry One report that I found interesting for an area that is so heavily influenced by motor vehicles is that there is an ample supply of tool and die makers This is not usual for our part of the country in the sixth year of an expansion The reason given is that investment in computerized design and manufacturing technology is making these people easy to find One very large auto parts company said that they are now producing the same truck parts with 20 percent fewer hours than in 1994 Productivity improvements at their plants have been averaging 5 to 7 percent per year, and they expect that to continue  Let me turn to the Greenbook and the national economy It seems to me that there are at least four views about monetary policy in the current situation that are all respectable views even if not equally probable Of course, there could be some combination of these four views One is that the current stance of monetary policy is such that in the future we are going to see an acceleration in the growth of final demand But because of capacity constraints, however one wants to think about that, the growth in output or aggregate supply cannot increase along with aggregate demand, and therefore we will get higher prices That is why at the last meeting I was so disturbed by the upward revision in the nominal GDP projections through 1997 That revision has now been reversed in part, so my concern from that source has been relieved A second view is that the stance of monetary policy is not going to produce an acceleration of growth in aggregate demand, but growth in aggregate supply will slow toward an annual rate of about 2 percent because of capacity constraints That assumes  -6-    9/24/96  productivity and labor market conditions similar to those in the current Greenbook Therefore, inflationary pressures are going to increase modestly in this view, but they will still increase A third position is that the current stance of monetary policy is going to lead to a slowing in the growth of nominal spending and in aggregate supply or potential output at a more or less parallel rate Therefore, inflation will continue at about the same rate; we simply do not make any progress in reducing inflation The fourth position would be that nominal spending growth is going to slow because of the current stance of monetary policy, but output growth is not going to slow as much because of the productivity improvements from the capital spending of the last four years--the introduction of new technologies, and all of that Therefore, we will get less price pressure in the future I think that those scenarios pretty much encompass the views of what we are hearing from Wall Street, from analysts, and other commentary about whether current policy is too tight or too easy  I support your recommendation  Peter, I agree that we need to get our deutsche mark holdings off the Bundesbank balance sheet, and I would agree with that even if Maastrict had not put them on an euthanasia program [Laughter] Eventually, you are going to be getting out of mark- denominated assets because there won't be D-mark assets I think the issue of how much of our assets is in the form of foreign currencies has to be addressed sometime, but that is not the issue now I also would be very concerned about the idea of buying private assets, although I think a few major central banks in the world do that  I think that is something we need to preserve, and other central banks around the world would be wise to do the same On the subject of duration, there are people around the table who know more than I do about it and how to use it appropriately I understand that it has had a very profound and a very desirable effect on the balance sheets of commercial enterprises It took a long time to bring that discipline into play I remember a period in the 1980s when the question among bankers was, ""Have you seen Sandy Rose's last article on duration in the American Banker?"" The response was, ""I hope so"" [Laughter] If the concept is to bring discipline and to help in the evaluation of portfolios affected by interest rate swings, one uses duration as a tool to manage risk; one should not do things to manage duration So, if we want to be comfortable about the way duration is used as opposed to what a maturity constraint would require, there should not be incentives to take actions for the purpose of influencing duration but rather to manage the changes in the valuation of the assets in the portfolio I can imagine some scenarios where very dramatic changes in interest rates would influence duration and cause somebody to think that something would have to be done to readjust a portfolio's duration We would not want to do that  Have you thought about how the Bundesbank might implement the eventual transition to the new euro?  You can't conclude that there would be no effect on market prices because if we swapped out of coupons into short-dated bills that are going to mature, the Treasury would have to issue new debt We don't know what their marketing strategy would be, so we don't know what the price effect would be  But without knowing what their overall deficit financing strategy is, it would be hard for us to--  I think this is an issue because regimes and ideas at the Treasury change periodically Like Ed Boehne, I think  -50-    9/24/96  that increasing the liquidity of our portfolio is the right thing to do Liquidity is not just a primary portfolio objective It is so far out in front that I do not even know what the second objective is And going forward we may not want to go to bills only, but going dramatically in that direction is the right thing to do  Some 20 percent of the $6 trillion debt rolls over every year and needs to be reset at the average 5-year maturity of the existing debt The Treasury needs to refund over a trillion dollars of maturing debt every year "
5833,1996-11-13," Thank you In the relatively long interval since our last meeting, gave us two reports from  an area we had not heard much about He said it appeared that the had gotten itself in a bit of a jam, but they were going to try to preserve as many jobs as they could [Laughter] Listening to directors on a recent conference call reminded me of how important it is to listen very carefully One of them very forcefully stated that he had seen very strong evidence of weakening demand for steel He indicated that domestic demand was flat, and he thought it would actually be down in 1997 compared with 1996 Imports would continue to be a problem, and the new capacity he has been telling us about for the last couple of years was already coming into production and capacity would increase further in 1997 He said the new mills were the price leaders The productivity of these new mills was so much greater than that of the preexisting capacity that he saw substantial downward pressure on prices and some very difficult times ahead for the older mills  Another report from that I found very interesting in terms of new developments came from a company in Columbus, Ohio, It is like a Mrs Fields but very diversified The official from that firm said that the fastest growing segments of her business are catalog orders, as she calls them, that come in over 800 numbers and increasingly this year over the Internet  and I asked her what would happen if she came into the office on a Friday morning and found a message from Osaka ordering pastries for a Monday morning meeting She said that her firm gets such orders all the time because there are so many Japanese associated with Honda and other firms in Ohio They learn about the gift box that her firm sells and their orders then start to come in over the Internet When I asked about the cost, she said that for a group of 15 people her firm would arrange for delivery on that Friday afternoon The package would arrive in Osaka on Sunday, and it would be delivered on Monday for about $100, including transportation She said that was less than they would pay to buy the pastries locally I asked if she ever thought of herself as being in the export business She said, No, and she didn't care What difference did it make? She may be right about that, too  We also met in recent weeks with a lot of bankers in western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and all over Ohio Especially with the community bankers, the consistent story in meeting after meeting was  -18-    11/13/96  about the quality of consumer credit One banker would get started on that subject and then everybody would tell stories not only about rising delinquencies and increasingly slow payments, but the phenomenon that most worried them was that of people who had never been late in making their payments unexpectedly walking into the bank and declaring themselves bankrupt Basically, these were stories about the pyramiding of credit card debts through transfers of debt balances from old cards to new cards until the borrowers ran out the string and their incomes simply could no longer service the debts So, they declared bankruptcy The bankers said that the charge-offs could be very high for this quarter, but there was a difference of opinion about the future Some said that they thought they had tightened up enough that this would be the worst quarter; others believed that 1997 was going to be much worse We met with the senior credit officers of about a dozen of the larger banks, and they all said that charge-offs would be much greater in 1997 They are very concerned about the credit quality of their loans on the consumer side, though increasingly they seem to be concerned about the commercial side, too They all believed that their own exposure to commercial real estate in the form of shopping center stores--they call them boxes--and hotels that they have financed is going to be a problem in 1997  I asked them about their earnings projections They were all budgeting for double-digit loan volume growth in 1997 I asked them to square that with the nominal GDP growth of about 4 to 4-1/2 percent, and of course they said they were going to take it from their competition [Laughter] They all confessed concern about margins next year and said that they simply would not be able to sustain their current earnings levels without the loan volume they had built into their budgets So, 1997 is going to be an interesting year in terms of bank earnings  On the national economy, the Board staff has revised down its third-quarter GDP numbers from those shown in the Greenbook Based on the latest GDP numbers and until we get new data, I assume that means the productivity growth number was close to zero in the third quarter, which defies belief We can talk all we want about whether the productivity number is bigger or smaller, but it is wrong It is simply inconceivable that there was no productivity growth at all in the third quarter In fact, the productivity numbers for this whole year are just not believable  What I am encouraged about is the Board's staff projection of the nominal GDP trend I was very concerned in March of this year when the staff first made a substantial upward revision in its projection of nominal GDP for this year and out into 1997 I was even more concerned in August when that projection was notched up further, but since then the upward adjustment has all been taken away The staff now has its lowest nominal income growth projections through 1997 since around 1995, including a growth rate of around 4 percent or a little more as we finish the year, about the same as it appears to have grown in the third quarter I do not know precisely what the growth of nominal GDP was for the third quarter; it was probably below 4 percent The staff has raised its growth projection for the first quarter of 1997, but that is strictly on the basis of an assumed rebound in auto sales If we take that rebound out of the projection, nominal GDP growth is still flat at about 4 percent So, out through  -19-    11/13/96  1998 the expansion of nominal GDP in this projection is still running at a rate of around 4 or 4-1/4 percent These numbers are well below the central tendency of the nominal GDP forecasts that the Committee members provided in July for the year 1997, and they are below our own forecast in Cleveland, which was at the lower end of that central tendency  The question, then, is how can we get an acceleration of inflation? It has to result from an acceleration in final demand, and we are no longer seeing that In fact, each successive revision of the nominal spending forecast has been in a downward direction Conceivably, if one were to believe such a forecast, higher inflation could result with such nominal GDP growth if real output were to drop further to little or no growth As a practical matter, I do not see how the Board staff could be wrong on the low side of its nominal spending forecast unless I am given different assumptions than I have seen so far about money growth, which has continued to come in below the earlier assumptions, or I am told it has something to do with velocity But such a velocity story would not be consistent with the interest rates we are seeing In fact, the story goes in the opposite direction The way I use MZM, as I have tried to describe before, is as a contemporaneous monitoring device of what is happening to nominal spending with a consistent set of assumptions about interest rates and money growth That tells me we are more likely to see weaker rather than stronger final demand in the period ahead I think that the risks are growing on the down side, not on the up side That view was reinforced by these stories that bankers tell about their consumer credit portfolios  I have one last comment on labor-intensive services that Bill McDonough was just talking about I think there is a very interesting issue in the linkage here that deserves some further research If one thinks about a self-employed person in business services, the price of the service is, of course, going to be equal to the person's compensation because output in this case is defined as the labor input of one person That cannot change There is no productivity in the calculation So, any increase in compensation would be all inflation simply by definition  I had a question all ready, David, about trying to square the Bluebook with the Greenbook, but your last remarks about the aggregates go in the same direction That's because you antici- pate M2 growth of 4 percent for the year, and that means there will have been essentially no increase or a very small increase in M2 velocity this year As I noted earlier, the Greenbook has a nominal GDP growth forecast of 4-1/4 percent or so I track nominal GDP on a four-quarter moving-average and an eight-quarter moving-average basis, and that, of course, produces a growth pattern that has been trending down over the last several years Now, if I run that trend out through the end of 1998 using the Greenbook's forecast of essentially 4 to 4-1/4 percent nominal GDP growth, such growth must accelerate beyond the Greenbook horizon to validate the staff statements about inflation and a policy stance involving a 5-1/4 percent funds rate The staff forecast is getting close to the point where the CPI is growing at the same rate as nominal GDP That does not compute That means we have to have nominal GDP growth accelerating beyond the forecast horizon, and I do not see the mechanism by which a sustained 5-1/4 percent funds rate produces the needed increase in the growth of aggregate demand  When people use the word ""inflation,"" I always translate that as something having to do with the purchasing power of the dollar I can't get away from that notion So, if people say inflation is going to be higher, I ask what is it that is going to cause the purchasing power of the dollar to erode at a faster rate in the future than it has in the past I wind up thinking in terms of an excess demand kind of framework and so on I do not believe that we are in an environment where the purchasing power of the dollar will be eroding at a faster rate for the next year or two If I thought that, I would of course conclude that we have to adjust policy I have not seen the evidence for that, and I still do not see the mechanism that is going to produce greater inflation from this point In these circumstances, if we had not already adopted asymmetry at the last two meetings, I certainly would not want to go asymmetric toward restraint at this time I wish we were not already there, but since we are, I can see the wisdom of not moving to symmetry and running the risk of having to return to asymmetry So, I will support asymmetry toward tightening but only because we used it in the directives for the previous two meetings "
5858,1996-12-17," I also applaud these moves in the direction of greater transparency I think these are the kinds of things we should be doing But you also are taking away one piece of information, for better or worse, stemming from the use of customer RPs The way that was used in the past by the Desk was to help estimate the reserve need So that got me to wondering, why not go a step further? What are the pros and cons of actually telling the markets what your rolling projections of the reserve needs for the period are? Is there some reason why you think that would create adverse incentives on the part of the banks?  I understand that the errors in the daily forecasts stem principally from unexpected changes in the Treasury balance, but other factors such as float get in the way of accurate forecasts Of course, that kind of uncertainty exists now in the way    12/17/96  that what you announce to customers is interpreted, so I don't see where that changes anything All of the analysts on the outside understand that Most of them worked at the Desk! [Laughter] In fact, isn't it the case that the Bank of England, which may intervene a number of times in a day, puts out a number on the amount they have in mind?  I presume that that would take away the intra-period gaming that we see going on I agree completely with Tom Melzer on the need for that kind of discussion, and I would suggest that when we have it that we include consideration of a more flexible use of the window I am not against activity later in the day, but I also think that we may need to rethink the role of the window in an environment where we make adjustments to unexpected reserve needs late in the day That applies not only to what we do on our side in managing the window, but also to how we should influence perceptions on the other side about the availability of the window for adjustments  Thank you I had a joint meeting of all three of our boards of directors last week and it included a go-around of the directors The most commonly used word to describe their business activity was ""flat""--flat at currently high levels of activity with expectations that activity in 1997 will be about the same overall as in 1996 In the motor vehicles area, there is an expectation--from the suppliers' side at least--that production next year will be down about 1 percent or so Because motor vehicles--both autos and trucks --are extremely important to our region, developments in that industry not only affect the reality but also the perceptions of what is happening There is also an expectation among the suppliers that the prices of materials are going to be down in 1997, so they expect their margins to improve even though they anticipate somewhat lower volumes  With regard to the steel industry, we did get information that was a little different Most of it was on the outlook for steel prices In that industry, mini-mills that have been under construction for some time will be coming on stream next year and adding to capacity Moreover, the growing efficiency of the integrated companies and expanding capacity abroad--we are seeing more sources of steel supplies from around the world--suggest that steel prices will be flat at best In fact, one of our directors who is very much involved in steel feels that steel prices at the end of 1997 are likely to be below where they are today, and as Mike Prell noted they currently are below where they were at the beginning of this year  -23-    12/17/96  There are growing concerns about the outlook for residential and nonresidential construction The feeling is that the residential projects that are now being completed are not being replaced in the construction pipeline, so that as they are finished next year residential construction activity will be coming down On the commercial side, there is a special concern about too many shopping centers--too much retail space The bankers say that they are tightening up on credit for this type of lending They feel that they have been extending too much credit for the construction of retail space on terms with which they are no longer comfortable  Employment is generally characterized as flat at very low levels of unemployment We simply do not have very much population or labor force growth in the region anymore I think people are going back to California! That population trend is expected to continue  One of the remarks that Governor Rivlin just made about the way the causality runs in labor markets is reinforced by views expressed by some of our directors One of our directors, who is now leaving the board, said that when he arrived inflation psychology was an issue He does not believe that anymore He thinks it has been replaced by what he calls a productivity psychology He notes that in management retreats and in meetings of boards of directors, people do not talk about inflation They talk about efficiency and about productivity and they lay their plans for the next year and set their longer-run strategies with the objective of accomplishing greater productivity The director believes that the productivity psychology is pervading business organizations and that employees understand very well that that is what is driving their companies  On the stock market, one director made a comment that I thought was intriguing, so I tested it with a few other individuals--I had a sort of aggregation problem The comment was that the shares of an individual's firm were fairly priced in the market or maybe a little undervalued, but the stock of other business firms was overvalued [Laughter]  On the national economy, I do not pay very much attention to what the Commerce Department reports on real output and even less to what the Board staff projects for real output [Laughter] What Mike Prell does with the real growth measure makes sense, but I believe it is increasingly flawed conceptually We don't know how to define output and we have all the related problems and concerns about productivity that we have discussed a number of times The numbers simply are not squaring up with what I, at least--and I think a lot of you, too--hear and see is going on in the economy In any event, I do not think that the growth measure has much to do with the purchasing power of the dollar I find the uncertainties about the linkage between measures of inflation and of real output and productivity to be something more than I can deal with when I am so unsure about how to estimate output and productivity  I do spend a fair amount of time looking at the price statistics Of course, there is a danger in that we can fall into the trap of thinking that inflation is caused by rising prices, but it is not [Laughter] I do look at the numbers for prices and I look at the numbers for wages Now, even in theory the only way we can have wage-push inflation is for firms to pay people more than the value of  -24-    12/17/96  their marginal product We do not find a lot of businesses that claim to be paying their workers more than they are worth However, when I look at the Greenbook projections of the deflators--the chain-weighted deflator or the gross domestic purchases deflator--out to 1998 and see that uptick out there in 1998, that certainly gives me reason to pause When we come back together in February, I am going to be very interested in seeing what the numbers look like going out for five years I think a crucial issue for this Committee at this point is the inflation forecast beyond 1998 Nothing that we could conceive of doing today or in the early part of 1997 is going to have much effect on reported rates of inflation in 1997 The implications of current policy for the year 1998 are a matter of interest, but much more so is what the inflation trend will be beyond 1998 Implicit in the Greenbook's 1998 numbers is an inflation trend that is rising beyond 1998 And yet I am very puzzled because when I look at the Greenbook projections of nominal GDP for 1997, those in the current Greenbook are the lowest that we have seen since the Greenbook began to include projections for 1997 About one year ago, at the time of the January meeting, the country was in a funk, with the economy perceived as bad and getting worse That sentiment changed by spring, and going into the summer the economy was seen as booming and getting stronger Now, the psychology may be back almost to where it was one year ago The numbers are softer in terms of nominal spending growth in 1997 and we have had three Greenbooks now with projections of 1998 nominal GDP, and each of those projections has been lower than the prior one So, the trend for nominal income growth is going in one direction, yet I am expecting staff to say that after 1998 nominal GDP is going to grow at a faster rate and produce higher inflation What I would like the staff to do, at least to humor me, is to show us what policy and the environment would look like if we set an objective of stable prices at the end of five years We have a pretty good idea of what it would mean in terms of nominal income We even have a pretty good idea of what it might mean in terms of nominal interest rates--they would be lower than they are today What kind of heroic assumptions would one have to make in your analytical framework, as it relates to growth in output and productivity, that would be consistent with that objective without first widening the output gap or pushing up the unemployment rate? I think it is possible to put that scenario together in some alternative framework other than a gap analysis  I agree with the recommendation to leave the funds rate unchanged at this meeting, but I am troubled by this issue of the meaning of asymmetry, not only among ourselves but also what we communicate to others In one sense, a central bank should always be asymmetric toward firming with regard to the issue of inflation In another sense, I cannot imagine the circumstances under which there would be any new information that would cause an action in the near term--between now and the next meeting So what asymmetry means is that if the consensus of this group is that the next action is more likely up than down, it is because of rising inflation well out there in the future, given the long and variable lags that exist In my view, we have done a much better job recently of avoiding communicating that we are concerned as such about too much growth or too many people working or not enough unemployed people and other idle resources We do not want to fall back into those kinds of communications So, how are we going to communicate the need to move the funds rate up when we face it, because of our concern about inflation in 1998 and beyond, if we do not set out explicit multiyear objectives and couch any action we have to take in that context? "
5883,1997-02-04," My emphasis was not so much on the distribution, although I would  like to see the detailed distribution of these forecasts because I know that three on each side get  tossed out to arrive at the central tendency I am more interested in the multi-year aspect of our  efforts to address our problem of distinguishing between a forecast of what is going to happen in  the near term and a public statement about what our objectives are  No, I am not worrying about that More detail would not add much  to what we already publish, though I don't know why we don't share the detailed distribution I  don't care who makes which forecast But I am interested in trying to evaluate specific forecasts  in terms of what I think of as my version of the internal consistency of a forecast It can tell me a  little about peoples' thinking when I look at their forecasts of output, unemployment, and  inflation  That would be fine  Thank you There are a couple of things that I want to talk about  One is a report that the National Federation of Independent Business made two weeks ago  covering the end of last year and the beginning of this year I thought there were some  interesting items in the report The percentage of firms reporting higher prices plunged to record    2/4-5/97  lows, but plans to raise prices in the next few months jumped to a 12-month high Reports of  compensation increases reached a new record high Some 32 percent of the firms said they had  raised compensation, and that is 8 percentage points higher than in any previous report But on  the other side, plans to raise compensation in 1997 fell significantly, almost to a record low  Capital spending plans remain strong The report now says that 37 percent of the respondents  are planning to increase capital outlays A record 76 percent of the firms reported actual  increases in capital expenditures last year  Let me turn to developments in my District First on the retail level,  who is in retail distribution nationally, and it is not always clear whether his remarks  apply to regional or to national developments He said that retail sales were very good in  January in spite of some of the weather problems They had been somewhat disappointed about  December He expects that wages in the retail sector will rise 4 percent this year versus a 3  percent increase in 1996 Whether or not that rise can be justified in terms of greater efficiency  or what some might call productivity was not clear from his comments  We are now hearing from contacts in the construction sector in the region that they are  no longer expecting some falloff in 1997 from 1996; in fact, some concerns are being registered  about possible overbuilding in the commercial sector The claim being made is that what is  already in the building pipeline to be completed this year, especially retail space, could result in  oversupply Labor contacts tell us that labor negotiations in the construction industry are going  to be tough this spring, meaning that they plan to catch up The view in the unions is that the  cost of benefits has been coming down in the last few years and that the contractors are adding to  their incomes as a result The workers feel that they now deserve larger wage increases in the  next contract than they received in the last contract because of what they see as very substantial    2/4-5/97  increases in productivity and efficiency in the construction trade They believe they are not  benefiting from that improvement and that now is catch-up time  In the steel sector, we are hearing that wages are expected to be up about 3-1/2 percent  this year, and our contacts say that such an increase is in line with gains in productivity  However, they think prices are going to end the year lower than where they are currently and that  1997 prices will average below those in 1996 So, earnings at best will be flat and are more  likely to be down Steel industry executives also continue to be concerned about imports,  especially because of the appreciation of the dollar In our area we are being told, mainly by  suppliers of automotive parts, that auto sales will be down this year from 1996  I thought one report on labor was of particular interest There are 70,000  manufacturing workers in northeast Ohio, and their average age is in excess of 50 years One of  the large firms, a steel company, put out a notice that it wanted to hire 100 entry-level production  workers They stopped taking applications after two days when they had received 1,500  applications for jobs with starting wages of $38,000 However, they could not find 100 qualified  workers out of these 1,500 applicants So, there is concern about the quality of the work force  One note on the housing market I don't know how general this phenomenon is yet,  but we are hearing reports that prices of houses on the high end of the scale are softer and that  these houses are staying on the market longer  Quite a few of us took a tour of facilities so that we could report to  Don Kohn on what is going on in The discussion focused on the productivity  and efficiency challenges is facing They claim to be in the midst of major  leaps in productivity due to new equipment technologies The latter are leading to the  introduction of new products that are substituting for products previously made out of other    2/4-5/97  materials All this raises some interesting issues The time for designing and testing a new  product a couple of years ago was measured in months It is now measured in days, because of  the use of computer assisted design equipment and new testing procedures Computerization  also has enabled to achieve extraordinary gains in efficiency by using production  equipment that is fairly similar, or looks similar, to existing equipment As recently as 1995, it  took them 8 hours on average to change a mold This year they are planning to do it in 45  minutes They anticipate machine downtime in 1997 to be 1/4 of what it was in 1995 and their  scrap rate to be less than 1/2 of what it was in 1995 They operate on a rolling 3-year plan, and  they say that they currently expect a 3 percent per year increase in their labor costs, but their  output prices will fall 1 to 2 percent per year Their earnings are good and they expect them to  continue to be good For 1997, they indicate that their labor costs will average about 5 percent  of the wholesale price of a product We looked at one product in particular--the  --which sells for about $1000 at Wal-Mart Last year, they were making 2 cans in 35  seconds on one machine, and the new equipment they are installing now will make 4 cans in 35  seconds The wholesale price will be $600, and there will be 30 cents of labor cost in the $600  I asked them about the effects of NAFTA on their operations in Mexico They  said that NAFTA was largely irrelevant to their production there They noted that they have  virtually no turnover of labor in their operations All new hires start on the  night shift It takes approximately 30 years of seniority for a worker to get moved to the day  shift [Laughter] In Mexico, on the other hand, they are experiencing 25 percent turnover So,  recruiting and training in Mexico are huge costs to them They say that in the end the difference  in labor costs is about $200 an hour, but when the labor cost is only 30 cents per $600 trash can,  it is irrelevant They say that labor could be free in Guangdong province and they still could not    2/4-5/97  make such products there and import them at a profit So they have crossed over a threshold in  which the value added coming from labor is so small because of efficiencies in production that  they cannot afford to produce at a remote location and move the product around They have to  have their manufacturing facilities close to their points of distribution They said their biggest  challenge is being able to respond when they know every single day which of their products were  sold and need to be ordered in each and every store of a Wal-Mart or some of the other chains  One more note on District manufacturing companies When they respond to our  questions about inflation, they say they are experiencing no inflationary pressures even though  their wages are increasing 3 percent or so and their earnings are very good Their earnings were  good last year and are expected to remain so in 1997 So, their story provides at least indirect  evidence that productivity gains are quite high and are expected to be quite high in an  environment of very, very low labor turnover Thank you  Brian, if we were to have a multiyear horizon as our objective for  getting to price stability, perhaps along the lines of the price stability alternative in chart 2 of the  Bluebook, money growth would be slower in that environment, based on current relationships  Whether inflation, properly measured, is 2 percent or 3 percent, we do not know We know there  are measurement errors that affect the implicit price deflator and other price indexes, but the  answer is going to be 2 or 3 percent Based on the information you have now, whatever  assumption you make about own price and the evidence about how the Treasury yield curve  behaves relative to the funds rate, how confident can you be that if we maintain a 5-1/4 percent  funds rate, there will not be a deceleration of M2 growth consistent with a policy of moving to  price stability?  But we can distinguish among forecasts of nominal GDP We do not  target nominal GDP, but you can say there is an implicit nominal GDP target if you have a price  stability objective If you say your objective is to get nominal GDP growth down to the area of 2  to 3 percent and if your analytical framework tells you that M2 growth also would be around 2 to  3 percent, then you can at least run the intellectual exercise as to what kind of interest rate path  would be consistent with producing that outcome In Gary Stem's words yesterday, if we have a  supply-constrained economy, then to get to price stability our task is to constrain nominal  demand growth to a rate consistent with that aggregate supply growth  Okay, but chart 2 was developed within the NAIRU framework and  the assumption that we know where the NAIRU is and where the current rate of unemployment  is relative to it I am asking you to think through the exercise for us and abstract from that  Have you or can you simply run through those interest rate alternatives presented in chart 2 and,  based on the statistical relationships in a money demand-opportunity cost framework, trace out  what kind of money growth would be produced? That is just an exercise    2/4-5/97  Okay We have run the exercise at our Bank where, if we take your  price stability path and those related interest rate movements that we can pick off of chart 2, we  produce an M2 growth of about 1 or 2 percent in about 3 or 4 years  I guess I am a little out of step with the way the issue is being defined  in this discussion because my first choice would be not to announce target ranges at all and to  explain why not Concurrent Resolution 133 and Humphrey-Hawkins were both adopted in an  environment where, even in the economics profession, there was no consensus about our  objectives So, the purpose was to constrain the central bank's activities and reduce one source  of uncertainty To continue to announce a target range for an aggregate, I think, actually hinders  its use in the formulation of policy It would be a mistake to resurrect money as an objective or  give the sense that any money measure is something that triggers a change in the funds rate I    2/4-5/97  think it was Herb Stein who once said, ""It is certainly true that there is a stable relation between  money and the price level; what is not stable is the definition of money"" If we were to get back  into a situation where people thought that our actions were being triggered by M2 or any other  money measure, we would have the Goodhart's law problem or what Henry Wallich called the  Heisenberg principle of people focusing on an instrument in drawing conclusions about our  actions This alters people's behavior and therefore changes the relationship between that  instrument and economic activity  I think that this is the time, whether it is in your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony in a couple of weeks or not, to start to try to get money out of there The legislation  does not require that we announce any particular money measure--M1, M2, or anything else It  says something broadly about monetary aggregates I think we could try to explain that using  something like money growth to formulate policy to achieve our objective of price stability is  one thing; setting it out there publicly as a target on an annual or even multiyear basis, I think,  would be a mistake I do not know how hard that would be to explain to members of Congress,  but we could just tell them that we are not going to announce target ranges anymore because they  miscommunicate our policy intentions  Thank you I am delighted with last year's results even though they  were not forecast by anybody [Laughter] I hope for similar mistakes this year in the sense of  more growth, lower unemployment, and less inflation than we are now projecting But I also  recognize that if we had been more accurate in anticipating the way 1996 was going to come out  a year ago, then in spite of that more favorable inflation outlook we would not have notched  down the funds rate early last year And I would not have supported reducing the funds rate if  we had been able to anticipate more accurately the way the year came out Given that, logic tells  me that we would have been better off with hindsight not to have recalibrated, and we probably  would be happier today if the funds rate were at 5-1/2 percent Certainly, if it were at 5-1/2  percent, we would not be reducing it  I am very concerned, Mr Chairman, about how you are going to be able to  communicate this to the markets, to people in political circles, and to the public at large The  Labor Department tells us that there are still 6 million people who are not working Fortunately,  they do not live in my District, but I would like to see a lot more of those people find jobs Most  of the metropolitan areas in my District have unemployment rates of around 4 percent or lower,  and this has been the case for a couple of years I would be delighted if we saw more  metropolitan areas out in Bob Parry's District with 4 percent unemployment So, I would  endorse fully what Bill McDonough has said--care needs to be taken to avoid communicating  that we are concerned that there are too many people working, that unemployment of 6 million is  too few, or that we would not be happy if there were only 4 million unemployed I think that this  is a very, very important communications issue as you try to prepare the markets and everybody  else for what seems to be unavoidable "
5907,1997-03-25," Thank you Regarding the Cleveland District first, both bankers  and a retail executive for a national firm expressed their concerns  about the construction of additional retail space There is  already excess space as far as they are concerned Store closings are starting to occur, yet  new construction is being planned and put into place One of the bankers said that lending  standards relating to the construction of commercial real estate have disappeared in the last  couple of months He hears of lending agreements with no takeouts being arranged, no  permanent financing being locked up, no tenants being signed, and he is finding it  increasingly difficult to rein in his own people and have them turn down applications for  such construction loans Also, he thinks extensions of C&I loans, which have been very  strong throughout the region, may be increasing further Interest margins have continued to  erode On the noninterest expense side, it is a mixed story Several directors, bankers and  non-bankers, talked about how their telephone expense has dropped dramatically A banker  said his overall telephone expense-- --is down 25 percent from a year  ago, but his software costs are skyrocketing On balance, he has not seen much benefit    3/25/97  from the retail sector said that even though January and February  sales came in a lot better than expected both nationally and in the region, he still thinks that  growth in retail spending over the next few years is going to average only about 3 percent  versus 5 percent so far in the 1990s So, he is pessimistic regarding the sustainability of the  kind of retail spending we have seen In the steel industry, from a very large  company said that he had his people do some research on productivity in 1996 versus 1993  Over the three-year period, they had an increase of 27 percent in productivity, and without  that his company would not have been able to sustain its earnings because they have not been  able to adjust their prices so far He said that steel imports were flooding in In the fourth  quarter such imports were 25 percent above a year earlier He sees downward pressure on  steel prices, but then, oddly, he said that he took advantage of a current situation in the  marketplace to put in a 3 percent price increase on 30 percent of his volume I asked if he  thought the increase would stick, and he replied that,  he personally did not think it would Some on his top  management team thought that current market conditions presented an opportunity and that  he had an obligation to try to find out if the market would support the price increase I found  interesting this shift in attitudes and willingness to test the receptivity of the market to higher  prices  Another interesting development in my view relates to the newsprint side of the  newspaper industry You will recall that a year and a half ago newsprint prices were  skyrocketing, and a lot of companies put through price increases for home delivery and at the  newsstand Now, in an environment where newsprint prices are plunging, I asked what  newspaper executives were doing about pricing I was told that the savings were all going to    3/25/97  the advertisers Price competition there was intense and the volume of ad space was up  sharply, but the price of ad space was substantially below where it was a year ago--an  indirect effect of how the marketplace works  On the labor side, construction unions are expecting a 4 percent average yearly  increase over the next three years They think their contract will be agreed to by May and  that the increase will be higher than it was in the contract for the three-year period currently  ending An interesting twist in the press about plant closings is that the Ford Motor  Company announced that they were going to shut down their Lorain, Ohio, operation and  terminate the jobs of some 1,800 people The news stories have said that these workers were  not going to provide much relief to the tight labor markets in the area That's because these  people will collect 95 percent of a very high wage for a year and they have the wrong set of  skills for other employers One press report also said that auto industry workers had the  wrong work ethic for what was needed by small manufacturing firms  Let me turn to the national economy I want to put a different twist on the notion  of an opportunistic policy We are experiencing a favorable productivity surprise We do  not know its precise dimensions, but a lot of the anecdotal reports that we hear certainly  suggest that it is occurring In some circumstances, we would expect prices to decline If we  were in a stable price environment--whether it is a gold standard environment or a stable fiat  currency regime--and we had a favorable productivity surprise, we would expect the benefits  of that wealth gain to show up in higher standards of living by way of lower prices In an  inflation-prone environment, we would expect a lower rate of inflation There is nothing in  the mechanism of the way individual firms operate that would by itself suggest to me higher  total nominal spending I think the connection between what we see at the micro level and    3/25/97  the macro level needs unraveling, when we look at projections like those in the Greenbook  that show an acceleration in nominal spending growth and in total demand for output  We would expect a favorable productivity surprise, other things the same, to  translate into higher real interest rates In a stable price environment where there is no  discrepancy between nominal interest rates and real interest rates, the level of interest rates  would shift up In a fiat money world, if monetary policy failed to recognize the changes in  the equilibrium situation and did not adjust nominal interest rates higher, then effectively, to  use the language we normally employ, we would have eased monetary policy even if we  maintained the same level of nominal interest rates In my framework, we would see an  acceleration in money growth, and that would accommodate, as in the Greenbook  presentation, an acceleration of nominal spending growth The second difference would go  up But we know that the second difference has to come back down if we are going to  prevent an acceleration in the rate of inflation when that favorable productivity surprise  begins to dissipate One thing we do not want to do is to accommodate an acceleration of  nominal spending like the one that happened in the 1960s, and I think that was a very large  part of the story at the time  It has been disturbing for me to see that growth in both narrow and broad money  measures in virtually every major country in the world has accelerated in the last 4 to 6  months Growth in some measures, including high-powered money, has risen into the  double-digit range A sharp acceleration has occurred in Japan, Canada, and countries  throughout Europe Now, it may be that the world is experiencing a productivity surprise  and a global post-Berlin-Wall marketplace surprise, but overall that should result in higher  real interest rates, not in higher rates of inflation It does seem to me that our economic    3/25/97  analysis would lead us in the direction of saying that we have to guard against passively and  unintentionally accommodating an acceleration of nominal income growth  We are now entering the seventh year of the expansion as dated  by the National Bureau For the most part, it has been an extraordinary expansion in that not  only has inflation been contained, but more importantly it has tended to drift down through  this expansion period, which is remarkable Last summer when Fed watchers--Wall Street  types especially--were certain that we were not only going to raise rates then but that a tighter  policy was needed, I was comfortable in not supporting that view I felt from a  forward-looking perspective that we would continue to get productivity increases, downward  pressure on inflation, and a concurrent decline in the unemployment rate People's  perception about capacity and how much slack existed would be changing, which allowed us  the luxury of leaving the nominal funds rate where it was and not incurring any trouble But  I also was counting on not having an acceleration in the growth of nominal final demand    3/25/97  For quite a while we had been in a period where the successive Greenbook surprises were in  the direction of lower nominal spending growth than previously forecast Not only was  inflation lower, but nominal spending growth and domestic final demand growth were lower  Even as recently as the December Greenbook--a week or two away from the end of the  quarter--we were looking at a fairly modest growth rate of nominal spending of under 5  percent for the fourth quarter  Of course, it did not turn out that way It came in much, much stronger But then  in the February Greenbook we still were looking at the reported strength in the fourth quarter  as having been a one-time occurrence associated with such things as seasonals, weather, and  the trade sector Now we are looking at a situation where nominal spending growth  accelerated very sharply in the final two quarters of the sixth year of this expansion and,  more important in some ways, where the domestic component of final demand accelerated in  those two quarters All of that may turn out to have been a one-time thing, and spending  growth may decelerate significantly from these levels But when we look at virtually every  measure of money and credit, the monetary base, Ml, MZM, and so on, not only for this  country but around the world, we find that such money growth rates have accelerated  sharply That says to me that the world's central banks are financing an acceleration in final  demand and that monetary policy could very quickly come to be viewed as being behind the  curve and require a lot of adjustment to make sure that money growth does not start sprouting  out in higher inflation "
5929,1997-05-20," Mike, the story you tell about the past and your concerns about  the future are consistent with a supply side surprise--a productivity shock In a passive sense,  what happens is that we accommodate the existing demand because we peg a nominal  interest rate while the natural rate--the real rate--is shifting up during the period We see not  only an acceleration in nominal spending growth but in money and credit growth to go along    5/20/97  with it and make it all possible What are the dynamics, then, that cause this process to  reverse and growth in nominal spending to slow? I am referring to your baseline forecast and  not to your concern about the upside Is it not true that, in effect, the natural rate shifts back  down and we then get the slowing that the staff is projecting in money and bank credit  growth? We get what you refer to as a fairly attractive scenario  Right  I am not clear on that I understand that your framework is  different, but if growth in nominal demand accelerates to a rate of 8 percent, as it did in the  first quarter, what are the dynamics that will cut such growth in half unless you say the surge  is all statistical error and it will unwind itself? But if the dynamics of your adjustment  process include an accommodation in behavior to the increase in nominal demand, what  causes the second difference to turn negative?  For confirming evidence of that, we would expect to see slower  money and bank credit growth emerge in this period At least the staff projection, I take it, is  that we are going to get that Some of the surge never was real because it reflected bad  seasonals and an inventory buildup that will go away To be sure that interpretation is right,  we would need in a sense to accommodate a much slower growth of money and credit;  otherwise we missed it  As you know, we use MZM to monitor how these things happen  because it does not have the sweep problem It grew at a rate of 8 percent in the first quarter,  right in there with nominal GDP For the second half of this year, we would expect MZM to  get down to a 3 to 4 percent growth rate if this forecast is right  Thank you First, I want to comment about your speech at NYU a  couple of weeks ago I thought it not only was very effective but also very welcome even  though the wire service types still do not know the difference between nominal and real  GDP It is worthwhile to continue to press on those issues I have grown increasingly  concerned that, with people on both the political left and the political right criticizing us, they  could together foster a general environment of open season on the central bank Criticism on  either side does not constitute a great risk to us, but here we have a sort of unholy alliance of  reasons to criticize us So, I thought that your making the speech at that time was very  desirable, and I hope that when you get the chance to testify on the Hill in July, you will be  able to press the same arguments and maybe get some people to start listening  Probably like others around the table, I spent this long interval between meetings  traveling around the District to a lot of meetings, sometimes in small communities One  word that summarizes attitudes is ""sobering"" I noted a dramatic shift in mood and concerns    5/20/97  everywhere that I was traveling I want to run through some of the highlights of what we  have been hearing  Executives in the steel industry are very concerned about the surge in imports  stemming from very strong demand Some interpretations of developments in the last couple  of quarters suggest that we were fortunate in being able to draw in a lot of imports because  the latter helped to hold down prices and minimize inflation But both the steel companies  and the auto companies know that once these foreign manufacturers get a foothold in our  marketplace, they are very hard to dislodge  Domestic steel companies are saying that their inventories are too high and that  they are going to be working to get them back down Specialty metals producers report that  raw materials prices are up very sharply and their plants are running flat out They say that  their sales to aerospace firms are booming and that they have no more capacity to satisfy that  market They are now engaging in what they call precautionary ordering They say that  there are widely perceived shortages and longer delivery times and that sales in their medical  equipment market are strong and getting stronger worldwide A number of these companies,  including some glass and rubber companies, indicate that they are revising up their sales  projections for the second half of the year and that they are going to have a better year than  they thought at the outset of the year Oil and gas companies are saying that their operations  are running flat out and that they do not have additional capacity to meet expanding market  demand Retail sales, though, have softened very considerably in the last few weeks after  what retailers characterized as a surprisingly strong first quarter They said that we should  expect to see very aggressive efforts to move merchandise in the weeks ahead    5/20/97  Labor market developments are unsettling Union contract settlements in the first  four months of this year were above those in the first four months of last year The increase  is not dramatic, but it is clear that the trend of successive contracts resulting in successively  lower settlements is over, and it is just a question of how fast the increases will occur from  this point Entry-level wages are jumping throughout the District We talked to bankers who  said that they are losing employees When we ask where those people go when they leave,  the bankers say mainly to local school districts and to city and county governments The  dynamics are that tax revenues are very strong in these communities, and they are replacing  retirees and others and adding staff at wages that are substantially above the earlier prevailing  wages In two different areas that we visited, bankers said that last year their starting wage  for a teller was $550 per hour, whereas it is now $800 at one bank and $900 at another, if  they can find someone who is qualified This kind of increase, of course, is raising their  whole pay structure  Farmland prices are a problem As recently as last November, we were not  hearing any reports of transactions that we would have characterized as speculation in  farmland No more People are saying that farm prices are now 20 to 25 percent above  where they were a year ago One banker terms the increases that he sees as ""scary"" He says  that on the basis of current crop values the price would pencil out to about $1,500 per acre  A year ago the prices were in the range of $1,800 to $2,000 per acre He says it is typical  now to see them at $2,300 to $2,500, and everyone wants to borrow on the basis of this  newly perceived higher level I have two reports, one from south central Ohio and one from  western Ohio, of foreign investors coming in and paying twice the highest price recorded  previously in the county for large chunks of farmlands I have two other reports, one in    5/20/97  Kentucky and one in western Ohio, that the Federal Farm Credit Banks are very aggressive in  lending and are now willing to engage, once again, in types of financing that they did in the  late 1970s and early 1980s They stopped such financings in the mid-1980s, but they are  starting to do them again  Contacts in residential construction say that they are experiencing the same level  of activity as in the spring of last year One difference is that last spring the construction was  all under contract; this year more than half of it is speculative With regard to bank lending,  one banker on our board said that there are no standards Bankers are just pirating each  other's loans We asked one large banker what we would look for as large banks moved  toward caution in their C&I lending, especially after our March move He said that every  deal was skinnier than the previous one, and that deals are now being done that would not  even have been considered last summer Small and medium banks say that they have  become more cautious on consumer lending, and as a result, in order to achieve their profit  plans, they have become more aggressive on business lending  In the large manufacturing sector, we talked to representatives of quite a few  companies both at our board meetings and as we traveled around the District They say that  they are convinced that 1997 will be a better year than they had anticipated, and, therefore,  they are stepping up their capital spending for the year from what they had planned earlier,  and they are placing larger orders for the second half than they had anticipated coming into  the year  On the national economy, the first time we got a look at a Greenbook forecast for  1997 was in September 1995--that's the way the timing usually runs At that time, we had a  5-3/4 percent federal funds rate, and the projection showed nominal spending growth of less    5/20/97  than 4 percent for 1997 That definitely was a favorable outlook, and it looked as if we were  on a track to move nominal spending down toward a rate of growth that we would think of as  approximately consistent with price stability But now we have nominal spending growth  closer to 5 percent for 1997 even with the deceleration that the staff is currently projecting,  and out through 1998 such growth is projected to remain above 4 percent So, while we had  what I thought was a very favorable trend a year and a half ago when we first starting looking  as far out as 1997, the attainment of such growth has now been pushed well beyond the  current forecast horizon  What are the risks? If the Greenbook is right and we do get the projected  decelerating growth in activity in the second quarter--and it is widely perceived on the basis  of monthly reports and other evidence that this will be a soft quarter--whether growth for the  quarter comes in at the projected 18 percent is not the important thing so long as the  outcome is in that direction And if we also are getting a lower increase in the CPI--and it  may not get down to the projected 12 percent but again assuming it is in that direction--then  what are the chances we would want to do something in July? We would not have any hard  evidence that would justify tightening in the minds of many people who watch us By  August, second-quarter information is essentially all we are going to have and only very  tentative indications of how the third quarter is shaping up Even in September, we would  not have much more in terms of hard numbers except for some additional monthly readings  So, it will probably be November before we will have the kind of hard evidence at hand to  justify in everybody's mind the need to do something That would be very late For me, the  policy issue is not a question of a little now or a little later It may turn out to be a question  of a little now or a whole lot later    5/20/97  Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree that there are a lot of  similarities to the 1920s I just do not want it to end the same way [Laughter] I don't even  know what to call the next decade when the years after 2000 are counted in single digits  Once we get to the teens, I'll be fine But I expect to end my career in the next decade, and I  do not want it to be labeled ""the great contraction"" I see a growing chance that the 1990s  will be viewed at least as one of, if not the, most prosperous decade of the century It will get  some label like the ""soaring 1990s"" or something like that There are some scholars who say  that errors made starting in 1927 sowed the seeds for what happened in 1929 and afterward  I find some of the analysis of what occurred and how it looked and felt in that period rather  compelling I started my career in the Fed in 1967, a year in which some policy mistakes  were made I was out of the System in 1977, another year in which policy mistakes started to    5/20/97  be made I was not in the System in 1987; a lot of you were, but I remember very well what  kind of year that was It is now 1997, and I think we need to be cautious about being too  shortsighted regarding how much momentum is built into the expansion If the  productivity-supply side arguments are right about how much strength there is in the  economy, then it must be true, as it was in the 1920s, that real interest rates are quite a bit  higher than those we have gotten used to I think that Al Broaddus's argument earlier and the  Chairman's remarks say that we have to accept the idea, and maybe try to sell the story to  some of our critics, that high real interest rates are a sign of a strong, healthy economy and  are not a bad thing "
5950,1997-07-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman I am going to characterize reports around  the Fourth District as mixed All of the large metropolitan areas and most of the medium-size  metropolitan areas are not mixed at all; their local economies are operating flat out But a  number of smaller communities around the District and some counties still report unemployment  rates of about 9 or 10 percent My impression in driving through those counties is that such  unemployment rates might translate into only 1 or 2 people, [laughter] but still--  Construction activity is reported to be booming throughout the  District in that there are no unemployed construction workers Resources in that industry are so  tight that many people cannot get bids on construction contracts There was a recent effort to    7/1-2/97  secure bids for the Cleveland Browns' new football stadium, and they came in well over budget  It is now reported that the whole project may cost $100 million more than the first estimate  when it was agreed to build the stadium Three years ago, we negotiated a guaranteed maximum  price on our building project I am now told that we would no longer be able to get a guaranteed  maximum price So, I'm glad that we negotiated it when we did, and in fact the cost came in  under budget Under current circumstances, the project would be much more expensive  Retail spending is reported to be definitely softer who is  associated with a national retailing company but tries to assess what is happening at the stores in  our region, indicates that earnings are coming under very severe pressure The main problems  that he sees are in imported inventories Such imports account for about 70 percent of the  problems with inventories insofar as the latter relate to filling orders and production pipelines  Labor contract settlements have been coming in with increases of around 3 to 4  percent in most cases There clearly has been an uptick from previous settlements, so that the  period of successive contracts coming in somewhat lower than prior contracts is definitely over  We had one construction union contract that went to arbitration and came in at 48 percent We  all hear the same talk about labor shortages in our Districts, and I will not go further on that We  have heard some talk about job fairs about which I am a bit puzzled after listening to some of the  reports around the table this afternoon Columbus city officials went to Boston to hold a job fair  to recruit people and Cincinnati officials went to San Francisco I hope they had a good time  [laughter] because it is not likely that they hired many new workers  We are told that there is no backlog in orders of steel, basically  because new domestic capacity is coming on at a time when imports continue to be very strong  and there are downward pressures on prices One director feels very strongly that plant and  equipment spending is going to slow, mainly because he says the motor vehicle companies are  going to be winding down their spending on new capacity I think he is talking principally about  domestic companies Communications companies in one of our metropolitan areas said that  their yellow-page listings are running at an all-time record, especially business listings, which  they said are rising very sharply Phone line installations are proceeding at rates above previous  records Bankers are telling us that earnings are good but they are worried about not being able  to maintain these earnings Their margins are getting squeezed, and the quality of their loan  portfolios is deteriorating Everybody is talking about very aggressive bidding for real estate  deals that they would not have considered not that long ago We hear more reports that  speculative residential and commercial projects are getting funded, mainly as banks try to  achieve their earnings objectives for the year Down in Kentucky, horse farmland prices are  jumping [Laughter] Next year I will say they are galloping! We are told that land that was  running $3,500 to $3,800 per acre in 1996--these are horse farms--was recently selling for  $4,500 to $5,000 So, there has been a significant notch up Two of our directors have argued  that inflation is understated They claim that many discounts that they had become used to and  regularly expected are simply no longer available  Let me shift to some thoughts about the national economic environment in which we  find ourselves Often in the past when we have talked about recent and prospective near-term  developments, we have given attention to such things as inventories, trade statistics, and the like    7/1-2/97  Usually we try to look through the statistics for the past couple of years and the forecasts for the  next couple of years in an effort to discern the basic trends in productivity, labor force growth,  labor force participation, and those kinds of things I want to focus on a much longer-term  perspective for a few minutes The business cycle dating committee at the National Bureau of  Economic Research says that this expansion is now past its seventh year Without that  eight-month contraction associated with the Gulf War, they would be saying that we have just  finished 15 years of expansion This period generally has been characterized by a rising  participation rate in the labor force, a declining unemployment rate, a concurrent downward  trend of inflation, and even a recent improvement in the saving rate There have also been  increasing returns to capital relative to returns to labor associated not only with increased capital  inflows but a domestic investment spending boom Certainly, at least some of these good results  are due to good policies I think even our most severe critics would give us some credit for  helping to make this economic performance come about It was not all luck, and it was not all  technology and innovation  Looking back, if the past 15 years had been characterized by several 2- to 3-year  stop-and-go cycles and/or if the inflation rate had averaged, say, 5 or 6 percent through this  period, I think we would all agree that standards of living would be lower today, the capital stock  would be smaller, and overall the economy would not look and feel nearly as good as it does If  5 years from now we are talking about an expansion that is approximately 20 years old, it will be  because the basic trends that have characterized the last 15 years have been maintained  Instead of asking how we can keep inflation from going up, we could pose the  question simply by asking how we might improve the chances that the expansion will last    7/1-2/97  another 5 years Part of our answer probably would be that a necessary but certainly not a  sufficient condition is to prevent the escalation of inflation Some of the Fed watchers--and  some of us, too--who look back on what we did in 1994 have characterized those actions as  preemptive anti-inflation measures But it would be just as accurate to say that they reflected a  preemptive anti-recessionary policy That is because had we not done what we did, I believe we  could make a very good case that we would have had a 1996-1997 recession If we had failed to  act in 1994 and inflation had accelerated, we would today be facing a higher unemployment rate  than we currently have, a lower level of output, less overall capacity, and the economy would not  feel as good So, we were preemptive in the sense of being anti unemployment and preserving  growth  When we turn to our future prospects, if we state our objective as minimizing the risk  that the year 2000 will turn out to be a recession year, I think we would argue that it is necessary  but not sufficient to prevent more inflation from emerging in 1998 and 1999 If we are  successful in doing that, employment is going to be higher and output and standards of living are  going to be higher when we get to the year 2000 This is going to be a richer country The  frustration comes when we look at policy options for the near term, for the next year or two The  latter often involve raising the unemployment rate to prevent inflation, but the ultimate objective  is preventing the emergence of a recession and unemployment Sometimes it must sound to  people out on Main Street that we had to create unemployment in order to prevent  unemployment I think we need to find ways to cast our policy alternatives and to communicate  our objectives in a manner that does not involve retarding growth and raising unemployment,  even for an interim period There are ways of thinking and talking about the interim objective of    7/1-2/97  stabilizing the purchasing power of money that do not involve excess supply of or demand for  output, or excess supply of or demand for labor I think that would be a useful thing for us to be  working on as we struggle our way to the year 2000 Thank you  I don't know if I can convert this into a question, but I will make a  comment that ends with a question mark  Thank you It was an interesting paper and it led to provocative and  3/ Secretary's note In Mr Stockton's statement and the discussion that followed, reference was made to a staff memorandum to the Committee dated June 19, 1997, and titled ""Toward a Working Definition of Price Stability"" A copy of the memorandum has been placed in Committee files    7/1-2/97  useful discussions with my staff I was glad to see not only the paper but to have the topic  included on the agenda When I approach the subject of various price statistics as potentially  useful information for policy, I cannot help but think back to the time when I was a Boy Scout  and had to learn the difference between magnetic north and true north How much adjustment  you make depends on where you are on the globe The adjustment is important because no one  wants to go to magnetic north Likewise, we use these statistical series to guide us toward some  place where we want to go, but it is also important that we not lose sight of where that place is  The paper starts by approaching the issue of how we measure inflation I start a  different way I start by asking how I should define the condition of noninflation because prices  are changing all the time to some degree Noninflation to me is a condition in which the  weighted average of those prices that are rising is just matched by the weighted average of those  prices that are falling This immediately gets to the question, prices of what? How do we want  to use the concept of inflation in talking about what we are trying to prevent or minimize? In a  gold standard world that was fairly easy because people in such a world were conditioned to the  notion that inflation meant it took more gold dust or nuggets to buy the same thing  Unfortunately, we in the modem world have gotten into the habit of talking about inflation in  terms of rising prices of things instead of an increase in the number of money units it takes to  buy those things, which is really what inflation is and what we want to measure  Regarding what to measure, we are condemned to live in a world now and forever in  which we can only distribute and consume what we produce Brezhnev thought that such a  world was the result of a capitalist plot; he never discovered markets Our inflation measure has  to relate to output over time, which does not mean we should ignore asset prices Ultimately, it    7/1-2/97  has to be a weighted average of the prices of things that people buy and consume over time  Some of those prices always seem to go up; tickets to Cleveland Indian baseball games certainly  do Some prices go down; computer prices certainly do We are trying to find some way to  normalize all of that information about prices in the minds of people and get them thinking that,  yes, some prices are always going up, some are always going down We want them to see price  changes as averaging out That is what I mean by noninflation  I think our price index has to be the broadest possible measure of output prices, but we  also have to have information about asset prices That does not mean that we necessarily want to  include asset prices in our statistical measure With regard to the relevant theory, Alchian and  Kessel developed a theoretical framework about 30 years ago, and Alchian and Klein did further  work in the early 1970s The St Louis Fed staff tried to put some empirical bones on that in the  mid-1970s, using various statistical measures that introduced asset prices into the Alchian and  Klein framework About two years ago at a Bank of Japan Conference, Charles Goodhart went  through all that theory again and he tried to develop an empirical measure for England using  certain asset prices So, there has been some work that one could build on At this point,  however, my judgment is that we would add more noise than we know how to process if we  included asset prices in our measure than if we did not We are better off seeking as broad a  measure as we can of those things that are simply current consumables over time Question  mark [Laughter]  A couple of things With regard to your question, Mr Chairman, we  too have looked at this with gross domestic purchases instead of nominal GDP and also the  command basis of GDP That's because we are trying to relate money held to household  income and the command of US citizens over resources It does change the picture a little The  statistical relationship of MZM is better in terms of the stability of the functional relationship  The series is volatile because of the higher interest elasticity, but we still get a tighter fit with  MZM, especially if we use gross domestic purchases or the command basis  My other question, a real question, is how to complete the picture of the NAIRU  alternative The Bluebook presents almost a ""for your information"" kind of alternative that  assumes the NAIRU is 48 percent, and then it really doesn't do anything with it It would be  helpful, to me anyway, to have Exhibit 4 completed to include what would be implied for the  velocities of the three aggregates under that assumption and then the appropriate ranges for the  aggregates You might choose not to change the nominal funds rate, so opportunity costs would  not change, but the lower NAIRU has to have an implication for your choice of the appropriate  ranges  I agree with that to the extent that we decide not to change the way  we use the ranges for the monetary aggregates But in anticipation of the possibility that in one,  two, three or more Humphrey-Hawkins hearings down the road we may want to give a little  different weight to the information M2 is providing, I think it would be useful to start preparing  the Congress and the public for the change We would alert them that the change would not be a  return to the 1970s kind of monetary targeting but rather that we intended to use these aggregates  as a contemporaneous monitor of how our policy actions are interacting with the real economy I  believe it would be a mistake to allow people on the outside to think that we will go back to    7/1-2/97  setting target ranges in the forward-looking sense that they could provide information to trigger  increases or decreases in the federal funds rate Rather, if a range is used for monitoring and  especially if, as the staff paper says, the feedback effects of interactions--the simultaneous  determination aspect of nominal income and money--are getting more weight, then we will want  to characterize that range as a monitor of what is going on in the economy It is telling us  something about the demand for central bank money and is not a target that we are trying to hit  I hope not  That may have come from a speech that I gave  It was in a speech where I said that a Western businessman traveling  in China visited a site where hundreds of workers were building an earthen dam with shovels  The businessman suggested that they could get an earth-moving piece of equipment to build that  dam in an afternoon The Chinese official asked what could be done about all the unemployment  that would create The businessman replied that he now understood He thought they were    7/1-2/97  building a dam, but the Chinese authorities really were trying to create work for people So, he  had a suggestion to make, namely to take away their shovels and give them spoons [Laughter]  Don, I believe you provided a useful framework for thinking about  demand side/supply side The need to think about that is unavoidable We do that implicitly  So, why not do it explicitly? It is very helpful to be forced into that framework as we think about  what is going on and the policy regime with which we respond You say that the model does not  really care whether it is dealing with a supply-side or a demand-side shock; it responds to output  and inflation gaps Of course, as policymakers we have to care It is important for us to try to  evaluate a shock when it occurs even if we cannot be sure of what we mean by demand side and  supply side I think I know what you mean Over the last 30 years, we were comfortable in  thinking of the oil events of 1974 as a negative supply shock or those in 1986 as a favorable  supply shock But there are a lot of other events that shock the economic system such as  international developments certainly Suez, the Bay of Pigs, and Kuwait come to mind There  also are domestic events like the Crash of 1929, Nixon's price controls, and things like that    7/1-2/97  I do not know whether you call them supply side, demand side, or what, but we might  want to react differently in a policy sense depending upon which of those we think it is--the  nature of the events There is a potential interdependence based on the monetary policy regime  that I think we have to be very careful about It does get back to this question of when we may  want to exercise caution in the Brainard sense or the Bill Poole sense or when we should worry  about paralysis I suspect--this is only a guess at this point--that to the extent we are confident  that we are dealing only with a demand-side development, we would lean in the direction of  caution To the extent we believe we are dealing with what starts as a supply-side event--it may  be an asset market development--then we need to resist paralysis The reason for that is the  following We may have a series of developments that one might characterize as being a  favorable supply-side shock such as the recent increase in productivity--where people perceive  that the real rate of return on productive capital is rising for a whole host of reasons The reason  we worry about a pegged nominal interest rate approach to policy is that the market dynamics of  people reacting to the perception of rising real returns and increasing wealth raise the opportunity  costs of holding central bank money If we have a derived demand for central bank money, a  pegged nominal interest rate policy would cause us to expand central bank money This would  unintentionally convert a favorable supply-side shock into a demand shock We would want to  be a little more activist to avoid converting a favorable supply shock or a negative supply shock,  say the Kuwait War, into an adverse demand shock That is what I mean by the interdependency  between the two  Sometimes we talk about those in terms of what has happened to the natural rate of  interest or something similar We can translate these things into the kind of framework that we    7/1-2/97  are talking about here I think the analysis of whether we can convert one kind of shock into the  other type of a shock, intentionally or not, needs to be fleshed out a little more to enable us to  guard against an inadvertent outcome That is just a comment and if you want to react to that, I  would be glad to hear your thoughts because I don't feel that I have thought it through as  carefully as I need to  On your alternative wording for the operational paragraph of the directive, I like  getting rid of the ""woulds"" and ""mights"" and all that However, I really do not want to introduce  the words ""tighten"" and ""ease"" into the directive even though it is clear that the language refers  to tightening and easing conditions in reserve markets What we are talking about is expanding  or contracting central bank money We all know that if we have a supply-side event, or possibly  a demand-side event but I have not thought about that enough, we can in effect tighten or ease  money market conditions or reserve conditions with an unchanged fed funds rate Conditions in  reserve markets can tighten or ease if we fail to change the nominal funds rate based on the  derived demand for central bank money as modified by external shocks The proposed directive  language would imply that only our actions cause reserve conditions to tighten or ease, and we  know that is not true It is failing to change the funds rate that would cause them to tighten  unintentionally or ease unintentionally, and we often are trying to guard against that  I want to respond to your point about the demand-side shock late last  year and early this year That was a case where I became increasingly concerned that what was  really going on related fundamentally to the supply side, and we were inadvertently converting it  into a demand-side shock by holding the nominal funds rate steady We were unintentionally  creating more demand, but the initial impetus came from the favorable supply-side surprises  I do not think this language is ready for prime time  Thank you I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman, that at  this point no action is the best course mainly because any rationale we might have for taking  action would not be well understood and would not be credible And therein lies the challenge of  moving ahead from here How do we make any rationale that we have credible to the array of  audiences that we have out there? I think that what is credible as a rationale changes depending  on the nature of the economic environment and trend Certainly, it makes quite a difference if  we are facing pure demand-side or pure supply-side forces If we are experiencing a favorable  productivity shock, then we would expect downward pressure on the level of output prices and  an increase in asset prices One version of opportunism would be to want to lock in that lower  level of output prices But an inadvertent conversion of a favorable supply development into a  demand shock or an excess demand situation would not be seen in rising unit labor costs or in    7/1-2/97  rising output prices We would not see it in those markets While we tend to look at retail sales  and other nonfinancial areas of the economy, that is not where we would see it We would see it  in speculative developments and asset prices Like Cathy Minehan, I too was struck yesterday  by how many of you are hearing what I am starting to hear about growing signs of speculative  activity in farm land, residential real estate, and commercial real estate I worry a little that these  symptoms of speculative excesses, rather than the sort of things we normally look at, may be the  first early warning signals of developments down the road that we would have to react very  sharply to As we move from here to August, I think we need to be looking for and worrying  more about indications of speculative activity than about conventional indicators of wage-push  or cost-push inflation such as unit labor costs and that sort of thing "
5976,1997-08-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to mention only a few things from  the District that relate to the national outlook and to convey some of my concerns about where we  are or may be in a few months On the retail outlook question discussed earlier,  the head of a major retail company, said that the first half of this quarter had been  excellent, with double-digit rates of increase However, he is not yet confident that the strength can  be sustained He said it would be mid-September before he would be able to begin to assess the  extent of the pickup in holiday season ordering and to reach a judgment on whether the recent  bounceback in sales was anything more than a temporary aberration from the softness in the spring  On the question of inventories, his view was that in the case of autos, the buildup was in  domestically produced vehicles, not imports However, in the case of dry goods, the rise reflected  imports, not domestic goods He said that imported goods accounted for some 70 percent of his  company's stocks  Manufacturers of communications equipment reported to us in the spring that their sales  had been disappointing More recently, however, they indicated that there had been a significant  pickup in new orders and that their backlogs were starting to build again One of our directors said  that the whole high-tech sector has ramped up sharply after being soft for several months    8/19/97  One area that concerns me, as it does others around the table, is real estate With regard  to farmland, we are continuing to hear reports of sudden and sharp increases in prices that make no  sense if we think in terms of the agricultural use of that land The huge price increases are not  limited to Kentucky horse farms, and that leads us to speculate that those increases may reflect the  anticipated conversion of these lands to alternative uses at some point in the future In any event,  we are not sure what to make of these very dramatic reports  We are told that construction in the region is being constrained only by labor shortages  Contractors simply are not able to get more construction workers Projects are being delayed or  they are being completed much later than anticipated, and new bids are coming in significantly  higher than previously There are still some concerns about sluggish sales of higher-priced homes,  but reports from most of our metropolitan areas indicate that there has been a recent pickup in  existing home sales after a very slow spring That is happening through much of the region One  isolated report, from is that there has been absolutely no  traffic in the four months that his house has been on the market in Columbus, Ohio  Bankers tell us that vacancies are appearing in shopping malls throughout the region  The new malls may get the tenants, but they are leaving behind vacant stores throughout the  District This development is still in its early stages One banker claimed that through next year,  we are going to see sharply rising vacancies in commercial retail space Another banker said with  regard to developers that it is getting hard to hold them back and they are getting later and later in  their payments The community bankers claim that they are making fewer unsecured loans, but  they say that the regionals and super regionals continue to lower their credit standards  I have a couple of observations about the labor markets that provide a little different  twist on productivity and about what we are hearing and reading concerning developments in labor    8/19/97  markets who runs a small manufacturing company that is  mostly related to the motor vehicle industry and does a fair amount of exporting, said that he cannot  hire the same skilled worker at the same rate as he could one or two years ago However, he is not  willing to raise his workers' wages, and he also does not feel that he needs to because in a sense he  is dumbing down his workforce He still pays the same wage, but because his business makes use  of computer-driven machinery, computerized inventory control, and computerized scheduling he is  able to produce the same output and continue to pay the same wage He simply has smarter  equipment coupled with less skilled workers to get the same output That will not show up in  productivity  who is associated with a company that  employs several hundred workers, said that software is available to permit the flexible use of a  workforce with unusual hours and that has greatly increased their ability to tap into labor pools that  were unavailable to them previously Examples cited include housewives and formerly retired  people who do not want 40-hour workweeks but are willing to work odd schedules The available  software allows the preferences of these people to be accommodated Another company that  produces auto parts needs a flexible workforce to meet the just-in-time demands of its customers  A few years ago, they could not have handled such demands, but they are now able to do so  because of the new software  Finally, a very large company with 70,000 employees worldwide is now using very  sophisticated, multimedia educational software to train their workers They have been able to  reduce their training costs after several years of dramatic increases in such costs And at the same  time, they claim to have increased the effectiveness of their training by 80 percent Again, this is  something that would not show up in productivity statistics There is a question as to how much    8/19/97  training actually occurs in a three-hour training session or a three-week training session When  asked how many students were in their classes, the reply was three students; the others in the  classes were just avoiding work  Concerning paradigms and the outlook in the Greenbook, anytime I hear that something  is new, whether it is an idea or a paradigm or whatever, I usually react by thinking that what is new  probably is not true, and what is true is not new It was said in this room well over 25 years ago  that the old laws of economics had been repealed It was not true then and it is not true now The  old laws of economics still work Of course, 26 years ago last Friday the US government tried to  repeal the laws of economics, but I hope that that will never happen again It may be that what is  called a new paradigm simply involves allowing what we all accept as fundamental economic  forces to operate in a less fettered way than previously That does lead to some optimism about the  sustainability of the expansion With regard to the new paradigm of pessimism as it relates to  deflation, we certainly are not hearing any of that when it comes to asset prices  When I looked at the Greenbook and listened to a number of people report about a  pickup in economic activity, the words ""rebounding"" and ""somewhat stronger"" were used to  describe the near-term outlook Yet, the Greenbook has 26 percent real GDP growth in the second  quarter and 23 percent for the third quarter On the surface, that would lead people to think that  there is some weakening or softening going on But what it says to me is that the growth reported  for the second quarter, assuming that the Commerce Department numbers are correct, was  unsustainable The mix was unsustainable and, as one exceptionally smart economist once said,  unsustainable things have a habit of ending When we look at that second quarter with weakness  on the consumer side, booming capital spending--which would suggest capacity is increasing--a  dramatic surge in imports, and inventory accumulation that is extraordinary for a second quarter,    8/19/97  we have to conclude that something is fundamentally wrong If those quarterly numbers are right,  those conditions cannot be sustained The Greenbook fixes things by having everything shift the  other way The consumer comes back, which I guess is what we mean by a pickup or rebound even  though real GDP is projected to slow There is a dramatic negative swing in inventory spending,  and net exports also make a negative contribution in the forecast for the third quarter I don't know  whether that is a correct forecast or not I certainly hope so because if it isn't, our problems will be  much, much greater We need an outcome something like the Greenbook's third quarter and also  its fourth quarter or we will have missed something here in a very serious way  The question in my mind, then, is how to monitor whether that is occurring or not A  part of it, getting into the monetary numbers, is the need to make sure that the behavior of those  numbers stays rather tranquil, including slow growth in M2 which has been running at a rate just  under 5 percent and some slowing in the growth of MZM from almost 7 percent in the second  quarter to something under 5 percent The recent jump in the growth of the monetary base is also  worrisome even though it reflects only a few weeks' data; that growth needs to slow  I am troubled, though, that as we get out to September 30 th, we are not going to know a  great deal more than we do today about the performance of the economy It really is going to be  November before we get a reading on how good a job the staff has done in forecasting an economy  that corrects the problem second quarter I would simply like to skip October because nearly all the  corrections take place in October We ought to repeal October, jump from the end of September  into November, and then get it right Thank you  Agree "
5999,1997-09-30," Thank you I always pay special attention to September Greenbooks  because they give us that extra year in the forecast horizon to think about  But September forecasts are nonetheless useful A year ago in  September, I looked at the projections and noted that nominal spending was increasing at a rate of  around 4-1/2 percent and not much progress was being made in the direction of reduced growth  This forecast pulls down nominal spending growth by a full percentage point by the end of 1998  compared to the previous forecast, but it also runs growth out in 1999 at a rate of around 3-1/2  percent I find that interesting, but I need to know how it is coming about As I understand it,    9/30/97  Mike, your baseline assumption is that starting perhaps 6 months or so from now the Committee  will raise the federal funds rate by 100 basis points over the course of next year, presumably in 1/4  percentage point steps That is more of a total increase than you were previously assuming I  would imagine that, as a general principle, the longer we delay taking any kind of policy action, the  more policy action you assume we will have to have to get the same result In comparison with  your assumption of starting to raise the funds rate in 6 months to produce the Greenbook forecast  result, assuming we like that result, what kind of tradeoff in timing versus amount would you have  in mind if we started to tighten policy now? How much less of an increase in the funds rate might  we need in total to produce the same Greenbook forecast through 1999?  So your view is not that we do less in total, but that we would start to  reverse it sooner?    9/30/97  Thank you In addition to our usual advisory council meetings and  other contacts, we had a board of directors meeting earlier this month with all the directors from  our three offices and, in conjunction with that, a breakfast with some leading manufacturing CEOs  to talk about innovations, greater efficiencies, and new products Chairman Greenspan was present  to hear these executives as well as the directors So, if the way I feed back what was said does not  fit with your impressions and recollections, Mr Chairman, you may want to add to or correct what  I have to say here  We were trying to get a sense of what was happening within companies and whether or  not that resonates well with what we see in various economic statistics Some of the common  themes and responses were as follows The increase in manufacturing capacity and in efficiency  and/or productivity as seen by firms reflects in part the very strong incentives that they all feel as  well as the availability of new technologies that can be used to minimize their downtimes, tighten  their control of factor input costs, and improve the management of their inventories They said that  the incentives for much of that increase in capacity and related productivity would have been there  and could have been accommodated even without major expenditures for capacity They talked a  lot about the continued shortening in product life cycles, and observed that the only way they could  hold prevailing product prices steady was through product enhancements They doubted whether  such enhancements were accurately reflected as different products within their own firms, let alone  in the statistics The CAD/CAM technologies are making it possible for them to shorten product  life cycles dramatically, which then allows them to customize the products far more readily than  they were able to before Also, they offer more frequent shipments to their customers as a way to  reduce the inventory costs of the customers That sometimes allows them to raise the posted price,  but for the most part it simply reduces the pressure they feel to cut their prices That is a product    9/30/97  enhancement even though it would never be recorded as a different product when it is simply made  available more frequently Production automation means that the setup times are dropping sharply,  and in turn that means that business firms have more actual capacity even with the same physical  plant facilities and product enhancements are facilitated  Global competition and outsourcing together with the constraints on pricing are  increasing the incentives for innovating and introducing new products at a faster pace I got the  sense that we were nowhere close to the end of that set of opportunities One newspaper executive  talked about how their overhead relative to total revenue has been falling because the same support  expenditures are now spread over much, much larger volumes This is made possible by new  technologies that have caused a very sharp drop in production and distribution costs Steel is one  industry that was well represented, and they commented that over the last 10 years their industry  has had a major increase in labor productivity averaging 44 percent per year Over that same 10  years, they have experienced a 57 percent increase in labor costs per hour with no increase in  product costs per ton  A little more on labor An interesting twist on what we have been hearing or thinking  about the behavior of unions is that they are now providing more and more intensive training of  union workers to insure that the productivity of their members versus nonunion workers is  sufficient to more than offset any wage differences Within the last 10 years, construction and  some other unions have adopted what they now call a ""lifetime-of-learning"" philosophy as a part of  the rationale for union membership The objective is, of course, to have their members stay in  demand as the most highly-skilled and therefore the most highly-paid workers This is a shift away  from earlier philosophies of protecting jobs through various restrictive labor market practices  There was also a claim that for office workers we are only beginning to see the kinds of    9/30/97  technologies that will allow workers to be trained and retrained on a continuing basis at their desks  or their work stations How that might enhance productivity also was discussed  One note about the tightness of labor markets It was said that Wendy's Restaurants  across the nation once had a notice in the center of every table that said ""special of the day"" Now  every table has a list of ""positions available""  Other directors commented that retail sales went flat last spring They characterized  retail markets by saying that ""customers went into a cave"" Then, in the course of July and August,  customers crawled out of their caves and started to spend at a surprisingly strong rate in the view of  some directors Major retailers reportedly are growing more confident, and the expectation now is  that we will see orders increasing in the period ahead  With respect to the real estate market, we hear that higher-priced homes are still staying  on the market a relatively long time and that in some metro areas overbuilding is becoming more  obvious in what had been hot markets Our directors expect that situation to get even worse Some  of the bank directors reported brisk home refinancing in the most recent weeks The bankers also  talked about increasingly skimpy pricing in their C&I lending They claimed that banks have  plenty of money to lend and that everyone is driving their volume up to maintain earnings in the  face of slimmer margins One banker commented that everybody is chasing deals  Turning to the national economy, a year ago we were looking at a near-term forecast for  the fourth quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of this year that looked satisfactory, with nominal  spending growth in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent range Of course, that did not happen We were very  surprised at how much stronger than expected nominal and real growth were in that period That  was a pleasant development because, at least in that period, the rapid growth was not yet associated  with an acceleration of inflation With the advantage of hindsight, we can see that that condition    9/30/97  was being signaled by an acceleration of money growth We got a lot more growth in broad money  but also in the base, sweep-adjusted Ml, and MZM than was projected at the time of the September  meeting Nominal spending growth needed to slow down, and it did slow down in the spring  quarter Money growth also slowed down, providing a little respite But money growth then  started to accelerate again, and we are now getting upward revisions in the third-quarter GDP  numbers, both real and nominal I was out in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago and Larry  Klein, who was on Bob Parry's program, reported that he uses a high-frequency model to make a  new estimate of the economy every Monday He has been revising his forecast successively  upward, and at that point he already had growth of 4 percent in real and 6 percent in nominal GDP  for this quarter He said that each time he makes this estimate, the economy looks a little stronger  That concerns me because we again are looking at a rather good forecast in the  Greenbook If this forecast turns out to be correct with or without the policy adjustments it implies,  I would be comfortable But I am more and more concerned that we are likely to be surprised again  in the near term by just how much stronger nominal spending is than we are anticipating So, when  the money numbers accelerate as dramatically as they have over the last couple of months, I see a  need for those increases to slow and I am not comfortable that our policy is right I cannot  visualize the conditions that would allow me to accept growth of the sweep-adjusted monetary base  on the order of 7 percent--and that growth is currently accelerating--at this stage of the cycle It  says to me that we more likely have calibrated the nominal funds rates too low rather than too high  The way we usually look at real interest rates--the real funds rate or some other real  short-term interest rate--abstracts from the idea that real interest rates have to be thought of in a  relative context If people in their decision-making are adjusting upward their expectations about  real returns on productive assets in real estate markets, equity markets, or elsewhere, then real    9/30/97  short-term money market interest rates have moved down in a relative sense even if consumer price  inflation has moved down There were references earlier to the possibility that boom conditions  could emerge If boom conditions are starting to emerge in the minds of people, then the stance or  thrust of policy has become progressively more expansionary even with an unchanged nominal  funds rate  Don, you mentioned that a substantial slowing in the growth of M2 was  necessary for such growth to be consistent with the staff forecast of nominal GDP in the fourth  quarter The Bluebook has M2 growth down to 4 percent in November and December This  suggests to me that the growth of overall commercial bank balance sheets--whether we focus on the  demand for credit, the supply of credit, or some interaction between them--also has to decelerate  very sharply from what we have seen in recent months The balance sheets still have to balance  Given an unchanged funds rate and the Greenbook-type forecast of the real economy, what  produces that significant deceleration in the growth of bank balance sheets and therefore money  growth?    9/30/97  Your answer says that we can get a slowing in the broad money  measures without a slowing in the growth of aggregate bank credit You also suggested in your  earlier remarks that if we do not see the slower growth of, say, M2 that you are now projecting, that    9/30/97  might be evidence that we are not getting the slowing in nominal demand If it is not an  opportunity cost argument, what is the argument that produces the slowing in M2 growth?  I think what is going on in the labor markets is a fascinating subject, one  that I wish I understood better I also wish that our friends on the European continent understood a  lot better than I do what is going on in our labor markets It does tell us a lot about the distribution  of the current prosperity and about how well all the wealth creation is being shared by our people  But I am not sure it tells me a lot about the purchasing power of money, at least not in a direct way  I also am very interested in all the discussions about capacity, capacity utilization, productivity,  efficiency, and capital formation because even though they too don't tell me anything directly  about what is going to happen to the purchasing power of money, they give important information  about things that I think directly bear on the purchasing power of money The demand for labor is  a derived demand; it is derived from the demand for goods and services That in turn, as Bob Parry  says, depends on nominal spending, which does have something to do with money I am less  comfortable than Bob seemed to be that we will get the needed deceleration in nominal spending    9/30/97  growth But with respect to the stories about productivity, capacity, capital formation, and all of  that, if the perceived real return to productive capital is rising due to technology, including both  wealth effects and substitution effects, that indicates to me that the demand for high-powered  money must be declining But what we see is an increased demand for bank credit to finance it all  That effect is somewhat like that associated with the old real bills doctrine when it signaled what  was interpreted as an increased demand for base money while modern theory tells us the quantity  needed to go down We should not be seeing an acceleration in base money growth at this stage  So, I think that we are probably late What I would be looking for in the next six weeks is what  Don Kohn alluded to, namely the much needed deceleration in the broad measures of money If we  do not get it, then I will conclude that we made a mistake "
6022,1997-11-12," Thank you In addition to the usual discussions we have had with  directors and advisory council members since the last FOMC meeting, we also spent some time  visiting communities around southern and western Ohio and central and northern Kentucky I  came away with an impression similar to the one I felt almost 10 years ago when I was still  traveling around Southern California, namely that I was in a rare part of the world and everybody  else must be suffering because everything was booming where we were And these are counties  that are not accustomed to experiencing such prosperity  Bankers reported strong loan demand in all categories, with most getting stronger Of  course, there has been a surge in mortgage refinancing that I am sure most people are seeing  around the country In the areas that we visited, people reported that consumer loan demand  was still very strong, especially auto-related The most prominent stories related to real estate  lending Our contacts said it was booming everywhere One banker in Kentucky indicated that  there was more speculative building under construction now than at any time in his memory, and    11/12/97 48  he is certainly older than I am He commented that in his county if a construction worker were  driving through in a pickup and happened to have a breakdown near a vacant field, by the time  he got the tools out of the back of the truck at least five bankers would stop and offer to finance  the project for him! [Laughter] Just before our visit, one banker saw seven proposals for new  speculative building projects He said three of the ideas were so poorly justified that they did not  even have a plan, and all the potential borrowers were significantly undercapitalized There are a  lot of reports that farmland is being acquired for future conversion to either commercial or  residential uses or on the chance that somebody might build an interstate interchange on the land,  making it more valuable These are not prospects at all, just hopes In central Kentucky, we  were told that the number of lots developed and ready for construction was triple the number of a  year ago Bankers said that a sharp net in-migration into the region was expected I asked them  from where and they didn't know Obviously, they thought that people were going to move into  their area because the local economies were in such good shape right now We were hearing the  usual reports of farmland prices well above what crop values would justify We heard more  stories of residential mortgages being made by nonbanks with 125 percent loan-to-value ratios  One banker said that one of his nonbank directors indicated that he was strongly opposed to  participation in any economic development efforts by the state or by the county because his  firm's labor turnover was high and he wanted to slow growth  On the labor side, we were told that entry-level tellers were being paid around $14 to  $15 an hour to start One reported $20 an hour for a teller trainee Our contacts said that banks  that advertised in newspapers for employees got no applications at all Instead, the banks were  resorting to hiring bounties They were paying existing employees to bring in a friend or a    11/12/97 49  relative and then paying them part of the bonus, depending on how long the new employee  lasted One new bank said that in their first six months of operations, they had surpassed their  initial three-year plan for earning assets There were more stories about consumer loans going  from being current to bankruptcy status without the transitory stages of late payments and  delinquencies  In other reports from directors and advisory council members, like Tom Hoenig we  have heard about the bottlenecks in rail transportation and even about the difficulty of booking  trucking transportation The claim is that there is a shortage of truck drivers, and our contacts  said that it was common now to pay $40,000 a year or more for truck drivers We have heard  reports of other worker shortages, including nurses, warehouse workers, computer operators and  programmers, and machinists Somebody reported to us that pickers and packers were now  getting $14 an hour; I'm not sure exactly what pickers and packers do! One company, a fairly  good-sized shop, said that they had a number of machinists whom they had been paying $18 an  hour, and a group of them walked out and went to a nonunion shop for $21 an hour The  unionized company cannot find replacements at $18 an hour, and the union will not agree to their  hiring new people at higher wages than the existing workers receive They are demanding that  the whole pay structure be raised So, the company's owners are now looking into the option of  simply shutting the plant and moving the whole operation to Mexico On health care, we heard  from one advisory council member that increases in medical costs are now sticking and that we  should expect such costs to rise for the next several years--the same kind of thing that Al  Broaddus mentioned    11/12/97 50  Three years ago I asked the members of my small business advisory council if they  could contemplate still being in business in five years if they were not able to increase the prices  of their products or services at all over that period The response was a unanimous ""yes,"" and  they explained to us how they could do that When I asked the same question recently, the  responses were almost all ""no"" or ""doubtful"" The reasons they give are that labor costs have  risen much more than they had expected, the quality of the labor force has fallen more than they  had anticipated, and the easy steps to increase productivity have already been taken Moreover,  they now expect more labor militancy, work stoppages, and competition from nonunion  operations Some commented that they thought the unions were going to demand catch-up  raises As the unions view developments, business earnings have been so good because the  benefits of increased productivity and efficiency have all gone to owners and not to workers, so  now it is the workers' turn  We heard some general comments to the effect that compensation data understate  actual labor costs It is an interesting phenomenon that nobody thinks that their situation is  normal It will be interesting as we go around the table to see how others view this phenomenon  If all of us are operating above average, it is going to be hard to know what is really going on  No one thinks that the unemployment numbers reflect what they are seeing in their communities  and their counties; nobody thinks that the inflation data reflect what they are seeing; no one  thinks that the compensation numbers reflect what they are experiencing; nobody thinks that  their labor turnover experience is reflected in the statistics Generally, our directors believe that  there is a buildup of inflationary pressures and that the inflation risks are decidedly on the    11/12/97 51  upside They report that sectors of the regional economy such as construction are operating flat  out, constrained only by the availability of financing  I have a couple of thoughts on the national economy One relates to the wealth effect  that Mike Prell mentioned Mike referred to high-end SUVs and second homes We surveyed  boat builders and found that luxury boats are doing very well The recent International Boat  Show in Annapolis was said to have been the best in over 10 years It is the high-end boats, both  power and sailboats, that are selling extremely well As we were driving around in Kentucky,  one banker reported that cars with license plates from New York and Massachusetts sometimes  pull into a farmhouse driveway and offer to pay cash for the farm  It appears that we have been in a virtuous phase of the cycle during the last few years,  with strong growth in income, output, and employment, good productivity, and falling inflation  It seems to me that the risks are rising that we are going to experience the mirror image of those  favorable developments including slower economic growth with possible declines in income,  output, and employment, and rising inflation On the outlook for corporate earnings and the  stock market, I was surprised that the Greenbook talks about a decline of only 20 percent in stock  prices because it also says that we have seen the peak level of corporate earnings in the third  quarter of this year According to the Greenbook, corporate earnings will be essentially flat from  this quarter through the second quarter of next year and will then decline for the subsequent six  quarters By the first quarter of the year 2000, the level of corporate earnings will be below  where it is today I think that if the standard view in the stock analyst community were that the  level of corporate earnings early in the next millennium would be below today's level, we would  have a more severe correction than the staff is talking about    11/12/97 52  The notion that any policy action would be viewed as preemptive is true only from the  perspective of the national statistics, such as the consumer price index, but not from the  standpoint of Main Street Wall Street might think so; I do not think Main Street would I  believe that when people on Main Street look at asset prices, not just equities but assets in local  communities such as those they are seeing in the housing market and the farmland market, the  anecdotal reports would not say that a policy action would be viewed as preemptive Their  reaction would be that it was warranted in current economic circumstances  This expansion will ultimately come to an end when the speculative  excesses and imbalances have built to a point where we have no choice but to take strong action  to deal with them and put the economy into a recession The speech I would not want to have to  write is one saying we never saw it coming and when we finally recognized it, we had to take  much stronger actions and cause a recession Apparently, I am not as convinced as others that  the problems to which we ultimately will have to react will be in consumer prices or even in  wages or other measures of labor costs The problem may not be in output markets but in asset  markets as suggested by historical episodes in this country, notably in the 1920s, and in Japan in  the late 1980s In those episodes, inflation was never apparent in consumer prices or wholesale  prices, and the policy reactions were too late I think we have to think more broadly about where  we see the signs of the excesses that we need to deal with "
6047,1997-12-16," Thank you Last week we held a joint meeting of our three boards of  directors I had asked our directors to come to the meeting to convey their own views and those  of other companies or organizations with which they confer I asked them in particular to  compare how 1997 was now finishing in relation to their expectations a year ago and then to  characterize their outlook for 1998 The word I wrote down afterwards in summarizing all of  this was one that Governors Phillips and Ferguson already have used this morning,  ""dichotomy"" It was quite obvious that the economic evaluations were similar to the story of the  blind man and the elephant in that the economy looks and feels differently to different people  Clearly, for firms in some sectors, such as metals and energy and those that compete with  imports or are engaged in exports, the year 1997 was disappointing and the prospects for 1998  are not as good as previously anticipated In other areas, retailers and especially importers say  that business conditions are terrific and can only get better One director reported that a real    12/16/97 56  estate developer who operates in Ohio and Kentucky said that his industry was starting to  experience the super boom of the century  My concerns are more along the lines of what Cathy Minehan and Gary Stern  indicated earlier about where some of the risks lie A realtor said that activity cannot increase in  1998 because his firm barely could handle all the work that was available in 1997 and it has no  capacity to handle more transactions Construction, at least in our region, cannot grow very  much simply because there are no additional workers to be found A union director said that  employment in every segment of construction could increase if workers were available, but he  does not expect to be able to find them and he anticipates that employment will be close to the  current level a year from now He said that even though union contracts are going to increase  worker compensation only about 4 percent in 1998, nonunion compensation is rising much more  rapidly He indicated that the unions are trying to recruit and retain members by offering them  more training and a focus on lifetime considerations because they cannot keep up with the  competition for workers on the basis of compensation alone A new problem for the unions is  how to stop subcontractors on a site from pirating employees from other subcontractors The  unions could provide some discipline if the subcontractors were both union employers, but  otherwise there really was no discipline left on projects Most directors said that they and other  people they talk to were concerned about the cost of attracting additional workers One director  commented that to keep employees under current conditions, an employer did not give them a  raise within the current pay grade but jumped them two grade levels Another argued that it was  impossible to discipline workers because of the hot job market If an employer tried to tell a  worker that there were policies about showing up on time or the length of the lunch hour, the    12/16/97 57  worker simply left and went someplace else There is no accountability The paradox for our  region of the country is that employment growth is so slow We probably will report  employment growth of about 06 percent this year in Ohio The increase is so low because  people are going elsewhere or there is not enough labor force growth  On the national and international situation, I remember a meeting with my directors  about six months ago and hearing them talk about how great the US economy was I said, yes,  but the paradox is that the rest of the world is a mess We spent quite a bit of time talking about  the rest of the world Oddly enough, the foreign economies have gotten worse and are likely to  get worse yet So, again the word ""dichotomy"" seems to fit the international context The US  economy is doing very well while much of the rest of the world is very troubled This is not the  first time that that has happened; we have been in that situation before  While we all recognize the problems that exporting and some import-competing firms  are having, people generally are optimistic about the next year or two Americans are getting  richer This is a period of prosperity Last week in preparing for the directors' meeting, I looked  at the Blue Chip forecast that had just come out for December It had some special questions  because of the Far East Consistently, every participant in the forecast revised down their  forecast of real growth and inflation because of what was happening in Southeast Asia How is it  possible that we are worse off in the sense of anticipating slower growth and simultaneously  better off with low inflation, higher real incomes, and wealth rising at a faster rate? Everybody  agrees that net capital inflows are going to be even larger than they were before That word  ""dichotomy"" has to be applied to asset prices as well as to goods prices Some Board members  referred earlier to the dichotomy between the prices of services and the prices of goods That    12/16/97 58  clearly is the case, but the notion of dichotomy also has to be applied in the case of asset prices  because we would not say that we have had deflation if we think in terms of what has happened  in the stock market in the last three years  When I get that question about deflation, I usually remind the audience that in the  early 1990s we had a lot of people, including some reputable economists, writing about asset  deflation because of what they saw happening in commercial real estate They were not  referring to deflation at all; they were simply talking about the prices of certain types of  manufactured goods that were falling, as was the case in the 1920s I was reading some material  about the operations of the FOMC in the early 1930s This involved a discussion of the concern  about the international situation in Britain, Germany, and Japan As we know, some countries  turned to militarism because they experienced a depression while we enjoyed a boom in the  1920s I decided to go back and look at A Monetary History of the United States, written by  Friedman and Schwartz They say at one point that US monetary policy was too restrictive for  goods prices and too expansionary for asset prices That observation may strike some as  somewhat curious I think that it's a useful reminder of what can go wrong if we are too narrow  in thinking about words like ""inflation"" or ""deflation"" When people use the term ""deflation""  today to refer to the price changes of certain types of manufactured goods caused by foreign  competition, innovations, product enhancements, productivity gains, or some combination of  those factors, that does raise some questions What do they mean by the word ""inflation?""  Clearly, it cannot refer simply to the current prices of goods, whether domestically produced or  imported We have to think in terms of the present price of future consumption    12/16/97  Three years ago, Mexican officials said that their monetary policies were not  inflationary as conventionally measured in terms of peso goods prices or peso wages in 1994  That was too narrow a way to think about it One would not have found warning signs of the  problems in Southeast Asia by looking at prices of goods available in the marketplace in these  Southeast Asian economies or wages paid in domestic currencies That is not where the problem  was manifested any more than it was where one would have found the problem in the 1920s in  the United States, when the wholesale price index fell and the CPI rose at a 1 percent rate, or in  Japan in the 1980s, when wholesale prices fell and the CPI did not increase at all But that did  not mean that they did not have a problem  After our action to increase the funds rate last March, we had a debate  at the May meeting concerning the desirability of a further increase--whether we should drop the  other shoe In an environment of decelerating real growth as evidenced by an assortment of  measures, related expectations of a fairly soft second quarter, and slowing money growth, we  decided against raising the funds rate another notch That decision was partly conditioned on an  expectation that growth in employment, real output, and other measures was going to be a lot  slower in the second half of the year in the context of fairly benign money growth That did not  happen in the third quarter, but at the September meeting we were still looking for much  slower money and economic growth in the fourth quarter So, we decided not to tighten policy  then either My guess is that if we had been focusing on nominal spending growth last May or    12/16/97 82  any of the other measures of demand people want to focus on, such as real output growth,  employment growth, the unemployment rate, or various measures indicating capacity pressures  in the economy, we probably would have raised rates at that time and we probably would be glad  today that we did We would not have financed so much demand over the past six months that  induced a lot more imports and enabled the Asians to get themselves into a deeper hole  However, of the various reasons for not acting now, I think the Far East crisis is among the better  reasons "
6073,1998-02-03," I do want to dissent on that  Thank you  Mike, I want to ask a question related to your confidence in the  consistency of the financial and the real forecasts I would like to get Peter's reaction  from the market's standpoint and from the Desk's as well Looking at Chart 1, Chart 2,  and the Greenbook numbers, let us imagine that six months from now, maybe at the  FOMC meeting in August, these projections have been borne out by the data reported for  the first two quarters In that event, we would be looking at real GDP growth of 1 percent  for the second quarter and an average rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, of 11  percent for the first half Bond yields would be about the same or higher than they are  today  Okay  The question was really about confidence in the consistency of  the two sets of data, the national income and product account numbers and the financial  When I look at the Blue Chip forecast, for instance, it is not clear to me to what extent  such a forecast is already built into the current market If this Greenbook projection is  already close to being built into current markets, that is one thing--  How much of an error in the Greenbook projections for the next  two quarters, the current quarter and spring quarter, would be required before we had a  significant backup in market interest rates? To what extent does the market in this sense    2/3-4/98  need to see something close to this kind of projection to hold these levels versus a  surprise in the other direction?  I was asking the question because headline reports about the  Asian situation give one the impression that these economies are even bigger than  California's economy, let alone Canada's, which, of course, is not true All of them taken  together are not that large in terms of their aggregate GDP, total trade, or shares of our  trade Yet, one gets the impression from the press reports that a very, very big downdraft  effect is about to hit us If such an effect is built into the marketplace, we could get a  significant backup in rates when the markets find out that it is not true  Let me ask a somewhat related question since you mentioned possible reactions to  signs of rising inflation, should they emerge In one of the panels on Chart 8, Mike, you  illustrated the strength of the housing markets by showing multifamily and single-family  housing starts, but you did not show house prices Do you have any implicit or explicit  forecast of what you think is going to happen to residential house prices?  Thank you The strength in virtually all sectors of the Fourth  District economy in 1997 was sustained through year-end and appears to have carried  over into at least the early weeks of the new year The most common complaint we  continue to hear has to do with recruiting and retaining people Turnover of workers  continues to rise, and reports of higher compensation to keep people are much more  frequent, along the lines of several other comments that already have been made here this  afternoon The financial sector is finding it especially difficult to attract and retain  people One bank that is now represented on our board of directors put through a 77  percent pay structure increase, and the bank does not believe that increase is going to be  adequate to retain the people they need for their operations Job switching for  significantly higher salaries is becoming more common for people with computer skills  All parts of construction--residential, commercial, and industrial--were strong in  the fourth quarter, and prospects for the spring and summer are reported to be very good    2/3-4/98  Construction contracts increased significantly in 1997, and so far we have had a very mild  winter in our part of the country so that construction activity has been seasonally strong  Bankers report a growing sense that retail space is overbuilt Nevertheless, new proposals  keep coming in ever-increasing numbers and they are getting financed One director said  that REITs have a ton of money He indicated that there is ample funding for just about  any project that gets proposed  Manufacturing generally continues to be strong in our area The production of  large trucks reached peak levels in the fourth quarter, and orders are reported to be strong,  suggesting that plants producing trucks will be operating at very high levels through the  first half of this year Steel orders and production also continue to be very high Even  though imports are expected to rise, domestic absorption also continues to increase so  domestic production and orders haven't yet weakened from very high levels One  director said that foreign steel would arrive just in time to meet his company's needs  Another asserted that the cutbacks and consolidations had ended in the health care sector  and that we should expect faster increases in health care costs going forward In fact, one  director commented that on the basis of what he is observing, health care costs are  starting to soar in western Pennsylvania of a small manufacturing  company said that there seemed to be a lot of people who were trying to put their money  to work because she was receiving 4 to 5 offers to buy her company every week  Help-wanted advertisements that a year or two ago would have produced a lot of resumes  now produce very few, and the only ones from qualified people are from individuals who  already have jobs and are looking for big wage increases Commenting on very strong  worldwide demand for machinery to make plastic goods, one director said that there is an    2/3-4/98  inordinate amount of capital available for acquisitions in that industry and that we should  expect a lot of consolidation, both domestic and international  Turning to the Greenbook forecast of the national economy, it is a good news, bad  news story The good news is that I really like this Greenbook forecast for 1998 The  bad news is that I simply do not believe it [Laughter] I have tried hard since last  Thursday night to convince myself that we got this lucky in terms of the economy's  performance and prospects because the crony capitalism and corruption in Southeast Asia  has taken us out of the very difficult policy spot that we had gotten into Nominal  spending growth accelerated in the second half of last year to a pace well above what the  forecasts were showing just 6 months ago, not just the Greenbook forecast but  everybody's forecast Nominal spending growth accelerated, real growth accelerated, and  money growth accelerated Every measure of money came in well above what had been  expected, creating what looked to me like a tough spot to work out of Then we got the  Southeast Asian crisis that supposedly solves the problem for us  When I look at components of the GDP forecast such as personal income,  however, I see a strongly rising trend of nominal personal income growth through 1997  with all the favorable factors that contributed to it, and I then note that the forecast  suddenly cuts the rate of growth by half to about the 1990-1991 recession pace I do not  believe that forecast I think it is plausible to anticipate that real growth will decelerate,  and the reason is simply that there is nothing in the universe for which the second  difference is always positive The second difference of everything must turn negative If  the second differences of real growth and employment slow because we have  supply-constrained economies, then we simply have to hope that growth in final demand    2/3-4/98  will slow simultaneously I do not find it plausible to anticipate that the amount of  slowing that is necessary in final demand is going to come from weaker exports In fact,  some companies in our area that view themselves as global companies now say that the  Southeast Asian situation is an opportunity for them to export high-tech products that  they want for their own foreign operations The risk is that the reported slower growth of  output and employment will materialize but not the slower growth in final demand If so,  we are going to find ourselves at some point with substantially much more upward  pressure on inflation than is now forecast or showing through the numbers, and we will  be scrambling to catch up Thank you  I cannot tell the difference between any of these alternatives  either in the way the Committee operates or in the way we communicate with the public  I believe we should start to articulate a view as to what monetary policy is all about quite  aside from the prices of goods and other assets denominated in units of money Our  objective has never been to stabilize or target or control any of those things but rather to  focus on the prices of items that people buy that are denominated in units of money We  have used various monetary aggregates as a benchmark of whether policy was roughly in  the acceptable zone, or a constellation of financial variables that gave us some sense of  that I think that once we approach something that most people would consider to be  close to price stability, an expression I do not like at all, these ranges do not serve us well  To the extent that it provides any guidance in communicating with the public, I  think M2 is the only aggregate that is at all useful and I would not change its range I  would leave it at 1 to 5 percent, but I don't think that is going far enough We do not  want to stabilize prices We want all prices to be changing all over the lot all the time,  especially prices of certain things that should be going down, like computers Prices of  other things, like tickets to Cleveland Indians baseball games, we know are always going  to go up We want people to conduct their daily household and business affairs in the  expectation that, roughly weighted in their minds, the prices of things that are going up  are matched by the prices of things that are going down and the purchasing power of  money is stable I do not see that M3 or debt is at all useful in communicating that  objective M2 gets the closest to it but it is not satisfactory The one change I would  make for 1998 versus 1997 is that we not only announce a range but that we mean it    2/3-4/98  I would like to follow up for just a moment because there are two  things along that line that we do know as economists, even if we are not able to    2/3-4/98  communicate that knowledge effectively to the Congress, let alone to the public at large  Our theories tell us that if we have a world in which the purchasing power of money is  stable, then all changes in nominal interest rates are simultaneously changes in real  interest rates We have a fully anticipated world Second, when there are changes in the  prices of things that people buy and sell, goods as well as assets and various services,  those changes in prices denominated in units of money are relative price changes If the  price of something goes up by 10 percent and people think of that as being partly a  change in the purchasing power of money and partly a change in relative prices, we are  not there If they can take the percentage change in the price of something as being  totally a relative price change, we have achieved a condition of stable purchasing power  of money That means that price increases are matched by price declines of such items as  computers and digital watches Stability in the purchasing power of money is ultimately  the benchmark by which our policy is going to be judged If people conduct their affairs  in the belief that the purchasing power of money, real income, and wealth change as  prices change, then we have not fulfilled our objective  Don, you noted a few times in your remarks that from the  standpoint of one financial indicator, the level of real short-term interest rates, the current  stance of monetary policy may be interpreted as being restrictive The measure you  mentioned is the overnight interbank rate minus some index of prices--the CPI or some  index like that You then referred to a wide array of other financial indicators that do not  suggest a restrictive monetary policy at all These include not just the ample availability  of credit from the banking industry but from the financial services industry more broadly,    2/3-4/98  the relatively rapid growth of various measures of money, and the ongoing strength in  various asset markets How much confidence can we have in the overnight interbank rate  minus the CPI as a gauge of the thrust of monetary policy in the face of all these other  variables that are pointing in the opposite direction?  With the obvious advantage of some hindsight, I now think the  thrust of monetary policy in 1997 was more expansionary than I thought at the time, and  it became progressively more expansionary as we went through the year There is an  irony in the way we now look at the numbers and also in how we communicate them A  favorable productivity shock or surprise has meant that the real rate of return on capital  was higher ex post than we had anticipated ex ante and that relative or nominal interest  rates, especially the overnight interbank rate, turned out to be lower ex post than we had  expected ex ante This manifests itself in what we see happening in the financial  industry, the banking industry, and in various measures of money and credit growth The  irony is that the way a favorable productivity shock is reported implies not only that real  incomes are higher than they would otherwise have been, which is certainly a desirable  outcome, but it also is manifested in the form of a lower level of measured price inflation  than would otherwise have occurred Therefore, the change over a short interval in    2/3-4/98  indices like the consumer price index makes it appear that we have higher real interest  rates, for a given level of nominal rates, when in fact our theory tells us it was the  opposite We had lower real interest rates  There is no question about the direction of the effects of the Asian influence In  the statistics, exports will be lower than they otherwise would have been, but I am not  sure what that level would have been Imports will be greater than they otherwise would  have been In an arithmetic sense, those two developments tell us on the basis of partial  analysis that GDP is going to be smaller than it otherwise would have been But that is  not a full general equilibrium effect Lower prices of both imported goods and domestic  goods that compete with imports mean that incomes are higher than they otherwise would  have been I now think that we would have been looking at even stronger nominal  demand growth coming into this year, fueled by rapid money growth We may benefit by  some amount--I'm uncertain about the amount--of less strong demand than we would  have experienced in the absence of the Asian developments, but I am not at all convinced  that demand is actually going to decline or that the rate of economic growth is going to be  slower than is reflected in the Greenbook  So, I think the odds are strongly in the direction that our next move will be to raise  the funds rate to slow the growth of money and credit We are going to see a substantial  acceleration of prices even if it is somewhat delayed "
6099,1998-03-31," Peter, you made what was almost a passing reference to the fact that  intermediate-term Treasuries had traded through the funds rate this year, and you indicated that  many saw that development as reflecting expectations of some easing in the funds rate But the  alternative explanation is that trading through the funds rate is consistent with an expectation that  the funds rate will be increased We had at least a brief discussion of that on the call over the last  week or so With regard to our credibility as a central bank, one of your people commented that  if in a gold standard type world there was growing credibility that the central bank was going to    3/31/98  take the appropriate policy actions to maintain price stability, one would expect intermediate-  term issues to trade through the overnight interbank rate Do you want to elaborate?  I'm asking about Street talk or views on this issue  I was thinking more in terms of the 5- to 10-year range If people  anticipated a transitory acceleration of inflation that we would respond to, we would expect the  yield curve to be downward sloping in that longer-term range  Mr Chairman, we have done a little work along the same lines Our  staff has what we call the median CPI or the trimmed mean The effects are on the order of  magnitude that you suggest, Mike, from what I recall our people were saying They are  continuing work to evaluate those indirect effects  Mike, you correctly anticipated a question that I had, but in at least  one respect your presentation added to a puzzle that I had when I read the Greenbook and some  of the other materials You have personal income growth picking up to a 67 percent rate in the  first quarter from a relatively robust pace last year and in fact from an upward trend over the last  five years Employment growth has been very strong along with hours worked There is strong  demand for output, strong demand for workers, and spending has been very robust The stock  market is booming The real estate sector also is booming, including existing and new home  sales, housing starts, and housing permits, and business fixed investment remains on a sharp  uptrend Then I read the first sentence of the draft directive that says ""the information reviewed  at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity may have slowed somewhat""    3/31/98  Let us suppose it is true that real GDP growth in the first quarter, as  you have added it up, is a smaller number than that for the fourth quarter In the face of all these  other indications of strength, do we really want to characterize the economy in the first quarter as  a weakening in economic activity even though the real GDP growth number may be  arithmetically smaller for the reasons that you indicated?  Let me take you to the productivity issue then Nothing that any of us  hears anecdotally when we talk to people or other evidence that we can look at would support    3/31/98  your first-quarter productivity estimate I understand how it is derived and why you wind up  with this negative productivity number, shocking as it is It is a residual  Somehow statistically arrived at! When I was talking to Don Kohn  last week, he told me that the decline did not happen and that productivity probably rose by, say,  2 percent Starting with that presumption, what else has to change in your forecast if you are  forced to put in a positive productivity number for the first quarter? Also, what is the net going  to look like?  So you would be raising not just the real output number but the  nominal GDP?  When you try to reconcile the data and make them consistent on the  income side, is your negative productivity number tied in with the decline in corporate profits  that you're showing?  You can imagine what it's like when we are out around our Districts  talking to people and we tell them that productivity is going down, profits are really bad, but  employers are hiring workers in large numbers because they are earning income and spending a  lot of money Something just goes ""clunk"" in that logic; it simply does not sound quite right  Thank you When I left the meeting in early February, we were  waiting for the East Asian effects to get here, and as I tried to analyze their likely impact I felt  like someone who was trying to anticipate what would be the effects of an asteroid or a comet  that supposedly was going to show up one of these days A couple of weeks after our meeting,  there was in fact a report about an asteroid that might reach the earth in about 30 years  [Laughter] Upon further analysis that report was very quickly dismissed Almost 25 years ago,  we were all treated to reports of the coming of the comet Kohoutek Comet Kohoutek was going  to do wondrous things It was going to be the brightest celestial object of the century, and there  was speculation that it might change the earth's rotation and weather patterns Of course, it was  a complete fizzle and no one will remember it As I thought about such phenomena, it occurred  to me that asteroids and comets are less predictable than eclipses But even eclipses, though    3/31/98  predictable, are often very hard to observe because there is so much other activity in the  atmosphere that even a trained scientist may need powerful instruments to observe one  I then thought about El Nino, which has been wonderful for my part of the country this  winter The lesson there is that even when phenomena are accurately forecasted and exceed  anticipations, the effects are sometimes hard to analyze If one analyzed El Nino's effect on the  basis of expensive California homes falling into the ocean, one would have a different picture  than if one lived around Lake Erie and saw what a wonderful winter we had in our part of the  country The schools did not close The people who drive salt trucks complained about the lack  of overtime, but other than that the experience was relatively positive If we put such disparate  observations into a full general equilibrium context, it really is very hard to sort them out It may  be that companies that compete with Asian imports or that lose export sales in Asian markets  will continue to get hurt Even so, I still think that the economy is much more likely, as Mike  Prell remarked, to be stronger on the upside than weaker on the downside of the Greenbook  forecast  I also continue to be concerned that we may never see the effects of monetary excesses  in output prices, but rather that we will see them in asset prices At our business advisory  council meeting about two weeks ago, one of my relatively new members came into the meeting  and indicated that he now understood the role of the Federal Reserve It was to keep people like  himself from doing foolish things I asked him to explain He runs a  manufacturing company He said he was driving one day and saw a big sign indicating that the  land he was passing was zoned for commercial real estate development and was for sale He  stopped and considered whether he ought to purchase that land in order to diversify his business  activities On further reflection he realized that he didn't know anything about commercial real    3/31/98  estate development and that this really was a dumb idea So, he came to our meeting to persuade  me to help keep him from doing something that would be really foolish We are hearing more  such stories, and I would be interested in knowing whether some of you have heard them as well  We asked our advisory council members and our directors how the first quarter felt  compared to the first quarter of last year and compared to all of 1997 In general, the  run-through simply reflected what the Greenbook is reporting probably happened Results were  not only strong but stronger than anticipated; indeed, they far exceeded expectations People  said they came into this year with a cautious view of the economic outlook, but they now are  revising up their expectations about what is going to happen  The anecdotal reports on labor markets still lead me to believe that the reported  compensation numbers are not capturing what is going on First, I don't think the turnover of  workers is being analyzed correctly In addition, there is occurring what I now think of as the  ""dumbing down"" of the labor force More and more employers are telling us that because of the  introduction of smarter technology and the way they are organizing their operations, they now  are willing to hire at a given wage people who have lesser skills than previously That does not  get captured in any of the compensation numbers that we receive  To cite other signs of labor market tightness, in the several counties around Dayton,  Ohio, in what is called the Miami Valley, there are currently 550,000 employees The university  there did a survey of job openings that added up to over 50,000 That total is 10 percent of  current employment in the area I asked our business contacts there how they were going to deal  with this labor scarcity problem They indicated that they are counting on migration from other  parts of the country They also reported for the first time such developments as workers balking  at voluntary overtime Retail companies are telling us that they are going to mandatory overtime    3/31/98  because their workers are not signing up What the workers are signing up for, faster than ever  before, is their vacation schedules  We are hearing more and more reports about real estate transactions that I think are  very questionable As probably everyone else is hearing, our banker contacts claim that it is the  other lenders that are engaging in such dubious real estate financing All of their own  transactions are very soundly based on appropriate valuations Home prices are rising very  rapidly in our area People are paying up for commercial space We are getting anecdotal  reports, scattered here and there around the District including the metropolitan areas, about rising  rental rates for retail space and other commercial space  In another report that I found interesting, directors said that the fastest rising wages  that they see are teacher salaries State, local government, and school district tax receipts are  coming in very strong and they are being spent on worker compensation We hear bankers, in  particular, who say that when they lose lower level workers in their organizations, they typically  lose them to schools or to city governments One of the large banks that operates in most of the  states in our region said that they came into the period expecting good commercial loan demand,  and it has been very strong What has surprised them, though, was that consumer loan demand,  which had previously tended to weaken, has rebounded very sharply They also asserted that  credit quality standards definitely have been lowered as a result of what they said is shoddy  underwriting by syndicators Finally, as an illustration of labor market flexibility, we saw a  report that United Parcel Service would be expanding greatly its operations in Louisville, in Bill  Poole's District A bank that has a significant credit card operation in Louisville said that was  not a problem for them; they were going to shut that operation down and move to some other    3/31/98  place where there was a bigger pool of labor They were not going to compete with UPS for  workers  Thank you Referring back to something I said earlier about the  opening sentence in the general paragraphs of the directive, I think we do need to make a change  there  Okay  I agree with Ed Boehne about what to include in our public comments  concerning the reasons for our policy actions I still think that our actions in early 1994, properly  viewed, prevented the recession of 1996 What we are faced with today is how to prevent the  next credit crunch and recession of the year 2000 We will have enough other problems in the  year 2000 without having to deal with a recession and a real estate debacle I thought that your  remarks, Mr Chairman, developed a persuasive case for acting now I am not particularly  concerned about the stock market I agree that it is not a reason to do something, but in my view    3/31/98  it also is not a reason not to do something I believe that reasons for taking action would be the  excessive growth of the whole constellation of money and credit aggregates, the upward revision  of expectations about the growth of economic activity, and what is going on in the banking  industry and especially in the real estate markets A 1/4 percentage point increase in the federal  funds rate now would deliver a very important message We are going to get some first-quarter  numbers that will make it obvious to everybody why we acted I am concerned that on the basis  of the published information, the case on the surface for a move may not be as compelling by the  middle of May as it is today, so I would strongly prefer taking action today "
6125,1998-05-19," Mike, I want to comment on your response to a question by Mike  Moskow I am trying to reconcile it with my own view of the process, which right now I am not    5/19/98  able to do You talked about the extraordinary domestic demand and about the increases in  compensation we are seeing Year over year since 1993, we have seen a steady upward trend in the  rate of personal income growth Last year it was 6 percent for the full year In the first quarter of  this year, it was 66 percent according to the Greenbook, and next week we will get a number for  April The Greenbook forecast indicates that after the steady upward trend of the 1990s to a rate of  over 6 percent in personal income growth, the rate drops to 3 percent in the current quarter that we  are halfway through What we hear from companies and from employers of all types is that they  are hiring people, giving them bigger and bigger compensation increases, promoting them, and in  short doing everything they can to retain them on their payrolls And yet, personal income growth  suddenly drops to 3 percent in your second-quarter forecast Now, other than needing that to  happen on the income side to add up to what is supposed to happen on the product side, are there  other stories we can tell as to why income growth suddenly decelerates sharply?  Yes  Total personal income  But personal income is for people who are working and getting paid  The number of people working is going to go up another 600,000 this quarter according to the  Greenbook projection, and everything we hear indicates that what will be going into their pay  envelopes will be bigger than before Every employer we talk to complains about how much more  they have to stuff in those envelopes one way or another So, why would personal income growth    5/19/98  slow down? I am getting more and more accustomed to the idea, at least when I talk to people, that  the growth in personal incomes has nothing to do with monetary and fiscal policy  It always drops from the first quarter to the second quarter, which  says something about the seasonal adjustment But as the quarterly personal income numbers run  out through the end of 1999, they maintain a nice steady 4 percent rate of growth  Some of the anecdotal comments we are hearing can be put into a  framework that people are familiar with, one that indicates a purely transitory decline in the  NAIRU along the lines of what I think of as the inverse of the money illusion From a money    5/19/98  framework, the reason we have lags in the system is the existence of a money illusion People  think that they are richer for a while, but we get an adjustment ultimately when people realize that  more money does not buy more The inverse of that in a NAIRU framework is that people do not  realize that they are a lot more productive and that they are worth more to their employer The  value of the marginal product of labor goes up and labor is not being compensated according to that  value, but at some point it is payback time It is catch-up time More and more, there are stories  from both employers and from the labor side that the reason corporate earnings have been so good  is that workers increasingly have been underpaid in terms of the value of their marginal product,  and now workers feel it is their turn I hear those kinds of stories everywhere what employers are  doing to promote people, what they are doing to recruit people I have trouble with the notion that  personal income growth is nonetheless going to decelerate and grow at a nice steady 4 percent rate  for the next 6 or 7 quarters That just does not compute with what I am hearing  How important is next week's number on personal income for April?  I look at this and say that if the two sides of the accounts are going to add up, we better get a sharp  slowing in the growth of personal income for the second quarter  Thank you In addition to our usual discussions with directors and  advisory council members, we also did a series of what I think of as listening sessions in smaller  cities around the District Their general tone was captured well by one banker in one small city  who said that people have more money than sense  said  that every day people ask him to find them a deal so they can put their money to work But for  balance, who says that everybody already has as much money as they  need so that the bank cannot find any more borrowers because there are too many lenders He  constantly argues that we should lower interest rates so the business firms will be more willing to  borrow and produce more to catch up with demand; otherwise, we are going to have inflation  [Laughter] This leads me to be concerned about how directors are selected [Laughter]  A theme among other bankers around the District is that lending is being driven by  asset assessments and not at all by cash flows or concerns about future cash flows Bankers  complain a lot that pension funds and insurance companies are doing deals that no sensible banker  would be willing to consider They indicate that income properties such as hotels, motels, strip  mall outlets, all kinds of outlet stores, restaurants, and auto parts stores are having problems The  turnover in such existing income properties is occurring at prices that these bankers see as  questionable In Zanesville, Ohio, for instance, they reported that three of the five new auto parts  stores that were built last year already were closed in the first quarter of this year I guess the  capitalist system is working in a certain sense Losses are being incurred  Another frequent complaint has been the Federal Farm Credit Banks One banker  said he lost 15 percent of his ag portfolio in the first quarter of this year alone to the Federal Farm  Credit Banks That caused another banker to say that they decided to get completely out of ag  lending because they could not compete on equal terms with the Federal Farm Credit Banks  One banker asserted that when he talks to customers about borrowing more, they are  unwilling to consider the possibility of a rise in interest rates in the future They believe that the  economy is in a permanently low interest rate environment To his frustration, when he tells them    5/19/98  that they have to allow for the possibility that interest rates could go up, they just dismiss the  thought as being unrealistic because the economy has entered a new era So, he argues that even a  very small interest rate increase would have a significant sobering effect on acquisition prices that  are being paid Another banker commented that all of his customers are bankrupt; they just will not  know it until interest rates go up  In manufacturing, directors have cited numerous examples of acquisition prices that  they think are too high For example,  equipment business said that he is seeing acquisition prices worldwide that he thinks are out of  sight In retailing, Dillard Department Stores bought Mercantile Stores on Monday of this week  When the CEO of Mercantile Stores, who is on my Cleveland board, called me over the weekend,  he simply said that he approved it  for his shareholders That was the best he could say about the transaction  We heard more reports of sharp price increases in farmlands One that I thought  would be of special interest to Don Kohn is that while we were in Wooster, Ohio, we heard that  over the course of the past year over 50 Amish families have sold raw land and moved to a  neighboring county They told us that farmlands that were going for $2,000 to $2,500 per acre a  year ago are now being sold for over $4,000 an acre  As an example of the tightness of labor markets, one banker said that whenever he  sees a customer talking to a teller for more than a minute or two, it turns out that the teller is getting  a job offer [Laughter]  With respect to construction, one director said that this spring he has seen more  announcements of new projects of every type than he has ever seen in the region before This  director is an official of a building and construction labor union The surge in new projects may be    5/19/98  reflective of the mild winter and early spring In any event he sees announcements of new projects  involving water, sewer, transportation and auto plants, hospitals, schools, road construction, and  hotels all over the District In Newark, Ohio, three new hotel projects have been announced by  major chains, financed by institutional investors So, we will have plenty of hotels in Newark  As others have noted, there are numerous reports of health care cost increases The  most extreme that I have heard involves Pennsylvania Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which is  requesting a 30 percent increase this year  Turning to the national situation, over 25 years ago Leonid Brezhnev said that the  fundamental problem we faced was that we can only distribute and consume what we actually  produce, and he felt that a capitalist plot was involved But we do face that problem How much  demand is out there, what is fostering all of this demand, and what is the probability that we are  going to have adequate aggregate supply to keep up with all of it? A year ago, I was hearing  reports of good economic conditions, but also about the need to be cautious about taking risks  Now I only hear reports about good economic conditions People's expectations about returns that  are available to them on a variety of investments clearly have risen very sharply, whether it is direct  or indirect, in the equity markets, in residential and commercial income properties, and in various  types of new business ventures So, in a relative sense, they view the costs of borrowing funds for  investing as having gone down compared to what they can get on more secure long-term financial  instruments like Treasuries I thought that Al Broaddus' initial analysis on this point was correct  We have all become accustomed to repeating the Chairman's way of phrasing the  objective of our policy and its success as being inflation that is so low that people do not even think  about it In that sense, we have been meeting that criterion in terms of output prices But a  corollary also has to be that we do not see people making decisions based on the assumption that    5/19/98  asset prices will rise forever relative to output prices In that sense, we are not meeting the  criterion, and we are not being successful We all know that asset prices cannot rise forever  relative to output prices or income streams So, the good news is that this too will end The  question is how and when Over the last two years through the first four months of this year, I have  seen that not only is demand for output from households and businesses very strong, but it also is  continuing to accelerate I believe such demand is being fostered by excessive growth of money  and bank credit and we see a lot of evidence that supports that argument We need to see that  growth in demand slow down It is not a question to me of no change or a small change in the  stance of current monetary policy in terms of the interbank overnight rate It is a question of a  small change now or a much bigger change later on  Thank you I agree that asset markets like the stock market should  not be an objective of policy, but I also do not think they should be a constraint on doing what we  otherwise think is the right thing I never saw the need for signaling or the desirability of trying to  condition the markets to anything we do  As far as Asia goes, I don't think the Japan problem is going to go away any time  soon I believe they are in far worse condition than is generally understood, and six months from  now or maybe even a year from now we will see that Japan is an even more severe problem So, if  we are going to have that as a constraint, it is going to be around for awhile  Demand is extremely strong and we are meeting a lot of that demand by increasing  our imports Even if the Greenbook is right, two years from now we will have a trade deficit of  over $300 billion, over 3 percent of GDP, and in the wrong hands that is a dangerous statistic I  think that playing locomotive to the rest of the world is the wrong way to conduct monetary policy  So, I believe we need to do something now or we will find that the toothpaste is already out of the  tube and it is going to be costly to try and squeeze it back in again "
6151,1998-06-30," Thank you I want to ask a general question about the way we think  about Japan This may build on Governor Meyer's question A number of the Committee  members recently have been in Japan, and I would be interested in their views about the problem  and potential solutions, as well as staff comments  We sometimes read commentaries about Japan that, it seems to me, are based on a  premise that it has an economy that tends to stagnate or decline in the absence of some type of  monetary or fiscal stimulus or pump priming to get it going These commentators do not seem to  believe as I do that the nature of a market economy is to display an inherent resiliency and a  tendency to expand in the absence of negative impulses When I try to figure out what is  preventing expansion in an economy like that, I look for headwinds problems like our own in the  early part of this decade    6/30-7/1/98  One way to think about Japan in my view is that over the course of the 1990s the  Japanese have been learning that Japan is not immune to the law of one price any more than  other countries Sometimes analysts, especially academic types, tend to think of exchange rates  mainly in terms of a fairly narrow set of tradable goods It is almost as if the relative cost of  producing a car in Yokohama versus Lexington, Kentucky will determine the exchange rate  Obviously, that simply is not the case in global capital markets Asset markets have as much  impact on exchange rates as manufactured goods, and that includes commercial and residential  real estate as well as other asset markets  Ten years ago if we had held aside the narrow set of exportable manufacturing goods  of Japan and focused on everything else--commercial and residential real estate, equity prices, a  whole host of things about Japan--translated through a filter of the prevailing exchange rate and  we had learned we would have predicted one of two things deflation or  devaluation We would have anticipated that either the exchange value of the yen would decline  dramatically or the price level in terms of the yen would decline dramatically We could have sat  back and waited for something to happen Yet, we have gone through a long period of time with  the idea that the yen was somehow undervalued and needed to go up It seems to me that is like  saying that in the late 1920s the British were right in repegging the pound at the pre-World War I  price of gold All they had to do was to let prices denominated in pounds fall, including the  prices of real estate, hamburgers, and everything else sold in the UK economy  For people who have traveled to Japan and looked at the situation there more closely  than I have, how close or how far is Japan to having adjusted to the rest of the world in terms of  the yen prices of residential and commercial real estate, a cup of coffee, and everything else so  that normal economic policies may work?    6/30-7/1/98  You have to build in deflation in Japan in order to get the internal  economy and external economy back in balance    6/30-7/1/98  To follow up with a comment on Governor Gramlich's question  about Japan Just looking at these charts, I assume that if you have their real exports flat and real  imports declining, then you have built in a very substantial decline in real domestic consumption  in Japan    6/30-7/1/98  That is part of it, insofar as deflation rather than depreciation of the  currency is the solution One of those two things has to happen If the second solution reflects a  correct interpretation of the environment, does any amount of monetary or fiscal pump priming  do any good?  Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me start with a puzzle I am left with  after listening to some of the comments that have just been made about inventories, oil, and the  connection between oil inventories and imports I may be missing something If the increase in  inventories is basically composed of imports, whether they are oil or something else, those  inventories could not have contributed to GDP in the first quarter because as imports they were  recorded as a negative By the same reasoning, the projected decline in inventories in the current  quarter should not have a negative effect That strikes me as something important that we need  to understand a little better I remember some huge previous discrepancies in the international  trade accounts when there were statistical discrepancies worldwide on imports and exports It  turned out that exports from some countries were counted as exports but were not yet recorded as  imports someplace else because they were in tankers held up in the Cayman Islands or  elsewhere So, we would have to wait a while to figure it out I think that is an issue that would  bear unraveling before we draw any firm conclusions about how either the trade account or  inventories will affect GDP in the second quarter and the rest of the year  I have a comment on the auto situation About 21,000 of the GM-affected workers are  in Ohio We have very large auto and auto-related production facilities in our area, so the strike  will have a negative impact on manufacturing activity in our region as long as it continues  Turning to some regional anecdotal reports since the last meeting, bankers continue to  tell us that commercial loan demand is very strong, exceeding their loan budgets for 1998 as  estimated at the start of the year Consumer loan demand is reported to have weakened recently    6/30-7/1/98  compared to earlier in the year, but bankers say that their consumer loan extensions are still well  ahead of their plans as set out at the beginning of the year With respect to real estate lending,  they say that mortgage financing, which boomed late last year and early this year, has cooled  more recently But in the usual reports on their real estate portfolios, they do raise increasing  questions about the transaction prices they are seeing on income property deals As before, we  are hearing frequent complaints from bankers throughout the District that the Farm Credit Banks  are very aggressive in their pricing, doing some of the things they were doing back in the mid-  and late 1980s  Construction spending in the District is heading for another record We have had  more announcements of new public buildings, and this is a reflection of very strong local tax  receipts Those projects will carry through into next year We already are hearing that not only  will 1998 construction spending and employment in the construction sector exceed 1997, but our  contacts expect 1999 to be even stronger yet Following up on the persistent complaints of  shortages of construction workers, the building trades unions are now lobbying Congress for an  increase in immigration limits on construction workers In Cincinnati, we heard that the labor  market is so tight in southwest Ohio and north central Kentucky that people involved with the  construction industry are developing plans to bus in workers to build the two new stadium  projects that have been authorized When I asked them from where, they said that they are still  working on that [Laughter]  Reports on labor market conditions indicate larger wage structure increases than  before and more use of retention bonuses to address turnover Health care cost increases, as we  have heard before, have risen by up to 30 percent One firm in the Columbus area reported that  they advertised for two weeks for unskilled clerical and warehouse workers with starting wages    6/30-7/1/98  of $7 to $10 per hour and the advertisements yielded no applications That prompted another  businessperson to respond that in their warehouse distributorship business, they have negotiated  a work release program with the local prison and have experienced no absenteeism so far  [Laughter]  A communications company told us that they now feel compelled to  pass through steep increases in labor compensation costs to their customers because they are no  longer able to meet such costs through greater productivity and efficiency We were told that  tourism is booming everywhere, but average occupancy rates in hotels and motels in the region  are declining because new construction is adding to capacity more rapidly than the rise in  demand  Exports to Latin America and Europe are reported to be well ahead of expectations  this year Contacts report optimism about markets in both parts of the world because those  markets are not only good for US exporters, but because they provide some relief to  import-competing industries here that see potential imports from Asia going instead to those  other regions An exception has been steel We were told that European steel was now coming  into the United States because Asian steel is going to Europe Balancing that somewhat, a mine  safety appliance company said that sales in Europe were the best in years, and they are optimistic  that will continue into next year  On the national economy, the Greenbook projects a soft landing Again, I like the  Greenbook forecast; I only wish I could believe it The soft landing largely comes from the slack  created by falling export demand and the leakage of excess domestic demand into the external  markets that is reflected in the surging imports and the skyrocketing current account deficit The    6/30-7/1/98  story implied by the Greenbook is that without the Asian crisis, inflation would be a much more  serious problem already and in the future The Asian crisis also helps us indirectly by depressing  earnings of exporting and import-competing firms That fosters less exuberant equity markets,  which in turn reduces the wealth effects that presumably have supported the extraordinary  domestic final demand In a nutshell, I read the Greenbook analysis as saying that we are going  to get out of the current situation without accelerating inflation or a recession or both That will  happen because the Asia crisis came along at just the right time and in just the right magnitude  Maybe so, but I am becoming increasingly less sure that we can avoid inflationary excesses and  imbalances in some of our markets--assets markets in particular and especially real estate--that  would eventually make a recession unavoidable  Our challenge is how to keep this wonderful economy going not only for the benefit of  our own people but for that of the rest of the world I would like to see and hear in our District  more caution being exercised by both borrowers and entrepreneurs on one hand and lenders and  investors on the other side But the pattern of errors that we have seen in the last year in  forecasting money and credit growth and nominal spending growth has gone on for too long I  feel very certain that if a year ago we had looked at a forecast that accurately predicted what  actually has happened in the economy in the last four quarters, we would have been more  inclined to think that some precautionary firming was appropriate Even if the Greenbook is  right about the economy and the Bluebook is right about money growth, two years from now we  are going to be looking at a current account deficit of $400 billion, a direct reflection of  excessive domestic demand in the sense of much more rapid growth in demand than aggregate  supply We know that pattern is unsustainable and it also should be unacceptable  Thank you I think that getting other input on the paper, if a way can  be found without creating all kinds of problems for us, would be very desirable But like the  research that was done a couple of years ago on the costs and benefits of reducing inflation, I have  a difficulty with the starting point To reduce inflation from any inherited situation implies initial  conditions and policies that set in motion certain dynamics as opposed to starting from the  premise that we have stable purchasing power of money Stable purchasing power of money does  not mean that the prices of all assets or goods or services are unchanged What it means is that  the weighted-average of relevant price categories is not rising or falling  Once we start from that concept of the stable purchasing power of the currency, which  is the idea we are trying to implant into the minds of decisionmakers--households and businesses  alike--I think we come out a little differently Suppose that is our initial condition and we then    6/30-7/1/98  have a favorable productivity shock, maybe like the one we have had in the last couple of years  That means an increase in the purchasing power of money because the weighted average of prices  that are falling exceeds the weighted average of prices that are rising There is some literature on  this, the work that George Selgin and others have done about the productivity norm for inflation  A couple of economists in Britain also have done some work on that issue A central bank can  conduct a monetary policy in that environment through a monetary base arrangement of supply  and demand for central bank money It does not create problems of the type that I see in this  paper derived from the Taylor framework So, even if we consider a Taylor framework approach,  there is another or different way of approaching the same question that I do not see included in  this paper  That is why I referred to initial conditions We do not get that  liquidity trap effect where efforts to increase the monetary base only add to excess reserves  unless we start with the initial condition of inadequate aggregate demand If we start with a  favorable productivity shock and we have stable purchasing power of money, then the real rate  of return to real productive capital has actually gone up We don't have a problem then We  only have it in this inadequate excess demand framework  Thank you, Mr Chairman A year ago at this meeting, I felt 1 to 5  percent was the right M2 range for 1998, given an economy operating at most people's notion of  full employment, and I still think that A year ago, I thought that if money growth was coming in  above the 1 to 5 percent range, repeating the experience of late 1996, we should be adjusting the  level of the funds rate, and I still think that I thought a year ago that if money growth was  coming in above the staff projections for late 1997 and the first half of 1998, it would be telling  us that nominal income growth was exceeding their GDP forecast, that there was an error in the  GDP forecast I still think that So, I still think that the 1 to 5 percent M2 range was right, is  right, and it tells us that policy is not appropriately calibrated  Thank you, Mr Chairman Obviously, I am delighted with the staffs  upward revisions in its estimates of productivity growth and potential output growth, and I will  be even more pleased if future revisions are also upward to 3, 3-1/4, or even 3-1/2 percent, which I  guess was the highest in history That would be absolutely delightful I doubt that we will see it  go above that and set a new record, but if that happens, that would be great! Nevertheless, such  productivity growth is still not as rapid as the growth of demand, and that creates the problem  that we have I also am delighted with the unemployment rate being at 43 percent, and I hope it  continues to go down I would like to see it go to 4 percent or even below 4 percent Low  unemployment helps us to do wonderful things by providing opportunities for people But it also  sets a model for the rest of the world about what works The longer we can sustain it, the more  imitators around the world we are going to have So, I hope we will not get ourselves into a  situation where we have to take action An unavoidable byproduct would be a higher  unemployment rate It would be not only bad for us, but also bad as a model for the rest of the  world if we found ourselves faced with having to take such an action    6/30-7/1/98  When I look at the Asian situation, perhaps Latin America, and certainly Russia, I  think we should ease policy Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of even considering that  option at this time, and that is too bad Maybe if nominal spending growth, money growth, and  other things over the last year had been as forecast by the staff instead of coming in stronger, the  economy might be more balanced right now and we might be able to entertain that possibility  Or maybe if we had responded earlier to indications that spending growth, domestic demand, and  money and credit growth were coming in a lot stronger and the current account deficit was  widening, we might have had the option of considering an easing sooner I think we are going to  need to ease for the sake of the rest of the world The sooner we create the conditions within the  domestic economy that will permit us to contemplate an easing of policy, the better off we are  going to be and the better off the world is going to be Unfortunately, we sometimes have to  tack; we sometimes have to go in an opposite direction from where we really want to go to get  there I want to be in a world where we not only have lower inflation, but where we have lower  interest rates, rapid economic growth, and sustained low unemployment But I think we are  approaching a point where we may have to go in a direction different from where we all want to  come out  Thank you I think that if someone did an empirical study of central  bank behavior, at least for the last couple of decades of fiat monies unanchored by a gold  standard or something else, they would conclude that there is an asymmetric bias toward easier  money The reason, of course, relates to the existence of an asymmetrical political bias toward  easy money, which already has been alluded to Because of that, we have seen a search for a  way to neutralize that political bias, and it takes various forms such as a provision in the  Maastricht treaty that gives central banks a mandate for price stability, currency boards that  anchor their policies to a strong hard currency, and other ways that try to institutionalize an    6/30-7/1/98  asymmetric bias toward tightening or at least to neutralize the asymmetric bias toward ease In  that sense, I would never favor an asymmetric bias toward ease, announced or unannounced,  because it is redundant [Laughter]  I also question the value of having a stated bias toward tightening, whether released  immediately or later, and any signaling that comes from that Governor Gramlich stated that he  feels there is some value in signaling or communicating in advance what we are going to do I  look at what the Bank of England did in May, and I do not see the downside of their having  taken an action that caught a lot of people by surprise Why is that necessarily a bad thing? In  fact, I worry about the opposite Before we started in early 1994 to announce changes in the  funds rate or to release a statement at the end of our meetings, the Fed watchers had to interpret  Desk actions, and success at that created a rent or a value to those people We took that away  from them and I was happy we did But now we may create a similar opportunity for those who  can interpret our statements or their tone and feel or something like that I think that there is a  hazard in that approach over time  I saw a cartoon a few months ago in a magazine that a lot of you probably do not read,  so I will describe the cartoon It showed a man sitting in front of a television set The television  set says, ""This is just a test; if it had been a real emergency, Alan Greenspan would have said  so"" [Laughter] I have seen and I suspect everyone has seen newsletters to customers of  brokerage houses that claim to know the Fed is not going to tighten policy because, if it were,  Alan Greenspan would have signaled in advance In the absence of a signal, you are safe in  assuming that nothing is going to happen Over time, there is a risk in allowing that view to  dominate behavior Ultimately, of course, it is our actions not our words that matter I just am  not convinced that even having an on-again, off-again asymmetric bias is desirable It does tend    6/30-7/1/98  to reinforce an unfortunate conviction that contemporaneous data have a heavy weight in policy  rather than a long-term strategic focus "
6176,1998-08-18," Peter, at the beginning of your remarks you made reference to market  concerns about Japan in two ways, deflation and weakness of the yen This may sound like a  continuation of a similar discussion about Japan at the last meeting or some of the previous  meetings What adjustment process do people really think needs to take place in Japan? When  markets are unfettered by various kinds of intrusions, prices provide information We have seen  numerous examples in the last couple of decades of governments, central banks, and regimes of  one type or another--in the former Soviet Union, Latin America, and elsewhere--that have  dismantled various barriers to the free flow of goods such as tariff and non tariff barriers, the  movement of products if not labor, and obstacles to financial flows such as capital and other  controls We have seen as a result that the law of one price takes over and the economies in  question move toward equilibrium in global markets--those for goods as well as assets If we start    8/18/98  from where Japan was some years back and if--maybe a big ""if'--Japan is in the process of  gradually transforming itself into something that is more like a market economy, they will have to  have either deflation or devaluation They cannot get from current domestic yen prices to world  market prices without one of those two things happening Now, the world does not want them to  have deflation and does not want them to devalue their currency What do they want them to do,  impose controls?  Thank you First, on Cathy's point, I would think that even people  who believe that there is not going to be a significant problem because of the century date change  will find it prudent to stock up before the hoarders get all of the supply  I have a couple of questions that relate to the staff presentations The  first is directed to Ted Truman on imports I don't know anything about the mechanics of putting  the import data together, but it would seem to me that in times like this, unraveling the crosscurrents  between volume effects and price effects is very complicated A dollar today buys boatloads more  of Indonesian goods than it did before I do not know what is happening to the rupiah prices of  goods, especially the costs of exportable goods We have a retailer on our board who reports that he  is importing a lot more from Asia, and his import bill has gone down That says the volume effects  did not swamp the price effects How should we think about these import numbers, given this  exchange rate and pricing problem?  Thank you I also have a question about the Greenbook's outlook for  the US economy and the emphasis on wealth effects Following up on your response to Bob  Parry, it seems on the surface that there might be some logic and even some indirect empirical  evidence in support of these wealth effects People are behaving in recent months and quarters as  though their permanent income is either above or has risen relative to their measured income The  indirect evidence of that shows up in measures such as the personal saving rate and so on I do  not know how much weight to give to all of that But suppose the central bank does give  significant weight to that kind of phenomenon, how do we then avoid incorporating views about  equity markets in the formulation of monetary policy? We would run into the problem we have  discussed before about somehow using the level of the stock market or changes in the stock  market perhaps not as an indicator but almost as an objective of policy  That is the reason I asked the question As I read the Greenbook and I  think about the outlook for the balance of this year and next year and the emphasis you put on the  wealth effects, I cannot help but think that my comfort level with that forecast depends on what I  think about the outlook for the stock market If the Dow Jones Industrials were to soar to 10,000  by year-end, how do I avoid that?  Thank you, Mr Chairman The autoworkers in our part of the country  have ended their very welcome summer break and have gone back to productive activities, giving  the theme parks and other tourist attractions a little relief They are looking forward to the start of  school so that they can get a little more relief Everybody is reporting record tourism traffic of all  types throughout the region  Construction projects continue to be announced at a rapid pace I view it as a  ""tyranny-of-small-decisions"" effect Some people might call it an aggregation problem because  virtually every metropolitan area in the region is announcing new construction projects on the  assumption that they will be able to import the needed construction workers from someplace else;  the local construction workers are all fully employed A director of a construction trades union  said that the union halls were empty, so they are now providing training to prisoners and parolees  as well as lobbying for increased immigration of construction workers, as I have mentioned  before This is quite a dramatic change in the attitude of unions that are trying to satisfy the  demand for labor as they see it out into the future Nevertheless, Pittsburgh announced that it is  going to spend $1 billion to construct two new stadiums and a convention center over the next few  years Apparently, Pittsburgh is trying to outdo Cincinnati, which is building two new stadium  projects if they can find the needed workers Both cities are trying to keep up with Cleveland,  which is completing a new stadium as well as a large assortment of infrastructure projects    8/18/98  downtown Like every other region of the country, billions of federal tax dollars are now going to  become available to add to local spending for roads, bridges, tunnels, and rapid transit  systems--again if the necessary construction workers can be found Our banking directors and  advisory council members cite examples of what they view as the overbuilding of hotels, motels,  and retail space They report that the deals are being done at ever thinner margins, longer terms,  less collateral, or no collateral  I was interested in the Board staff's report on rents for commercial space relative to  prices of commercial structures Mike Kelley was at our board meeting last week, and one of our  directors, the chairman of National City Bank, said he had read in a newspaper that National City  Tower had been sold again His bank occupies 90 percent of the building and has fixed rents for  seven years The building sold two years ago for $60 million, eight months ago for $80 million,  and last week for over $100 million Public works infrastructure projects are being announced all  over the District every week Tax collections continue to be very strong throughout the area  Residential construction also is very strong Some counties report that permits are up over 50  percent from a year ago The only area of softness in construction is industrial structures where  there has been a slowing in new contract awards  Overall, the labor markets are reported to be very tight Turnover continues to increase  and the quality of entry-level applicants is reported to continue to deteriorate Retail sales were  reported to be surprisingly strong right through the GM strike period Retailers now are  concerned that they will enter the fourth quarter without adequate inventories of the right products  to satisfy what they see as very strong consumer demand Apparel and specialty stores have  experienced very strong sales and their earnings should be at record levels this year Last week  the Cleveland purchasing managers reported the first increase in new orders in several months    8/18/98  Business confidence levels, one director said, are more shaken by what they read about Asia than  by what they see in the order books Our steel industry sources say that consumption levels are  excellent, perhaps a record, but surging imports have put downward pressure on steel prices So,  the domestic steel producers are going to start filing dumping charges very soon and join textile  producers in seeking some protection from cheap imports  Turning to the national economy, much like Bob McTeer I think that the time is  growing nearer when we will have to contemplate an easing of our policy stance, but my reasons  are quite different from his That's mainly because I think it will become increasingly apparent  that we first will have to tighten monetary policy to deal with the speculative imbalances and  excesses that are accumulating across the country Subsequently, we will have to be flexible  enough to respond promptly once we get to the other side of this problem Over the last year we  have seen final demand persistently exceed our expectations in the context of the rise in equity  markets, related wealth effects, and other developments, but we still found reasons not to act I  think that once we finally do act, we will have to be prompt in reading errors on the other side in  the expectation that we subsequently will have to back off a bit  Even though we and everyone else are happy about the low inflation, the low  unemployment, and the good income gains that we are seeing in the nation, it would be very hard  to call this a well balanced expansion at the present time We can put a favorable spin on the past  year by saying that in view of the very strong domestic demand, we are fortunate that the Asian  economies fell apart at just the right time, that their exports were available to meet our surging  consumption, and that their reduced demand for our exports liberated some domestic industrial  capacity so that the domestic economy did not spill over into rising inflation Or we could turn  things completely around the other way and say that in view of the Asian crisis, it is really a good    8/18/98  thing that the United States was enjoying a spending boom so that we could play locomotive to  the rest of the world and lessen the adverse effect on people in those countries But the distortions  in our economy are becoming ever more obvious Manufacturing has been hit hard while  construction soars to unsustainable levels Goods prices are falling while service prices are  accelerating Returns to capital have risen to historic levels as a share of total income in the  economy, while returns to labor appear to have declined as a share of the total  I will now commit a little heresy in the minds of some folks In current circumstances,  the absence of consumer price inflation is not a sufficient condition for financial stability in my  view It is ultimately financial stability, as we have seen in our own history and in other  economies around the world that is the key to maximum sustainable growth When there is a  favorable productivity surprise, it brings with it an acceleration of the growth of business earnings  and in equity prices It is a normal cyclical phenomenon in any case, but it is accentuated when  we have a favorable productivity surprise That in turn translates into increased credit demands  So, we see both bank and nonbank lenders face outward shifts in the demand for loanable funds  and investment capital, and then an increase in the derived demand for bank liabilities But if  those demands for credit and investment capital are accommodated by an acceleration of money  growth, there will be an acceleration of nominal spending growth that manifests itself in excessive  capital accumulation, inventory accumulation, and even employment in some sectors of the  economy  I have avoided talking about the stock market because I do not want to make the same  mistake that Irving Fisher made weeks before the crash of 1929 But there was another economist  of the period, a New Zealand economist, Allan Fisher, who wrote an analysis of the boom-bust  cycles of the time He was following Dennis Robertson, Ralph Hawtrey, and some other    8/18/98  economists who dissected the period of the 1920s and the 1930s Fisher argued that sustained  periods of very favorable developments in productivity led to an exaggeration of what he called  false profit signals or returns to capital If capital investments were financed through an  intermediary banking process, with or without moral hazard problems, there would be set in  motion dynamics that ultimately would result in an economic decline He, of course, was writing  in a period of the gold standard and arguing that the price level should be allowed to decline in  order to avoid the imbalances resulting from these dynamic forces Speaking of gold, it is  intriguing that the ratio of gold prices in dollars relative to oil prices is about the same today as it  was 30 years ago In all of the intervening years, the ratios stayed in a fairly narrow range  expressed as a multiple of gold in dollar terms to oil in dollar terms That is because both are  internationally traded commodities They do not look quite the same in yen or rupiah or other  currencies that have been weak relative to the United States dollar  In the end, shifting the supply schedule of bank credit or other forms of intermediary  credit by increasing the monetary base in a passive way by pegging an overnight interest rate in  the face of a shift in the demand for loanable funds is not the right thing to do We ought to be  allowing a move up on a relatively fixed credit supply schedule and let a rationing process take  place I still am concerned that the growth of the monetary base and the monetary aggregates this  year is fostering too much demand, and we are going to pay a price for correcting it  Thank you, Mr Chairman For what it's worth, during the break I got  the data used by the staff to calculate the median CPI It takes us a little longer to compute this  number after we get the BLS statistics The number for July is 30 percent For July-to-July, it is  28 percent I would take that as the best estimate of what to expect in the next 12 months What  is interesting is that when we break it down, we take the position based on long historical  experience that in the case of a divergence, the published CPI almost always converges to the  median A divergence occurred between October of last year and March of this year when the  published CPI dropped to an annual rate under 1 percent and the median stayed right at about 28  percent During the four months since March, the published CPI has come back to an annual rate  of 24 percent So, one can look at that and say that monetary policy has eased because the real  fed funds rate has fallen in the last four months That is consistent with some other monetary  statistics and credit aggregates, especially the monetary base, which I pay a lot of attention to  The reason for not taking action to restrain monetary growth at this point would be  either the effects of developments in Asia and Russia, though I am not sure how to quantify that,  or the argument that some tightening would do harm to them and therefore we should refrain from  taking action Well, I am really a believer in tough love I remember all the periods in the 1980s  of rolling over repeatedly the maturing debt of Argentina and other countries to give them time to  build up the courage to fix their problems It really was only when we cut them off that the  political dynamics within those countries got to the point where they were willing to do  something When I listen to the discussion about Asia around the table, it seems to me that  people are saying that some of these countries are not yet in bad enough shape to fix I do not  know how our taking action for the purpose of helping them creates the pressures for them to help  themselves    8/18/98  The other argument on the domestic side for not doing anything is the Greenbook  forecast Don Kohn and others have talked about a forecast of slowing expansion in domestic  demand and related slowing growth in money and credit and so on It is a forecast On that score,  I am reminded of century date change problems associated with the computer, whose development  owes much to Marina Whitman's father, John von Neumann, who was the architect of the modern  computer system I do not think we ought to blame him for the two-digit problem, but he did  develop the basic architecture that goes into modern computers  The other thing on which we as economists place more emphasis was  his work with Oskar Morgenstern on the calculus of decisionmaking using mathematical  formulations of the minimax type This helps us to identify which kinds of errors we are willing  to make and which are the most difficult to correct In that light, I still believe that the more  costly mistake to correct will be the one that occurs if it turns out that excess demand growth does  not in fact slow down The analysis so carefully done and mathematically developed by von  Neumann and Morgenstern basically says that we sometimes should base decisions on something  that we not only do not believe and definitely do not want, but that is still the wisest course of  action "
6217,1998-09-29," Thank you With regard to the minutes, I agree with releasing them  as soon they can be prepared, even though releasing them sooner will impose some burden on  the staff and on all of us who review and approve them  On the release of the tilt, though, I am persuaded by a number of comments today that  if we release it immediately, we will not use it Therefore, I want to release the tilt immediately!  [Laughter] I am persuaded that over time the costs of having a tilt outweigh its benefits in terms  of consensus building I have always thought that if we have monetary policy that operates on a  price basis, we run into problems in terms of interactions in the marketplace if we announce our  intention to change interest rates in a certain direction over time The markets do move on that  kind of information, as opposed to the way they tend to function if we have a quantitative  approach to implementing policy  With regard to the wording of the options, like Bob Parry and Ned Gramlich, I like the  way Option 1 begins with a statement of our objectives Regarding the tilt sentence, though, I do  not like Option 1 because it states that ""the Committee believes that developments are more  likely to warrantetc"" That immediately starts to raise questions about what developments are  involved or what indicators flashing red, yellow, or green will trigger an action It puts undue  weight on some signal that may lead to a change in policy Option 2 does not do that  I agree with Governor Gramlich's comment that the federal funds rate has tended to be  too rigid, but my sense has been that the tilt frequently has been used in lieu of making a policy    9/29/98  change The tilt may serve a function in terms of building a onsensus, but if it were not  available, we would have more straight up or down votes We would change our policy or we  would not  Thank you We had a joint meeting in September of our three boards  of directors What was notable about the meeting was that about half of the group said that there  had been a change in confidence and the other half said there was none At earlier meetings,  virtually no one had said that there was any concern on the downside So, this was a marked  mood change on the part of many of the directors, while others from their local vantage  points--their local city or economy--saw no break from earlier trends  In construction, commercial real estate continues to be very strong throughout the  District We get more reports of overbuilding in the upper price range of the housing sector  Our contacts say that projects are falling through or are behind schedule because of labor  shortages; certain construction skills are just not available Cost estimates of some proposed new  projects, especially warehouses and hotels, have come in so high that institutional investors are  no longer willing to provide permanent financing because the implied yields are so low In  contrast to that concern about low yields, the Cleveland Browns franchise was sold for $530  million plus stadium cost overruns that are estimated to run between $35 and $50 million One  of the investor groups backed out, saying that above about $350 million they no longer saw any  current yield But a spokesperson for the NFL said in the New York Times that even though    9/29/98  some are concerned about a very low or nonexistent current yield, the owners can count on  capital asset appreciation! Builders report that local banks are still willing to provide 100  percent construction financing without pre-arranged takeouts in the form of permanent financing  because of their knowledge of the projects and the builders But our contacts believe that  institutional investors are backing away, especially out-of-area investors One banker  commented that the young developers in the region believe that they are bulletproof  Probably the worst situation in the District is that of the steel industry Steel is being  impacted very severely by imports While domestic consumption is going to be at record levels  this year, we are told that imports were up 43 percent in July The steel companies are now  telling us that there will be consolidations, permanent plant closings, and companies taken over  by foreign investors, probably the British, because the domestic companies are in so much  difficulty  One theme that came out of meetings with advisory council members and others  around the District is investor caution We get reports that the fear factor is pervasive We hear  claims of a daily buildup in cash on the sidelines; investors are parking cash because of  uncertainty and are waiting for it to subside We hear nothing about what will dissipate the fear,  when it may happen, and what will be done with all the cash that is parked on the sidelines  waiting for the green lights to come on again  Labor markets continue to be extremely tight Turnover is rising and finding qualified  replacements is taking longer and longer One of the banks that hires throughout the region and  in several other states said that a year ago starting tellers were earning $7 an hour; they are now  earning $10 The bank expects their nonexempt pay to be up 4-3/4 to 5 percent this year versus 4  percent in 1997 They also reported, like some others, that mortgage lending is at record  volumes    9/29/98  Our retail sales have been very strong Retailers say that sales and profits for the third  and fourth quarters will be at record levels and that retailers that source from Asia are doing  especially well They are not as optimistic about 1999 but extremely optimistic about the way  this year will finish In contrast to what somebody else said, sales of home furnishings have  been very strong, probably reflecting the housing industry Telecommunications also are very  strong  We decided to check on a couple of developments in parts of the service sector that  had not otherwise been reported One was what is happening to hotel rates, but after the staff  memo on the Watergate, I guess I don't need to report on that! We contacted major theme and  amusement parks in the region I myself as part of our research effort spent a weekend looking  at those roller coasters at Cedar Point! They boast about having more and bigger roller coasters  than anywhere else in the world They and other theme parks in the Pittsburgh and Cincinnati  areas boosted ticket prices this year by 65 percent to 67 percent, yet attendance also was up in  excess of 6 percent at all of them, giving them double-digit revenue gains this year One big  park said that they will boost ticket prices 10 percent further in January and February next year  To deal with the labor shortages, one of the parks reported hiring 500 foreign students this  summer  Another bit of evidence as to the psychology in our area is that caution apparently did  not hit Kentucky because the thoroughbred horse auction was the best ever Average prices were  up 35 percent from last year More yearlings were sold for over $1 million than in any year since  1980 In two days alone in September 56 yearlings were sold for over $1/2 million each Most  of those horses will be sent to Europe and Asia  Turning to the national economy, I can save some time by saying that I agree with  Gary Stern that a lot of the changes--the break from the past that we have seen--were essential    9/29/98  We have known for a couple of years perhaps that there were certain unsustainable trends at  work As some sage once said, unsustainable things have a habit of ending We may not like the  way they ended, but it was essential for that to happen The difficulty now is how to deal with  the attendant shocks to confidence We have a long history of responding to domestic events  such as Nixon's wage and price controls and the stock market crash of 1987 and to international  events such as financial crises and military actions--including among the latter the Suez, the Bay  of Pigs, and the Gulf War in the early part of this decade When these things happen, there tends  to be a rush to liquidity and a rush to quality The yield curve steepens at the short end and  people seek to invest in better grade assets The central bank had to respond to such  developments in order to avoid an inadvertent contraction of central bank money But in this  environment, we have to be very, very careful about how much of a response we make because  the developments in question tend to be reversed The response has to be limited and  proportional to the problem because of the unavoidable necessity of taking out an injection of  liquidity as confidence starts to rebuild We do not want to err on the other side We have had a  number of episodes in the past where we responded to surprises and overstayed our response  The cost of then taking corrective action in terms of contracting central bank money and raising  interest rates had some unfortunate effects Thank you  Thank you My position is not a 1ot different from that just expressed  by Al Broaddus I had been hoping for quite some time for the emergence of investor caution  Rational optimism is desirable, but investor sentiment was well beyond anything that I would  have called rational optimism Having both lenders and other investors be a little more reasoned  in weighing risks is certainly desirable, but we got there too fast It went too far, and we now are  dealing with a crisis of confidence We do not want to see a seizing up in financial markets,  domestic or foreign Foreign financial markets have seized up to a large extent So, I am hoping  that this uncertainty will dissipate rapidly and that we can turn back to a situation that is more  reflective of the fundamentals I think that any action that we take will be more symbolic--a  message that may have a political component--than needed in a fundamental sense I hope that  turns out to be the case For that reason, I think it is desirable to do the minimum that we can get  away with To do otherwise would be to ignore to our peril the rapid acceleration that we have  seen in all of the money, reserve, and credit aggregates We have to be careful about that  As far as the symmetry is concerned, I always prefer symmetric directives But I do  not feel strongly enough about asymmetry or symmetry that I would dissent from an asymmetric  directive "
6241,1998-10-15," Mr Chairman, this is Jerry Jordan I think most people know my  position on policy, namely that it is too expansionary at this point With regard to the discount  rate, its only economic significance is the message So the question is what message we want to  send with the discount rate There is real significance to what we do on the funds rate I don't  think a 1/4 point reduction is going to do a lot of damage or help a lot either But I think the real  question that must be carefully considered about the discount rate, whether the change is 1/4 or 1/2  point, is the statement that is made about policy now and the statement that will have to be made  in a subsequent period when the rate has to be raised again "
6266,1998-11-17," Cathy, your alternative wording for a tilt in the directive refers to  economic, financial, and monetary developments; that is fine Option 2 talks about prospective  developments, tilt or no tilt; that is fine as well I am agreeable to talking about risks, but your  ""no tilt"" sentence refers to ""risks to the economic outlook"" That stopped me because it could be  interpreted to mean real growth rather than ""economic, financial, and monetary developments""  As we saw very recently, a variety of near-term risks may cause the Committee to do something  that may not translate in the view of every outsider as pertaining to the economic outlook  On the sentence relating to the tilt, I would like to substitute ""the  intermeeting period"" for ""in coming months"" and to delete ""in coming months"" I do, though,  want to ask that the staff think about that last sentence on money and the aggregates The only  thing I like about this sentence is that the constant repetition of some expected moderation is a  subtle acknowledgement that growth has been immoderate, [laughter] that we are embarrassed,  and that we would like to do something about that However, I never look at M3 I look at the  monetary base and to some extent at MZM Once upon a time, we used the expression  ""monetary aggregates"" I would like the staff to think about that and maybe come back to it  when it refers to money What is it about money that we really care about?    11/17/98  Are we discussing the whole range of topics, including the purchase  of indexed securities?  In a very important sense, when we buy Treasury securities we  effectively cancel that part of the government's debt The word ""monetize"" is used to describe  that result Wright Patman used to say that the bonds owned by the Federal Reserve might as    11/17/98  well be burned because the Treasury gives the Fed interest on those bonds, and for the most part,  the Fed gives the interest back to the Treasury Those bonds do not exist in an economic sense  any more  Whatever the Treasury's reasons might be for wanting to increase the  outstanding stock of index-linked securities, I would be troubled if we were, in effect, to  undertake to cancel some of those securities by monetizing them As I understand it, a problem  with that market has been its illiquidity; it is not a market that has developed breadth and depth,  and all those things For us to buy up some of these securities and remove them from the market  when it is still in its early stages of development would be troubling, so I think we should  proceed very slowly and carefully before engaging in this activity And then there's the notion  you alluded to, regarding the public policy perception of the central bank buying inflation  protection  Thank you, Mr Chairman As is usually the case, conditions in our  District are partly like those in the Eighth District but especially like those in the Seventh District  with regard to motor vehicles and so on One big difference that I had failed to note, until a  director pointed it out to me a couple of Saturdays ago, was the sudden, dramatic plunge in  consumer confidence when Ohio State lost to Michigan [Laughter] I assume that there was an  offset in East Lansing  One director at a recent meeting argued that we are suffering from a severe shortage of  people Our problem in the region is that we cannot fill up the hotels, the motels, the shopping  malls--although they are pretty packed--the houses, and the office buildings that are being built  because there just are not enough people One major homebuilder in southwest Ohio and  northern Kentucky said that 1999 will be the best year ever Builders tell us that  taxpayer-financed construction in 1999 will exceed that of 1988 if they can find the workers  needed to build all of it So, we need a strategy for the region to get more people to do the work  and to fill up all these places About the only things that we seem to be able to build and fill  readily are the prisons I am tempted to suggest that we go down to Texas to try to recruit some  people there, but I am skeptical about how effective that effort would be That's because the  head of the construction trades union on our board told us that the scarcity of labor is so severe  that construction workers are complaining that they're not getting their usual time off for deer  hunting So, I'm not sure we can recruit the workers that we need    11/17/98  In conversations with directors and advisory councils since the last meeting,  references to the notion of a credit crunch or credit crisis came up frequently A common  comment was that they were mystified in that what they understood was going on in global  capital markets simply didn't apply to their customers Some bankers said that they had looked  hard for financial strains They figured that would give them an opportunity to deploy some of  their excess liquidity more profitably than in the past, but they were not able to find such  opportunities Business loans are still being made at fixed rates of 7 and 7-1/2 percent for up to 15  years and no personal guarantees One banker reported a deal with a 10-year maturity at a fixed  rate of less than 7 percent There are complaints that the competition is still bidding down the  pricing on loans to medium and small businesses It is not an issue for them of having survived a  credit crunch; it simply did not happen  There is a disparity in the outlook in that the communities and the businesses tied to  steel in particular are in a very gloomy mood and say that 1999 is not going to be that great a  year If anything, we are going to see more plant closings and more layoffs in businesses related  to metals Agriculture is also suffering some strains There are record crop volumes, but that has  not fully offset the depressed prices  In retail, there is a nervous optimism The malls are packed now, but retailers are  worried that it will not last Bankers and others are trying to draw a connection between the  stock market and consumer optimism, but they seem to want to have the causality going both  ways I really don't know what to make of that One banker, an active member of our  community bank advisory council, said that an indication of consumer optimism is that 80  percent or more of the ballot initiatives in the region passed He said he thinks that when the  voters approve anything for bond financing or tax increases, they must be feeling good One    11/17/98  banker believes an indication of trouble is that a chain of 16 pawnbrokers is reporting record  traffic Maybe people are just hocking things so they can buy more Asian goods; I don't know  Labor turnover continues to be a problem in the retail industry Frequently mentioned are rising  starting wages, overall compensation, and of course the poor quality of the people who apply for  jobs  Some bankers in the area have reported that a withdrawal of the Japanese lenders has  allowed them to increase margins and gain back some lost customers One regional bank was  telling us that loan demand bounced back dramatically and was surprisingly strong in the third  quarter and will probably be even stronger in the fourth quarter We had a meeting with the  senior credit officers of eight of the largest banking companies in the area and asked them about  their policies They said that, having received letters from the Board and the OCC about  tightening credit standards, they felt more reluctant in the course of putting the largest amount of  loans on their books in a very long time At least they had their attitudes right, because they all  smiled about it! One banker contends that the jolt, as he puts it, to the capital markets was very  much needed and has brought back realistic pricing for risk in his view  Auto production, as Mike Moskow reported, is very strong All the auto communities  are very buoyant Heavy truck production is not only operating at high levels, but the order  backlog going into 1999 is reported to be at historically high levels In contrast, makers of  construction and agricultural equipment are telling us that orders recently have been falling off  sharply and production will be lower next year  On the national economy, I want to say a few words about money and monetary policy  and the conjecture that what we have seen in terms of some of the monetary aggregates--notably  mutual fund balances, money market balances, and various types of savings balances--is related    11/17/98  to the stock market Saying that the behavior of money just reflects a decline in velocity is, of  course, tautological; it doesn't help us to understand the causality Any statement about velocity  is a statement about the demand for money If it had anything to do with increased uncertainty  related to the capital markets and the stock market, then we would expect the rise in velocity to  be reversed at some point in the context of a decline in the broad money measures Earlier in the  decade when we saw no growth in broad money measures like M2 and M3, I reached a comfort  level with that because other measures were growing very rapidly Usually when we have these  explanations about depositors, whether it is households or others that are shifting their behavior,  there are disparate movements of the various narrower and broader measures of money and  credit This time we are not seeing that What we are seeing is that the monetary base adjusted  for sweep accounts, MZM, M2, M3, total bank credit--all of these measures--have  simultaneously been increasing very dramatically I think this is an issue in search of an  explanation that can let us feel comfortable with what we can see going on and that will leave us  unconcerned about the implications down the road But I'm concerned about the implications  down the road I think there's at least a risk that we're going to see that monetary growth  showing up in ways, whether it's in the asset markets or in the goods markets, that we are not  going to be happy about  For the reasons that several people have stated, I think it would be  better to wait  Less immoderate? [Laughter] "
6289,1998-12-22," Thank you There are disparate developments in our District as well  as all over the country In particular, directors and others we talk to focus attention on steel and  how hard times have been for the steel sector Twenty years ago when I lived in Pittsburgh, one  of the large corporations headquartered there was among the largest in the world--the United  States Steel Corporation They decided they were too dependent on steel so they diversified into  oil [Laughter]  So, we do hear those stories about just how difficult it is for certain  companies and certain communities that are related to either metals or energy But virtually  everything else is about as strong as it can get, and everybody talks about 1999 being even  stronger The motor vehicle industry is exceptionally strong Mike Moskow mentioned Honda  and Camry; they are both produced in our District In fact, four of the top six selling  automobiles are produced in our District and three of the top selling so-called light trucks are  produced in our District So, employment in that industry is strong and the automobile producers  would like it to get stronger if they could find the workers Toyota announced last week that  they are going to develop 86 acres in northern Kentucky across from Cincinnati and build an    12/22/98 38  840,000 square foot facility, and they are going to import the labor from somewhere Most of  the communities around the District talk about importing labor from someplace else  Expectations generally are that holiday retail sales will be excellent; the malls are  packed People are earning good incomes and they are spending In banking, C&I loan demand  is reported by one director to be the strongest that he can recall in the time he has been in the  banking industry Bankers have expressed concern about the continued overbuilding of retail  space and hotel and motel space They also worry that depressed commodity prices are  eventually going to depress farmland prices, but they continue to report that for the moment  farmland prices keep going up One director with the construction workers' union said that labor  shortages are going to worsen in the region in 1999 because of all of the new projects One  director in the asset management business reported that the equity market is being driven by  what he calls ""perpetual great expectations,"" which he considers to be unrealistic He voiced  concern that company pension plans and individual retirement plans have been increasing the  share allocated to equities in recent months I have seen--probably everyone has now seen--  newsletters, advisory letters, talking heads on CNBC, and so on saying that there is no risk that  the stock market is going to go down because if it even started down, the Fed would ease policy  to prop it back up So, in their view, the market can only go up from this point I think there are  more and more people coming to that belief and acting on it  One note in retail distribution that I found interesting is that catalog sales are reported  to be growing at very rapid rates and that sales to corporations for promotions and gifts are  extremely strong It was noted that apparel sales are now the fourth largest category of Internet  sales, accounting for 23 percent of total sales on the Internet and rising at double-digit rates of  increase, reported that his company plans to raise wages 10 to 12    12/22/98 39  percent across the board in 1999 in order to reduce their reliance on temporary workers and to  lower the turnover of their work force And while they are doing that, they plan to invest heavily  in labor-saving equipment  Since the last meeting, I had an opportunity to be in a more tropical climate than  Cleveland Of course, Cleveland has been somewhat tropical this year I had daily reminders of  what somebody once said ""Inflation is like bananas Once you start to see the brown spots, it's  too late"" [Laughter]  So, we all look for signs and evidence that prices of goods and  services are starting to rise at a somewhat more rapid rate There are some signs, and the staff  forecast for the next year or two is that the rate will be modestly higher But even if that forecast  is accurate and prices of goods and services rise only moderately faster in the next couple of  years, low measured inflation is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for monetary stability  We and others around the world have experienced monetary and financial instability and  ultimate economic difficulties even during extended periods when prices of goods and services  were rising only very slowly So in an important sense, stabilizing the dollar involves more than  just wages or prices of goods and services  We all know that equity prices cannot continue to rise at double-digit rates as they  have over the last few years Forecasting an end to that in one sense is easy There is no such  thing as The change in the rate of change can increase indefinitely Inevitably, the rate of  increase in equity prices must slow, and I would have been happier in that regard if we hadn't  had this recent very strong rebound in equity prices from the lows of last fall We also know that  the rates of growth of the whole constellation of measures of money are going to have to slow    12/22/98 40  They have accelerated dramatically; they will moderate Somehow, someway, their growth must  slow Either we'll get lucky and they will slow or we'll take action to slow them down We  know the growth of bank credit and all of its components cannot continue to rise at double-digit  rates It must slow down, sometime, someway We know that the rate of increase in real estate  prices--house prices, commercial real estate prices, and farm prices that have all been  accelerating--must slow There must be a deceleration, a negative second difference So, we  know these things are in our future It's just a matter of when and how we get there  Thank you I can agree with ""no change"" today Even though I  disagreed with the funds rate reduction in November, I would not reverse it as of today I don't  know what is going to happen in the future because of the potential for external shocks from  Brazil or Russia or elsewhere that will influence the way the domestic and international financial  markets function But holding that aside, I think domestic considerations are going to require at  some point that we start to raise the level of the overnight interbank nominal rate in order to slow  the growth of money and credit  On the issue of pricing in goods and services markets, the area I would watch very  carefully is that 13 or 14 percent of the economy we call the health care sector Significant  upward pressures are already emerging in that sector We also see prices being raised, at least in  our region of the country, in a broad range of leisure goods industries including recreation,  travel, tourism, entertainment, and restaurants So, I think that we are seeing the brown spots  I prefer option 3 and I'd delete the reference to ""in coming months""  My first preference would be to keep the sentence on money if it were read and interpreted by  everybody as a true proviso clause If, for example, it meant that if money growth does not slow  down as currently indicated in that sentence, we would change something But since we do not  use the sentence that way, I think it has to come out  I support the proposal "
6312,1999-02-02," Peter, I probably should know this from something else you   have sent us, but when you converted our holdings of securities denominated in   deutschemarks to securities denominated in euros, what did you do?   The portfolio now has euro-denominated deposits at the   Bundesbank, euro-denominated German government securities, and euro-denominated   deposits at the BIS?   Okay Under what circumstances would we wind up having in   the portfolio euro-denominated obligations of other taxing authorities besides the   Germans?   Thank you   I want to ask about the last chart because it goes into the   Humphrey-Hawkins report and does get some attention from the public I was struck that   the central tendency on the real GDP numbers and on the CPI numbers stayed the same   as those we had last summer but the nominal GDP range went down That implies, I   suppose, that our idea of what deflator is appropriate was revised down compared to what   we thought last July   Last Friday’s report on economic activity in the fourth quarter   had nominal GDP growth at 6½ percent?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy was very   strong in the fourth quarter of last year, but that no doubt reflected the weakness at   midyear associated with the auto strike But it is creating what I think of as a ski jump   effect Inevitably we are going to reach a point where people’s expectations are going to   be disappointed   The anecdotal reports suggest that people are expecting 1999 to be a stronger year   than 1998, but that may just be a reflection of how strong autos, construction, and other   sectors were as we finished the year We are told that the backlog of presold, not-yet-  built houses is at record levels and was rising as of year-end Construction employment   this year is expected, by the construction trade unions anyway, to exceed the levels   recorded in 1998   Overall, the labor markets continue to be very tight One of the large regional   banks that operates in a number of states in the Great Lakes region said that as of the end   of last summer they had 3,000 open positions In order to cut that, they significantly   increased their use of retention bonuses For example, any teller who was on the payroll   on September 1, 1998 will get a $1,000 cash bonus if he or she is still on the payroll on   February 28, 1999 I’m going to call in the early weeks of March and find out what   happened after tellers get their bonuses! The company also was planning an across-the-  board increase of 4 to 5 percent in base wages for 1999   Reports from people in the retail sector almost never square with the subsequent   data That may reflect overcapacity in that sector or it may just be unrealistic   expectations by the people in the sector The retailers complained in December about   warm weather hurting sales; then they complained in January about cold weather hurting   sales Even in the last week of December they were saying that retail sales were soft or   disappointing and they subsequently reported that it was the best Christmas since 1984     2/2-3/99 52   A director from the retail sector says that no matter what happens in 1999, we will hear   retailers saying that it was not as good as 1998   Bankers report that C&I loan demand is very strong One of the regional banks   said that at the end of the year loans in the pipeline were at the highest level ever, and   they are now able to improve their profit margins Earlier in the year they felt their   margins were being squeezed   Even the hard-hit steel industry struck a note of optimism recently Steel prices in   the fourth quarter of last year were said to have been down 6 percent on average from a   year earlier but some view that as the bottom  That may be wishful thinking And it was   asserted that steel imports, especially from Japan, had peaked sometime last fall and are   now declining With consumption last year at a record and expected to be as high or   better this year, steel industry executives are starting to turn optimistic I agree with what   Mike Prell said about the earnings numbers LTV reported a big loss for the fourth   quarter, but even they are less bearish going forward   Turning to the national economy, I have the same problem with this Greenbook as   I have had with other recent ones, especially for the Humphrey-Hawkins projection   period, in that I like the Greenbook forecast; I just don’t believe it I continue to want to   believe it because it looks so good   For the first meeting of the year, I look back over the forecasts of the last several   years This forecast is now the highest current year forecast for real growth that we have   had, at 26 percent on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis That looks really good   It’s higher than last year’s 24 percent The year before it was 24 percent and in 1996 I   think the forecast at the first meeting of the year was only about 18 percent for the four-  quarter period Growth substantially exceeded that initial forecast in each of the last   three years and inflation came in lower than projected It’s hard to beat that It’s easy to   say I want more of the same--faster growth, lower inflation This is the first time in the   last couple of years, though, where the unemployment rate is not rising in the current year   and the out year I also like that outcome, but I doubt that, given what we inherited from   1998, we have conditions in place that will produce that result again Certainly in my   region, but I think nationally as well, a significant portion of the surge in economic   activity reflected an acceleration of final demand--fueled by what I consider to be very     2/2-3/99 53   rapid growth in all of the reserve, money, and credit measures--to a pace that was   associated in part with large and growing current account deficits That, as the Chart   Show illustrated, gave the appearance of a virtuous cycle of rapid growth, strong demand,   and low inflation that cannot be sustained Some components of that are going to start to   reverse on us and will give us a disappointing result of less output and more inflation   The longer we wait to start to rein in some of the nominal aggregate income   growth and spending growth, the longer we are subsequently going to have to endure a   period of very weak growth in output and employment in order to lean against the rise in   inflation So, at some point we have to contemplate an adverse transitory tradeoff, and I   think the sooner the better   Thank you Quite a few references have been made to the role of   expectations I did not come into this meeting with any expectation that there would be   an adjustment in the funds rate at this meeting I didn’t know what the reasons for not   making an adjustment might be, but I did not expect an adjustment However, I still   stand by my dissent on the cut in the funds rate taken in November, and I think it should   be reversed I don’t think this would be the time to do it, with due respect to Al Broaddus   and others whose views are that perhaps it should be done now   A reason for acting at this time that I would not find desirable would be that the   economy is growing too fast In fact, there is a potential that the economy would not   grow so fast if we tightened at this meeting There is the potential for an unfortunate,   undesirable misinterpretation, coming after last Friday’s report on real growth, that the   Committee thinks that there is too much growth and too much employment and that we   are unhappy about that That would not be desirable In fact, I believe we ought to go   the other way by trying to emphasize how delighted we are with this strong growth, how   delighted we are with the low unemployment rate, and how delighted we are with low   inflation and, therefore, we did not take action   Nevertheless, expectations going forward are going to be a dominant concern to   us and to everybody who watches us As much as we and the world are happy that the   average level of current consumable goods and service prices is not changing very   rapidly, that is the necessary condition for successful monetary policy but it is not a     2/2-3/99 123   sufficient condition If it were a sufficient condition, we would still be under the gold   standard In fact, the Federal Reserve would not exist if it were a sufficient condition   We have had cases in our history and cases in other countries’ history where the present   price of claims to future consumption moved very substantially--sometimes too far up   and then sometimes very rapidly down This creates financial instabilities that are   unhealthy for the performance of an economy Otherwise, 1907 would not have   happened; 1893 would not have happened Central banks and monetary policy are   designed to try to correct some of the flaws inherent in a pure gold standard type of   environment That means that we have to take into account things, such as the present   price of future consumption, that are missing in our usual measures of goods and services   prices   For some time, people have been purchasing equities in the expectation of selling   them to somebody else at a higher price, with not a thought as to what the earnings   potential or real value is--and it’s probably more than just my three kids [Laughter]   There are people making real estate investments for residential and other purposes in the   expectation that prices can only go up and go up at accelerating rates Those expectations   ultimately become destabilizing to the economic system  "
6341,1999-03-30," I want to ask something that doesn’t really have an answer   But I’d like to get your views from the domestic and international side in trying to tie   together some thoughts and observations about the US economy and the rest of the   world and which is more likely to change and why Looking back on 1998, for the US   economy everything was, if anything, better than expected in terms of output,   employment, inflation, and other measures we talk about Looking at the rest of the   world, economic performance was, if anything, worse than hoped for or expected In our     3/30/99 11   efforts to understand the US economy, we use words like technology, innovation, and   various business efficiencies to try to explain its extraordinary performance Then, in   thinking about what is going on in the rest of the world, at least in the non-English-  speaking world, it is tempting to think that technology, efficiencies, and so on do still   recognize borders, which is probably not likely So if it is not a uniquely American   phenomenon or even a phenomenon of English-speaking countries, as some people might   argue, what is likely to change?  Also, on Al Broaddus’s question about the exchange   rate, I don’t know to what extent we ought to be thinking that it is a pull phenomenon-­  where everything is wonderful here, which allows the capital inflow and a worsening of   the current account deficit and yet we don’t have a problem Or how much of it is push?   If everything is so bad every place else, when are they going to get their act together and   figure out what we are doing right?  That would help us understand at what point this   large and growing current account deficit and external debt will become a problem for us   Will it be either when we stop doing things so perfectly or when the rest of the world   starts doing things a lot better?  Any comments or observations?   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the material we received at the   hotel last night was the proposed draft statement of the directive, which begins “The   information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity has   moderated in early 1999” I was curious whether I would hear that view expressed   around the table because I certainly did not hear it in my District I have not heard it   around the table If that sentence is supposed to convey something about the real GDP   number, I don’t think it fully captures what we have been hearing and feeling about   economic activity, whether from the Purchasing Managers’ Report or anything else   The directors and Advisory Council members in my District continue to be   generally upbeat about the first quarter While we’ve had some reports of a slowing in   demand in these first few months compared to the fourth quarter of last year, which was   surprisingly strong to most people, those were more than offset by reports of further   increases in sales and orders in the first quarter Retailers, who had expected a slowing   after the surprisingly strong year-end numbers, are now reporting that the first quarter   will show further increases They also say that their inventories are below desired levels   and that they want to try to get them up One retailer said that catalog sales were up   sharply compared to in-store sales, about 30 percent in the first two months of this year   versus last year They break their sales figures into two components, those from 800-  number calls and those from Internet orders The Internet share has risen dramatically,   and the profit margin on the Internet sales share is significantly higher than on the 800-  number catalog sales   The labor markets continue to be tight throughout the District, especially in the   southwest Ohio and central Kentucky metro areas where reported unemployment is less   than 2 percent As others have noted, temporary employment agencies say they have   more requests for workers than they can meet One large regional commercial bank that     3/30/99 47   is headquartered in the Cincinnati area but operates in several states said it currently has   over 500 approved openings that it is unable to fill   Companies, both large and small, continue to report an escalation of health   care costs Some of the increases they report are really very, very high Some companies   are trying to contain these costs by cutting coverage or by raising the deductibles They   are targeting prescription drugs especially because they say those costs are rising very,   very rapidly; so they are trying to get the employees to pay more of the cost for   prescriptions   One company with a unionized workforce is bargaining for what they call a   “total compensation increase” over the life of the contract and letting the union and the   employees decide how much will go into the paycheck and how much will go into   benefits They say that if they can contain the increase over the life of the contract to a   total of 6 percent per year for the two components, they will be satisfied   Construction spending is accelerating further from the record 1998 pace, and   unions are reporting that contractors are now offering bonuses to previously retired   construction workers to come back into the workforce, especially to train and tutor   apprentice workers We even have had some reports of retailers giving as their reason for   going out of business the difficulty and cost of attracting and retaining workers Bankers   continue to report strong loan demand Home sales have been so strong that there is a   growing backlog of appraisals to be done   As Mike Moskow reported, steel companies are feeling a lot better about their   situation, especially since steel exports from Japan have dropped off sharply They do   mention that there has been some increase in steel coming from Europe and Mexico   Nevertheless, consumption of steel has continued to be extremely strong, and price   increases have been posted for the second quarter We don’t know if those price   increases are going to stick, but the industry is quick to point out that the increases are   only a reversal of price cuts taken last year that they considered too large So, in their   view, the price hikes are not inflationary     3/30/99 48   Turning to the national scene, I would note that also in our hotel rooms last   night was a copy of the Board staff’s briefing yesterday on domestic nonfinancial   developments I thought that did a very good job of summarizing what the implications   of an improving productivity trend--technological efficiencies or those other labels we   have talked about in analyzing the real growth numbers--might be for monetary policy I   would encourage the staff to go further in that analysis to develop an understanding of   the implications for the financial sector, not only for banks but for other financial   intermediaries There may be implications for asset-based lending or income-stream or   working-capital-based lending if lenders begin to make some mistakes There is a   tendency to overshoot especially when negative second differences come into play and   the rate of change starts to slow Both short-run business earnings and market valuations   of assets can be influenced by the dynamics that are described in that analysis If so, an   inherited approach to credit risk analysis would subsequently prove to have been a   myopic way to look at the risk/return relationship One does not have to have been a   lender in Southern California, Arizona, Texas, or some other places in the 1980s to see   how those dynamics work out But the people who made those mistakes back then are   now retired, so I guess there’s a new group that has to repeat those mistakes   The tendency is for positive productivity surprises, by their very nature, to be   reflected in favorable earnings reports If that tendency has been amplified by a failure of   workers or their union leaders to fully appreciate that the value of the marginal product of   labor has in fact risen, then there is going to be a further but temporary acceleration in   returns to capital versus returns to labor And those dynamics at some point have to   reverse A reversion to conditions where real wages do reflect the value of the marginal   product of labor, which we know will ultimately happen, requires a mirror image of   surprises on the returns to capital The risk to financial stability depends on the ability of   lenders, both banks and financial intermediaries, to absorb those adverse surprises As   I’ve said before, stability in various measures of average prices of consumer goods is not   a sufficient condition for overall monetary and financial stability It is a bigger issue than   that Thank you     3/30/99 49   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with what Bill   McDonough said at the outset It is highly likely that if we were to take a firming action   today, it would be interpreted in view of the strong growth numbers as being antigrowth,   and that would be very undesirable It is also true, in view of the stock market finally   closing above 10,000 yesterday, that a tightening step could easily be interpreted-­  unfortunately, and in my view wrongly--that we considered that undesirable and we   reacted to it What is troubling about that is that it leads to the implication that we have   to wait until growth slows sharply and the stock market drops and then it will be safe to   raise rates [Laughter] I don’t know how to get out of this box because, certainly, once   the need for a move is obvious it is too late It is easy for monetary policy steps to be   taken when it is obvious to everybody that they are appropriate I believe, however, that   some of our greatest successes in the past have occurred when we were willing to take   actions that were not, in fact, obvious to everybody   If my memory is right, our May FOMC meeting will mark the second   anniversary of our looking at domestic conditions and forecasts of the future, taking   account of our concerns and the lags and saying Well, we probably should move in an   anticipatory or preemptive way, but there are certain external reasons for not doing so   Since then we have had a whole succession of reasons Sometimes they have been   compelling--for example, in the fall of 1997 and even last fall when the newsletters were   full of stories about how the Asian crisis was going to bite us if we waited just a little   longer     3/30/99 67   We have had some discussions around this table in the past about the partial   analysis of the negative impulses and the partial analysis of the positive impulses   affecting the US economy coming from events abroad It is very difficult to net these   factors out But it is hard for me to imagine that the economy today in the United States   would be even stronger had these events not happened So it is easier to come to the   conclusion that the netting would lead to the view that we have had more beneficial than   adverse consequences, though certainly not every sector or industry would agree with   that But we cannot live on just-in-time crises around the world to sustain this economy   At some point the effects on our economy have to come from internal decisions   I don’t believe that recessions are caused by the economy running out of gas,   with demand just drying up for lack of stimulus Rather, I believe they are caused by the   kinds of conditions that Japan created for itself Dramatically expanding domestic   industrial capacity far beyond the ability to absorb it internally and creating conditions in   its financial sector that they have been trying to work off for a decade If we get to a   point where we have to have a protracted period of no growth or a contraction, it will be   because we have overstimulated on the front end, not because we ran out of stimulus to   demand  "
6363,1999-05-18," Thank you Discussions with directors and advisory council   members since our March 30 meeting have gone in the direction of reconfirming that the   regional economy is very strong Even the communities that are most influenced by   steel, which had been registering some concern earlier, have reported that business   conditions never got as bad as they had feared and that they have started to show some   improvement Wheeling Steel, for instance, is already recalling workers Structural steel   orders are still strong and it was suggested that some “strike hedge” stockpiling may be   going on at the present time, with the backlog building   Because of worldwide overcapacity, steel industry people expect to see   significant consolidation in the steel industry In particular, they expect Western   European companies to be acquiring US producers In the first quarter, an overall   decline in steel imports had been expected, based on the view that less Japanese steel   would be coming in And there was a decline in Japanese steel and Russian steel   However, that was more than offset by an increase in Korean and Brazilian steel So,   steel imports in the first quarter were up 4½ percent versus a year earlier   In motor vehicles, production is reported to be flat out at the plants around the   District, with some of the larger plants, at General Motors in particular, operating 7 days   a week And the workers are getting tired of it One of the truck body manufacturers   responded to a shortage of welders by starting to offer courses in the high school, where   he pays his employees to go and teach welding shop   We have an interesting situation with Honda They have a number of plants in   Ohio and they have in the past been considered a model of labor/management relations in   the non-unionized sector The UAW attempted to organize them twice, in 1985 and   1989 Early this year, a petition from workers asked the UAW to try again The UAW   declined, based on a low expectation of being successful, so the workers went to the   Teamsters The Teamsters went to the UAW and the UAW said the attempt would not     5/18/99 30   work and they were not interested in trying again, so the Teamsters decided to try Out of   8,000 workers at the various plants, they have already collected 3,800 cards--they have   not certified them all and they need to have about 2,400 certified--which got the UAW’s   attention very quickly The UAW has petitioned for a hearing, which is being held today,   to decide whether or not the Teamsters do in fact have jurisdiction or whether they will   have to turn the organizing effort over to the UAW A contact in the Teamsters local in   Columbus said that they had not expected the organizing drive to be successful the first   time around They were caught completely off guard by the response of the workers So,   that is one we plan to monitor closely Union communications workers just settled with a   company in Cincinnati; the contract is for three years and the package is 6 percent per   year for the three-year period   In construction, the situation has been described as a surge of new business, even   though there continue to be shortages of workers with various crafts and skills Some   said those shortages are worse than before The Ohio building trades now expect to have   at least two more years of high levels of construction activity  On the residential side,   builders say the problem with starts activity is that they are so far behind schedule on   existing projects that they are seeing more delays, longer times to complete projects when   they do start new ones, and thus they are reluctant to extend the pipeline any further   People from Pittsburgh say that the city is in the early stages of a major construction   boom that will last five years; and that includes the building of stadiums, convention   centers, theaters, bank operation centers, downtown retail space, tunnels, and bridges   Earlier, people from western Pennsylvania had been saying that they were lagging   considerably behind Ohio and Kentucky but now they claim that they have closed the   gap They have experienced very rapid growth and have labor shortages in an increasing   number of communities  A contact from one of the community banks in southwest   Pennsylvania said that a significant employer for their community decided to go out of   business and laid off 200 workers So the bank joined with some others to co-sponsor a   job fair for the displaced employees But they had to cancel the job fair because the   workers had all found jobs before the fair took place   A food processing company in Ohio reported continued strong sales at both what   they call the in-store retail and their 800 Internet services or catalog sales They are very     5/18/99 31   happy about that But they are not happy on the cost side Freezer storage rates in the   first quarter were up 13 to 18 percent from a year earlier; health care costs in 1999 are   now budgeted to be up 14 percent from a year earlier; and prices of corrugated packing   material in the first three months of the year were 15 percent above year-earlier levels   Other manufacturing reports included tool and die companies who say they have now   fully recovered from the earlier loss of business to Asian imports A manufacturer of   safety equipment for mining and manufacturing companies reports that in addition to   continued strong US orders, they have recently seen some pickup in orders from both   Asia and Europe   Bankers in the region report strong loan demand in every category We asked   our Community Bank Advisory Council why we no longer hear the stories we were   hearing a couple of years ago about people walking in and turning over the keys to their   vehicle because they could not afford to pay for the car, the truck, or whatever it was   And the bankers did not really have a coherent response They said these stories have   stopped totally Some guess that it has to do with wealth effects from the stock market,   the equity taken out from refinancing homes, and debt consolidations They mention   various reasons why they conjecture that those “stretched” consumers no longer exist   But no one had any stories to tell   In agriculture, conditions in our area sound a little better than in Mike Moskow’s   District Bankers and one agricultural supplier have told us that it has been a very good   planting season; all the planting has been done They experienced falling seed, fertilizer,   and energy prices during the planting season and--assuming they get appropriate amounts   of rain--they are optimistic at this point about having a good year, the first in three years   We still hear references to, in one person’s words, “outrageous prices” being paid for   farmland The reports are that it is not the neighbor farmer buying the land but somebody   coming from somewhere else, and often these are cash deals Another banker said that he   tracks what he calls the debt service per acre of farmland and it is the highest level he has   ever seen   Let me turn to the national scene for a moment I always have trouble using the   word “inflation,” mainly because of the way people also use words like “deflation” So   instead I think in terms of the purchasing power of our currency and I try to give some     5/18/99 32   meaning to the expression “price stability” What we mean by price stability is that   people make decisions in the expectation that the purchasing power of a dollar in the   future is going to be the same as it is today When that condition is met, we get efficient   allocation of resources at the business level and the household level, and we get   maximum growth in our standards of living We have had the experience of people   revising downward their expectations for the future about what we call inflation, though   perhaps not by as much as the decline in the reported numbers for late last year and the   early months of this year And that was, in words that we used some time ago, a period   where we could have exercised “opportunistic disinflation policy” and locked that   progress in We clearly missed that opportunity and did not lock it in It’s much more   likely that people expect the purchasing power of the dollar to decline faster in the future   than has been the case in their recent experience I think we have to anticipate that from   this point forward people are going to expect higher rather than lower inflation   Thank you, Mr Chairman As probably everyone knows and   as Peter Fisher’s charts showed, the level of intermediate- and long-term government     5/18/99 67   yields in May of 1999 is almost exactly where it was in May of 1998 So, in looking at   nominal interest rates and the yield curve, we are right back where we were a year ago,   and I thought policy was too expansionary then I still am from the school of thought that   believes a steeper yield curve indicates a more expansionary monetary policy rather than   one that is less expansionary, and the yield curve is distinctly steeper today than it was a   year ago Governor Meyer said that the markets moved the rates back up in expectation   of our tightening policy--raising the funds rate I hope so because I don’t like the   alternative explanation That explanation would be that the markets don’t expect us to   tighten, and for that reason interest rates have risen and will keep on rising That would   be especially disturbing   The shock of last August and September was exactly that--an external shock   that is unpredictable by its very nature Those things happen They have happened   before For a time they lead the central bank to suspend the normal considerations that   go into its monetary policy decisions I strongly suspect that it happened to the   Committee with the onset of the Gulf War in 1990 It certainly happened in the fall of   1987 with the stock market crash in October of that year I dread all Octobers, and since   we are having a meeting this October, I am going to dread it, too [Laughter]   Right, let us just skip October But I still believe in long lags,   in variable lags too, but especially in long lags I think our policy stance on balance has   been more expansionary than was necessary or desirable for the environment in which we   found ourselves I say that even though we would have had to interrupt the policy that I   would have thought appropriate a year ago because of what happened in August and   September Now, we should get back on the track that we otherwise would have been on   We are not back on that track and in my view monetary policy right now is more   expansionary than desirable   With regard to the issue of announcing a change in the tilt, I am bothered by   the idea of saying we have cocked the gun but hope that we don’t have to use it That   bothers me a lot I don’t like that practice in foreign policy let alone monetary policy,   namely telling people that if one more thing happens--I don’t know what that one more   thing is--we are going to use this tool Also, once we adopt an asymmetric directive and     5/18/99 68   announce that decision--with the understanding that we are providing information about a   shift in our thinking about policy--then I assume at a later point we would have to   announce a decision to remove the tilt if we determine we will not use it To do   otherwise would be to misinform the marketplace Announcing the adoption of a tilt and   not being very clear about the circumstances under which we would or would not use it is   in my view going to lock us into making further announcements I am not sure whether   such a practice will give better information to the markets or not  "
6386,1999-06-29," Some of the initial commentary I saw after the announcement by   the Japanese in early June of their first-quarter number was along the lines that it was a   statistical fluke or window-dressing The view was that it wasn’t real and that by year-  end we would see the Japanese economy back in the tank again A fair amount of the   commentary had the tone of “This is something we did not forecast so it couldn’t   possibly be true” More recently, I have seen more commentaries suggesting that the first   quarter may have represented a turning point, though the GDP number may be   exaggerated, and that from this point forward Japan would be viewed as having seen the   worst Is there any dominance of one opinion or the other in the street?   Thank you Several meetings with bankers in sixteen of the   western and northwestern counties of Ohio two weeks ago revealed somewhat of a   paradox in that area in terms of a very strong regional economy but simultaneously a very   vulnerable economy It’s an area where manufacturing often runs double the national   average as a share of total employment; most of that is motor vehicle-related production     6/29-30/99 50   Auto companies and their various suppliers are by far the largest absolute employers   throughout that part of our region So employment levels and personal income growth   are very high and spending growth has been exceptionally strong   But bankers increasingly express their worries about personal bankruptcies; the   stories about people who were current and then suddenly file for bankruptcy have   returned They say it is fairly common to have two adults in a household using the entire   paychecks from all four of their jobs, including all the overtime they could get, to service   their debts So when there is a loss of one of the jobs or loss of overtime or illness or   divorce, then that’s it They can no longer service the debts One banker emphasized the   condition of his customers this way He said he is not worried about withdrawals around   the time of the century date change because his customers don’t have any money in their   accounts to withdraw   They said that their business customers continue to experience   difficulty hiring, especially for entry-level positions The bankers said they are often   paying 18-year old teller trainees $11 to $12 an hour Then they can’t hold the   inexperienced people long enough to take advantage of their productivity after the period   of training, but it has been impossible to recruit experienced people   We also did a roundup of what was going on in tourism in the region, so if you   haven’t been there recently, come on up! [Laughter] Given that the south shore of Lake   Erie is a major tourist destination [laughter] and tourism companies are a big employer   there, we talked to people at Cedar Point, Geauga Lake, Sea World, and King’s Island   Park to see what they were doing Ticket prices are typically up 10 to 15 percent this   year and these places are having a great deal of difficulty in recruiting employees Cedar   Point had openings for 3,700 summer workers and in June they are running still about   200 short of their goal They went to Europe, again hoping to recruit 500 workers as they   did last year, and were able to get only about 350 They increased the amount of   subsidies for housing and for employee and employee family discounts And they   increased their season-end retention bonus by 50 percent; a worker receives $650 if he or   she stays the full 14 weeks of the summer season We hear similar stories from the other   parks Sea World and Geauga Lake contacts said that a significant number--about 1/5 of     6/29-30/99 51   the total--of their concession stands haven’t been opened and probably will not open this   summer   Bankers are reporting strong loan demand for all types of loans and in addition are   expressing concerns about credit quality Some of our examiners also are starting to say   that they are seeing very early signs of things they are not comfortable with   The ag sector is in very good shape in the sense that the planting was all done on   time, conditions for planting were excellent, and since then we’ve had just the right   amount of moisture and sunshine So, as one said All the farmers need to do now is sit   and wait for a drought or a flood someplace else! But even the low crop prices are not   restraining the price of farmland One banker said that he has customers who recently   have been acquiring new land at $2,000 to $2,500 an acre that will not produce cash flow   of $1,000 an acre at current crop prices So buyers are either counting on commodity   prices to go up or they plan to use the land for something else I’m not sure what the   logic of that is Also, for the first time in a while for us, we heard reports of foreign   investors--Swiss and Canadians in particular--buying farmlands or even raw wooded   lands That may reflect capital preservation efforts on the part of some of the foreign   investors   Our Small Business Advisory Council described commercial real estate activity,   particularly shopping centers, as booming One referred to an “explosion” of orders in   the spring for hot tubs and in-ground and above-ground swimming pools The problem is   that labor shortages make it difficult to get the work done So he went to Miami to   recruit 20 workers, some with families--he claims they have green cards--and besides   moving them to Columbus, Ohio, he provided them with housing as well We also heard   reports of rising medical costs, all of that usual thing   In the building sector, we were told that framing contractors weren’t even bidding   on some proposed new projects Additionally, for some projects they had planned to start   this summer it now looks as if they may not even start digging or preparing the sites  We   did hear some reports, especially in machine tools, of some new orders coming in from   Asia and Latin America So that may be an early hint of positive developments there   We were told that a number of fast food restaurants in both central and northwest   Ohio are often now open for drive-through business only They don’t open the eat-in     6/29-30/99 52   facility because of a lack of staff So I assume that, quality adjusted, one might call that a   price increase   A director in the national retail trade business said that this year is going to be   phenomenal and will go down as a banner year for retailer earnings He said retailers are   worried that they are going to go into year-end with stocks that are too low to meet what   they think is going to be seasonally very strong demand for clothing and other   nondurables   We heard a lot of reports of food processing costs--refrigeration, transportation,   container costs and so forth--rising fairly strongly A director who specializes in   came into this year expecting 800 number and Internet sales for   all of 1999 to range between $300,000 and $400,000 but already had booked $5 million   in such sales in the first five months of this year Whether that is a reflection of   aggregate demand or a shift in demand, I don’t know She feels that discretionary   income is high and rising very rapidly   Also, we heard reports that the structural steel industry is improving Industry   contacts said, in fact, that right now order books are full through the third quarter and that   because of large construction projects, especially stadiums, they expect to finish the year   with a full book   Turning to the national economy, I wouldn’t know what assumption to make   about the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year in any case While   it is no doubt true that Y2K will foster some buying to accumulate stocks of various   nondurable goods in particular, I don’t know how I would go about making assumptions   regarding consumer behavior or business expenditures for durable goods or plant or   equipment or even recruiting and hiring decisions If Y2K gets to be a media event with   the degree of hysteria or concern about the future on the order of what we saw in the fall   of 1990 looking toward Desert Storm and the Gulf War, we could have a very substantial   negative impulse in the fourth quarter And we would have to wait to see if that then   reverses in the first quarter I wouldn’t know how to quantify the magnitude of that I   can see it going both ways Also, if people want to enter the year-end period with a high   degree of liquidity, that does imply, other things the same, a slower rate of spending for     6/29-30/99 53   something So Y2K may influence the balance sheets and cash flows of firms as well as   of households in a way that I wouldn’t know how to put into a forecast   I have commented over the last year, year-and-a-half about the very rapid growth   of personal income In the spring of 1998 we were looking at Greenbook projections of   personal income decelerating into the 3½ to 4 percent range and it has run 1 to 1½   percentage points faster than that And that’s great, as long as it stems from income that   people are really earning based on what it is they produce  I heard last week--and I   haven’t had a chance to follow-up to see if it can be documented--that right now we’re   experiencing an inflow on the order of 1 million workers a year from foreign countries,   augmenting the labor force Now, as for how many of those are illegal and how many are   permanent, I don’t have any information But the total is a very large number--much   larger than I would have thought--and it certainly would contribute to rapid personal   income growth   We can see what the effect of the rapid growth of demand is on the domestic   economy and, of course, we can see it in the rapid growth of imports at a rate that I   certainly consider unsustainable I take that as the strongest piece of evidence of excess   aggregate demand in the domestic economy, and at some point that surely has to be   reversed So I do continue to be concerned about too much demand chasing what we’re   able to produce in the longer run in this economy   I have a couple of comments on inflation We continue to do research on various   measures of inflation We track the median CPI; we’ve also been looking at the regular   CPI but using PCE weights While the level of the latter measure may not be statistically   significant, it has moved up appreciably In the first five months of this year it ran right   at 3 percent, even with the drop we had in May Now, for the first time in a couple of   years, that measure is running ahead of both the regular CPI and the median CPI that we   track So, that measure is another way of looking at the concerns about inflation that we   have All I’m saying about it at this point is that it’s moving in an upward direction   compared to what it has done in the last two years   One more comment on inflation numbers  We began a project some time ago,   and are building a track record now, with our own consumer price outlook surveys to   compare with the Michigan survey’s perceptions of current inflation and forecasts of     6/29-30/99 54   future inflation Our surveys have some different questions and a lot more detail in terms   of the breakdown on respondents First, both perceptions of current inflation and   expectations about future inflation have moved up sharply It’s the direction that’s   important, not the levels, as far as I’m concerned at this moment Some of the   information that is starting to become available on the breakdown of income levels,   education levels, males versus females we’re not sure how to interpret Consistently,   females’ perceptions of current inflation and future inflation run 1 to 1½ percentage   points ahead of males’ perceptions We don’t have an explanation for it We even break   the data down as to whether the respondent is a member of a household and whether he   or she is working or not working outside the home So, without getting into too much   detail about levels right now, since the beginning of the year all of these measures have   turned upward in each successive survey   Thank you I agree with your recommendation of not changing   the ranges As far as discussing it in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, and perhaps as a   way to initiate more public dialogue about these issues, I would ask that some weight be   given to the idea that in industries where we know productivity gains have been   extraordinary--in the computer and communications industries, for example--prices are   falling, as they should And the wealth gains to businesses and households are   manifested in an increase in the purchasing power of money because those prices are   falling The idea of price stability more broadly means that we would then accept more   rapid increases in prices in other areas where there are no productivity gains so that the   average stays the same, and it’s not clear to me that that’s optimal   I hope so, too!   Thank you Don, the discussion about wealth, permanent   income, measures of income and savings and all that in a domestic context is certainly   very important We’re seeing more focus not on the creation of wealth but on the sharing   of the wealth in a domestic context We saw in the Chairman’s JEC testimony recently   some questions related to that--for example, is everybody participating equally?  These   are important comments, politically driven important comments When the context is   broadened to the global economy, the issues become much more complex in that the   United States has been creating a great deal of wealth in recent years We have our own   interests about sharing the wealth and the distribution of income But in a global context,   in most of the places where we look at wealth and measure it we would say that they have   been destroying wealth The effect of the destruction has been most severe on those with   lower incomes--Latin America, Asia, and so on--worsening their income distribution     6/29-30/99 77   Now, suppose the rest of the world, not only the old industrial world of Europe   but Asia and Latin America, starts to get its act together a bit, or maybe a lot--whether   that involves the enforcement of property rights, tax reform, tax reduction, or   deregulation--and they start getting the keys right to create wealth Suppose they also   address some of their other problems about the distribution and sharing of that wealth   Under circumstances where the rest of the world finally starts to perform well, what   implications do you see for the United States?   May I ask a follow-up question on that?   Maybe this question is for Peter Fisher since it has to do with the   markets; I don’t know Wouldn’t a switch to symmetry suggest that the risks are in fact   balanced?   Thank you I certainly agree that a move today is appropriate   As far as the strength of the action and the way it’s interpreted, I’d prefer to do that with   or without discount rate increases Since I believe that a stronger action now is   appropriate, I hope the Board will consider the issue of the discount rate on behalf of my   directors anyway   Unlike Al Broaddus, though, I’m going to disagree on the issue of the symmetry   I favor a permanent move to a symmetric directive [Laughter]   The happy state of affairs is one where the collective view of the   group, when we meet, is that the risks are in fact balanced I prefer symmetry in our   behavior more than in our words, and it troubles me when there’s asymmetry in our   behavior with or without asymmetry in our words Last fall, when the opinion of the   Committee shifted toward the view that the risks were on the downside, we moved very   promptly over a fairly short period of time to a position where the collective judgment of   the Committee was that the risks were in fact balanced I think we should be symmetric   about that on the upside as well When the collective view of the Committee is that the   risks are on the upside, we should move as promptly, at meetings or between meetings, to   get back to where we feel that the risks are balanced   As far as the announcement of symmetry/asymmetry, I think Professor Eisenberg   has bitten again, or as the British would say “Goodhart’s law has hit us again” We and   most other central banks have known that announcing exchange rate targets or levels or   something of that nature is a rather foolish thing to do; it comes back to haunt us We   have learned with monetary targeting that if the wisdom of the market is that they know   the trigger point--that if some growth rate of some money measure is epsilon above or   below a certain level, that is going to trigger a policy action--it isn’t going to work   That’s because it doesn’t elicit the behavior in the marketplace that would occur if they   didn’t know what the trigger was   Imagine the absurdity if we were to announce this afternoon that the Committee   voted today to raise the funds rate ¼ point at its next meeting on August 24 and,   therefore, we plan to save the airfare and the travel time and just not show up then   because we’ve already decided we are going to do that Well, that’s rather absurd So I   think announcing something that is interpreted by the market as meaning that we have   already decided to raise rates at our next meeting, as I think the May announcement was   interpreted, gets us into an undesirable position I can tell you already that I don’t want   to go into the October 5 meeting with a predisposition to raise rates because I don’t want   to be blamed for the crash of the stock market in October! [Laughter] I also know that I   want to get to the December meeting--and possibly even the November meeting, but I’m   much more certain about the December meeting--clearly feeling that the risks are   balanced If anything, we ought to feel that we have as much chance of lowering rates as     6/29-30/99 102   raising them once we get to December and into the next year We ought to be ready to go   in either direction We know there’s going to come a time when things will again be   changing rapidly in a downward direction, and I would prefer to enter that environment   with the risks in balance We do not have balanced risks right now I think we need to   get to a position where we’re comfortable that the risks are symmetric as soon as we can  "
6409,1999-08-24," Thank you I have a question along the same lines In view of all the   other things that are in place--the special liquidity facility and all the things we are going to   be doing to make sure that everybody knows we will be making markets and operating to   the full extent--I can still see some concerns among individual market players I’m not sure   whether you’re worried more about bank dealers or nonbank dealers; my guess is nonbank   dealers And I think they still would be concerned about the distribution of liquidity It’s   not that the aggregate is a problem, but rather the distribution, with everyone trying to get   through the door at one time You’ve used a few words that get near but don’t quite answer   what I’ve been puzzling about You’ve said “auction;” you’ve said “insurance;” you’ve   talked about the pricing But auction implies supply as well as demand, so you have to   decide on an amount you’re going to auction Then there has to be a demand So describe   for me, and for everybody else I guess, how somebody in a dealer operation would explain,   to whomever they have to get approval from, that they want to bid at the Fed’s auction to   buy an option What is it that they’re gaining and how much should they be willing to pay   for it?     8/24/99 25   May I ask a follow-up question?  You mentioned already that, in their   scenario, when the currency is going out banks are also going to be thinking about that   currency coming back in What are they going to do with it? Are they going to get to count   it toward meeting their reserve requirements?  I can see those in the banking industry doing   their own exercises--seeing times when they are concerned about adequate liquidity and   they want some insurance and then seeing periods of excess liquidity and wondering how to   get rid of it I can imagine both It seems to me that it would be important in your   conversations with the dealers to ask them their ideas about quantities and prices and so on   I’d also want to find out if we offer this and if they buy this insurance--these rights to get   liquidity or put liquidity to us--what is it that they otherwise would have done that they will   not be doing as a consequence of our making this available I say that because we are going   to alter their behavior from their own contingency planning that assumed this program   didn’t exist   I have a couple of questions, Mike, on different topics First, on   inventories, your remarks this morning as well as what I read in the Greenbook surprised me   a bit by suggesting that there is a lack of anecdotal reports on inventory problems We’ve   all been reporting on certain shortages, for example that there are no 2x4s around and so on   We had noted in our Beigebook report that in the auto sector certain   models simply aren’t available So my staff looked at the Beigebook reports of other   Reserve Banks, and a couple of them also cited drains from retail inventories One of my   directors reports to us regularly about the retail sector, and he has been saying for a few   months that major retailers are increasingly worried that their efforts to build stock are being   aborted by those darn consumers who keep clearing out their shelves! He believes retailers   are going into the year-end period with significantly less inventory than they wanted I   always think that means they are inevitably going to overshoot, as they find themselves   trying to catch up to some level and miss it So I was just wondering how confident you are   that you’ve got the picture right on inventory It seems to me a significant risk to the   forecast   The other question relates to inflation, anticipating that at our October   meeting you are going to give us a first look at your forecast for 2001 As I look at this   Greenbook forecast, which goes out to the fourth quarter of 2000, your forecast for the CPI   excluding energy seems to be on a track that will produce a number over 3 percent in 2001   Am I right about that?   Thank you, Mr Chairman On cars, trucks, and steel, which are all   very important in our District, I can just say “ditto” to what Mike Moskow said All are very   strong in every dimension Construction in the District also is very strong   is involved with the construction unions said that the best sign of the prosperity in   construction labor markets is that the local breweries all seem to be expanding! He   regularly reports to us now about warnings being given by the AFL-CIO that wages of   workers are not being kept up He’s starting to stress what he considers to be the need for a   catch-up in compensation So, at least from that one source, there’s a suggestion that a bit   more labor militancy might be forthcoming   On the steel side, the strikes settled with increases in the range of 8 to 10 percent over   the full three-year period and that sounds pretty good But they doubled the pensions So   they avoided the bigger problem of disruption by promises about the future rather than the     8/24/99 58   present Our directors are telling us that there will not be a strike in the auto industry--that   Ford, which is the target, will settle They believe Ford will settle and then Chrysler and   GM and the others will just fall in line   Let me skip some of the other points in my prepared notes because it would just be   repeating what a number of other people have mentioned In labor markets we are hearing   about a couple of new wrinkles One is a “show-up” bonus If the workers come to work   five consecutive days they get a bonus! [Laughter] And one firm pays a daily bonus for   workers who show up in the morning on time and finish a full shift That is probably not   showing up in wage and ECI data One banker asserted that we are experiencing a lot of   wage inflation, but it does not show up in the figures because businesses that he’s familiar   with are paying the same or somewhat more for considerably less qualified people than   previously Somebody earlier mentioned that schools were losing people to the private   sector, but the bankers in our area claim that they are losing people to the schools, that the   school districts and local governments are flush with funds from tax receipts and are bidding   aggressively for people Nevertheless, the schools opened for the fall term with shortages in   teaching positions and in some staff positions and a reported “severe” shortage of substitute   teachers   We took an in-depth look at what is going on in labor markets in the health care sector   Health care is a huge industry in the District, with the Cleveland Clinic, University   Hospitals, and others in Cleveland and Pittsburgh as well You may have seen the Wall   Street Journal story yesterday about the health quality program in our city that the Cleveland   Clinic managed to kill off That sort of thing is not the real problem The problem is that   they do not have enough people We have been told of shortages throughout the District of   nurses and other staff to support the hospitals One contact claimed that it is an ongoing   crisis One hospital said it had gone to a work schedule of three 12-hour days with four   days off for the nurses, and that getting floor coverage in hospitals on a 24-hour basis is   becoming increasingly problematic The hiring coordinator at the Cleveland Clinic said the   shortage is the worst she has seen in 20 years  Others, including Meridian Health Systems,   described the situation similarly They say it is not just a shortage of nurses but of support   staff as well     8/24/99 59   When one talks to people in the health care industry it is not uncommon for them to   use words like acute and critical, but they are usually talking about their patients In this   case they are talking about their staff levels Ohio State University reported that its critical   care unit and operating rooms are not adequately staffed with competent people So they are   using retention bonuses, referral bonuses, and premium pay for those working overtime,   special hours, or weekends The VA hospital said that the shortage of staff is so severe that   they’ve decided to close some inpatient units, such as their long-term care unit, simply   because they could not staff it If that’s not bad enough--probably other areas of the   country are experiencing this, too--a race is going on between Rite-Aid and CVS to see who   can overbuild the most and the fastest and they are bidding away the pharmacists on hospital   staffs Our VA contact said that pharmacists are getting $8,000 to $10,000 more in salary to   move to the retail side   On the national economy, if I were focusing on the domestic side alone, I’d say that   the risk is on the upside on inflation and that policy is not balanced for that risk Yet the   international dimension--and Bill McDonough described in some detail the political risks--is   where I think all of the risks are in the other direction I agree with Karen Johnson’s   description about the near-term economic outlook in Japan, Europe, and elsewhere But   with that shaky coalition in Japan, it is very hard to have confidence about what is going to   happen there I think Chancellor Schroeder faces extraordinary challenges over the next   couple of months in Europe, and what happens is going to be extremely important for the   outlook for the rest of Europe The Italians are certainly not going to attack pension reform   if the Germans do not come through with solid reform The good news about the ongoing   saga in Russia is So,   that’s the silver lining   We will have to be prepared at all times for an easing action that could be necessary   because of some development on the external side I would rather go into that situation   feeling that monetary policy is positioned where it ought to be in terms of our domestic risk,   so we can respond to unforecastable international developments when they happen   A large and rapidly growing trade deficit or current account deficit   says to me that demand for products in the United States has been growing at an ever faster   rate relative to the pace at which we can produce them So far, we’ve been blessed by the   savings of the rest of the world, as poor as the rest of the world is, coming to our benefit   That is unsustainable That will turn around They will want to take their savings home and   we will need to start making our savings available to them That means US domestic   demand must slow Current policy is not positioned to accomplish that   If the move today were designed to signal that we’re on hold for the balance of the   year, my preference would probably be to go ahead and do 50 basis points and say this is a   “we’re done” type action That is really not my first choice, though My first choice is what   Jack Guynn has suggested, a move on the discount rate I think that is more important I’ve   thought about an increase of 25 basis points on both rates but I like his idea of a catch-up, so   I’d favor 25 basis points on the funds rate and 50 basis points on the discount rate  "
6432,1999-10-05," Thank you To convey the story of our District it is often tempting to say,   “It’s motor vehicles” If motor vehicles are booming, the economy is booming And as you all   know, motor vehicles are booming Like Mike Moskow, I was hearing reports from directors,   especially those from steel companies, on how they characterized the auto contracts They were   talking about them as being generous or even extravagant But unlike the views Mike encountered,   they were claiming that the auto contracts were pattern-setting, and they are concerned about the   effects The AFL-CIO is putting out some talking points for the press about how generous this   package was That has been disturbing to small business owners because their employees see that   Besides, they live next door to some of the autoworkers benefiting from those contracts     10/5/99 29   One very large company headquartered in the District that supplies the motor vehicle   industry and housing markets worldwide had what I considered a very strong report about   increasing export demand combined with reduced import competition It means that they have the   best opportunity for raising prices they have seen in years The instruction has gone out throughout   the organization that they are to work to raise prices at any and every opportunity They do see   their own raw materials prices rising, but they also feel that they’re going to be able to pass those   increases along   Labor cost pressures continue to intensify We hear the same kinds of stories about benefit   costs increasing at double-digit rates that everybody has been talking about The general sense is   that, as far as health care costs are concerned, it has been bad in 1999 and it will be worse next   year People mention severe shortages of nurses, aides, and other health care workers Those in the   health care industry talk about the packages they have to pay to attract people or to retain workers   One executive at a small manufacturing company said it got hit hard by the increase in its health   care costs--he used the same 21 percent figure that you did, Mike--and expects the increase in the   next year to be higher if anything   As an indication of what’s going on in construction, a comment was made that the demand   has been so strong that union contractors are now subcontracting to nonunion firms just to try to get   the work done One small businessman in the mid-Ohio area, a supplier of luxury consumer goods   --swimming pools, hot tubs, patio furniture, and the like--said they had a very strong June They   saw a leveling off at what they considered to be a very high level in July and August, but then in   September sales took off like gangbusters It was surprising to them, given the nature of the   products they sell, to see September come in so strong Another company that supplies the   trucking industry said that it is expecting to finish out this year with about an 8 percent increase in   sales and is budgeting for an increase next year in the 10 to 15 percent range   As we’ve done before at this time of year, we took a look at what has been going on in the   race horse auction business At Keeneland this year gross sales for September were up 37 percent   and at $253 million reached an all-time record for any thoroughbred sale anywhere in the world   The average price was up 30 percent and the number of horses sold was up 5 percent The prior   record for the number of horses sold at $1million or more was 17 This year they sold 23, with one   horse going at $39 million--the highest ever recorded I wanted to probe a little deeper, beyond the   issue of prices, to find out where the buyers were coming from Were they all people from   Microsoft or Wall Street?  I was told that after a slump last year, there was a rebound in Japanese     10/5/99 30   purchases Also evident was a return of demand out of the Middle East In total, where the source   could be identified, foreigners spent $52 million in the September sales this year versus $32 million   last year, for a large gain   Some of the issues that came up in our Advisory Council meetings caused us to look into   Y2K planning in a different way than we had before Companies, both banks and others, were   saying that they didn’t expect to have cash around for their own operations or to meet employees’   needs for cash They plan to send their employees to check cashing facilities So we decided to   contact the check cashing facilities and found none that is planning to add to its currency holdings   They don’t view that as being the business they are in and they don’t expect to do so One simply   said, “If we run out of cash, we’ll just close the door for a few days” Another Y2K-related item   that came from an Advisory Council member who is in the warehousing business caught our   attention He said that Proctor and Gamble has been moving through the area taking up additional   warehouse space because it wants to accumulate several months of extra inventory by the time we   get to December   Let me report one more example, in a somewhat different area, where the idea that there’s   no pricing power is becoming an increasingly quaint notion We looked at tuition increases at   public and private universities, and they are quite sharp All of the public universities in Ohio that   we contacted said that their tuition charges were up by 4 percent or more The big three-­  University of Akron, Ohio State, and Ohio University--were all up 6 percent They said they   would have done more but several years ago the state legislature imposed a maximum tuition   increase of 6 percent in one year, so they’ll just have to raise tuition prices again next year   Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh raised the tuition for entering freshmen by 113 percent and that for   returning sophomores, juniors, and seniors by 35 percent   On the national economy, it’s nice to have a Greenbook forecast that final demand, or   nominal spending, will decelerate somewhat next year and the year beyond But we’ve had that   forecast before and there is just nothing in the numbers to suggest that that is going to happen   Growth in nominal spending this year is not just a lot above the rate forecast a year ago, it has   doubled That may have been because of the pessimism coming from Asia But even if we go   back six months, it’s much stronger than what was expected then Again we have a forecast that   the expansion is going to slow down But that is just a forecast and I can’t see anything in the   recent data that supports it There certainly is nothing in any of the monetary statistics or the credit     10/5/99 31   statistics we’re seeing So I’m very skeptical that we’ve already calibrated policy to insure that   nominal demand slows to a rate consistent with nonaccelerating inflation   Don, you began your remarks and then referred again later to the point that   aggregate demand and aggregate supply, if anything, look better balanced now than before You   cited, if I heard you right, evidence of balance in the data that have been released on labor markets   and price markets If I were doing assessments of risks to the domestic economy, let alone other   risks in other places in the world as I once did, I would not have looked at these data as indicative   of a finely balanced situation In looking at the numbers for the past and at the projections for the   next two years, I would note how much of nominal spending is consumption, the negative saving   rate, the growth in credit, and the growth in money I would examine all the variables one might   want to look at and I would say that there are some serious questions about the stance of policy in   this country, and I would say the economy is not well balanced   I’m not at all convinced that the unemployment rate has to rise, but I am   convinced that the trade balance cannot stay where it is, let alone continue to rise Other people   said it better than I did We need to see this trend reversed At some point the United States needs   to stop being a net absorber of world savings and become a net supplier of savings to the rest of the   world   Thank you Let me start first with this question of symmetry or   asymmetry I think everybody knows my views on that, but I’d just like to remind everyone that   there was an action in August following our adoption of a symmetric directive on June 30th So   having a symmetric directive now doesn’t preclude an action My basic assumption is that there   will be enough speeches and press commentary and quotes for us to signal markets if that’s   necessary It seems to happen all the time   On the question of policy objectives, though, it’s one thing when we have a high inflation   environment--whether it’s a high, single-digit inflation rate let alone a double-digit rate--to bring it   down using rhetoric like price stability, zero inflation, and other terms like that I think it’s quite   different when we have achieved an environment that by most statistical measures is somewhere in   the zone at least of what those words are taken to mean That makes it more difficult to try to find   a way of communicating why we do things when we do That’s because I think we mostly would   agree that taking anyone’s statistical measure as an objective of policy and saying raise this, plus or   minus, would be the wrong thing to do   I agree that we’re having a productivity surprise that is very positive and significant I hope   it continues And I’m very willing to base policy on the assumption that it’s true But I also know   that it’s not evenly distributed throughout the economy Certain sectors or industries have very   pronounced favorable productivity surprises--computers, telecommunications, and the like Others   have none at all, like the marina where I keep my boat, which raised my fee 10 percent And some     10/5/99 58   even have a negative--declining productivity--because of a decline in the quality of the labor pool   they have to work with and so forth All that is no doubt true   I also know that when there is a favorable productivity surprise, it’s like a bumper crop   We’re going to have a relative price effect Relative price effects can come about either from a   decline in the price of the products with favorable productivity surprises or an increase in the price   of things with no productivity rise or, more likely, some combination of the two The question is   Do we have overall monetary stability when some prices--on items where there is no favorable   productivity--rise?  Clearly not Under a gold standard, all of the wealth gains are manifested and   distributed in higher purchasing power of money; when you don’t have price rises at the marina,   you have price declines at the establishment where you have coffee   Now, overall, I wouldn’t worry about all this too much except for the intermediation   process The way the credit markets work through the banking system, I worry about asset price   increases in a relative price sense--relative to goods prices--when those assets are financed in ways   that make those price rises unsustainable And though I know that a second derivative can be   positive for a while, I also know that the second derivative for nothing in the universe is positive   forever It must always go to zero if not negative So I worry about the second derivatives of asset   prices being positive--financed by the banking industry or pension funds or life insurance   companies--and the prices getting to unsustainable levels When that inevitable point comes where   the second derivative must go to zero or negative for asset prices, people will find out that they’ve   made a mistake and then we will have a credit crunch We will have a debt/deficit cycle that   becomes a problem So overall monetary stability in the zone we’re in still leaves us with a   challenge Even if the projection for the CPI over the forecast horizon were 1 percent and not   rising, I would still say that we have a challenge of achieving overall monetary stability that is   sustainable   I have a question about something that wasn’t raised in the discussion   because I didn’t think about it until after I listened to everybody It may be too late to raise it for   today but it may be useful for next time Without in any way prejudging whether the Committee   would want to take an action in November, what would be the implications of removing the   asymmetry from the directive in November?  Or does that matter?  We could be in the situation we   were in on June 30th where the action and the words seemed to convey different messages and we   got varying market responses  "
6454,1999-11-16," Mike, you mentioned oil prices spiking When I was reading the   Greenbook, I was struck by the fact that in the very week in which oil prices were spiking, you   were writing down a forecast that has the price going back down by $5 a barrel, 25 percent or so   Oil prices are among the many things that I have absolutely no confidence in my ability to   predict, so I will go with your forecast But I am curious about how sensitive your inflation   outlook is to that, because there are a lot of volatile personalities who still have powerful   positions in places in the world that produce oil So, who can predict what will happen?   Suppose we just draw a straight line and assume that for the next two years, the forecast horizon,   oil prices remain the same as they are today What would be the implications of that?   Thanks The general sense of both business and labor contacts in the   District is that the boom continues and that it will be even stronger next year I have been   expecting our region of the country to be among the first to show signs of flattening out And I   still think that’s a reasonable expectation, given the composition of the regional economy; at   some point, for example, the slowing of auto sales in the last couple of months should lead to   production adjustments But it still basically looks and feels like a supply-constrained economy   Business people complain that they could be doing more if only there were more warm bodies   around that they could put into positions of all types The idea of caution is almost totally absent   from the discussions we have with bankers and other business people In the last two meetings   of both the Community Bank and the Business Advisory Councils we have asked the participants   to discuss the conditions under which they would think about the possibility of a recession on the   horizon And they just dismiss it as utterly implausible and not a fruitful thing to spend time     11/16/99 17   thinking and talking about We tried to press the idea, especially on the bankers, that there is a   downside risk And some do admit that they know of deals that others are doing that they have   walked away from, suggesting perhaps an element of caution someplace--but not among their   competitors at least I find that very troubling   It may work out that as the domestic absorption of goods produced in our region of the   country levels out, some international demand will pick up and that will keep the level of activity   in our area more or less even But I still think the most likely scenario is that we are going to get   back to what in the 1980s some of us called the soufflé economy--one that is rather soft in the   middle and firm around the edges Activity up and down the West Coast and the East Coast may   stay hotter longer And if we see some weakness in our area, that will make it difficult for those   of us in the middle part of the country to have a proper perspective on the appropriate national,   let alone international, monetary policy   As a note on one of Karen’s comments about Japan, one of our contacts from an   industrial company just returned from Japan and said he detected a dramatic change, in a positive   direction, in the mood he encountered there His firm had a large pickup in orders for roller   bearings for industrial inputs   All sectors of the labor market continue to be very strong One of our construction   contacts said that their union views the auto company contracts as a problem because they   commit the auto companies to hire apprentices, which is going to draw on the pool of workers   that otherwise would have been considered available for construction work So, there is some   sort of rivalry there Honda motor company announced that they will not build a major plant in   Ohio after all Until now all of their production has been in Ohio They said there is an   inadequate pool of labor in Ohio, so they are going to build in Alabama instead, right next to   where Boeing is building an enormous operation So we’ll see how they sort out the workers   down there We hear more stories of fast food restaurants going to a drive-through only   operation and suspending their eat-in service because of labor problems We are told that   contractors in the region are hoping to avoid the usual winter curtailment of activity because they   are concerned that if they were to shut down for the usual two or three months the workers   simply would not return in the spring One report from a construction union in Ohio now   estimates that there are 25,000 Latino construction workers in the state alone and that at least 50     11/16/99 18   percent of them are illegal And the complaints about higher health care costs occur without   exceptions, really   Retail trade overall is reported to be strong, although the Bob Evans restaurant chain   said that they have experienced a sharp slowing in traffic recently They relate it to substantial   increases in their menu prices that they felt they had to put through because of higher wages,   higher health care costs, higher transportation costs, and unfilled vacancies in their restaurants   They boosted menu prices and people stopped coming; so their earnings fell and their stock price   fell In manufacturing, one director said his firm is in the early stages of getting some price relief   in major industries He thought that was a good thing He said industrial companies have been   put through an earnings squeeze in the past year or two and are now going to find it easier to   improve profit margins   In conversations with directors as well as advisory council members and others, the   suggestion that inflation over the next year or two might remain the same as it has been over the   last year or two is simply not credible The expectation that inflation is moving up just does not   have any dissenters And a surprising number think that that’s not a bad thing If I say to people   that a reasonable forecast for the consumer price index for the next year might be that it will rise   a percentage point or so faster than in the last twelve months or so, there is almost no reaction to   that   A frustration has been that some bankers--and maybe a few others, but it is   particularly worrisome about bankers--think an increase in the federal funds rate will have an   adverse effect on interest-sensitive industries such as housing and autos It’s a sort of interest   rate push idea that a rise in the overnight interbank rate pushes up all interest rates and, therefore,   will hurt real economic activity which they care about If you say to them that if it turns out later   that the funds rate was artificially held down and inflation accelerates and that is what really   hurts housing and autos and other interest-sensitive sectors--because intermediate- and long-term   interest rates will rise more because of inflation premiums--it falls on deaf ears It is simply not   a story that resonates well at all  I think our biggest problem, if it is necessary to tighten in order   to contain rising inflationary pressures, is how we explain the rationale behind such an action and   find people who support it and applaud it   I agree with your recommendation on the funds rate and, of course,   with the symmetric directive I was pleased to hear and interested in your analysis of how   productivity changes, especially in a positive direction, can have secondary effects if one puts   that acceleration into a larger general equilibrium context I know the staff has been doing   research on this I have been reading some of their work and I would encourage them to do more   so that we can flesh that whole idea out more fully It’s important because I believe that it’s   affecting not just the United States, but if we’re lucky--and I think we all would hope it will turn   out this way--the rest of the world may yet experience similar kinds of things And   understanding how the wealth creating process affects both goods prices and asset prices I think   is going to be really important to us in the years ahead   As we saw in our actual deliberations earlier today, we need to take   into consideration the risk that later on down the road with new information we will find out that   we had the stance of policy calibrated wrong Even if we take an action with the expectation of   the risks being balanced in some way, the costs of changing are not symmetrical As we’ve seen   very often, we find it relatively easier to correct in one direction than the other  In part that is   because the pressure on us from the outside is asymmetrical and always will be asymmetrical   That’s a risk that I don’t think it would be useful to put out in a press release So I'm a   minimalist on this The least we can say about it the better, since we are not going to be talking   about this other risk of suddenly changing course when we get new information and find out   “oops,” we had it slightly wrong So, saying something about the balance with respect to likely   policy actions I think is going too far Saying something about the balance of risks to the   outlook for the economy and inflation is the most that I would like to see us do at this stage  "
6479,1999-12-21," Thank you In recent reports from directors, the focus has been as   much on the outlook for the next year as it has on current or recent conditions, especially     12/21/99 21   among those people who indicated they were in their profit-planning cycles or putting   together business plans We questioned them about the specifics they were putting in their   business plans One company that owns newspapers throughout the country said they   expect ad revenue to be significantly stronger in 2000 than in the current year But they are   budgeting a 10 percent increase in newsprint costs and an 18 percent increase in corporate-  wide medical costs And they expect the rise in their total labor costs to be in the 6 to 7   percent range A communications company reported what they refer to as an “explosion” of   demand for communications equipment Growth in data transmissions is currently running   10 times that of voice transmissions, and for the year 2000 they are budgeting for a 40   percent increase in fiber mileage that they expect to put into place Previously, for the   current year they had expected a fourth-quarter slowdown in orders and shipments because   of the so-called lockdown effect They said it did not occur The quote is “If there was a   lockdown effect, it only delayed a further acceleration in telecommunications equipment   shipments” And they will be watching for early signs to confirm that next year   A company that basically makes items out of specialty metals--they supply the   aerospace industry and the medical profession--said it expects most of its growth in the next   few years to be in exports to Asia and Europe Some recent signs of such growth proved of   interest compared to what they had been seeing over the last couple of years A major   supplier worldwide of safety equipment had an abysmal summer but reported that exports   from September to November were great and they do not believe the improvement was   Y2K-related They said that they had been concerned that the improvement could be a blip,   but they don’t think so now Their foreign orders were picking up nicely and they expect   next year to be even better   The outlook for construction spending and employment in the region is reported to   be one of continued strength but it involves mostly public spending on the highway   infrastructure and the kinds of projects that Tom Hoenig also mentioned It has been   asserted by some of our contacts that the recent leveling in residential construction in the   region reflects the lack of available labor, not the increase in mortgage rates They feel it is   really a deferral of residential construction because workers are not available In unionized   activity, our contacts say booming nonresidential construction has reduced the pool of   available residential construction workers They are simply being bid off to other kinds of     12/21/99 22   projects We hear more reports of companies delaying or canceling expansion plans for   warehouse facilities or for other distribution operations, mainly because of the lack of labor   We are told that some fast food restaurants in central Ohio have now gone to a weekends-  only policy because they simply do not have the staff to operate in the middle of the week   A western Pennsylvania company that produces air curtains reports that overall 1999   will be a record year They are now expecting the fourth quarter to be the strongest single   quarter they have ever had; the strength is in both domestic and foreign markets but the   pickup has been in foreign markets recently They think most of the growth in demand that   they are seeing stems from retro-fit projects, not new construction   Another company that is engaged in specialty food processing and distribution said   that they estimate their December sales will turn out to be 25 percent above last   December’s Over the course of this year their catalog sales have risen 20 percent and the   share that is from the Internet has accelerated dramatically In January of this year Internet   sales were 2 percent of catalog sales and in November they were 10 percent Their   corporate sales--pastries and other packaged foods that I would call luxury food items--rose   30 percent this year Most of that is for gifts to employees, customers, and suppliers   In the steel sector, the orders for the first quarter are reported to be good Price   increases in the range of $10 to $20 a ton were put into effect in the fourth quarter And   price increases ranging from $15 to $30 a ton have been announced for the first half of the   year; that would be about a 7 to 10 percent increase If they are fully implemented--some of   them don’t take effect until April 1st--that would leave the average level of steel prices about   5 percent below where they were a year and a half ago in July of 1998   Export demand for plastic-manufacturing equipment has recently picked up, and it is   expected that demand in 2000 will be stronger Again, it is said that most of the growth in   new orders is going to be from foreign markets They think Europe is picking up very   nicely and are hopeful about Asia   In the sports and entertainment sector, the average price of a ticket to an NBA game   on opening day this year was up 11 percent versus a year ago on opening day The average   ticket price for entertainment events this year at Gund Arena in Cleveland--mostly for music   performances--was 10 percent above 1998 Finally, let me cite one report on the labor   markets in the region We were told that in Pittsburgh this year the starting salary for a     12/21/99 23   worker with a bachelor’s degree in biology and with computer proficiency was $90,000   Thank you   Thank you My first choice would be that at 215 pm today we   issue a statement that says “Happy Holidays,” as I think Tom Hoenig was suggesting It   seems likely that in the very near future our directive language will no longer refer to likely   future policy actions but rather to the balance of risks in the economy If that is the case, I   don’t know why we would want to move from symmetry to asymmetry with respect to   future policy actions when we will never do that again To put out a symmetric directive   today does no harm I doubt that there is anybody in the world who doesn’t think that we   will have a very serious discussion at our meeting on February 1st and 2nd I cannot imagine     12/21/99 54   that that would be a surprise to anyone Everyone knows that meeting will be a tough one   There will be a lot of new information, and maybe even some reliable information, although   I don’t know about that So, I see nothing to be gained by putting out an asymmetric   directive I see potential negatives And I don’t see any negatives in putting out a   symmetric directive   Thank you We know, of course, that what matters from this point   forward over the next two years or longer is what we do, not what we say Whatever box   one wants to run monetary policy through, it’s our actions that influence economic activity,   inflation, growth, and so on, not the words that we use But it seems to me that we’ve   gotten ourselves in a situation this year where more and more focus has been on our words   and the transitory market reactions to our words and that has taken attention away from   what we do What mattered in 1998 was that we lowered the funds rate three times; what   mattered this year was that we raised the funds rate three times The reason I don’t like   Option 1 is the stress on both goals and the way that has been rephrased in the bracketed   expression to imply more strongly that the goals are separable, which I do not believe At a   time when we would vote for asymmetry toward tightening, I would want the directive to   say “weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflationary   pressures, which would cause economic weakness” It is increases in inflation that send   false signals to market participants, producers, and households, and weakens economic   growth The other option, to leave out any reference to inflation at all and say “weighted   mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness”--that’s asymmetry toward   ease, I guess--I don’t know when we would use this option I can’t imagine that we would   adopt that kind of directive unless we foresaw something like the Asian crisis, the Russian   default, or some other adverse shock In such a case I think we’d do what we believe is the   right thing to do--cut rates, as we did in 1998--rather than announce that we’ll think hard     12/21/99 68   about it at the next meeting I don’t see any benefit at all in trying to give these kinds of   signals about future meetings and future actions   May I ask a question just for clarification?   Suppose we had been operating under Option 1 at the October   meeting and had adopted an upward tilt--using the balance-of-risks language--and then at   the November meeting raised rates as we did Do you think we would have retained that tilt   with the balance-of-risks language or taken it off as we did under the old approach?   But to raise rates and then take off the balance of risks toward   higher inflation would seem peculiar  "
6502,2000-02-01,"  Thank you  I have a few questions on the international side and then,   if I may, a question on Dave Stockton’s presentation and the simulations on Chart 15     But first, Karen, on Chart 10  I think these kinds of simulations are interesting, but I   want to get you to say a bit more about a scenario that might at least be consistent with the   exercise that you went through here  We see a lot of references to the idea that the United States   has become a debtor nation now and that our external liabilities are growing  I’ve probably even   talked that way myself on occasion  But we know that a lot of the holdings by foreigners, the   source of the capital inflows--the counterpart to this large and maybe growing current account   deficit--consists of assets that from the perspective of these foreign investors are denominated in   dollars  We may think of some of it as debt, but to them it is an asset  And some of their   holdings are literally dollars  I would assume, the way the accounting is done, that if last year   foreigners increased their holdings of US currency by $30 billion--or whatever the number was   --that it is counted as part of our debt  So, that would be part of the financing that has been going   on    It is getting pretty big!  Depending on what the rest of the world does   with regard to so-called dollarization, it could get quite large  I don’t know how much the   Russians alone acquired last year  The other dollar-denominated assets that foreigners hold--   whether CDs or other types of deposits in our banks, mutual funds, debt securities, equities, or   other kinds of investment vehicles--are counted as part of our debt  The part that in a sense   really is our debt is what they buy of Uncle Sam’s debt or debt instruments of other governments   or corporations in the United States  That is debt, whether held by domestic or foreign investors,          34  and appropriately so  And to some extent we are on the receiving end of what on the basis of   anecdotal reports is an increasing volume of direct foreign investments of all kinds--acquisitions   of our companies including, for example, supermarket chains and banking chains, which may   increase too  Suppose we superimpose on your simulations two extremes  (1) that all of the   increase in foreign holdings of dollar-denominated assets really is Uncle Sam’s debt, or (2) the   other extreme, that it is all equity investments, portfolio investments, or direct investments of any   kind  Would we draw different conclusions about the implications for the exchange rate of the   dollar?    I know    Okay, I accept that--and there is nothing in this simulation that   suggests a change is imminent  Let me come at my question in a slightly different way, because   I’m trying to understand this better  Let’s start from the panel in the lower left where the   exercise involves an assumption that the dollar is devalued by 25 percent  My first reaction was   to say to myself, “Okay, that's a useful exercise to go through”  Then I started thinking about the   fact that if the dollar were declining by 25 percent in value over some time period, other   currencies would be rising by 25 percent against the dollar  And I can’t imagine any currency   for which that might actually happen    You'll never convince me    Maybe the Japanese are all Ricardians!  Let me ask Dave Stockton a   question about Chart 15, if I may  These are interesting scenarios  This gets back, I think, to          37  Governor Meyer’s comment on the simulation differences between other forecast models and the   staff’s model  Under your scenario 1 in the staff’s model, wouldn’t it be the case, at least with   partial analysis, that given the acceleration in productivity and the corresponding increase in real   GDP growth you would have a deceleration from the inherited rate of inflation corresponding to   that?  To the extent that does not occur, then you would have to have--and I guess the model   requires this--an acceleration in nominal spending  That says that you don’t get all of the   productivity gains in a lower price level over time--a lower rate of inflation on an ongoing basis--  but rather some of it produces an increase in final demand  And that increase in demand has to   be financed  So, is it implicit in this that there is an accommodative policy on our part?  Either   money growth accelerates and all the credit comes along to finance the greater spending or   velocity must change  What happens to make these things come together?    Okay  But--and I think this is a very important point--the simulation   does not allow the real interest rate to move up to the equilibrium level because you don't let the          38  inflation rate come down  That is the way the model works  We don’t get that automatic   increase in the real rate that would come along with the deceleration of inflation, and therefore   the real rate has to rise out in the future to get things back into balance    Okay, thank you    I’m just volunteering to start the discussion    Banks in the District have reported that both commercial and consumer loan demand   remained strong in nearly all the early weeks of the new year  In the mortgage area, while   refinancing activity has dried up completely, mortgage loan applications jumped sharply in the   past two weeks, we are told  One banker said he thinks mortgage loan demand is being   stimulated by people's belief that interest rates will be higher later  We have heard quite a few          48  reports that deposit growth evaporated completely in the first few weeks of the year and, with the   cost of funds rising, that interest margins are under pressure  One large regional bank reported   that they are already in the process of putting through a round of loan repricings during this   quarter to offset partially the squeeze they are feeling on their interest margins   A banker with a fairly good sized institution told us that bank stock mutual funds are   experiencing very substantial runoffs, which is forcing the sale of bank stocks out of these funds    He said there are several large blocks of bank stock currently being priced for sale on the market    He noted, based on his own experience, that foreign interest in buying US banks is increasing   From the perspective of foreign investors it is bottom-fishing time   In motor vehicles, though we don’t have any solid numbers for January, we were told   that auto sales were very strong during the month, along the lines of what Mike Prell reported   Steel is looking quite good and the mood of people in that industry is the best we’ve seen in at   least a couple of years  Both domestic steel consumption and production are increasing  Import   volume declined last year and appears to be continuing to fall, so orders for domestic production   have been rising  Some steel price increases have already been implemented and further   increases have been announced to go into effect April 1  So, we will have to see whether the   market can withstand those increases or not   Let me make a couple of comments about the national economy and the global   economy in terms of the context in which we’re making policy decisions  I thought--and I'm   sure everyone will agree--that the Chairman's speech on January 13th was an outstanding   framework for thinking about the environment in which we find ourselves  It provides a basis   for a dialogue inside the System as well as outside the System about the broader implications of          49  the challenge of monetary stability  That overall concept includes what we call price stability but   encompasses much more than that  The challenge is to try to maintain some sort of equilibrium    The message for the rest of the world is a hopeful one  Other nations may be at best in   the very early stages of experiencing the kind of productivity gains we have had over the past   several years  And if other places around the world get into the type of reinforcing virtuous   cycle that we have had, that may help them work out of some of their very deep and long-lasting   problems  But the message for us is that when the acceleration of productivity occurred, we did   not get the full effects passed through into a sustained drop in the price level  So we did not get   the automatic increase in the real interest rate that might otherwise have happened  We relied on   these other safety valves, as the speech I thought described very well  Our reliance on those   other safety valves is problematic because those things can change--whether on the fiscal side,   the labor market side, or the immigration side  And we have to be very aware that our own   policy response may be influenced heavily by the actions of others in these areas, especially on   the fiscal side    I am troubled by the idea--I know it was said last year and repeated   again here--that faster productivity growth means we should raise the money growth ranges  I          83  suppose in the 19th century if we had discovered we had faster productivity growth, we would   have said we have to go out and dig gold at a faster rate  There is nothing inherent in our   objective for price stability and what we are trying to do about the purchasing power of money   that says that when we have a favorable supply shock we should raise our money growth   objectives  There’s no more reason to do that than to cut the money growth targets if we had an   adverse supply shock We wouldn’t do that  I’m sure that back in the 1970s or the 1980s we   didn’t argue for lowering our targets  What we want to do is to view the transitory effects of the   acceleration in productivity growth in a lower reported rate of inflation or transitory decline in   the price level as an increase in the purchasing power of money  It would be a one-time decline   in the price level--I don’t want to use that “D” word  And then when the supply shock goes   away, we would return toward the sort of balanced equilibrium that we would have been in    Also, I don’t see why it follows that leaving the money growth ranges alone communicates that   they are not important and that we have reduced the weight we give them  Why do we need to   change them to say that we are paying attention to them?  And why does not changing them   mean we don’t pay attention to them?    The part I am questioning is the linkage of saying we should adjust   up the nominal growth of GDP; it’s a sort of nominal spending effect  That was the point I was   getting at yesterday with regard to Dave Stockton’s simulation  To be clear about it we ought to   be explicit rather than implicitly saying that we want a monetary policy that is going to be   “accommodative” to nominal demand increases because we have a real supply-side favorable   development  If we are going to do that, then let’s also think about the implications of being   symmetric about the matter  If we were to have a surprising adverse supply shock, what would   we be doing then?  Would we say “Let’s cut our money growth targets”?  Probably not    I would agree with what Don said if it were the case that we had the   ability to distinguish between an adverse oil shock in 1973-1974 and something that much later   on the profession came to view as a secular trend in what we call productivity  I don’t know that          85  our ability to know what we are experiencing at any given time allows us to make that judgment    The Committee certainly did not do it in the 1970s    I agree that that’s an arithmetic implication  We did not start this   period with price stability  Had we started with price stability and then later found out that we   had an acceleration of productivity growth, that would have been one thing  We did not do that    So to me an acceleration of productivity growth when we’ve started with a positive rate of   inflation, somehow measured, means we have a deceleration from that inherited rate to   something moving toward price stability  At the juncture where we are today and with concerns   like those being registered yesterday by the staff and others, I would be afraid of what the   message that we are changing the ranges would convey  Rather than communicating that we are   going to put more emphasis on achieving a higher rate of growth, it would seem to say that we   are more willing to be accommodative of an acceleration of inflation  We could all say to   ourselves that we are accommodating faster productivity growth  I might even be persuaded that          87  that is the right thing to do  I think the message that would be heard is that we are   accommodating faster inflation    I am sure you have the credibility to say that and be believed; I do   not  I know that people wouldn’t believe me if I said that     Thank you  In the earlier comment period, I was in the questioning   mode, so I’ll state a view on this now  We are talking about two different things back and forth   at times here--about a belief in a sustained growth in productivity and potential output and what   would be an appropriate stance of monetary policy, especially as implied by monetary growth,   versus acceleration in productivity  Those can, at least, be separated analytically in the way we   think of them  If it was a matter of a consensus that we are going to have real growth on the   order of 4 percent--through a combination of productivity gains and labor force growth--and if in   raising the ranges it could be communicated that the Committee was pro-growth, that is one   thing  And I would have a hard time objecting to that  If it is a question, though, of   accelerations and decelerations with a fair degree of uncertainty about what is happening to   productivity, then we run higher risks of miscommunicating our policy intentions     I would be delighted, as I think everybody would be, if productivity growth   accelerated to the point where real output growth was 6 percent  But I still would not necessarily   conclude that we should very quickly change our monetary growth assumptions That’s because   with a favorable productivity surprise, there is nothing wrong with an increase in the purchasing   power of money  There is nothing wrong with manifesting and distributing the wealth gains   through society in the idea that the dollar buys more  We know that in most sectors and   industries where productivity growth is increasing rapidly, prices are falling  And that is a good   thing  There is no reason why we should think that prices of other goods and services need to   rise faster than they otherwise would have in order to hit some statistical measure of average   price changes  So I don’t think we should rule out the idea that favorable productivity   developments can be accepted as being associated with rising purchasing power of money or a   falling price level          102    Thank you  I, too, have a lot of reservations about the national   income accounts sets of information that we use to think about an increasingly globalized   economy  It is certainly not what we would construct if we were starting from scratch today,   given the way we see the world going  Nevertheless, it’s what we have, so we try to torture the   data in our efforts to find some useful information  I thought this was a useful set of exercises   and simulations from the standpoint that while we are all very uncertain at times about all kinds   of things, our degree of uncertainty about specific things varies a lot  Some people are quite          115  certain about one thing while others are very uncertain about that same thing  So these exercises   at least allow people to be rather explicit about what they are certain about and what they are not   certain about  So from that standpoint, I think they are useful     What occurred to me as I was looking at this was one exercise that I would have been   interested in, which was not included, involving the augmented Taylor rule that Ben McCallum   has written about--essentially what in the 1970s we would have called a Taylor rule with a   proviso clause  That would have been one additional exercise that I would have been curious   about had it been presented     I am going to ask a question to characterize my understanding of this and you can tell   me how close or far off I am in the characterization  First, I need to digress into the frameworks   that we are looking at, because for the last three decades at least we’ve had essentially two   competing paradigms  One has to do with the supply and demand for money, somehow   measured, and the other relates to the supply and demand for output or the unemployment rate   and the NAIRU  At times the empirical experiences tended to favor one framework and at times   the other framework--going back and forth, with reasons for uncertainty about both of them    As I looked at the different charts and listened to the narratives that went with them,   the message I took from the material was this  The greater the confidence one has in any leading   indicator--whether in a NAIRU framework, a money supply/money demand framework or   something else--the more gradualist one can afford to be in terms of smaller incremental changes   in policy actions  The less confidence one has in leading indicators, the more aggressive one has   to be  One might have to see a blip or some new information in order to take policy actions    You might not like the characterization, but the label I would put on the simulation you called   the realized-inflation rule is the “Bunker Hill” or “whites of the eyes” approach  As soon as we          116  see a blip up in inflation, bang, we move and we move aggressively  Is that a fair message to   come out with in regard to one’s confidence or uncertainty about leading indicators?    Thank you  When I look out at what the financial markets are   tellingly me--or maybe more importantly not tellingly me--I see the Treasury yield curve upward   sloping a bit from two years out to five years  Beyond five years it’s downward sloping, with   corporate bond yields and mortgage rates at 8 percent  I would be hard pressed to say that those   are at the wrong levels for an environment as outlined in the Greenbook and the associated   expectations  I would feel on much firmer ground in saying that there is something wrong with          137  these market levels if, given the second-half experience of 5-3/4 percent real growth and,   depending on the inflation measure, nominal spending of 7-1/2 to 8 percent, I thought it didn’t   add up  But this says to me that the market is not building in that kind of real growth plus   inflation inherited from the second half of last year through this year  So, I don’t know that   nominal interest rates need to go up  If inflation were to turn adversely and accelerate more than   seems to be built into the marketplace right now and inflation expectations were beginning to   rise, I do think it would be undesirable for real rates to go down  Then I would think that   nominal rates would need to increase   On the front end of the curve, though, when I look at the rise in rates for securities   maturing in up to two years, it does leave me with the feeling that a 5-1/2 percent overnight   interbank rate is too low to be consistent  Just closing that gap somewhat would be the wisest   thing to do And taking a step today, I think, is appropriate   I have a comment, though, on this question of 50 basis points versus 25 basis points,   and that requires me to make reference to the discount rate  There was a time, and I think it is   still the case, that a movement in the funds rate with an accompanying increase in the discount   rate was interpreted as being a more lasting move as opposed to a move in the funds rate alone    Given that, I would think a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate with a discount rate change is   too strong  And since I do consider directors’ recommendations for a discount rate increase   appropriate in this environment, I would prefer ¼ point on the funds rate knowing it is to be   accompanied by a discount rate move  In fact, I would oppose a 50 basis point change in the   funds rate either with a discount rate increase or without it  "
6527,2000-03-21,"  Thank you  I read through this material, of course, thought about it,   and gave it to a couple of people on my staff to read it  One reaction from my staff was along   the lines of  Well, you don’t have any choice but to approve this  I don’t like to be in situations   where I feel that I don't have any choice  In addition, they said  Once you do this, of course, you              - 17 -     will never reverse it; so just recognize that you're heading down a slippery slope  That does not   leave me very comfortable at all     One way of thinking about what we do when we conduct operations of the System   Open Market Account is that we are monetizing government debt--the liability side of our   balance sheet is in effect non-interest-bearing government debt  On the asset side we hold   interest-bearing government debt that has effectively been canceled  When you were in Boy   Scouts, Peter, Wright Patman used to say we could burn the bonds we hold and nobody would   know the difference  But that is true only if it is government debt that has in effect been   canceled by our activity  Once we broaden what we are willing to monetize, we are doing   something quite different and that leaves me very uncomfortable  So, if there are some   alternatives rather than continuing these operations in agencies, I really would like to pursue   them  Anything!  I would almost rather we monetize state government debt, I think, but I'm not   so sure of that either    Thank you  I want to ask a question about the alternative   simulations  As a general comment, let me say that I like having the alternative simulations    Nevertheless, those that are now included in the Greenbook and all of the other supplementary              - 36 -     ones that you have been sending to us are starting to tax my ability to absorb the information and   know what I'm learning from them  The one I want to focus on is the one that assumes faster   productivity growth  At the last meeting there was a simulation in the Chart Show showing that   faster productivity growth set in motion some dynamics that resulted in accommodative   monetary policy and an acceleration in nominal spending, especially if the forecast is extended   out very far  So it struck me when I saw in this one that the faster productivity growth results in   a little faster output growth from 2000 to 2001--it’s up 01--but the PCE rate of inflation drops by   02  That suggests that nominal income growth is slower under the faster productivity growth   scenario shown here than in the baseline  So that says to me that this particular simulation does   not have built into it, at least for this horizon, an accommodative monetary policy    In 2000 I agree, but then it slows in 2001  I’m not sure what kind of   lags are going on here because your faster productivity growth has GDP growth up 01 but   inflation down 02 in 2001  I thought you were saying that with this lagged effect of an   accommodative monetary policy, nominal spending growth accelerates  And that at least is not   what is shown here    Well, I thought it was something like that  That says, though, that the   inflationary dynamics that you see are beyond the forecast horizon    That means that this simulation is of limited usefulness to me if I am   going to assume faster productivity growth as I formulate my thinking on policy  By this alone I   can't tell what I'm getting myself into    Thank you  In conversations with directors and advisory council   members and others, one remark of a general nature--at least until the recent switch in the stock   market with the Dow Jones up and the NASDAQ down--was a very frequent lament about the   perverse behavior of the stock market  That companies like Federated and Kroger and some of   the banks and other firms in our District are having record earnings and their stocks are tanking    It was just a few years ago that the rap on corporate America was that it was shortsighted, caring   only about current period earnings and not at all about the future  And now only the future is              - 43 -     rewarded--even if a company’s earnings are expected to materialize some time in the far distant   future--and there’s no reward at all for good performance today   There is a uniform expectation that this year as a whole will be stronger than last year    In banking, all loan categories, with the exception of mortgage refinancing activity, are reported   strong  One of the large regional banks said that they had surprisingly strong deposit growth in   the first two months, surpassing even the growth of their earning assets  That same bank   reported to us that its own profit plan for this year includes an increase in interest expense that   would be consistent with a rise in the structural market interest rates of 75 to 100 basis points    Again it was reported that bank stock investment funds have been experiencing substantial   redemptions, which are forcing them to liquidate significant blocks of their holdings     Throughout the region there is a substantial new amount of retail space under   construction  People comment on it with the usual observation that overbuilding is occurring,   though each one of the individual projects seems somehow to be rationalized  Public sector   construction spending--for new stadiums and the like--as well as residential construction   spending point to activity this year being above that of last year  However, the new stadiums   under construction in Cincinnati and Pittsburgh are said to be headed for major overruns, as was   the case with the Cleveland stadium  Contacts in the construction industry claim that delivery   time for bricks is now up to one year and they say we can expect drywall shortages this summer    Asphalt and roofing material prices are up sharply and paper prices are quoted at levels 25   percent above those prevailing last summer     In the distribution business, along the lines of what Mike also noted, freight costs are   said to be skyrocketing  Packaging materials and insurance costs are reported to be 15 to 18   percent higher than at this time a year ago  Retailers indicate that there was no post-holiday              - 44 -     drop-off in sales  They came into the new year with lean inventories, so there was no pressure at   all for markdown sales in an effort to move out merchandise  A manufacturer of sports apparel   said everything was selling very well and price seemed to be no object  Some retailers had   record earnings for the fourth quarter and they expect earnings this year to exceed those levels     On the other hand, a major restaurant chain that is headquartered in our area said that   their labor costs as a share of their total menu prices have risen from 30 to 32 percent just a few   years ago to about 40 percent now  And they find that they frequently have to rope off parts of   their restaurants because they don't have adequate staff  Labor costs for delivery, warehouse,   and retail staff are reported to average 10 percent higher than a year ago, with entry-level wages   up 10 to 15 percent    I’ll cite one particular report on inflation--and pricing power, I guess  A director who   is involved in the sports and entertainment business said that for a recent concert by the Back   Street Boys in the Gund Arena the brokers reselling tickets were able to get $600 per ticket!   Most of the reports about health care costs were the same as we have all heard before,   with increases in the double-digit range  But with increasing frequency, both directors and   advisory council members told of actions they have taken to shift costs to their employees, which   raises some questions in my mind about how labor costs are reported  What happens, according   to them, is that they get a quote from their medical care processor/supplier for a double-digit   price increase and they don't want to pay that  So if they had co-pays before, they raise the co-  pay amount  If they didn't have co-pays, they introduce them, both for the office visit and for   prescription drugs  Also, they are raising the deductibles  So, one might assume that the cost of   the health care benefit provided is unchanged where in fact it has been shifted from the employer   to the employee as a way for the company to avoid incurring a higher benefits cost  That seems              - 45 -     to me to be a reduction in the real wage of the employee  I don't know how that would ever get   reported or captured in any of the data that we look at   Let me make some comments about the national economy and the way we think about   and talk about monetary policy and what we are trying to accomplish  We all see these   newsletters and press reports with statements about how the Federal Reserve wants to push up   interest rates in order to hurt interest-sensitive sectors, and those who incur interest expenses--  households or businesses or others--think that isn't fair  This reminds me of a lot of the “victim   sector” types of discussions of old--back when Ed Boehne attended his first meeting almost 30   years ago--that we sometimes heard  The theme was that the purpose of raising interest rates   was to hit housing, which in turn, with multipliers and ripple effects, would affect the rest of the   economy   Instead of thinking about actions on the overnight interbank rate as something   designed to push up other market interest rates and affect the economy through that channel of   influence, I think there is a different way to think about this  The issue in regard to the interbank   rate versus the structure of other interest rates is whether we have it calibrated at the right level   or not  When we have significant increases in productivity and the pace of technological   innovation has picked up, that does mean in an important economic sense that there is greater   wealth being created in the economy  Usually we have used labels to reference theories or   frameworks that talk about how people's perception of their ability to consume over time is   influenced by something over and above changes in their current measured income or cash flow   income  We have such constructs as the permanent income hypothesis, the life cycle hypothesis,   and--from one of my teachers--the standardized income hypothesis  We use these theories to   think about why it is that at times observed consumption spending doesn't move up or down as              - 46 -     strongly as measured income or measured cash flow income  People are rational in a longer-time   horizon than what that paycheck number says to them   But we can reverse that kind of analysis and think about a situation in which the   permanent income has moved up relative to measured or paycheck income, creating the   perception on the part of households that their ability to consume over time has increased   compared to what they thought before  And they can see that in a number of ways  With a   credible anti-inflationary monetary policy, they see it in lower nominal interest rates  They can   refinance their house so they have more discretionary disposable income left over after they have   paid the mortgage and other interest expenses  They expect, after a sustained period of rising   income and sustained employment, that that will continue  They see that their employer’s   retirement plan is enhanced relative to what it was before  Their own 401(k) may look better   than it did before, so they perceive that they can live better in retirement than they used to think,   which means they don’t have to save as much now for retirement as they thought earlier   So, there is a whole variety of ways that suggest that consumption expenditures by   households would likely increase  Demand would be expected to increase in a period of rapid   productivity gains and increased financial innovation  And at the same time, those same factors   mean that the marginal productivity of capital has improved--moved out to a higher isoquant--so   that claims on the current resource utilization to enhance future ability to consume have   increased  That means that real interest rates have risen, by definition, whether we can observe   them or not   Both forces at work simultaneously say that the real level of interest rates is higher    Now, in the gold standard world that is not a problem because the price level falls, so there is no   need for an increase in nominal interest rates  Real interest rates go up because there is a              - 47 -     declining inflation component, or maybe even a negative inflation component in there  The same   is true with a disciplined final demand or monetary growth kind of regime   In an interest rate pegging regime, though, it's different  If the whole structure of   interest rates is under upward pressure because of rising real interest rates, then a failure to move   the overnight interbank rate up means that we have to inject high-powered or central bank money   at a faster rate through open market operations in order to maintain the same fed funds or   overnight rate as otherwise  So the purpose of raising the overnight interbank rate is not   necessarily because we want to push up other interest rates  The purpose is simply to slow the   pace at which we increase total liquidity in the economy that accommodates that acceleration in   nominal demand that would occur if we didn't push up the funds rate  I don't view it as an   exercise in trying to seek a victim sector or trying to penalize somebody by raising interest rates    I just want to slow the growth of central bank money    I agree with the recommendation   "
6547,2000-05-16,"  Thank you  My comment was going to be along that same line,   that this absolutely would not be the time to fail to renew the swap arrangement with Mexico    That action could be far too easily misinterpreted  However, a year from now we will have a      17  new Administration in Mexico and maybe a new minister of finance and central bank head,   and a new head of the central bank in Canada  So before we get to this point in 2001, I think   it might at least be worth exploring with the Mexicans and Canadians an exit strategy from   these swaps      Thank you  First of all, Mike, let me say that it really does look   different from this end of the table where you used to sit!  [Laughter]    But if I sound a bit disoriented and confused, remember that I've   only been sitting here a little over an hour, whereas you had a lot of years to absorb the vision   from here!    When I look at the data in the Greenbook for the last four quarters, including the   current quarter and assuming that the Greenbook forecast is correct on that quarter, I have to   say that the resultant set of numbers is really extraordinary  It’s not only a set of numbers that   was not forecast, but one that I would consider unforecastable  One of the exercises that I like   to go through to prepare for an FOMC meeting is to review how things looked a year ago to   me, to the Blue Chip forecasters, and to a lot of other folks  And I reflect on what kinds of   policy assumptions went into those forecasts  Sometimes I review more than a year, but   certainly I try to recall how the economy looked a year earlier  In view of these numbers on   real GDP for the four-quarter period through the current quarter, I was looking at some tables      31  the staff prepares and how they compared to those done last May  My first thought was  My   gosh!  The staff got it exactly right  And then I realized I was looking at a table on nominal   GDP for that four-quarter period!  [Laughter]    Then I picture myself in the fourth quarter of 2001, say at the   December meeting, looking back and saying  My gosh!  The staff got it exactly right in terms   of nominal GDP, real GDP, and all of the other variables in these Greenbook tables for the   six-quarter period starting in the third quarter of 2000 and running through the fourth quarter   of next year  But then if I looked at where the funds rate would be--at 7-1/4 or 8 percent or   something like that--and the associated other yields, I think I would be absolutely mystified    Now, I have to admit that, when I reflect on the financial markets of the last four quarters, I   have a lot of unanswered questions about their consistency with the performance of the   economy  Certainly the Treasury market is difficult to interpret  Let’s say that the markets   have it right, and what is reflected in the financial markets is that we have a transitory   acceleration in nominal spending and real output and then we will glide into the staff’s set of   numbers in the Greenbook  In that scenario, I cannot imagine getting into the fourth quarter   of 2001 and seeing the funds rate up there in the 7 percent range or more and the associated   other interest rates comparably higher  In fact, I would say where rates are right now is   probably consistent with this set of nominal and real GDP numbers  Your reaction?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  On several recent road trips through   the District to host meetings for bankers, I had the impression that in at least one dimension      63  there has been a distinct slowing  And that is that the spring crop of orange traffic barrels has   been the best ever and is coming close to the objective of blocking at least one lane of every   major road!  [Laughter]  Contractors and union leaders say that there is enough money to   obstruct even more traffic if only they could find the laborers  [Laughter]  One claim I’ve   heard is that there are no unemployed construction workers  In thinking about what is   happening, I don't think I want to tell you any more about the outlook for public sector   construction through the forecast horizon because there's nothing that monetary policy is   going to do about that now or for any time horizon that we care about  The revenue is there; it   will be spent  The stadiums are under way; highway programs are under way  The money is   available and it is going to be spent  So I am just going to stop talking about that!   Let me shift to other labor topics  Some of this reflects the lagged effects of earlier   developments  Chairman Greenspan has cited Herb Stein as saying that unsustainable things   have a habit of ending  I will tell you that there is a new definition of overbuilding in the   retail construction sector  A company that builds very, very large stores that sell a variety of   items--groceries, what we would call department store goods, hardware, and so on--just built a   major facility in the north area of Columbus, a rapid growth area  The opening of the store   was set for May 1st and they needed to hire 800 people  They began advertising for help with   a starting wage of $8 an hour  The week before the scheduled May 1st opening they had only   200 applications  They have now delayed the opening for at least a month and have raised   their offering rate to $10 an hour and have their fingers crossed that it will attract the workers   they need   Employees of hospitals in the area gave us some startling reports  Normally there   is a cooperative relationship between the Cleveland Fed and the Atlanta Fed on the payments      64  system  But that’s not the case in health care  Cincinnati area hospitals say that their   employees are being offered bonuses of $5,000 by Atlanta hospitals plus a year's free rent to   relocate to Atlanta  Some Cincinnati area hospitals are approaching employees of other   hospitals and offering them $2,000 just to move across the street or across town  A Columbus   hospital said that it has shut down three operating rooms in the face of a 100-nurse shortage   The lack of labor and the implications of that have led to our hearing more stories   about companies choosing not to expand in our area or choosing to relocate or add additional   capacity in Mexico  It is not at all a sucking sound but it is a phenomenon of the type of labor   market we are seeing  There are some silver-lining aspects to it  A union leader was adamant   that I report to you that they now want a complete and unconditional amnesty for   undocumented workers  That would help the INS problem in Indiana and they could   concentrate on the southern part of Jack Guynn’s District!  [Laughter]  He also wanted us to   be aware that there is a possibility of a nationwide strike against General Electric involving   five unions in a dispute over pensions  Another sort of silver-lining aspect of the tightness in   labor markets is the increased emphasis on labor substitution investments  A contact from a   company that ships out merchandise through Internet and 800 number catalogs sales--mainly   gifts of its dessert products--said that a year ago their shipping cost per gift was $106  They   have had an 8 percent across-the-board wage increase and even higher benefit cost increases   and have reduced their cost per gift to $96  So, productivity still is helping us out   And as we head from spring into summer, employers in the services sector say it is   going to be a very tough season for our amusement parks  Cedar Point wants to hire 4,000   workers for the summer and they expect                                          of those will be foreign   students  They are using hiring or retention bonuses as well as free or heavily subsidized      65  housing to try to attract them  All of the major amusement parks in the region are increasing   prices  The smallest increase of 54 percent is at a park that increased its fee 10 percent last   year  The highest is at Cedar Point, with a 15 percent increase in admission price  We have   been told that admission at Six Flags in New England will be up 22 percent for this summer    And increases in parking fees are said to average 10 percent  We’ve had reports of other price   increases of note  One was a 33 percent increase in paper costs  These, of course, are all   relative price increases and you all know that  Another, which was reported in this morning’s   Wall Street Journal, was that Chubb Insurance is raising premiums     A major worldwide supplier for the motor vehicle and housing industries,                                                                      said that its suppliers are asking for relief from the   price caps in their long-term contracts  He said that with the strength in recent orders from   Europe, Asia, and Latin America--in his words it is the first time all global markets are   coming in strong--they expect to be able to renegotiate the price caps and to pass the higher   costs on to consumers     All of these anecdotal reports of tight labor markets, increasing cost pressures, and   efforts to raise prices are the lagged effects of the very strong final demand that we have   experienced--with an emphasis on the past tense of the comment  Very recently there are   some tentative indications that growth in final demand is moderating, perhaps in response to   the policy actions taken since last June  In recent meetings with directors, advisory council   members, and bankers we’ve heard many more suggestions that a degree of caution is starting   to be reflected in the behavior of both businesses and consumers  Certainly the combination   of higher energy costs and higher debt servicing burdens is starting to have an impact  I look   forward to the June meeting, our Humphrey-Hawkins meeting, when we will get a longer-     66  term perspective on the outlook beyond 2001  That’s because the effects of actions we have   already taken as well as any action we take today will really influence that period much more   than the short term   We are now experiencing a very familiar pattern  Once we start raising the federal   funds rate, market participants and Fed watchers talk about how far we will have to go and   they extrapolate that to ever-higher rates  In February of 1995 when we had previously   increased the fed funds rate to 6 percent, the futures rate five months out indicated a funds rate   of 7-3/4 percent  And some commentators were talking about a rate over 8 percent    Nevertheless, we stopped at 6 percent  We disappointed them and we were right  In   December 1998, after the reduction of the funds rate from 5-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent, at least one   very vocal Fed watcher said that we would cut the rate to 3 percent  We did not and we were   right  The point is that the one thing that is certain is that we will need to stop raising the fed   funds rate long before the commentators and the fed funds futures markets say we will  And   the question of when to pause cannot be avoided  I think we are now much closer to that   point, possibly with an action at this meeting, than is suggested by the assumptions behind the   baseline forecast   I have one little comment on the issue of raising the real fed funds rate--which is   what some of my staff occasionally refer to--or otherwise raising real interest rates, let alone   real exchange rates  We don't raise and lower real interest rates  The markets do that    Fundamental forces of all types influence real interest rates and real exchange rates  The issue   is not that but where we are pegging the nominal fed funds rate--the overnight interbank rate--  relative to market determined rates, nominal as well as real  I now think that even talking   about the concept of real interest rates is not only not useful but counterproductive  It is really      67  market interest rates more generally, both the real and the nominal components, that matter    The issue is the nominal fed funds rate and whether we have it at the right level to be   consistent with an expansion of central bank liquidity that is consistent with what’s going on   in the economy   I was pleased to hear the Vice Chairman’s remarks and caution to the Committee   about the international situation  I think that is very important  It probably doesn’t get as   much attention as it should, especially in the environment in which we find ourselves  It is   always difficult to make monetary policy in presidential election years, including Mexico’s   presidential election years, as we have seen many times in the past     Our objective, of course, is stable purchasing power of the dollar for our economy    But increasingly that means for a lot of other economies, too  Our policies, as we are seeing,   do affect foreign countries’ policies and, therefore, foreign economies  And that feeds back to   affect our economy and our ability to achieve a soft landing, in line with the points of concern   that Vince Reinhart raised in his remarks  Thank you    David, you started with a reference to the risks at our last meeting   as we stated them but also to the forecast and discussion of the risks around the table  But   then you ended with the focus on the interpretation of our statements of the balance of risks    Isn't it the case, as long as there are lags--and maybe long and variable lags--that there will be   a time when we will stop raising the funds rate when the risks of reported inflation are still   rising?  We cannot wait until we have seen the first break toward a downward trend in   inflation or we are going to cause a recession for sure  So there has to be a time when, in spite   of what the futures market projections say and in spite of what the forecasts and projections   say, we stop  Suppose we raised the funds rate by 125 basis points today to 7-1/4 percent    Wouldn’t the risk still be that inflation in the month ahead would be higher?    That is why I am raising the question    Let me follow up  Suppose my own model had really long lags--I   used to think the lag was about two years--and I think that the stance of policy today affects   the inflation rate in 2002  And my guess is that inflation is going to rise for the next year and   a half no matter what we do, just due to good old-fashioned momentum   Then how do I use   this balance of risks statement as a communication device for people out there looking at it?    How do I handle that communications problem?    May I ask from that whether it is intended to be interpreted that we   could at some point say with this action we now see the risks as balanced?    I fully support the 50 basis point move at this meeting  My   preference would be to say that with such a move the risks are balanced  But I recognize the   risk that such a statement would be misinterpreted, and that would be undesirable in my view    But to my mind saying that the balance of risks is still tilted toward inflation also can be   misinterpreted if the market's impression is that the decision at the June meeting is a foregone   conclusion  I think that would be a mistake and it would be miscommunicating  I'm troubled   by the concern over surprising the market because we do have to disappoint the market at   times by not doing what it expects  We know that; we've done it many times before  I prefer   to think of this as a situation where sometimes we will have to take an action and   communicate in a way to educate the markets and get them to adjust to us rather than have us   adjusting to the market  So, at least among us, if we are going to say that the balance of risks   is tilted toward inflation and that the funds rate will be moved still higher, I wouldn't want to   think about that in terms of the old tilt language  That is, I don’t want the presumption to be   that we are going to come back predisposed to another increase in June  I think it would be   desirable to take a stronger action at some time and then be willing to give it more time to   have the desired effects  "
6572,2000-06-27,"  I don't know if this is going to be helpful or not!  [Laughter]  Instead   of talking about the unemployment rate, which is a highly visible, highly politicized figure, I   was going to cast the question slightly differently  Once a month people in a government   agency go out and take a snapshot of the inventory of individuals who are counted as willing to   work--they did something to try to gain employment--but were not working  That inventory is   about 5-1/2 million people  There is a lot of churning in that inventory, a lot of ins and outs    We get all sorts of other information but we look at that number of 5-1/2 million--and the total   stock is growing by about 2 million a year--and we say, “Well, that number of 5-1/2 million is   too small”  We think technology--search engines, search techniques, or efficiencies of all sorts   in information communication--has moved down the inventory of many items that are needed   for building cars  But you are implying that this inventory of people not getting a paycheck   needs to be up around 7-1/4 million, otherwise the prices of goods rise, or rise at a faster rate    Without repeating what you already said, draw me a connection that tells me that the inventory   of unemployed individuals needs to be 7-1/4 million instead of 5-1/2 million people     Thank you  The best way to summarize the sentiment of executives   of older manufacturing industries in our region is “hostile”   Following the surprisingly strong   demand that we saw in the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year, it was   probably inevitable that the inflection from that, when it came, would catch at least some   manufacturers by surprise  And they are embarrassed, one might say, about having extrapolated   a pattern that was clearly unsustainable  As I’ve noted before, manufacturing employment in   our District is much higher as a share of total employment than the national average, and that in   turn is concentrated primarily in motor vehicles and their suppliers  So when truck and auto   sales are rising and rising rapidly, order books are filling up and everyone is happy  But when   truck sales start to decline first--and they have--and then auto sales ease back somewhat, as they   now have, inventories rise and new orders are weaker  Production levels in the current quarter   are going to be reported out as quite good, probably at record highs  But manufacturers are very   grumpy about the order book outlook for the second half of the year  Steel production in the   current quarter and the entire first half was very high  But in that industry inventory levels also   are high and rising, and weak incoming orders together with those inventories are putting some   downward pressure once again on steel prices  A nationwide distributor of carpets and other   floor coverings has reported that sales in this quarter are running about 8 percent below sales in   the same quarter a year ago  That’s in line with what Jack Guynn was saying about housing-  related industries  A banker claims that he’s seen a noticeable slowing in commercial loan           53  demand and he expects overall growth of earning assets to be very slow to nonexistent in the   second half of the year     Generally, labor markets in our region were described by our contacts as less tight   this spring than previously  A survey of tourist destinations around the region, notably the   amusement parks and other places that typically hire thousands and thousands of young    people--or increasingly retirees--to work during the summer months, said that they did not have   difficulty hitting their hiring targets this year  They’ve stepped up their programs for recruiting   foreign employees; up to about one-fourth of their total summer labor force is comprised of   foreign students they bring in for the summer  It’s now reported that one can hire construction   workers in Ohio  They are available as long as the employers speak Spanish  Another director   reported that all the horse farm workers he sees in Kentucky are Spanish-speaking  We have   flexible labor markets!     Let me turn to the national economy  A year ago at this time, getting ready for the   midyear meeting, I was bothered by a general lack of caution on the part not only of bankers but   their customers--though the bankers would usually attribute that attitude to their customers  We   would ask the bankers how well positioned their customers were for an upward shift of 100 or   200 basis points in the yield curve  They said their customers’ response would be, “You don’t   get it  Interest rates can never go up again because inflation can never go up again because we   have a new economy a new era” and so on  And even if the banker made a sincere effort to   instill a bit of balance to the customers’ perspective of the risks that were involved, the message   was difficult if not impossible to convey  I don’t sense that at all now  I think we have   delivered a very effective and important wake-up call to people that there are various risks   associated with their business behavior and their household behavior  I think that is healthy and           54  I believe it will help to sustain this expansion  Even the post May meeting commentary about   how high we might have to see rates go, as wrong as it turned out to be, was constructive to this   process of rebalancing people’s assessment of the risks  People have learned that stock prices   can go down  They have learned that IPOs can fail and that even dot-com companies can go out   of business  Some businesses have learned that sales can decline  And we are probably going   to see that workers will learn that layoffs can and do occur  All of that I think is healthy to the   kind of decisionmaking that we ought to be seeing   The surge in nominal spending growth in the second half of last year, which carried   into the first quarter of this year, was not forecasted and was probably unforecastable    Unfortunately, we may have accommodated more demand than we would have liked  But it   didn’t continue  At our May meeting it was only conjecture that the acceleration might have   been moderating, but the data in the weeks since the May meeting have gone in the direction at   least of suggesting that we may have had an inflection there  While I agree with Cathy   Minehan’s comments about not over-interpreting the data of recent weeks or the couple months   of the spring, they do at least point in a slowing direction and we ought to be aware of that    And the anecdotal stories that I’m hearing in my part of the country suggest that the second half   is going to be quite a bit weaker  As we know, surprises can have negative signs attached to   them as well as positive signs     Let me make a couple of comments on oil prices  Even though oil overall is a   smaller percent of our GDP than it was 25 years ago when we were hit by the oil price shocks,   it’s still a significant factor When oil prices to any importing country go up, and go up so   sharply, if the wealth lost to us in terms of trade is changed there are wealth redistributional   effects internationally  But probably more importantly, there are redistributional effects within           55  our country--by sector, by industry, and certainly by region  The effects are not at all uniform    A couple of years ago manufacturers in our part of the country were quite happy with oil prices   of $10 to $12 per barrel  In Bob McTeer’s and Jack Guynn’s Districts they weren’t quite so   happy with those prices  Well, the situation has turned around  Maybe it will turn around   again; I don’t know  But for the moment we are seeing a lot of dislocations that I think will   take some time to work through the economy  Quite aside from the direct and indirect effects of   energy prices are the effects on various price statistics  There are differing implications for   consumption and production     As for inflation trends, I suppose I’m not as worried as some of the commentators   I’ve heard today seem to be that inflation is definitely on a rising trend  That may be because a   couple of years ago I never believed that the core inflation rate was as low as indicated by some   measures  We may have regretted that we didn’t lock in a sustained lower inflation rate in an   opportunistic way, but the domestic and international situation simply didn’t allow for that    Nevertheless, the movement up may be simply a return to the kind of trend that was actually   built in based on basic monetary fundamentals anyway  So I’m not as convinced that inflation   is accelerating from where it is    Don, in reading the Bluebook and listening to you now, it seems that   a critical part of the analysis involves a wage-lag hypothesis  At a micro level the idea--this is   not your language but the way I interpret it--is that the value of the marginal product of labor as   individuals has risen but there may be some lag in the perception of this  And as reality dawns   on the worker that he is more valuable, he’d want to be compensated in the paycheck for this    So, what we would expect to observe if that is going on is that for a while returns to capital rise   relative to returns to labor  That is an imbalance; it needs to be adjusted  Over time, returns to   capital will fall relatively while returns to labor rise and balance will be restored somehow  If   the owners of the capital and the labor are one and the same, though, that is not an issue  So   there is some notion that these are different participants in this economy and that those who are   the owners of capital gain for a while relative to those who are the workers  Maybe    At the same time, in some of our analysis of what is going on in the economy we   have something called wealth effects  There the idea is that people in this long sustained   prosperity have reduced their concerns about layoffs, have seen various aspects of their   current/future consumption tradeoff altered, and perceive that their permanent income has risen    In a lifecycle sense they say, “We are richer Our 401(k)s are doing better, our company's   pensions are better, and our probability of being laid off is lower”  Somehow they perceive that   they are richer and can afford to consume more in the present as well as in the future  And thus   being richer, even if they perceive that their wages currently have lagged behind the increase in   the value on the margin of their labor, if they have a wealth effect in a sense there is no wage   lag  There is no catch-up and rebalancing of returns to capital and returns to labor implied    There is no adjustment to be made           100   Can I follow up, Mr Chairman?  I have two points on that  The   more we believe that the distribution is quite different between the owners of capital and   workers--and that certainly is true to some extent--the more trouble we have with wealth effect   arguments as the catalyst stimulating consumption  If the workforce and this other group that   owns the capital are totally different, driving consumption spending off the so-called wealth   effects coming from technological innovation and rising productivity is a difficult case to make    The other point, though, is that innovation per se involves creative destruction, reducing the   value of something old  And it doesn't matter whether it is technological innovation, managerial   innovation, or whatever  That reduction in the value of something old--this is partial analysis--  especially if it involves labor substitution kinds of innovations, does not increase the value of   the marginal product of at least some workers  And the idea of worker insecurity as an   hypothesis drives in the other direction in terms of whether or not these people perceive that   there is a wage lag that needs to be rebalanced    May I respond on that?    That is not clear to me if part of the manifestation of the wealth   effect on the part of the work force is in their rights to future consumption that is contained in   their pension plans, their 401(k) profits, or whatever    Their claims on future streams of consumption rise and that does not   necessarily have to pass through a paycheck      Thank you, Mr Chairman  For this meeting I support the   recommendation for no action  And in line with the Vice Chairman's remarks yesterday, if a   recommendation to raise the federal funds rate--whether at this meeting or a subsequent   meeting--had an underlying objective of raising the unemployment rate or opening up a gap   between potential output and actual output, I would oppose that  I think it is too easy for these   kinds of exercises and scenarios derived from models to become objectives, if not of the   Committee at least in the minds of some observers  I cannot imagine Chart 3 of the Bluebook   appearing in the monetary policy report to Congress  I simply cannot picture the reaction if that   chart were to be included in such a document  Like Governor Meyer, in reading the Bluebook I   tried to find out what it was telling me regarding what position I should take  With regard to   inflation objectives, the Bluebook tells me that at this meeting I should support a 50 basis point   increase in the funds rate with an announcement--in line with President Poole’s remarks at   previous meetings that it is not nice to surprise the markets--that we will increase the funds rate   by another 50 basis points at each of the subsequent four meetings this year because we plan to   raise the funds rate to 9 percent by December  Now, the reaction to that would be chaos in the   financial markets  We would not produce the results indicated if we did that, of course  No   model would tell us what results we would get because we can’t forecast what would happen if   we were to announce to the market 250 basis points of additional tightening between now and   December  So, I don't know what use the exercise is in guiding me as to what position I ought   to be taking to support a price stability objective  "
6596,2000-08-22,"  Does this include the topic of the euro diversification?    Yes, first a question, though you may want to treat it as rhetorical when I   get to it  What is the current dollar equivalent value, roughly, of both the Fed and Treasury holdings   of yen and euro-denominated assets?    The combined total of our holdings and the Treasury’s of both yen and   euro-denominated assets?    The number that stuck in my mind from a couple years ago was $40-$45   billion, so if the exchange translations reduced that, that’s great  Is that the right amount to have?       15   Well, that was the rhetorical part of the question  [Laughter]    We got to this situation where we hold assets that are claims on foreign   taxpayers by way of historical accident in a sense  We somehow got here  And then, especially if   Al Broaddus keeps prevailing, we won’t intervene, which means that we don’t add to that but we   also don’t reduce it except for exchange translation effects  There must be a point where we should   step back and look fundamentally at what it is we are doing when we are holding claims on foreign   taxpayers as opposed to claims on our own taxpayers  Or, if the Treasury situation were to continue   as the baseline forecast suggests, claims on some other earning streams  When a central bank holds   the obligations of its own federal taxpayers, as we do for the most part in our portfolio, it has   monetized that debt in the important sense that those paying the interest on the debt--the taxpayers--   are the same people who are benefiting from those payments  That’s only true in the case of federal   debt and federal taxpayers  It wouldn’t be true if we were holding agency issues or state and local   government issues or foreign government obligations  To have a strategy that says we’re going to   hold claims on the Japanese taxpayers or the German taxpayers or the French taxpayers is something   that I think needs to be addressed fundamentally  Why are we holding those and how much should   we hold?  When we hold debt claims on our own taxpayers, they get the benefit from the   monetization of that debt  In the alternative of holding foreign assets, again holding aside what’s   going on with the exchange rates and resulting translation, there is a cost imposed on our taxpayers if   the yield on the claims of foreign taxpayers--Japanese yen debt or euro-denominated debt--is below   the yield on US government debt  So if there’s a cost, there’s presumably a benefit  And since we       16  --we, the Federal Reserve plus the Treasury--by our actions or behavior are imposing a cost on our   taxpayers, we should think through what the benefits are on the other side and try to keep those in   balance  I would think in principle that the answer to the question of what is the right amount   involves asking to achieve what end?  What are the costs and benefits of holding any foreign   currency reserves?  I have a hard time getting myself back to the point where it makes sense for our   country, maybe uniquely in the world, to hold any official assets that are claims on foreign   taxpayers    I would suggest as we all think about this--and we can’t avoid thinking   about it because of surpluses as far as the eye can see, so to speak--that we look back to the earlier   practice of exchanges of foreign assets with our foreign counterparts  I know it’s the Treasury’s call,   really  But if it were to turn out that central banks in other countries chose to reduce their holdings   of US government obligations, I think we should at least be open to opportunities to do an off   market swap or exchange of currencies    It would get to the question of the composition of our portfolio, what we   have in, say, euro-denominated assets versus something else, because some things might have to   happen  Say we wind up only owning claims on German and French taxpayers but not on Japanese--  and I think right now why we hold so many claims on the Japanese taxpayers is an interesting   question  But if, say, an island off the coast of mainland China decided it wanted to reduce its   holdings of US assets, depending on what it wanted to hold instead, then an off-market exchange   might be appropriate       18   That, too!  I’m suggesting that we be open to facilitating--not   intervening, I know--in such a case by engaging in an off market transaction that would result in a   reduction of our holdings of assets denominated in foreign currencies in exchange for taking their   holdings of US government obligations into our portfolio  I wouldn’t want us to preclude the idea   that those types of transactions could be done    Thank you  My question is for Karen on the international side, but it   does feed back on the domestic side I’m still not sure what I ought to be thinking with regard to   developments external to the United States and how that feeds back on our economy and, by   implication, on our policy choices  There was the suggestion that inflationary pressures may be   emerging increasingly in other countries because of the closing of gaps and that, therefore, some   tightening of policy abroad might be coming along, which might tie in with a weaker US dollar    But of course if all of the reason for higher nominal interest rates were higher inflation abroad   compared to the past or to inflation in the United States, then in real differential terms it wouldn’t   have any implication for the US dollar or for our policy actions  You may have had this in mind   and it wasn’t coming out clearly to me  If we thought that what is emerging abroad is all demand   side economic activity, driven by whatever--monetary, fiscal policy stimuli or something--and that’s   all, that’s one thing  But suppose we were to accept that some or a significant share of what is   emerging abroad is supply side activity, as we are now more increasingly incorporating into our   thinking about the United States  If we started to think that economies abroad were in the early       27  stages of what we have experienced over the last four or five years, wouldn’t we come to a different   conclusion about the implications for the dollar and for the feedback on the United States economy?    Your alternative simulation in the Greenbook says that if the dollar is 8 percent stronger, that’s going   to reduce our real GDP and inflation  Well, that’s mechanical  That’s because of the net trade   effect  But that wouldn’t be true if what we are seeing, or if what we were willing to think about   what we’re seeing--whether it’s in Latin America, Asia, or Europe--is more a supply side kind of   experience that is driving their growth, their productivity, and their employment    I agree with the partial analysis implication of that last comment, but also   our export demand would--     Certainly  I don’t know what those elasticities are, but that goes in the   opposite direction       29   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Not surprisingly, in many respects recent   developments in our District are very similar to those Mike Moskow reported for his District  I   won't cover them in detail because many of my remarks would be a repetition of what he already   said  The most commented-on development in the District in the last couple of months has been the   slowing in the motor vehicle sector, with the decline in large truck production most pronounced        48  Parts suppliers and trucking companies are reporting substantial declines in new orders  Some are   saying orders are down 50 percent  So, some workers have already been laid off and, more   importantly, additional layoffs are expected  Layoffs have not yet occurred in auto assembly plants,   but overtime work for autoworkers has largely disappeared in the District     Residential construction activity has declined, most noticeably in the low- and moderate-  income range  Within the District, building in western Pennsylvania is holding up best--maybe   because that region was lagging earlier--whereas contacts from a number of metro areas in Ohio and   Kentucky have reported what they consider to be overbuilding  Commercial real estate construction   is said to have slowed to a more sustainable pace  Both developers and bankers claim that during the   course of the past year a pronounced element of caution and restraint has crept into their previous   optimism about new developments and new projects  They claim that the bankers have really   tightened conditions by demanding more equity in any new project that is about to get under way    So, the real estate professionals believe that widespread overbuilding has not occurred in the District    Bankers assert that the pipeline of new loans is starting to empty out  And the bankers on our boards   of directors say that they are revising downward their projections of earning asset growth for the   balance of this year, and their expectation is that it will be soft next year     With increasing frequency we hear from manufacturing companies located in the District   that their optimism about the prospects for exports pretty much balances out their more pessimistic   view about domestic demand  As I reflected on some of the comments that we were hearing from   these companies, what was noticeably absent--but I didn't think to ask about it at the time--was   concern about competitiveness  There was no suggestion or hint that the value of the dollar or   exchange rate levels or anything like that was influencing their ability to sell  Their comments       49  mainly were about how strong these foreign economies are going to be and how much of the market   their firms could service    Reports about retail spending have fluctuated widely in the last couple of months  The   only thing that seems clear about the retail sector is that the uniformly strong reports that we were   hearing earlier have stopped  The one sector where labor market conditions continue to be very tight   or even tighter is health care  Contacts in the health care field say that they are telling employers to   expect several years of double-digit increases in the cost of their medical plans  A disturbing trend is   that smaller employers report that they are offering young workers the option of higher wages in   exchange for forgoing any medical coverage   At a recent small business advisory council meeting almost all participants said that they   expect inflation over the next two years to be somewhat higher than it has been on balance in the   past couple of years  Most apparently felt that wage and benefit costs would rise more rapidly, but   on other issues their views were somewhat divided  Some suggested that continued productivity   gains would keep pace with these higher labor costs  Others suggested that their earnings were   going to be under pressure because productivity would not keep up  And they were equally split on   whether or not they could be successful in passing along unavoidable cost increases, mainly labor   costs, to their customers   Turning to national and international prospects, I always look forward to the meeting after   this one each year because that is when the staff adds another year to the forecast horizon  I don't   underestimate at all how difficult that is, but to me two years or so is the right horizon to be thinking   about in terms of the current stance of policy or even possible near-term policy actions  I think it is   important to get us thinking about what kind of environment we're going to face in the year after   next year  It is sobering and humbling to think back to the August meeting two years ago--when the       50  Russians were in the process of defaulting that very day--and what we went through in the   subsequent two years to get to where we are today  We have seen oil prices at $10 or $12; we've   seen oil prices at $30-plus  We've seen developments in credit markets and foreign exchange   markets that none of us would have been able to forecast, let alone be sure about what the right   policy response should have been  So, I think we have to be very open to the idea that there will be a   lot of unexpected events  My own view is that these surprises are more likely to be on the   international than the domestic front over the next two-year horizon     Three months ago, when we last raised rates, I would have put Mexico very high up on   my list of worries  Now, three months later--and maybe I'm just being totally naïve--the situation   there seems to have changed dramatically for the better and I would put it well down on my list of   worries  But I could be wrong  We may get through the inauguration of their new president and a   transition and find out that something was there that we couldn’t see  But when I look around   elsewhere for things to worry about that may be different in ways that I could not possibly imagine, I   think the domestic fiscal side is going to be different  And the report I read last night about how to   think about US fiscal policy alternatives did not comfort me  I believe the fiscal stance we have   had recently of increasing government savings has been stimulative to at least one sector of the   United State’s economy, the investment sector  I find it difficult to think about increased spending,   reduced tax revenues, and smaller surpluses or even deficits as being stimulative in an overall sense    It may be toward certain parts of the economy, but I can't think of it as being stimulative to the   business investment sector  So, over the coming two-year horizon it seems to me that we have to be   willing to think about fiscal impulses more flexibly than what was suggested in the material I was   reading last night         51  When I look at the issue that was raised earlier about Japan and the concern there, we   know that something is going to happen in the next 2 to 2-1/2 years  I don’t know what baseline   assumption we should make, but something is going to happen  Politically it is already starting    How fast it will go is anybody's guess  Anybody's is better than mine!  We know that developments   in Europe are going to be quite different than they have been in the past  The launch of the euro in   currency form a year from December will be a very significant landmark development if it happens,   or even if it doesn't  And to get from here to there what has to be done in Germany, Belgium, Italy--  in a lot of these countries--could be socially and politically very, very divisive and difficult  As I   said, I don't know what the right assumption is to make  But I think it would be useful to the   Committee in our October meeting, when we look out through the end of 2002, for the staff to   consider a wide array of possible events and assign some probabilities to them, and see where we   come out on them  We ought to be prepared to be flexible and humble about our ability to forecast   what is going to happen over the next two years    A couple of questions, if I might  I read in the Bluebook someplace,   though I can’t find it now--and I thought I heard you say it again in your briefing--a reference to the   declines in real rates as reflecting a reduced probability of the Fed tightening and raising the funds   rate  So, I look at the data and I say  Okay, 10-year yields have come down and other yields have   too, but 3-month rates went up  Well, the fed funds rate is a one-day rate  So I ask myself  Can I          69   square those?  If we attribute to the market an expectation that whatever inflationary impulse is in the   pipeline is very short term but not longer term, is that how we reconcile those?    Okay  That leads me to another question  Some of your remarks about   the markets and what we can read into the markets and maybe learn from them, I interpret as saying   that there is increasing credibility in the marketplace attached to our commitment to avoiding a   sustained acceleration of inflation  A year or more ago, before our first rate increase in this series at   midyear last year, we heard a lot of commentary to the effect that inflation can no longer be a   problem because of the new economy--that the silicon chip prevents inflation  And that went along   with stories about the success of IPOs and equity prices and price/earnings ratios and so on  Now it   seems that if people are comfortable that inflation is not a problem, it is because the Fed is on the job    To me there does seem to be, compared to a year ago, a big swing as to the reason given for why   inflation is not a problem  If that’s right and if that is built into what we’re seeing in the markets’   financial indicators, then what weight would you give to increased credibility of the FOMC?  The          70   reason I’m asking is because there is this phenomenon, at least theoretically, of the Friedman surge   effect or the Parker’s paradox effect--that with an increase in credibility of the commitment to fight   inflation, the demand to hold money balances relative to wealth or permanent income would be   higher  So the same money growth would be less expansionary than compared to a lower credibility   environment  And if there has been a shift over the last year toward more credibility attached to our   commitment to resist inflation, what weight would you give that in assessing the thrust of policy   actions?    Thank you  I agree that leaving the funds rate unchanged at this point is   the right thing to do  I am also sensitive to the communications issues involved; it would not be   desirable to communicate the expectation that we are not going to raise the funds rate in the   foreseeable future or to imply that the next change might be down rather than up  But it is a   challenge as to how to avoid communicating that     Regarding the language on the balance of risks, part of me would like to say that the   statement should always be that an unavoidable, permanent feature of a fiat money system is a   balance of risks toward higher inflation  [Laughter]  If it ain’t going down it’s going up!  But since I   am not likely to win that one, I think we do have to spend a little more time here on what it is that   leads us to believe that the balance of risks is toward higher inflation  I say that because in some of   the discussion today and in previous meetings it sounded to me as if we worry that higher   productivity through various avenues--through demand increases, wealth effects, higher real interest   rates, and liquidity injected by the central bank--causes higher inflation  And as Governor Meyer   suggested, we worry that lower productivity causes higher inflation  So, until we sort out a little   better whether higher productivity causes inflation or lower productivity raises the risk of inflation,   we are not quite ready to explain why we think the risks are toward higher inflation  "
6619,2000-10-03,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recently one director started off the go-   around at our board meeting by relating what he considered to be an anecdote about conditions in   labor markets  But I interpreted it somewhat differently, and I'll come back to that  He said he      51  overheard another customer in a store where he was shopping complain to the manager about one of   the store’s employees  And the manager responded,  “It is easier to get a new customer than it is to   get a new employee!”  [Laughter]  That raised in my mind the question about appropriate quality   adjustments in the services sector, and we could all probably compare anecdotal stories about that   As for other reports about labor markets, layoffs have been announced by Eaton, Dana,   and smaller trucking parts companies  KeyCorp has announced a very major layoff, which is not   limited to our District but covers the seven Districts where they operate  Reduced overtime in motor   vehicle assembly plants and parts supply firms is becoming a problem  One banker in the northwest   part of Ohio, where there are a lot of assembly plants, noted that his customers had worked so much   overtime for so long that they had started to view their overtime pay as part of their base wage  That   loss of extra overtime income is now being reflected in late payments, delinquencies, and even   bankruptcies  We're starting to hear of a few cases, again from our community bank advisory   council, of some people just walking in and turning in their keys   Other directors and advisory council members commented that the higher energy prices   seem to have cut into discretionary spending even before winter has arrived in our part of the   country  Specifically, it was reported that entertainment spending for sporting events and movie   theaters had dropped noticeably in the past two months  In fact, one theater chain announced that it   is leaving the mid-Ohio region  A banker said he expects to have to start reposessing powerboats he   financed earlier this year  Because of high gas prices a lot of them wound up staying moored in the   marinas during the last couple months  He noted, for example, that a 30-foot powerboat will   consume 20 to 25 gallons per hour of running time   Reports about the retail sector indicate considerably more softening in our region than the   data suggest for the nation; in fact it was claimed that we did not get a back-to-school sales bounce       52  A manufacturer/distributor of packaged pastries said that corporations are cutting their gift budgets,   and orders for the fourth quarter are off significantly from a year ago  I’m not sure how to interpret   that particular anecdote because a year ago I assume a lot of companies had planned substantial gift   budgets for Y2K rewards and recognition  So a year-over-year comparison might not be very   reliable  In the retail sector going forward, we were reminded that November last year was very   weak, so on a year-over-year basis November should be good  If it is not, that ought to be   significant  And there is an extra Saturday and more days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this   year, so the retailers are optimistic that they will do better in December-over-December as well   One of our directors who is affiliated with a national newspaper chain reported that ad   revenue has been off sharply in the last couple of months  Another reported, with respect to the   retail sector, that in the past 60 days the FTC has sharply increased the fines they impose on retailers   for failing to meet promised delivery schedules, which is probably pretty sobering for the online   sales sector   In manufacturing, truck assemblies and parts have been off sharply this year  Also, the   very much higher diesel costs--one contact asserted that diesel fuel prices were double what they   were but I don't know the timeframe he was using--have greatly increased the operating costs of the   trucking companies that are headquartered in the region, some of which operate nationally of course    A characterization of how pervasive the effects may be was the suggestion that partly because of   just-in-time inventory, we should start thinking that the United States has put its warehouses on   wheels, and rolling warehouses do consume fuel     Reports from both large and small banks indicate that even in the face of slowing loan   demand and a dwindling number of applications in the pipeline, proposals are now being turned      53  down that would have been accepted a year ago  Bankers also tell us that not only have their interest   margins narrowed considerably this year but that they expect margins to be thinner yet next year   Turning to the national economy, I also thought all of the simulations provided by the   staff were useful  I think these kinds of exercises, static as they sometimes are--and I recognize that   getting them to be dynamic and interactive is quite difficult--are very useful to conditioning our   thinking  If one reflects on what has happened over the last few years--in oil prices, productivity,   economic growth, and exchange rates in a couple of notable instances--we might have been better   able to think through the appropriate policy had we sensitized ourselves more to the implications of   these kinds of events  But looking back at the range of developments over the last few years, my   guess is that we would have had a very hard time imagining just how far a number of these things   would go  So, looking out at least to 2002 is a very desirable thing for us to do  And I agree with   the suggestion that looking out even further would be helpful, even if we don't have a lot of   confidence in any one scenario actually playing out or coming close to what actually will happen   I think back to four or five years ago and the inherited situation at the time, with inflation   somewhere in the 2 to 3 percent range depending on which measure one looks at  Had we been able   to anticipate the acceleration in productivity growth from about 1 percent or so then to where we   have seen it in recent years, in an ideal policy sense I would have preferred to take all of that gain in   productivity to lower the rate of inflation  I would have favored a very opportunistic response in   order to lock the gains in productivity into a lower inflation trend  We took maybe half of that; it's a   very judgmental thing  I think some of the favorable developments in productivity have reduced the   trend rate of inflation, but not by as much as I would have liked  Going forward, I would like to be   able to take advantage of all of any further increases in productivity growth to lower the inherited   rate of inflation, whatever the underlying monetary inflation trend may be      54  That does raise a question of strategy, in terms of how we would go about doing that  The   baseline forecast in the Greenbook has us starting off from the current position, where the economy   is operating somewhat above some notion of our national potential  And as skeptical as I am in   today's world about the notion of a potential output either in labor markets or some other way of   measuring our capacity, I don't find that approach very convincing  I am just not sure and I wouldn’t   know how to convince somebody else that we are now operating above capacity  Nevertheless,   going forward the baseline forecast has output growing somewhat more slowly than potential   growth, so that takes some of the pressure off inflation in the framework that is being used there    But that does raise a question about how we think about the increase in interest rates since June of   1999, particularly the fed funds rate  I still don't find it useful to think in terms of a real fed funds   rate  Normally when we talk about real interest rates in a Fisher equation sense, we say that the   appropriate horizon for the expected rate of inflation is the duration of the instrument we are talking   about--whether it's the 30-year, the 10-year, or whatever  Well, in that sense, I find it troubling to   think about a real component in the overnight interbank rate  Instead, I like to think about whether   or not the current nominal fed funds rate is calibrated at a level that will ensure that we do not, in an   accommodative sense, inject excessive central bank liquidity  Doing so would turn a favorable real   side development--productivity growth--into an excess demand situation, thereby creating inflation    I’m not there at this point  I cannot conclude that a fed funds rate of 6-1/2 percent is too low  I   would be looking for evidence of these favorable productivity developments showing through in   other market measures, especially in financial markets, telling me that the 6-1/2 percent nominal fed   funds rate is too low  It’s a very tough issue  So at the moment as I look out to 2002 and the   baseline forecast, my own very loose judgment would be that the trend rate of inflation is going to be   declining in 2002 rather than rising, especially if the forecast is correct about productivity growth      55   I support the recommendation    Why?  "
6666,2000-12-19,"  On the same page, Peter, my puzzle was just a little different from the   Chairman’s puzzle on the bottom part because I was looking at the red line going up last year and      10  this year, and I was thinking that the A2/P2 didn’t go up as much this year  But what’s going on   with the A1/P1 that the yield is just flat across there?  There's no year-end movement in it, whereas   in all the rest of the years shown on the page there was some movement even in the A1/P1 rate  And   this year it was zip    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Speaking from the old economy region of the   country in contrast to the new economy region, the view really is quite different  At a joint board of   directors meeting of our three boards last Thursday, one of the directors cited an index that I had   never looked at before  She said that in the three weeks since Thanksgiving to that date, the   Salvation Army's collections were down 18 percent from a year earlier  Now, I don't know what to   make of that because I always thought that a little prayer went along with the coins in the kettle  So   I don't know if it means there's less to pray about or less money to spend!    Exactly  First, on construction, public sector construction spending in the   region remains strong, but residential, commercial, and industrial are all down, and most   expectations are that activity in 2001 will be below that experienced in 2000  Inventories of   construction materials are said to be high, and the earlier reported shortages and long lead times,   especially for items such as brick and drywall, have disappeared  Prices of construction materials   are reported to be below levels prevailing at the beginning of the year   Turning to motor vehicles, truck production is off sharply and parts suppliers have begun   layoffs and plant shutdowns  In the region people would say the trucking industry is in a depression   not a recession  One large truck dealer that sells in seven states of the region said that almost 50   percent of his sales have gone delinquent in the last 60 days  Several auto assembly and parts plants   have closed for the final weeks of the year    Steel executives expect the auto companies to cut production schedules further, which   reinforces what you were suggesting, Dave  In the steel industry, the situation was described as dire    One company reentered bankruptcy--it's the second time for them--and others are expected to   declare bankruptcy soon  Three CEOs in the District were fired in the past month  Timken has      30  closed all of its steel plants and three bearings plants for the balance of the year                        with a   long career in steel said the bloodletting has only just begun   Retailers, not only those in the region but chains that operate nationally, report sharply   lower year-over-year sales  Even with the additional selling days and the extra Saturday between   Thanksgiving and Christmas, sales through the middle of last week were so far below year-earlier   levels  that the difference cannot be made up in the remaining selling days  Sales at one company,   Bath and Body, are down 10 percent, and this is the first year-over-year decline in the company's   history   On the subject of inventories I've heard one report that I don't know what to make of, nor   do I know enough about the issue to be well informed  Nevertheless, we were told that Wal-Mart   has notified its suppliers that starting next year they won't get paid until the goods are sold  And if   the goods are not sold Wal-Mart will return them, which means they are the property of the supplier    I don't know how Wal-Mart will set prices in that kind of environment  So, that type of practice is   going to muddle the inventory data further, among other things     A food processing and distribution company reports that while sales have been soft, the   prices of food processing equipment have dropped and labor turnover has declined, so profit margins   are good even in the face of the larger discounts they are now offering   Labor markets are reported to have eased considerably with the major exception of the   health-care sector, where the shortage of hospital workers and pharmacists is still described as   severe  Among our contacts two areas were cited as showing some strength safety equipment is   described as strong, with an orders backlog, both domestic and foreign; and orders for spring   delivery of sporting apparel from one manufacturer are said to be high  Bankers report a noticeable   slowing in loan demand, especially for mortgage and auto financing  But on the other side, large and      31  small banks reported a significant drawing down of home equity loans, which may not be a sign of   strength  Members of our commercial bank advisory council all reported increases in what they   described as ""voluntary repossessions,"" especially of SUV-type vehicles, trucks, and boats  Most   expect loan growth to be much slower in 2001 and have budgeted for higher charge-offs  The head   of one large banking company headquartered in our District said that a year ago they were getting   hammered by institutional investors because they were only promising 10 to 12 percent earnings   growth, and this year they are getting rewarded for promising 8 percent  So, expectations may be   adjusting  Software companies are said to be cutting prices, especially for development of Internet   sites  Otherwise, I guess they move to Boston!  Some dot-com companies have ceased operations   because venture capital funds have dried up and these firms never reached the bankable stage   Let me turn to the national economy and economic policies  At recent meetings of   directors and advisory councils I suggested that perhaps what we had been observing in recent weeks   was what I called the “Gulf War Syndrome""  My idea was that uncertainty--in this case uncertainty   associated with the election outcome--was causing only a temporary postponement of commitments   by households and businesses alike, as we saw in the weeks before Desert Storm  I found almost no   support for the idea  It certainly cannot explain what we see in the trucking and steel industries  It is   likely that we will see a succession of downward revisions in private sector forecasts for major   industries, as well as for the national economy in 2001    I want to make a few observations about what I consider to be appropriate and   inappropriate uses of contemporaneous or high frequency data for policy purposes  I do not believe   that reports of economic weakness should call for monetary or fiscal pump-priming stimulus to head   off a cumulative process of contraction  I don't think that's the way our economy works  I do   believe that a market economy has an inherent tendency to expand, as adverse effects of various      32  shocks such as sharp increases in energy prices tend to wear off  However, we do have to be alert to   the mirror image of the sharp acceleration of productivity growth that we've observed, with a lag, in   recent years  By that I mean that our observations were with a lag  We came to recognize that if we   held the overnight interbank rate unchanged as the natural or equilibrium market rates of interest   rose in the face of strong wealth creation, we could inadvertently accommodate an inflationary   process  An unchanged federal funds rate with rising market rates is a de facto easing of the stance   of policy, and that's true whether it comes from an increasing inflation premium or what we call the   real rate     Conversely, if forces are at work that are putting downward pressure on the natural rate,   an unchanged overnight bank rate is a de facto tightening of the stance of policy  In this context, the   natural or the equilibrium structure of market rates is not the same thing as what we usually mean   when we talk about real rates, which can never be observed ex ante  This year, for example, it might   be tempting to cite the lower Treasury yields in the face of faster inflation as evidence of lower real   interest rates and consequently an easier stance of policy  I believe that conclusion would be wrong    In a nutshell, lowering the fed funds rate in the present environment would not and should not be   viewed as an act of stepping on the monetary accelerator  It would be and should be viewed as an   act of reducing the pressure currently being applied to the brake pedal  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Two questions, Don, that may lead into one  At this time last year, we   had a funds rate of 5-1/2 percent  We were really constrained then from doing anything because of   Y2K, but we were learning at that time of upward revisions to growth, reinforced by the anecdotal   information that things were coming in much stronger  We now know that we were halfway through   a period of over 8 percent nominal spending growth on average for the four-quarter period  And,   clearly, a 5-1/2 percent fed funds rate was not consistent with that  We agree about that  At the next   three meetings we moved rather promptly and got the funds rate up to 6-1/2 percent  Once we got   the rate to 6-1/2 percent, the differences among us were about whether it needed to go higher or not,   and that had to do with the forecast  Now, certainly, if I had thought that the economy was going to   continue at 8 plus percent nominal growth, I would have been in the camp, too, that felt our work   was not done and that we should keep going  But in fact growth did decelerate  When I look at the   current Greenbook, I see that we are now, including the forecast for next year, in a six-quarter period   of 5 percent or a little less in nominal spending growth  And yet the Greenbook assumes that a 6-1/2   percent funds rate is consistent with nominal spending of 5 percent or less  How do I get to that   assessment?  How do I close that circle?      68   That leads into my second question because I read the Bluebook as   saying that the reason for holding the funds rate at 6-1/2 percent is the desire to have the   unemployment rate rise to 5 percent and to hold growth below potential  So, if you don't want to   raise the unemployment rate and hold growth below potential, then you’d be in favor of reducing the   rate  The only reason I saw in the Bluebook for holding the funds rate at 6-1/2 percent was to try to   drive up the unemployment rate    One more brief follow-up question Am I right that given the Greenbook   forecast for inflation, nominal spending, trucks, and houses, and everything else, if the current   unemployment rate were 5 percent, then you would say ""cut""?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Jack Guynn said he was still debating when   he left for the airport yesterday  I'm still debating now!  Clearly, based on what I said earlier, if the   reason for not lowering the funds rate is because we're waiting for the unemployment rate to go up,   then I can't agree with that  So if the press statement is going to make any reference to continued   tightness in the labor markets, then I would disagree with that  But I guess I won't know what the   press statement is going to say until after we vote on this  So I may have to guess as to how it will--    Okay  The other reason for not moving is because it's awkward to go   from a balance of risks toward inflation to a balanced risks statement, which would seem to be out of   tune with reality  I would find that troubling  And I've always thought that whenever we reached   the point where we had to announce a balance of risks toward weakness and we didn't act, it was   going to be a problem for us  It puts the burden on us to explain why we didn't do anything if we   saw the balance of risks as weighted toward weakness Why we didn't act is going to have to be   explained, whether we do it in the press statement or in remarks people make subsequently      81   That's why I don't like being asymmetric!     And my final point, speaking of predictability, is that what apparently is   expected out there is that we would change the language this time, and then everybody could read   into that that we would change policy the next time  And I don't like being predictable  [Laughter]    I would like to do the unpredictable thing--what is not fully anticipated in the market today--and that   is to lower the rate  I think that would give us a lot more mileage than waiting to ease until after it's   well anticipated that we will ease at the next meeting or in between meetings  "
6688,2001-01-03,"  Mr Chairman, this is Jerry Jordan    First of all, I agree with your recommendation  I also agree with   what Bill was just saying, that your earlier point when you made your recommendation was the   right one  Last summer--and well into the fall, no doubt--a 6-1/2 percent funds rate might have   been perfectly appropriate, given what was going on in the real economy and how it was     1/3/01 15  affecting the financial sector in that period  But in the environment we now find ourselves--not   only what we’re learning about the real economy but what we’re seeing in the financial markets-  -a 6-1/2 percent funds rate is in effect tighter than it was earlier  Lowering the funds rate and   bringing it in line with these other developments I don’t think ought to be cast as taking back the   final rate move last May as though it were wrong  I say that because I’m not sure that it was   wrong, given the circumstances at that time  But I do feel strongly that the 6-1/2 percent rate is   too high for the current environment  Lowering the funds rate, if it’s not an insurance move, is   to my mind a reduction in the amount of restraint that is currently in place  And by casting it that   way, if we were to get a resurgence in real economic activity and in the financial markets, we   would at least have a consistent basis for explaining any subsequent need to move the funds rate   back up from however low we take it during this current round of easing    "
6711,2001-01-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I believe this is an   extraordinarily important discussion for us to be having  Even if we didn’t have the   prospect of Treasury surpluses and the paying down of Treasury debt as the event forcing   us to consider this matter, in my view it is sometimes useful to step back and think   strategically about the asset side of our balance sheet  The week before last, our Bank   held a two-day session, what we call a strategic planning exercise, to set goals and   objectives for the next five years, as all the Reserve Banks regularly do  At about the   same time I was wading through the 300-odd pages of these SOMA studies and I was   struck during those two days of our planning exercise by how the focus of all the   discussion was on the liability side of our balance sheet  People think very carefully   about that in the Reserve Banks, and they are good at it  They think about the ACH,   about analog and digital check systems, Fedwire, and on and on  We pay an enormous   amount of attention to the liability side and virtually zero to the asset side of our balance   sheet--probably appropriately so because very few people in the Reserve Banks actually   would be able to add much to the discussion about the asset side of our balance sheet    Those individuals who can are the ones who participated in these studies, and I thought   they did a tremendous amount of very valuable work  But in the end, it’s only this group   that can think strategically about the asset side of our balance sheet  To think   strategically means you first have to have some sort of a vision and some ideas about the   future beyond the immediate time horizon  Right or wrong, you have to identify   possibilities, assign probabilities, and reflect on what you would be happy about or not   happy about at a point out there in the future  These days the point in the future I like to   encourage our people to focus on is our 100th anniversary in December of 2013  In my     1/30-31/01 34  view it’s not too early to start thinking about that centennial celebration  Governor   Ferguson, once he is reconfirmed, will be the first governor whose term runs into the   Federal Reserve’s second century  I won’t be around, but other people will be who ought   to be focusing on the vision of what this institution will look like at that time   Well, to return to the issue at hand, the Treasury’s general account is one of the   items on the liability side of the Reserve Bank balance sheet  It’s an important element   of the services we provide the Treasury as its fiscal agent  It’s a big element in what   Peter does as part of what I view as defensive operations, the temporary injections and   withdrawals of reserves necessitated by fluctuations in the Treasury’s account  It actually   is not on the liability side of the monetary base, because the monetary base is a   consolidation of the accounts of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks together with the   Treasury’s monetary account  So it comes as a negative source component on the asset   side of the balance sheet  Everything else on the liability side of our balance sheet is   either currency or funds of those entities that have a settlement account with us  Now,   having a settlement account with us is an extraordinarily important principle to preserve   both for depository institutions and for other financial intermediaries or governmental   entities  This consolidation of the Reserve Banks’ accounts and the Treasury’s monetary   accounts, outside money or high-powered money, is linked to a financial system that   importantly depends on the concept of inside money--those payments mechanisms   through the institutions that have settlement with us  That leads me to some principles   about the options we should be willing to consider, what I would view as very low risk   options relating to items we hold on the asset side      1/30-31/01 35  When I started reading through all of this material, my first reaction was--and   one of the Chairman’s first comments brought me back to it  Let’s get an exemption   from double-entry bookkeeping because none of the other options looks attractive  But   that would take legislation and I’m not at all in favor of legislation  I would prefer that   the Fed have no authority to lend to California utility companies, whatever others might   think!  Debt of state and local governments gives me great pause because of that kind of   concern   If ours was a closed economy, having no international dimension, then a   Treasury-only policy on the asset side of the balance sheet, if feasible, is what I think I   would want  And on the liability side of our balance sheet would be either balances of   our domestic depository institutions or currency that US residents hold  But that’s not   the reality, and that’s not the world we are in  So we are going to have to think about   some alternatives down the road that are beyond our own borders as an institution  But   linking items on the asset side of the balance sheet to ones that are on the liability side of   the balance sheet is an extremely important principle, and we shouldn’t stray very far   from it   Monetization is a term that applies only properly to domestic debt of the   central government  The reason is that the revenue from that monetized debt, which is   our liability and is noninterest-bearing debt for the government sector, goes back to the   Federal government as we, in a sense, cancel interest-bearing debt  Monetization doesn’t   really apply, at least not in my mind in the most useful sense of that term, once we start   thinking beyond US Treasuries  But the other things on our balance sheet on the   liability side are the accounts of financial institutions  I don’t know which institutions     1/30-31/01 36  those are going to be in the future  We broadened the scope in recent decades to those   that have a settlement account with us, and that may change over time  But whoever they   are, they are the only institutions to whom we should consider lending  If we have to   stray beyond a Treasury-only policy, we ought to lend only to those that are creating   inside money out of our outside money  And that means no GSEs--sorry, Tony, we can’t   go that route  But we should only lend to entities that have a settlement account with us   because that is the basis of the monetary control mechanism--ultimately settling through   us  That does lead me uncomfortably into the foreign arena and the consideration that   our liabilities are increasingly used by others around the world  Having assets on our   balance sheet that are claims on taxing authorities in other parts of the world that use our   liabilities at least doesn’t violate my principles on what I think we ought to be willing to   consider holding as earning assets  Thank you      Peter, I’m probably going to need to ask a follow-up question   to my first question because I think I can guess the answer to the first one  Suppose the   Committee accepted part or all of your “B” proposal of pouring RP dollars into foreign   debt, with or without municipals, but did not accept the first part of the proposal to   reauthorize the temporary authority to accept mortgage-backed securities  What would   be the problems associated with that?    Now consider the possibility that you will find the notion of   operating in foreign sovereign RPs politically acceptable  Suppose it’s a good enough   market to be able to do substantial amounts and it is working to meet all of your needs   and the Committee’s intent down the road is not only to seek authority to operate in   mortgage-backed securities but in GSEs as well  How difficult does that become?     1/30-31/01 67   Okay  Well, from a Committee process standpoint, often on   issues like this we have found that once we start doing something, the burden of proof on   those who think it is not a good idea and want to stop doing it is quite formidable  It   sometimes serves our purpose, if we can get a consensus on our objectives down the   road, to reverse that burden and say we will stop unless somebody proves that we should   continue because the benefits outweigh the costs    Yes, that’s conditioned on your finding the foreign sovereigns   satisfactory for your purposes    Thank you  That was very helpful, so I can be brief  Will   your discussion include the warehousing facility?    I am not currently a member of the Committee so I won’t get   a vote this time around, but it’s comforting to know these discussions will be taking place   before this issue is on our agenda again  With a new Administration, I think this is an   especially opportune time--and one we shouldn’t miss--to discuss the subject of   intervention and find out where we stand      Thank you  I have a question on the very short term for Peter   and one on the longer horizon for Don  Peter, based on our experience in April of the last   two years, what is the order of magnitude of the challenge you are expecting this April?    I know that problem only comes up once a year, but it appears   to have become a big challenge    On the longer term, I’m glad you’re going to be thinking   about the vision for the future and would ask whether you plan to include in that some   issues related to the liability side of the balance sheet and to other institutional     1/30-31/01 88  arrangements  Twenty years ago we began implementing a new regime, mandated by   legislation, with regard to the structure of reserve requirements, the balances that must be   held with us  The system has evolved into one that can be thought of as comprising a   fortnight positive balance, based on a number of criteria, and an overnight, 24-hour non-  negative balance  We have in a sense a two-tier reserve requirement system imposed on   certain types or classes of deposit liabilities  If one thinks out very far into the future, a   lot of nomenclature we use is not terribly useful with regard to how we determine what is   a deposit, what is a transaction deposit, and what is or is not a clearing balance   In various places around the world these concepts are evolving into a different   kind of structure  If we contemplate a long enough period, 10 years or more, we might   envision an opportunity for legislation--on these asset-side issues or for whatever reason   --to which we may want to attach some desired changes on the liability side  It might   give us the opportunity to evolve toward a different system whereby the liabilities of   those institutions that have an account with us are subject to a liability on our account   balance sheets at some specified frequency  I would like to imagine that we could move   toward non-negative hourly balances at some time in the future  The technology is going   to be there  But the daylight overdraft and the overnight overdraft problems are part of   the structural framework where changes could address my concerns about Ned’s NACF    If I knew what was going to happen on that side, then I could get a lot more comfortable   with his concept of NACF  But the NACF as it is, without doing some of these other   things, has too many uncertainties in terms of how it might be gamed by depository   institutions to allow me to feel comfortable with it right now  But I could get   comfortable if I knew of enough other changes we were going to implement       1/30-31/01 89   Which I’m opposed to but--      I’ll pay for the fourth beer and Marvin can convince you!     Thank you  I’m following up on Mike Moskow’s question   about inventories  I want to tie it together with your assumptions and what you know   about imports because they are big swing factors quarter to quarter, both compared to the   December Greenbook projection versus now and also going forward  I can imagine a   scenario where the overhang of inventories can be tied very closely to imported goods   and so we would not expect to see much of an adjustment in inventories of domestically   produced goods  So I’m wondering what you assume or what you know about that    The one sector you didn’t mention is retail  Very large retail   companies headquartered in Cincinnati and Columbus are telling us that 70 percent or   more of their stock is imported and that the aisles are full of goods and no customers    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess it’s not surprising that the   Twelfth and the Second Districts are doing well, in contrast to our region  We ought to   be viewing it as payback time for the prosperity we enjoyed in the '90s  It probably will   take long memories to remember how good it once was     I didn’t really need to see the Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment or the   Conference Board's survey results to know that consumer sentiment had deteriorated    That's because of an experience I had yesterday morning when I got to the office  Before   I went to a briefing with our economists, my secretary thought I ought to see her heating   bill for the month of December and that of her elderly aunt  The numbers were really   shocking  November and December were the coldest months on record  Combine that   with the rise in energy prices and it's clear that people are taking a huge hit  So it’s not     1/30-31/01 155  surprising that confidence is down, though we don’t really have an answer to Governor   Gramlich’s question about whether we are seeing a permanent income kind of effect    We’ll have to wait until it warms up and see how it thaws out!   Mike Moskow referred to the steel industry as bleak  That’s not what my   contacts are saying                                            spent his career in the steel industry said   steel is “an unprecedented disaster,” which is worse than bleak  He said we should   expect to see more bankruptcies of integrated steel companies, further consolidation,   some plant closings, and sustained reductions in employment in the steel industry  I’ll   come back in a minute to some structural issues about large manufacturing companies   more generally     A large producer of plastics said that business has fallen through the floor and   is still falling  He's found another floor!  After more than two years of continuous   overtime, auto assembly and parts plants have no overtime and have been announcing   layoffs that they hope will be only temporary  But it now looks from the latest news in   the last couple of days that there will be some permanent plant closings in our District   Possibly as the result of the weakness in manufacturing, retailers reported that   for the first time in several years they had no trouble at all hiring the seasonal workers   that they needed  As a reflection of how much weaker the region is than the national   figures suggest, unemployment claims in December rose from 57,000 a year ago to over   90,000 this year, a 65 percent increase  My guess is that our increase in unemployment is   going to be temporary  As soon as the benefits run out, many people leave the   workforce, or they head west or south      1/30-31/01 156  Putting a positive spin on all this, one director said that the dramatic loosening   of the region’s labor markets means that firms will be giving smaller raises than they had   earlier budgeted for this year  And no one is offering retention or recruitment bonuses,   which were a big issue with everyone last year  Another director said his firm is seeing   more applications than openings for the first time in two years  As of last week, auto   suppliers said they now expect no pickup in orders before the fourth quarter  And we   were told that just since the first of January there has been a noticeable decline in orders   from both Mexico and Canada     A retailer said the drop in sales in December was so sudden that he at first   suspected that their computers were broken  He claims that the shake-out in retail will be   worse this year than in the 1990-91 recession  Every division of Limited stores had   declining year-over-year same-store sales At Hallmark stores sales were down 6 percent   year-over-year     After complaining most of the last year about the difficulty of attracting   deposits, our bankers reported strong deposit growth in December and early January,   which is consistent with the national figures we’re seeing  They also say that mortgage   refinancing is booming again; and home equity loan demand is very strong, which might   not be a good sign  One banker said it is common for homeowners to take out additional   equity when they refinance, reinforcing what was suggested in some of the materials we   were given  Other comments by bankers included a rising trend of late payments and a   rapid and serious deterioration in their credit card debt   Turning to more general remarks about the region, I think we are now going to   see what I view as a longer-term decline in the old economy industries that had been the     1/30-31/01 157  strength in our part of the country over recent years  I now believe that the right way to   think about what we saw in the last few years in the behavior of these companies is that   the healthy glow of a fever was masking a serious fundamental illness  They didn’t deal   with their problems and it’s going to be very difficult for them to deal with them now, as   we’re seeing in what the steel companies and their workers are asking for     When I talk to civic and government leaders in the region, they remind me of   somebody who runs a retail establishment and says that the customers aren’t coming, the   products aren’t selling, and our competition is killing us, so I guess we’ll have to raise   our prices  I say that because these politicians want to tax anything that moves in order to   subsidize those parts of the economy that are not moving  They are scrambling to find   any and every way to raise taxes, mainly because population and employment are   declining and the revenue base is now starting to decline  So suddenly they’re desperate   for more revenue   Let me turn to the national economy  With regard to the remarks about how   difficult it is to forecast recessions--and I certainly agree with that--I'd note that that is   true also of forecasting recoveries  When the economy turns, it is surprising how rapidly   and vigorously it sometimes turns As we have seen in the past, recessions often have   been associated with some unforeseen event, whether it was the Gulf War of 1990 or the   near recession in the aftermath of the Long-Term Capital Management debacle--a   development that didn’t turn into a recession  But we are sometimes just as surprised by   the vigor of an upturn, most recently in 1999  If we go back to the fall of 1998, in the   forecasts that we were looking at and the Blue Chip forecasts as well, nobody foresaw the   vigor of  ’99  So the surprises can come from both directions     1/30-31/01 158  Underneath most forecasting exercises there’s an inherent philosophy about the   nature of the market economy  A lot of models historically have been based on what I   think of as older ideas about economic activity  They tend to reflect the view that there is   a natural tendency for the economy to stagnate, for a decaying process to take place as   the old stimulus wears off in the absence of new stimulus  The opposite view, of course,   is that the market economy is inherently resilient, that it tends to expand except when it   gets knocked down for some reason or other  And as we know, over time it has been   knocked down for a whole host of reasons--sometimes even because of perverse   economic policies, monetary or fiscal  I believe that one aspect of our job is to do no   harm--not to be a part of the problem  And whether or not we need to be a part of the   solution, in terms of the stimulus, is a different way of thinking about things     Like Tom Hoenig, given the current circumstances, I think our policy recently   has been more restrictive than is appropriate  And I come to that view with some   difficulty  I read the yield curve and other things as telling me that, but I don’t read the   money numbers as telling me that  So I put a lot of weight on the staff's explanations that   mortgage refinancing or this and that are affecting the money numbers and that by May   or June M2 growth is going to be down to 1 or 2 percent  If that doesn’t turn out to be   true, I’m going to change my assessment about how restrictive policy is      I agree with Bob McTeer on the general idea of front-loading policy changes    My view on this is symmetrical; I mean it in both directions  At times I'm just as   impatient to move toward restraint as to move toward ease  But I recognize, given the   external pressures and the dynamics, that it’s always a lot easier to front-load on the   easing side than on the other side  While I would support the “early” part of Bob's     1/30-31/01 159  suggestion, I do not agree with the “often” part  I would front-load--move early--and   then pause    Thank you  I support the 50 basis point move today and I   think 100 basis points of easing in a four-week period does achieve a significant degree   of front-loading  It is early and substantial  And I would support that even though I think   the baseline forecast is the best projection to go with  It’s the one I certainly hope is   correct  But the funds rate path that was coupled with the baseline forecast is not the one   that we prefer  Where that leaves me is that if the baseline forecast does turn out to be   the correct one, then we’re going to need to move the funds rate back up, perhaps to   where the staff says it is going to be two years hence  And it’s getting difficult for me to   imagine the path that we will have to follow if that forecast is right  I say that because   the pressure for further cuts at the March meeting and especially at the May meeting, if     1/30-31/01 187  we have a negative GDP number for this quarter and rising unemployment, is going to be   huge  It will be a time once again when the market fully expects us to move, when the   analysts and everybody else say we’re going to move, and we will have to disappoint   them     "
6735,2001-03-20,"  I have a couple of questions, Karen  One is a follow-up on   President Parry’s  I’ve wondered for some time in the case of both Argentina and Japan   how one can know when, from the perception of the best policymakers in those countries,   the situation has gotten bad enough to trigger action  In looking at this, my thought was   that it’s not bad enough yet because they think they have a lot of options available to     3/20/01 17  them  I heard you as still expressing skepticism that in their eyes it is bad enough yet to   fix    Well, that’s what I mean by “Is it bad enough to fix yet?”  I   think somebody once said that if you have no options you have no problem  They   apparently still think they have a lot of options, as far as dealing with their people and   getting the people to buy into a solution     Okay, that’s helpful  The other question has to do with   exchange rates because you suggested a hypothesis to me that I thought was very   interesting  What I heard you saying is that expectations that the Federal Reserve either     3/20/01 19  has or will ease enough to stimulate a stronger recovery, combined with expectations that   the ECB has not and will not ease sufficiently, cause the dollar to be stronger and the   euro to be weaker    Okay, but I know that doesn’t show up in any textbook     So I’m wondering whether that reflects some serious   rethinking about the factors that determine exchange rates over time    I wanted to follow up briefly on David Stockton’s response to   Tom Hoenig’s question  One of the alternative simulations you typically included in the   Greenbook last year was a lower NAIRU  I’m not a big fan of the NAIRU as a way of   finding out what the inflation rate is going to be, but if you continued to provide that   alternative simulation with easier monetary policy, what would that say about inflation?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Sometimes it’s hard to know   whether an anecdotal report was intended to be good news or bad news  One of our   directors recently reported that he had gone to a boat show and was told that they had   sold only nine personal watercraft or jet skis this year compared to over a hundred last   year  I said “That’s great”  Then he told me that he had bought one of the nine!    [Laughter]  But that report, together with a Wall Street Journal story about how well the     3/20/01 37  travel and boat show in Columbus had gone, prompted us to call around the country to   find out how strong sales had been at travel and boat shows in January and February    And they were surprisingly strong  In Cleveland the attendance was higher than last year   and better than they had expected  Large boat sales were about the same as last year and   small boat sales were stronger, which surprised the dealers  In Chicago, Detroit, and St   Louis, the attendance also was better than last year  Only the New York show   experienced a small decline in attendance, and our contact said it was because of adverse   weather conditions during the week of the show     We also saw some stories on corrugated paperboard producers, first in the Wall   Street Journal in February, and subsequently in Cincinnati and Cleveland newspapers  So   we did something the journalists probably would consider a dirty trick We called the   same companies, often reaching the same individuals quoted in those stories, to inquire   about conditions in that industry  And most of them disavowed the way their stories had   been portrayed in the articles  They said the situation wasn’t nearly as bad as had been   reported, though perceptions about how fast conditions were improving appeared to differ   somewhat  Most noted a marked increase in sales in March relative to the first two   months of the year, and none of the manufacturers we contacted expected a decline in   sales for the year     More generally, the reports of directors and advisory council members are as   mixed as the data we have been observing  There are pockets of strength and pockets of   weakness  In the case of large truck and steel manufacturers, there is severe weakness   that is expected to last for a couple of years  But interestingly, LTV, which is in   bankruptcy and starting last November had laid off 600 people, already had recalled 400     3/20/01 38  of those workers by early February  They now have 200 former workers who have not   yet been recalled or are reapplying for lower-paying jobs   While the general picture in manufacturing is one of weakness, exceptions   include such firms as air curtain manufacturers, which reported a record backlog of   orders--and interestingly, I thought--a manufacturer of hot tubs and patio furniture  The   latter reported a strong rebound in sales recently  Specifically, our contact at that firm   said that in late September-early October orders hit a wall and simply stopped  He   described the autumn months of 2000 as the worst period he had experienced in the   business  Those horrible months were followed by a flat December and then in January   and February the company had a huge increase--40 percent year over year--in orders for   hot tubs and patio furniture  And this is a firm that has been growing 20 to 30 percent a   year for the last five years   Another company that is headquartered in the District but manufactures and   sells nationwide reported that while orders for construction materials generally had been   down in recent months, orders for decking and siding materials were at record levels in   December and January  They complained about energy costs, of course, but they said   demand was out there  But even the energy sector is mixed  A director reported that a   traveler in eastern and central Kentucky, where they produce coal and gas, will see a lot   of celebratory high fives     Construction in the region also is mixed  Public sector infrastructure spending   is still very strong; another record year for orange barrels is expected  The residential   construction sector is described as good, but the commercial sector is mixed  There is   strong demand for warehouse space, which is in short supply, but industrial construction     3/20/01 39  spending is off significantly and is expected to stay depressed  People in the health-care   industry report that it’s still difficult to hire workers  They are still using recruitment   bonuses and retention bonuses and they say that cost pressures are going to be passed   through to health-care premiums in the period ahead   We looked at all the leisure sectors--the recreation, travel, tourism, and   entertainment businesses--and again found a mixed picture  There were reports,   however, of significant overbuilding of restaurants, very low occupancy rates in hotels   and motels, and some movie theater chains that have overbuilt and will have to retrench   As for the national economy, it now seems reasonably certain to me that the   economy did not continue to slow in the first quarter as it did over the fourth quarter    And I think the Greenbook generally has the direction right in its forecast of real output   growth, though I won’t go along with the staff on the unemployment numbers  I have to   figure out why I don’t go along with that projection; it just doesn’t look right to me    Maybe it’s the sort of thing that Cathy suggested--that some other developments would   occur if that employment pattern begins to materialize   Some of you may have seen the February survey of the National Federation of   Industry and Businesses that was released last week; their index of small business   optimism rose in February  I was especially interested in noting that capital spending   plans had rebounded strongly and also that there was a decline in the percentage of firms   reporting that they had raised or planned to raise prices  The survey also indicated that   credit availability was not a problem  Of all the things we look at, it appears that access   to credit is not a problem confronting this economy       3/20/01 40  If the pace of economic activity of the last quarter and this quarter were likely   to persist, then the current funds rate probably would be too high  But it’s not at all clear   that the current funds rate would be inconsistent with the pace of economic activity that   the Greenbook projects for the second half of this year and 2002  The steep inversion of   the yield curve, especially for maturities under one year--with the one-year bill rate now   even lower than the two-year rate--on the surface does suggest some restraint  But the   explosive growth of the various measures of money and credit does not     On balance, I think our national network of directors and advisory council   members have served us very well during this whole episode  They assured that our   recognition lag was very short in the fourth quarter  We did act promptly, I believe, and   we acted substantially  And now I think our attention is going to have to turn to the   question of when it will be time to pause and let the effects of our actions and the   inherent resiliency of this economy start to work through  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the easing move   today of 50 basis points, but I’m troubled by two things  One, when we use the word   “weakness,” we may think slower growth but others hear decline  And I think that's a   troubling message  If what is heard out there is that we expect further declines in   economic activity, the question then arises, “Why aren't we doing even more?”  I don't   know how we can communicate this concept of slower growth  The second part of that   concern is that at some point, of course, we will reach a position where we feel that with   this move, or lack of a move, the risks are balanced  And I don't see how we say that if   the economy is perceived as growing at less than its potential--if it’s not at full   employment or not at capacity or some such notion  But we're going to have to get to   that point, given the lags in the effects of policy actions on inflation, well before it is   perceived by the public that what we are observing in fact represents a situation of   balanced risks   Finally, I question putting emphasis on high frequency data reports or giving   the public the impression that some information is going to come out in the next six   weeks that is going to carry so much weight with us that we may take an intermeeting   action  That may well be the case; we've done it before  But I don't see the value of   signaling that we're going to be very heavily preoccupied or focused on some report   because that just heightens the interest of the Fed watchers  The wire service types will   be saying, “Which one of these reports is the one that if it flashes in the right color,     3/20/01 100  whatever that color is, is going to trigger an action?”  At some point we need to think   about how we start communicating that we have a long-term focus on maximum growth,   which involves sustaining price stability  "
6754,2001-04-11,"  Mr Chairman, this is Jerry Jordan  I’ll be having a joint   board meeting with all three boards of directors tomorrow, so I’ll get more information of   an anecdotal nature and the thoughts they bring to the meeting on how they see the   situation and what their various contacts say  What information I do have at the moment   comes mostly from meetings with bankers last week  In particular we had separate   meetings with the top executives of three of the largest banking companies in the District    It was their sense that the situation is not continuing to get worse overall; they have   confidence that things are definitely picking up  Some said that their customers thought   there was room for optimism in February but that tended to dissipate in March  In the   words of one banker, they had an early spring  Expectations were that a turn would occur   quickly and when that didn’t seem to materialize, their customers became less optimistic    The automotive sector, of course, is still important in our District  The fact   that automobile sales didn’t drop as much as had been expected just a few months ago   has been a relief to a lot of folks  We know that the problems in steel and heavy trucking   are structural and long-lasting; those headwinds are going to be around for quite a while     4/11/01 19   and there’s not a lot that monetary policy can do about that  It’s going to take a long   period for them to rationalize the scale of their operations  On policy, when I look at the yield curve, the three-month Treasury bill rate is   now the lowest point on the curve  Just a couple of months back the low point was at two   years and last summer it was at five years  At slightly above 4 percent, where the bill rate   is at the moment, I think the funds rate is probably too high at 5 percent  I would be   happy if the funds rate were lower than it is because I do worry that we could become   inadvertently restrictive relative to where the markets are  On the other hand, the act of   cutting the rate sends messages and has implications that I find troubling  So while I   would like the rate to be lower, I don’t know how to get from where it is to where I think   it probably ought to be  And I don’t like the idea that we, whether intentionally or not,   tend to support the notion that there is one particular statistical indicator that causes us to   adjust our policy stance  What I will be monitoring are the trends in the various   monetary and reserve aggregates  Growth in the base has slowed recently  That is not a   desirable development in the current environment and I think that we have to be careful   not to hold the overnight rate artificially high if that’s what is implied by the rest of these   yields  If it turns out that this economy does have a little more resilience and if economic   activity does come back a little more quickly than seems likely in the views of the people   we’re hearing from, then maybe we will get through this period without having to lower   the funds rate further  But it’s a tough call at the moment  "
6796,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, let me relay a comment by one of   the bankers in our District who operates in quite a few states in the Great Lakes region  He said     5/15/01     25   that a year ago the bad news was that there was little e-commerce in the region  This year the   good news is that there is very little e-commerce in the region  He also mentioned discussions he   had with other bankers at a meeting on the West Coast--it was probably the Montgomery   Securities annual event--for large banks  The typical question he was asked by other bankers,   especially those from the western part of the country but even some from the East Coast was    How on earth did your Midwest banking company make any money when the economy in that   region is in the tank?  And he told them that his bank’s profits are very good, its loans are very   good, and that he felt people’s perception about what is going on in the Midwest was quite   different from the reality  Another director made a report that I would put in the silver lining   category  He said that the golf course he occasionally plays is still charging the same $250 green   fees as it did last year, so there’s no inflation there  But the course is not nearly as crowded as it   used to be!  [Laughter]   Last week there was quite a bit of news on the District  The Wall Street Journal had   two front-page stories on our region, one about Cleveland and its labor market and one about the   coal situation in Pikesville, or more generally eastern Kentucky  That latter article dwelled on   the shortage of coal miners and the reluctance of younger people to consider coal mining as an   occupation even at significantly higher starting wages than the alternatives available to them    The discussion then got into issues about how much technology is going into that sector  A   director from the region said that the mining companies are expecting two years of good, strong   demand for coal but they are unwilling to undertake investments that would require a longer   period of higher coal prices and volumes   The article about the Cleveland labor market gave a little different impression of it than   our own so we called some of the people who were cited to check up on that  The article     5/15/01     26   generally gave the impression that manufacturing has lost more jobs than we can confirm and   that the health-care sector has created more jobs than we can confirm  It is the case that   manufacturing has been weak, but it is not continuing to worsen  And we have found notable   expressions of optimism about the second half of the year and beyond  The health-care sector is   investing heavily in new technology and the facilities to house it but it is not adding much in   employment, in part because of tightness in the labor market for that sector  It was reported that   just in the Cleveland metro area alone there are openings for over 1,000 registered nurses and   that many staff support positions for health-care facilities also continue to go unfilled  For all of   Ohio, state officials are now skeptical that the employment/unemployment numbers are accurate    The last two months for which we have data, February and March, showed the unemployment   rate dropping to 38 percent and 35 percent respectively, the lowest since 1970 for the state     Recreation destinations reported that this spring’s attendance has been much stronger   than even last year’s record levels  But our contacts also speculated that because of the energy   crisis people might be seeking their entertainment closer to home  So, oddly enough, they say   the high attendance at these places might be a sign of some economic weakness     Retailers were telling us that the story on imports is mixed  Some of them say that the   long lead times in ordering abroad mean that merchandise they ordered last summer and fall is   still in transit and that if they do see final demand weakening, they will cut domestic orders    They could then end up with a mix of goods that is different from what their customers want    But others have asserted that it is easier to cancel or postpone delivery of foreign-sourced goods   than it is domestic-sourced goods   So, where are we in the District?  Residential construction remains very strong  Motor   vehicle production is down from last year but is better than the manufacturers thought it would     5/15/01     27   be for the second quarter  Government infrastructure spending on roads, bridges, buildings, and   so forth is well above last year’s pace and is still constrained only by the limited availability of   contractors, subcontractors, and workers  The health care sector is building facilities and seeking   to hire people but the lack of available workers is a constraint  The general impression, based on   what we hear and what we see in the news, seems to be that some other people someplace else   must be having a hard time      Let me comment on the national construction situation                                                                                                                              and he reported not only on the region but on his   firm’s experience and outlook from a national perspective  He said that this will be a record year   for them and they expect 2002 to be even better  He noted that while there is some weakness in   and around what he called the Rust Belt region, it is more than offset by strength elsewhere in   the country and outside the United States  In the South and Southeast parts of this country,   construction is booming  Those are areas where they have all the business they can handle in the   construction of facilities for elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities due to   very strong demographics and regional shifts  He said that health care facility construction is   very strong nationally  And there has been no slowdown in spending on entertainment facilities;   his company is building a number of museums, aquariums, and sports and fitness centers  He   does expect a slowdown in professional stadium construction, given the fact that most major   cities now have their two brand new stadiums  But he believes that is being more than offset by   a rise in construction of sports facilities for colleges and universities, a trend he expects to last   for about a decade  And he foresees continued strong bond issuance by construction companies   such as his to finance the organizations that are building some of these facilities     5/15/01     28   Let me turn to the national economy  Listening over the intermeeting period to the   views of directors at our head office and branches as well as some advisory council members on   what it’s going to take to turn this economy around, I was struck by how different perceptions   are on Main Street versus Wall Street  A significant minority of our contacts--not a majority but   still quite a few fairly strong voices--have said that they think we have already gone too far in   our policy efforts to promote recovery and stimulate growth at the expense of potentially higher   future inflation  Roughly one-third of our advisory council members and directors indicated that   no further easing actions were desirable  Of the other two-thirds, views seemed to be about   evenly split between those who thought that an end to the easing should be near and those who   thought that much more easing would be desirable  We can usually identify their policy   preferences just by knowing which companies they are talking about; the latter view is especially   true of metals manufacturers     The current fed funds rate is now more than 30 percent below where it was four and   one-half months ago  The Bluebook presented a range of estimates of where the equilibrium   overnight rate should be, and I hope the staff continues to refine that framework; I found that   very useful  So far what it says is that we have dropped the overnight rate in lock step--with only   a very short lag--with at least an implicit notion of where the equilibrium real rate is  And the   current rate is now at or even a bit below the bottom of that range of estimates  That says to me   that from this point forward extreme caution is warranted in contemplating further easing   actions  Thank you    Thank you  Not only do I not think that disappointing the market--not   doing what is already built into the market--is a bad thing, I think it’s inevitable  We stopped   easing in 1998 when market participants were saying we would move the funds rate down to 3     5/15/01     93   percent  We didn’t  We stopped tightening last spring when they said we were going to raise the   rate to 7-1/2 or 8 percent  We didn’t  And I think there’s going to be another time when we will   disappoint the market’s expectations  I’m afraid the message here will be seen is the same old   message another 50 basis points, another balance of risks statement toward economic weakness,   and the FOMC will come back and do the same thing again in June  So I’d be happier with no   change or a 1/4 point reduction today  But if we’re not going to do that, then I think Bob   McTeer’s idea that the Board should consider taking the discount rate down only 1/4 point might   at least send a different message out of this meeting rather than just relying on speeches to change   that expectation    "
6819,2001-06-26," Does your currency forecast make any explicit assumption about   currency demand as we head toward the end of the year and the launch of the euro as the   currency in Europe?   Well, there has been some anecdotal speculation that the countries   that are outside the euro area--where very large amounts of deutschemarks are held and no   provisions have been made for conversion--may find alternatives in either Federal Reserve notes   or travelers checks or something, at least temporarily  I’ve been told that the price of jewelry, of   diamonds and so forth, is really skyrocketing in Europe  But the word is that large amounts of   Federal Reserve notes also are being used again     6/26-27/01 5   Thank you Let me make a couple of observations and then pose a   different type of question about the international dimensions of this  First, on the observations I   think it is very useful to have these kinds of papers and discussions such as this in light of our   relative ignorance on the subject of productivity  When I look at a time series that we label   “productivity” and reflect on what we know or think we know about output and the other inputs   that produce a result such as this, I wonder what I am supposed to think about it from a   policymaker’s standpoint  But, for example, when I look at Charlie’s Chart 2 and that spike in   1971 and 1972 and the subsequent decline in 1973 and 1974, I recall that a number of things   were going on at the time that I’ve always thought confounded any analysis of that period  In   1972 it was reported at the time--I don't know what the subsequent revisions showed--that real   output supposedly rose 9 percent that year and the GDP deflator rose 2 percent  The GDP   deflator rose only 2 percent because that's what President Nixon’s wage/price control program     6/26-27/01 41   permitted  Then in the subsequent year the control program came off and the price index rose 9   percent or so, and the effect was that output plunged  I've always felt that we ought to average   those years together if we were trying to draw any conclusions because the data as reported   certainly were affected by the on-again/off-again aspect of price controls  Meanwhile, as that   was going on, we had the oil price shock of ’73-’74  I've always believed that those shocks were   better thought of as real wealth losses  They represented a change in international terms of trade;   we moved to a lower production possibility boundary  We all remember the stories about 747s   being grounded, and it had nothing to do with how new those aircraft were  They were   economically obsolete given the input price; their economic life was shortened dramatically quite   irrespective of their physical life and their accounting life  So we got a plunge in output in 1973­  74   I also remember the mothballed aluminum smelters around 1978-79  Those facilities   were brand new but they weren’t viable any more, given the level of gas prices  I mention that   now, of course, because we’ve had volatility in energy prices and we've had some other rather   odd developments  The State of California by itself is the world's fourth or fifth largest economy   and it is 15 percent of our economy  If it were to continue the same energy policies and produce   no output or a decline in output, except for suggesting that it should secede and not distort our   data, I don't know what I should think about that situation in terms of productivity  We haven't   lost technology We haven't become dumber or anything like that; it's just that the state has an   incompetent governor  So if you have any observations about that, I’d like to hear them    On the international side, as I read these papers, it was easy for me to fall into thinking   about our economy as a closed economy  But I do know--and you mentioned investment--that   we have some very large corporations that invest across the border--in Canada and Mexico and     6/26-27/01 42   even in Taiwan And I don't know what to think about the pace at which they're transferring   knowledge and technology and how that feeds back into our economy  So to make my question   simple, suppose all innovation--all breakthroughs in technology or creativity or knowledge-­  occurred in the United States and that the only way other countries acquired a new product or   knowledge was through our transferring it How would that come back into our economy--as an   increase in our wealth that would somehow show up in a time series of productivity?   So if we are importing the final product, partial analysis would say   that that's going to enter negatively in our GDP numbers   Unless in the time period I'm looking at the exchange translation   effects of that are swamping that reflow of income  Because we have the innovation going on   here, our wealth increases, capital flows in, our currency rises, and we get a lower rate of return   at least for that time period on our foreign capital investment   If our measurement is right and we get the J-curve effects     6/26-27/01 43   May I follow up on that?  That answer suggests to me that the way   you think about that event is similar to the way some view the ’70s, when we had enormous   capital expenditures--mandated expenditures--on clean air and clean water, but they were not   output-enhancing capital expenditures Some people at least asserted that the decline in trend   productivity growth at that time occurred because we were producing something, ie cleaner air-­  or more precisely, not producing dirty air and dirty water--but the associated capital spending   didn't add to what got sold in the marketplace   Thank you David, on Chart 5 labeled “Fiscal Policy,” in the lower   right-hand corner the unified budget surplus for fiscal year 2001--for this fiscal year, which is   three-fourths over--is shown as $185 billion  I recall seeing the other day that the Treasury   reported a surplus for the month of April alone of $190 billion  Am I right that from this point   forward, the combination of the spending growth that you and others have assumed--the rebates   and the lower withholdings--means that outlays will exceed receipts for the balance of the   calendar year?   Yes, but from that standpoint--abstracting from the fiscal year and the   full calendar year issue--your interpretation would be that at least for the near term there is going   to be less fiscal drag and more fiscal stimulus for the balance of the calendar year?   Part of the reason I'm asking is because the huge tax payments that   were made in April by businesses and households, which were coming out of the private   economy and into the government side of the economy, are behind us now  From this point   forward, at least for the calendar year, we don't have that flow impact   Thank you Now that I have volunteered, all I have to do is find my   papers! [Laughter] Sorry, I wasn't quite prepared  I would like to comment first by providing   some general impressions about economic activity in the District  As one of our Business   Advisory Council members said, we are “bumping along the bottom”  Activity is not continuing   to decline but it is not rebounding  And except for the steel industry, I think that generally   summarizes what directors and Advisory Council members think about the situation in our   region   We had reports from a corrugated box company and separately from a freight delivery   company that are both headquartered in the District of a rebound in the second quarter after steep   declines in the first quarter Now, one assertion was that corrugated paper boxes are the best   indicator there is, but the Chairman should know better than I whether that’s true  A supplier of   siding, decking, window materials, and PVC pipe--and this is a company that manufactures and   sells nationwide as well as a bit internationally--reported that they had experienced a very recent   pickup in orders  Accordingly, they are hopeful that the second half will be better than the first   half A manufacturer of tapes and glue said that demand for industrial uses of their products   continued to decline but consumer business was flat or up slightly  A contact from a company   that supplies materials for motor vehicle parts said that demand from the US Big Three was   down while demand from transplants and from plants in Mexico was up  He also noted that their   business in Europe was weaker in the second quarter than it had been in the first quarter     6/26-27/01 80   Reports from important industries in Kentucky were mixed, and some were especially   interesting First, the state's budget is being bailed out in a sense by strong coal severance tax   revenue The complaint in that area is still the lack of coal miners, but other than that business is   terrific Second, it is estimated that 25 percent of this year's crop of thoroughbred colts died or   were born dead Those deaths had something to do with cherry blossoms and spring and   caterpillars, and it's a long story  Industry observers estimate that over the next three years that   will cost Kentucky thoroughbred farms a half billion dollars  Now that the cause is known, they   think this year’s experience will not be repeated  But of course nothing can be done about the   losses that have occurred already   As for retail companies, Federated is headquartered in our District and we have   grocery companies and other retailers as well Federated reports--and this relates to its stores   nationwide rather than just in our District--that apparel sales were down sharply and are expected   to continue to decline until the first part of next year  But Kroger’s says that grocery store sales   are at record levels and they are confident of sustained growth  In fact, a director from a dry   goods company said that the only explanation he could come up with is that people must be   buying food in stores and cooking it at home  He cited that as a sign of how bad things are   A major landscaping company, Scott’s, said that its spring sales were the weakest in   years Layoffs continue to be announced in manufacturing but we have had some reports of   continued labor shortages in other sectors  A large regional bank noted that it has about 500 jobs   open company-wide and that it is especially difficult to hire for its urban area locations  Some   hospital health-care organizations report openings in as many as 40 percent of their staff   positions, including the housekeeping staff  A company that operates nationally and employs   6,000 workers in the tree-surgery and maintenance business reported that worker turnover is still     6/26-27/01 81   very high; it sometimes runs as much as 40 percent  They continue to use recruitment, retention,   and relocation bonuses in their efforts to fill openings  Our contact said that all segments of their   business in all regions are strong except for the California power companies, which are   delinquent and refuse to pay their bills It continues to be hard to recruit and retain long-haul   truck drivers High fuel costs had been affecting those companies but a contact at one firm at   least said that they were now getting some relief on earnings because fuel costs have come down   a bit   Let me turn to the national situation  It seems to me that at a time when the problems   of some industries and sectors are so clearly due to excess supply--structural kinds of problems,   whether domestic or foreign--there is a risk that adding abundant liquidity will cause overheating   in those areas such as housing that continue to be strong  But that liquidity is not going to   provide any relief to other troubled sectors  Neither the price nor the availability of credit is a   problem for the smaller companies, for the truck manufacturers or telecommunications firms, the   furniture or textile companies in Al Broaddus’s District, or the personal computer and electronics   firms in Texas or elsewhere  The excess retail space is not going to be quickly absorbed as a   consequence of increased monetary stimulus  And adding further to the already ample liquidity   in the financial system is not going to cause apparel sales to rebound suddenly    We seem to have three sources of stimulus in the works right now  We have monetary   stimulus and fiscal stimulus  Moreover, after two years of higher energy prices, those prices are   now declining and, from what I hear, they may decline even more than the staff forecast suggests    Certainly, some adverse effects on households and various industries, sectors, and regions--not   only in our country but around the world--occurred when energy prices were high, most notably   in our own PRC, the People's Republic of California  [Laughter]  But the effects were not all     6/26-27/01 82   adverse either for the United States or elsewhere  The increase in energy prices did effectively   communicate the need for greater energy supply as well as the value of innovation in energy   conservation It is gratifying to see that we have had a significant increase in energy production,   and a lot more will be coming on stream over the next year or so, especially electric capacity    Also, some truly remarkable efficiencies in energy consumption are being achieved by   commercial enterprises, thanks to better management  So we are now in a period of falling   energy prices, in large part a reflection of the substantially greater aggregate supply of energy,   not declining demand  And that is going to increase both our income and our output  We have   monetary stimulus, of course; I don't need to say anything more about that And finally, we have   fiscal stimulus   American businesses and households are going to get four “postcards” over the next   nine months to give them an idea of how permanent the tax reduction is  Starting next week, they   will see a reduction in withholding  Quantitatively it may not be large, but it is a message    Sometime in the next two or three months they will get a check in the mail  Whether it's large or   not, it will be a message  On January 1st of next year they will see a further withholding   reduction, and then next April they will either pay smaller taxes or get a bigger refund than   previously So in nine months’ time people will get four messages that their taxes, state as well   as Federal, are going down Over the prior months, the first four or five months of this year,   American people sent a lot of checks to their government--many of them large checks  A lot of   those tax payments were on earnings realized in the year 2000, and people may not even have the   money anymore In some cases, they probably had to borrow to pay their taxes  So over the first   four months of this year, as my question yesterday was trying to imply, households as well as   businesses were feeling the pinch of having to shift a great deal of cash to Uncle Sam and their     6/26-27/01 83   state and local governments  That period is now over for this calendar year  From this point on,   basically we are going to have fiscal stimulus in the pipeline, augmented by monetary stimulus   and falling energy prices We'd better be careful  Thank you   I have two questions, Don But first let me follow up on the exchange   between you and Tom Hoenig  At some point we have to back up our confidence in the future   with action or lack thereof, not just our words   The Bluebook does a remarkable job of putting together a lot of   options for us to consider depending on the assumptions we want to make  I know you can't put   in 17 alternatives to satisfy all 17 of us, but you are getting close  If I want to be a productivity   optimist as in Chart 6, then, of course, I take seriously the kind of caution that suggests  That by   itself, on the basis of partial analysis at least, says that we might have to consider going in the   other direction sooner and by more than under other assumptions  But I also believe that the   labor markets have been influenced in a fundamental way by a sustained low inflation   environment and by a pickup in productivity in technology So if I also want to be a long-run   NAIRU optimist and believe that the downward move in the natural rate is permanent and not   just transient, do those two offset?   My other question relates to the fact that I share the concerns Bill   Poole cited about growth in the various money and credit aggregates being extraordinarily rapid    And, of course, history suggests--whether it's relevant to the future or not--that to ignore money   growth is at our peril Are you comfortable in looking at and understanding those money   numbers in a way that says they are not a risk?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  A year ago at this time when we came   into the meeting we had the hope from the prior meeting that we would not need to move again    We had made a 50 basis point increase in May last year and by the time of our June meeting   people expected that we would move the rate up more  We hoped that we wouldn't have to do   that when we came to that meeting  The outside pressures and expectations on us were that we   were going to do considerably more tightening, and we disappointed those expectations  So, I   was hoping for a repeat--a mirror image of that--in that after the May action our approach would   be symmetrical to the one we followed last year and we wouldn’t have to move again at this   meeting  But maybe the risks are not symmetrical or the economy; I don't know  I do agree that   we have to be as vigilant to lean against booms as we do the subsequent inevitable busts  When     6/26-27/01 151   we discuss the balance of risks for the press statement, we make some remarks that can have no   possible bearing on a statement that's already been drafted  Nevertheless, the risks that we see on   the downside are fairly narrow and we have to worry about the risks spreading  Not all sectors,   industries, and regions of this economy are in fact showing weakness; some are showing   remarkable robustness  And I think we have to try to be a little clearer in the statements that   some of us make--perhaps you can do so in your testimony, Mr Chairman--that what we have   seen, as you and Bill Poole have said, is fairly unique  There is no weakness in the auto sector or   the housing sector--areas that have been associated in the past with a weak economy and   recessions  Therefore, our ability to respond to this type of weakness and the risks involved is   different Moreover, we are not the only game in town  We do have fiscal stimulus and we do   have declining energy prices So there is a lot of easing in the pipeline  "
6847,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, a note on agriculture  Corn crops in   the region are coming in very strong, as evidenced in the last couple of weeks by roadside signs   offering a dozen ears of fresh picked corn for 50 cents  I thought that was a real bargain until I   went across Lake Erie to Ontario and saw outside a store large crates of corn with a sign that said   “Free fresh picked corn Take all you want”  [Laughter] I don’t know what the purchasing   power parity of this means!   A year ago at this time we were hearing more quickly about weakness in the area that   we serve than I think was the case in other parts of the country  That may have been a reflection   of the rising energy prices; we are very energy intensive in many ways in a lot of our sectors and   industries And other factors were at work, certainly in the case of metals  I didn’t go back to   check but I don’t recall that our Beige Book description of conditions in the District was as   negative as what I was hearing from directors and advisory council members at that time  But   this time I did look at our Beige Book to compare it with the reports I was getting from our   directors and advisory councils, and it seemed a bit out of sync  So at the beginning of August I   sent a letter to all current Small Business Advisory Council members and to about 15 or so   former members who are in manufacturing companies and nonresidential construction to try to   get a sense of their views All of the responses were coming in last week and we also met then     8/21/01 37   with our directors  The assessment of conditions in the District by these contacts was not as   negative as our Beige Book report  Certainly, portions of manufacturing in the District are still   weak Some of the big companies like Timken and Diebold are still reporting weakness  But a   lot of the smaller firms are not  Outside of metals, the tone was much more upbeat than what I   had been hearing   We contacted every motor vehicle assembly plant in the District, including those for   trucks, as well as every parts supplier and asked  “How does it look, coming into the second   half?” Ford is very weak--Ford kept several plants idle, mainly those producing commercial   vans and minivans--but the rest are strong  Toyota and Honda are running flat out, well above   last year; and both GM and Chrysler are operating at levels above last year and they remain   optimistic  So at least from our District’s perspective, the motor vehicle sector doesn’t look as   negative as the Board staff is assuming in its forecast   Because of the articles I mentioned last time about the corrugated box industry being a   leading indicator, we also contacted 14 corrugated box suppliers in the District and asked how   things look Those that supply mainly consumer product companies in the District, such as   Proctor and Gamble, are doing quite well  Those that supply motor vehicles or metals-related   industries or tech firms are not doing nearly as well, and certainly not as well as last year    Construction is still strong in our region Residential construction, of course, is very   strong everywhere, but our contacts in the nonresidential sector say that public works and   utilities also are continuing to expand  In Kentucky our contacts report about a 5 percent   increase for the first half of the year versus a year ago  In Western Ohio and Indiana,   nonresidential construction is up 15 percent from a year ago  Our contacts noted that multi-  family housing--well, that does get into residential--was especially strong, up 40 percent  But     8/21/01 38   they say it's the health-care sector that is providing them with a lot of new contracts  As for   other nonresidential construction, such as highway and bridge construction, several companies   say that their problem is just a matter of getting labor to fulfill their contracts  Mostly their   complaints are about the lack of skilled labor to operate the type of construction equipment that   they are now employing   A producer of air curtains in Western Pennsylvania informed us that July was the best   month in the company's history by a big margin; both domestic and foreign demand has been   strong We also contacted a company that produces controls for industrial motors and supplies to   firms throughout the United States as well as around the world  Their story may be more a   comment on technology and what's in store for future capital spending rather than just general   business Our contacts said that for the first half of the year their business was up over 30   percent versus a year ago  They attribute that to the fact that they implemented an e-business on-  line ordering system that has allowed them to increase their productivity since the beginning of   2000 by about 25 to 30 percent across all product lines  They say that 80 percent of their   operations now involve orders that are coming in on-line for just-in-time delivery  They have   been able to decrease their prices across product lines by 7 to 10 percent while increasing their   profit margins and they have been expanding their workforce because of the strength of their   business Their expectation is that they won't be able to sustain all of this because they expect   their competitors to implement these same kinds of technologies and close the gap that they   believe they now enjoy   Companies that supply equipment for the health-care sector say they are doing very   well, as are those that are involved in large, highly automated, and very expensive coal mining   equipment  The problem for the latter is getting labor to work the very sophisticated coal mining     8/21/01 39   machinery, some of which cost $5 million per machine  Business for a company that produces   titanium parts for the aerospace industry is up 25 percent versus last year  And their sales of   parts to the medical industry--knee joints and that sort of thing--are up 20 percent  That firm has   five openings for machinists but no qualified applicants  Pittsburgh Plate Glass sales to the   aerospace and housing sectors are strong but sales to the motor vehicle industry are weak   The retail sector had been very negative but turned better in early August  Some of   our directors--especially from Federated and other retailing companies--were very bearish  They   are hopeful now that the back-to-school sales are going to be better than they had planned for   coming into the second half of the year     Representatives from the school districts in North Ohio in particular said that they have a   lot of unfilled teacher positions as the back-to-school period arrives--school started last week in   our area of the country--and they cite aggressive recruiting of Ohio teachers by California   schools as one reason In response, Ohio schools are going to recruit in India  [Laughter]   On the inflation front, tuition is up 9 to 10 percent at almost all of the public colleges and   universities in the District We might be able to justify some of the increases in medical care   costs as quality improvements, but I doubt that’s true in higher education  [Laughter]   On the national economy, midway through this third quarter it now appears that from a   broad GDP perspective, the second half is going to be slower than had been hoped at the   beginning of the year  But it’s notable that two very important sectors of the economy, housing   and motor vehicles, have been considerably stronger than had been expected at the start of the   year Moreover, employment has held up better than expected  The unemployment rate is lower   than had been feared And what appeared to be a dangerously destabilizing situation in natural   gas and electric power six or seven months ago has eased dramatically  Even the current account     8/21/01 40   deficit in the first half came in much smaller than expected  Now, it is true that inventories   plunged much more dramatically than had been expected, but that's not necessarily a bad thing    We were told that steel inventories are down dramatically because of a 25 percent drop in   imports   The biggest miss in most forecasts was in business fixed investment, the same   category that accounted for the tendency of forecasters to underestimate the strength in the prior   expansion Risks outside the United States seem to have intensified; Argentina, Japan, and even   the euro area are all considerable risks  And there is no doubt that events will occur to which we   will have to respond But the solutions to those developments in advance of their occurrence are   not going to be influenced by whether the US overnight interbank rate is a little higher or a little   lower There must come a time when we have to demonstrate confidence that with patience the   magic of the marketplace will again produce bigger GDP numbers  Thank you   Thank you First, I’ll make sure that before the next meeting we do   get not only some mixed reports but also some strong reports!  [Laughter]  Some of my Bank’s   directors have turned from being very bearish two or three months ago to saying, “Wait a minute,   things are starting to improve”  So I’ll make sure you hear some of those reports, too     I associate myself with some of the comments of Jack Guynn, Al Broaddus, and Gary   Stern I, too, worry about the concerns they mentioned  But I also believe the risk is high that an   external event will materialize that will require us to respond  We’re going to have to respond to   it from wherever we are, and we may have to respond very aggressively So I’d rather have   some more dry powder to be used because there’s nothing that a little adjustment in our domestic   policy can do to alleviate the situations external to the United States that we view as most   threatening And I don’t see that small adjustments in our policy stance are likely to be very   helpful in turning around the psychology within the United States  I think your analysis is right   about capital spending; it will start to improve once the risk starts to narrow  So how do we get   from where we are to that process where the risk premium starts to narrow and we return to   business as usual?  I don’t know, so I too worry about an exit strategy  "
6867,2001-09-13," Mr Chairman, this is Jerry Jordan in Cleveland  As we   demonstrated yesterday, our ability to inject liquidity into the system as needed is very,   very large It appears to me--with the combination of discount window borrowing   yesterday, RPs, overnight overdrafts, and the Fed float--that we’ve added about $100   billion worth of liquidity So it would be hard to imagine the availability of liquidity as   an issue And for the sophisticated people in the financial industry, I think that has   already had a very calming effect  I think anything that the FOMC might do with regard   to rates would be mainly with a mind to sending a message to Main Street, if that is   deemed necessary  But I doubt very much that it’s needed for Wall Street      9/13/01 21  "
6907,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also thought that the Desk   performed extraordinarily  No matter what kinds of contingency scenarios one might   have envisioned, this was way beyond what anyone would have imagined  So the Desk’s   performance really was remarkable   I was studying Charts 6, 7, and 8, especially in light of the FOMC’s statement   that the funds rate might trade below its target for a while, which you mentioned, Dino    It is clearly evident on Chart 6 that for four trading days you did let that happen  But I   can interpret the chart as saying that after about four days you pretty much returned to   operating in the way you normally do on a daily basis, letting the funds rate be both a   floor and a ceiling Part of my question is  Is that a fair characterization?  Also, I’d like   to ask you to say a little more about the way you conduct daily operations in terms of   factors supplying and absorbing reserves What led you to the conclusion that it would   not continue to be appropriate to allow the funds rate to trade below its target?  The   reason I raise that is because in periods of heightened anxiety, liquidity preference, risk   aversion, or other characterizations of these reactions we can’t really observe, it would be   very hard to know where an equilibrium is  The question really is  How comfortable   were you in starting to view the target funds rate as a floor in that environment?     10/2/01 9   Well, that was helpful  The reason I’m raising the issue is that   intuitively I think one thing that should not be allowed to happen is for the stock of   central bank liquidity to decline inadvertently because of operational procedures  So I   was judgmentally struggling with the data in the Board’s H41 release for the week   ending last Wednesday versus the week ending September 5th, the week before the crisis    I don’t know what the seasonal factors were doing during that period--I can guess, though   I don’t know for sure--but to see the monetary base actually lower for the week ended last   Wednesday than it was the week ended September 5th alarmed me a bit  I questioned   whether that is something I would want to see happen  If heightened anxiety among   other factors caused the natural equilibrium level to be very low--though I don’t know   where that level is--I don’t think we would want to see our operating procedures result in   the contraction of central bank liquidity   Yes, and I can understand liquidity coming down from the   elevated levels immediately after the attacks  But I was comparing the recent figures   with those in the week before the attacks, the week ending September 5th That week   may have been atypical because it included the Labor Day weekend; I can’t readily make   a judgment on that  But I was looking at this in terms of wanting to be comfortable with   our position going forward We don’t know what’s going to happen or what the next   terrorist event is going to be, but we can expect heightened anxieties, a preference for   liquidity, and risk aversion Those are all psychological factors that we really can’t   quantify And we wouldn’t want those things to cause us inadvertently to produce less   central bank liquidity than we think is appropriate  Intuitively I think the demand for   central bank liquidity has had to go up, so I am concerned to see this contraction in   supply   Thank you   Karen, I want to ask you to say a little more about Japan  You   mentioned that after the Committee’s action on September 17th eight central banks eased   policy Well, that list wouldn’t include Japan because in their case there was nothing to   announce in terms of a rate cut  For at least some six months now they have been talking   about quantitative easing and whether they have made that real or not certainly is   questionable Then you mentioned that fiscal policy in Japan could be contractionary  I   might conclude that a contractionary Japanese fiscal policy would be stimulative because   they’ve had 10 years of pushing on the fiscal strings with no effect, unless one thinks the   economy would have been worse without that  One can look at the results of what has     10/2/01 24   been done over the last decade on the fiscal side and say that the Japanese people are all   Ricardian The more the government borrows and spends, the more its people don’t   spend; they save, and the government’s effort comes to nothing  But as Dino mentioned,   last week the government did more than double the amount of current account balances   from 6 trillion to 12 trillion yen  So I would think the important question for Japan is    Are they going to unwind it or are they going to continue on what seems to be   quantitatively a very stimulative monetary policy?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin with autos  Last   week on an Executive Committee conference call one of our directors, a banker, reported   on a conversation with one of his customers, an auto dealer  The dealer told the banker   that over the prior weekend, September 22-23, only four customers even came into the     10/2/01 60   showroom and he had no sales at all  We, of course, were interested in following up on   that, so people on our staff called auto dealers around the District yesterday to get   information on their traffic and sales this past weekend  Comparing notes on what they   heard, the staff’s general consensus was that auto dealers were happily surprised not only   by how much traffic they had but by how strong sales were for the weekend    Nevertheless, when asked how sales were likely to come out for the month overall, the   typical response was that sales were down about 20 to 25 percent versus a year ago    However, and this is a point I’m going to come back to in a moment, it is very hard to   discern a trend in anything at this stage and will be until the passage of a little more time   Another of our directors runs a company that makes pastries both for retail use   and for what they call institutional use--that is, sales to restaurants and airlines  Last   week she said that all six of her airline customers had called and cancelled all orders for   onboard service for the foreseeable future  Two of the company’s other lines are   corporate gift giving, which usually involves gifts to employees or suppliers, and   individual gift giving by retail customers  They have had strong sales in individual gifts   of pastries but a 50 percent drop in orders from corporations  So one can’t draw   conclusions about any overall trend from that     We’ve been staying in weekly contact with representatives of Federated   Department Stores  As you know, of course, Federated reported very sharp declines in   sales immediately after September 11th This last weekend, for the four-day selling   period Thursday through Sunday, sales were back on plan except in New York City    Again, one cannot discern any trend from that because for the month overall sales will be   down very considerably  Our contacts were very encouraged, however--we talked to     10/2/01 61   them yesterday--by the volume of traffic and sales over the weekend  Nevertheless, they   now expect the fourth quarter to be weaker than previously anticipated  There’s not   much they can do about that They are currently ordering for next year and they’re going   to order less for the spring than they previously thought they would   Yesterday I received the raw data and a preliminary summary of the September   survey of the National Federation of Independent Businesses  You know how they do   that survey; through the course of the month they get responses to a lot of different   questions and then they try to distill the information and summarize it  Those data, too,   show the difficulty of drawing any conclusions about the trend  Almost half of the   responses they received were dated prior to September 11th and a little over half were   dated after September 11th Based on the survey responses dated prior to the 11th, the   analysts would have drawn the conclusion, given the firmness in the July and August   data, that September would have marked the third month in a row of an improving trend    They would have been tempted to interpret that as indicating that activity had seen its low   point The data dropped off dramatically, of course, in the post-September 11th reports   If one tried to average together the two sub-samples the results would be nonsense    Neither period is going to characterize the month  And that’s where we are stuck We   can’t conclude anything about the August to September data per se  We really have to   view this situation as a break in the series and try to find a new base, a new place to start   and maybe see a trend forming  But that’s going to take a little more time for any dataset     Turning to the national economy, I have no idea what the national income   accounts numbers are going to add up to for the foreseeable future, either from the   product side or from the income side, let alone how they will break down for various     10/2/01 62   sectors and regions and so on But I don’t think that’s really the biggest challenge we   have A number of people have mentioned in one way or another that uncertainty is an   issue Not long ago I thought most of the uncertainties we had to worry about involved   developments that might occur outside the United States--perhaps involving Argentina or   Japan or the launch of the euro or something else  Those concerns have not gone away   entirely but obviously uncertainties within our country have suddenly jumped to the top   of the list of things we’re uncertain about  It may well be that we will escape some   potential problems in the international arena  Maybe Argentine will not default and spark   a crisis Maybe Japan has turned a policy corner; maybe the mark-to-market of equity   portfolios of their banks starting yesterday will not cause serious problems in their   banking industry  Maybe the launch of the euro will go well  Nevertheless, it seems to   me that we’re going to face a protracted period of waxing and waning of anxieties, with   good justification I would not attach the term “irrational” to the anxiety  I think it is   probably very rational But it’s difficult if not impossible to quantify, and certainly we   can’t observe it   The Committee’s press statement of September 17th said that we recognized   that the actual federal funds rate might be below its target rate on occasion in these   unusual circumstances  I was very pleased about the inclusion of that wording and I   thought it might continue to be needed in our statements for some time  We’ve had   decisionmaking periods in our history when the greatest uncertainties were about   inflation and inflation psychology  And in those periods we found that it was especially   difficult to draw any conclusion from movements in nominal magnitudes, so instead we   resorted to paying more attention to--if not targeting outright--quantitative magnitudes      10/2/01 63   For exactly the opposite reasons relating to the difficulty of observing inflation   psychology, I think in this period of heightened anxiety we have to think along the same   lines If we don’t go all the way to quantity targeting I’d at least like to think about a   proviso clause as to what we’re willing to see happen to nominal interest rates, especially   the overnight interbank rate   I don’t expect that at this meeting we’re going to change the statement that   accompanies our announcement  But the statement that the risks are weighted mainly   toward conditions that may generate economic weakness has become in effect a proviso   clause It says that if we get more weak data, the FOMC may cut the overnight interbank   rate some more  If the stated funds rate target is not producing an expansion in central   bank liquidity, the monetary base, I would prefer to think in terms of our being willing to   let the rate drift lower  The one thing that we certainly would not want to see, as I was   suggesting earlier in questioning Dino, is a contraction in the monetary base  In fact, not   only should growth in the base not be negative, it should be adequate to assure that we   accommodate the demand we believe exists for base money  Thank you   I support the 50 basis point reduction in the target rate today    But for the period between now and the next meeting, I think the statement that was   included in our announcement of the 17th is probably going to be needed again As the   President said, the terrorists decided when and how this started  The United States and its   allies will decide when and how it ends We don’t know when that’s going to be  If   there is another occasion of greatly heightened anxiety, I would hope that the Desk would   again be willing to let the funds rate trade as low as necessary to provide adequate   liquidity  "
6931,2001-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Listening to everyone who has spoken so far   leads me to feel that it’s not much easier today than it was five weeks ago to know what to make of   either the economic reports or the anecdotal information available to us  I come to each of these   meetings hoping there will be less uncertainty than the last time--and last time was uncertain   enough--but that doesn’t seem to have been the case today based on our go-around   About 150 years ago a clever economist made a reputation for himself by talking about   the unseen versus the seen He had a lot of fun talking about those things that were not so obvious,   but rather important to think about  Of course, that concept wasn’t new with him  It was in the   works of Copernicus and Ptolemy also  Nevertheless, what people are not doing at all or are doing   less of is not news to any of us However, what they are doing instead--if we can find out what it is--   is of interest and might give us some clues  For instance, based on a lead from one of our directors   we found that ticket sales for the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus in the last two weeks   of October at Cleveland’s Gund Arena were 10 percent higher than a year ago  So apparently people        11/6/01 55   are doing something for the family, which seems to be consistent with other things we’ve heard  In   fact, both a member of our advisory council and one of our directors reported that the composition of   consumption spending that they have been seeing is consistent with the notion of a cocooning effect    A couple of remarks by previous speakers support that notion--for instance, the spending on home   improvements and durable goods for one’s home  I don’t know whether the car sales phenomenon   goes with that too or not   A company that produces security glass for both businesses and residences reported that   they were already having a very strong year and they experienced a sharp increase in orders after   September 11th Our contact said that all four of the firm’s plants are running at capacity and their   backlogs are lengthening Also, the health-care sector has generally boosted capital spending since   September 11th, both for facilities and equipment  My contacts indicate that the expenditures are   primarily for emergency room facilities   As for the retail sector, we stay in contact with Federated department stores and they   reported that their October sales were down year-over-year but the decline was considerably smaller   than they experienced in September and much less than they had expected based on what happened   immediately after September 11th Their thinking now, looking ahead to this quarter, is that they   will finish the year down 6 percent from the fourth quarter of last year  They’ve revised down their   expectations for the spring to a 2 percent decline, year-over-year, which is a smaller decline than   they were thinking a few weeks ago And for the second half of next year they have projected a 6   percent increase year-over-year  Our contacts at both Kohls and Federated told us that they now   expect stronger year-end gift giving sales than they had previously  They analyzed the composition   of sales over Halloween and now believe the desire to give gifts is much stronger than before, which   may also be related somewhat to the cocooning effect       11/6/01 56   Tying in with some of the remarks made earlier about the uncertainty regarding what is   going on with auto sales, auto dealers in our District think that sales will fall very quickly  They said   their strategy is not to have any inventory on December 31st One director, continuing in the good   news vein, said that Bob Evans, Applebee’s, and Ruby Tuesday’s all had the strongest September in   their history, which is consistent with people driving to places instead of flying to Florida, for   example  The bad news side of that is that auto accidents are probably up!     One of the sources we’ve been looking at is a company called Telecheck, which has   270,000 outlets across the country that report on purchases by checks  The data are analyzed now by   a former                                                It’s a rather interesting report  Sales in New York City,   which is a big market and heavily weighted, were down 5 percent October over October  Overall   sales in New York State were down about 1 percent  Those were the only declines recorded in the   survey either by metropolitan area or on the state level  The Southeast was the strongest region, led   by Louisiana and by New Orleans in particular  Maybe it’s those casinos!  One of the strongest   states in the survey was Ohio, where sales increases were well above those in California  And the   metropolitan area of Cleveland was second only in strength to New Orleans  So we’re not quite up   there at the top, but we’re pretty close   Eleven years ago at this time, looking ahead to Desert Storm and in the midst of Desert   Shield, it seemed that both businesses and households went into a mode of postpone the postponable    The attitude was “Don’t do it now if you don’t have to; wait and see what is going to happen”  We   met with quite a few groups in recent weeks, including our directors, advisory councils, and the   senior credit officers of all the large banks in the District, and asked them whether they see a similar   response today Confirming what we’re seeing in the numbers, the answer was “yes” for businesses   but “no” for households How does one explain that to a large extent the business sector, especially        11/6/01 57   manufacturing companies, seems to have gone into a postpone and wait-and-see mode while   households have not?  Generally, the initial response among our contacts was  “Apparently my   spouse doesn’t read the same things I do!”  But upon further discussion they said no, in fact it’s the   opposite The spouse usually says  “Haven’t you read about unemployment and the bad economy?   It’s our duty to go out and spend” Apparently businesses don’t think the same way        In our meeting last week with senior credit officers I asked them to imagine that a year   ago, when making their budget plans for 2001, they had accurately forecast the economic situation   of today in terms of broad measures of output, employment, and so on  With an accurate forecast of   the macro economy I wondered what they would have expected with regard to their consumer loan   portfolio They said they would have projected a substantially worse outcome  They would have   assumed a very negative hit to the consumer portfolio, but that has not happened  Asked why, they   suggested that the refinancing boom might be a factor, with the lengthening of maturities and, of   course, lower interest rates One banker commented that his bank’s mortgage department is buried    The general view is that household debt service burdens are actually lower now than they were a   year ago If that could be confirmed, I would think that’s pretty good news  They also reported that   their commercial real estate portfolios were in much better shape than they would have thought; in   fact they described them as excellent, which is quite different from the experience 10 or 11 years   ago I asked about car loans, expecting that there weren’t any  But they said car loans are in fact   still increasing I had forgotten about imports and transplants, such as Honda, which did not offer   zero percent financing Honda didn’t go that route because it doesn’t like it and thinks it’s a mistake   Toyota and in fact many of the DaimlerChrysler models were not included in the zero percent   financing deals either And Jeep, for instance, is producing a Toledo model for which they can’t   keep up with the demand  Moreover, the loan officers made a point that is obvious, but I hadn’t     11/6/01 58   thought about it With every new car sale, a used car sale almost always occurs too, and the banks   often finance those purchases   Let me make some general comments on economic policy actions and the performance of   the macro economy  It seems to me that a prescription for policy should be derived from a   diagnosis We never see all regions, sectors, and industries of the economy moving up or moving   down together There have been times in past history when we’ve seen weakness in sectors like   housing and autos Those situations often warrant a prescription of easier monetary policy; lower   financing rates may seem appropriate  When I look at the fiscal policy under consideration today--  and having listened to the staff this morning regarding the uncertainties about it--it’s very hard to   understand what might be going on, in the way of economic thinking at least  I don’t know how   what is being proposed or considered by the Congress is going to help any of the problems that we   actually see now in the economy  It’s easy to understand the need for separation of powers in the   branches of government  And it’s easy to understand that members of Congress want to raise their   hands and vote for something  They want to be perceived as being a part of the solution  But it’s   not at all clear to me that anything that is being proposed under the banner of fiscal action is going to   be on balance constructive That assessment may be derived from my general bias in that I’ve   always been skeptical about the thrust of fiscal policy actions  But I could easily talk myself into   believing that the fiscal actions currently under consideration will do more harm than good   On monetary policy I distinguish between the level of the fed funds rate and the reactions   associated with announcements of changing it  The level, of course, is important because we need to   know where the funds rate stands relative to some perception of the natural rate  That’s crucial in   assessing whether we are injecting a sufficient amount of liquidity for the macroeconomic   circumstances to achieve the outcome we want  That’s one issue  I look at where we are and     11/6/01 59   evaluate other information to tell me whether I think the funds rate level is appropriate or not    That’s quite different from the issue of announcements of the Committee’s decisions to change the   rate, which show up in the headline news When I engage in the debate between “keep the powder   dry” versus “take preemptive action,” I think in terms of how many more announcements we might   want to be able to make  That would lead me to suggest one-eighth of a point changes in the funds   rate as more appropriate at this juncture because then we would capture more headlines  But that has   nothing to do with whether I believe the current stance of policy is sufficiently stimulative or not     Finally, my thinking is that over time the Committee should look at the balance of risks,   not in terms of the statement that we put in our announcements, but in the sense of what kinds of   mistakes are we more willing to make and how can we correct them  We know that mistakes are   inevitable, but we need to assess which mistakes are more harmful or more difficult to correct    There was a time when we thought the greater risk was for policy to remain stimulative for too long   because having to tighten dramatically would be difficult  So we thought it would be better to err on   the side of restraint because we could always ease more readily  I now perceive, at least based on   some of the comments made around the table, that the balance of risks is reversed  And that may be   correct and appropriate Now the view generally is that the risk of being too restrictive is the greater   mistake, especially looking at the experience of Japan and theoretical worries in some other   countries, resulting in either deflation or prolonged contraction  So the thought is that it’s better to   err on the side of more stimulus  While that may be correct, I think we should be saying, at least   among ourselves if we don’t want to go public with it, that we are more tolerant of running the risk   of re-inflation than we were before   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve long thought that a variety of   unforecastable internal and external shocks do happen and that there’s nothing much we can do   about that but try to interpret them and respond appropriately  And we can hope that we don’t get a   succession of shocks going in the same direction that builds into a cumulative process  To my mind   the role of policymakers is often one of trying to avoid becoming part of the problem rather than part   of the solution I do believe that in some episodes in the history of this central bank and others in the     11/6/01 87   world the policymakers became part of the problem rather than part of the solution  That’s the basis,   too, for my comments earlier about fiscal policy  I’m not convinced that what is going on now in the   fiscal arena is all that constructive  But actually I’m less concerned today than I was five weeks ago   that monetary policy is not properly calibrated  At that time I was worried that things were moving   in the direction of rational risk aversion so fast that we might find that the funds rate was too high to   be consistent with the appropriate thrust of monetary policy  Given the Desk’s net injections of   liquidity over the period since then, I actually feel more comfortable that the level is not too high    Moreover, my confidence in the inherent resiliency of a market economy and its tendency to expand   following shocks is undiminished  My uncertainty remains about what kind of internal or external   shocks we need to be prepared for So I would have been perfectly comfortable to stay with an   unchanged funds rate at this meeting, given my reading of the events since October 2nd Looking at   the yield curve--the four-week, the three-month, and the six-month bill rates--it’s hard to disagree   with a cut of 50 basis points  I can’t say that that’s wrong  But I’m actually fairly comfortable with   where we are   Mr Chairman, could I offer a slightly different perspective?  It may be   consistent with what is bothering Cathy  The last clause is a clear statement that productivity growth     11/6/01 95   is good I might think that and everybody around this table might think that  But hypothetically,   suppose 20 years ago we had substituted for the term “to enhance security” the phrase “to clean up   the air and the water”? The vast majority of people believe that whatever is being done in our   country to enhance security is for the good  For the tone of our statement to somehow suggest that it   is really unfortunate that our country has to do this, I think is very undesirable    "
6958,2001-12-11," Thank you David, as always, I can’t quarrel with the baseline forecast   because I don’t have an alternative that is more convincing or in which I have more confidence  And I   always find the alternative simulations and assumptions that you provide to be useful  But this time   more than usual I have a problem reconciling the policy assumption in the baseline forecast with the   forecast itself It’s not that I’m convinced that the forecast is wrong  But if it is correct, I have trouble   understanding the policy assumption  Or if the policy assumption turns out to be correct, I don’t see it   as consistent with this forecast  Maybe you’ve answered my question in your forward-looking   futures-based scenario in the Greenbook  But let me at least try with you a mental exercise that I   would have wanted to run And that is, imagine that we get to October of next year and that you have   nailed the forecast exactly Nominal GDP accelerates in the second quarter as you have it; in the third     12/11/01 16    quarter it goes to 6 percent and real GDP is up to 4-1/2 percent as you have forecast  And suppose all   of the associated information that would have been released on a weekly and monthly basis goes along   with that kind of forecast  In that environment, I think the 30-year rate and the 10-year rate would   have marched somewhat higher as that scenario unfolded  Certainly the 2-year rate would have   marched higher and I expect that 3-month and 6-month yields would be considerably above where   they are today Then I try to imagine your producing a forecast that says yes, all that has happened   and the 2 percent fed funds rate is still correct  I can’t get that to square because to me a ceiling on the   funds rate of 2 percent would produce an explosive increase in the monetary base, assuming that all   the rest of the data come out exactly as in the baseline   But your answer suggests that the consensus private sector forecast is for   even stronger growth than in your baseline forecast of 4-1/2 percent real GDP in the third quarter and   6 percent nominal  That’s not what I saw in the last Blue Chip forecast   On that same point, Dave, in the Michigan survey the 5-to-10-year   inflation outlook didn’t budge And the survey that our people do together with the folks at Ohio State   University showed the same thing  That survey indicated a very near-term drop in inflation, which   correlates with people’s experiences at the gas pump and with rebates and so forth, and zero change in   the longer-term expectations  Measures of inflation expectations beyond a year or two don’t seem to   have moved at all     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I’m surprised by Al Broaddus’s negative   tone on the labor report because I really expected him to come in here and note that West Virginia,   which is more in his District than in mine, had its lowest unemployment rate in the history of the data   series   And about nine other states registered drops in their unemployment rates    Our region enjoyed spring-like weather last week, setting a record high of over 70 degrees on one day    So even the shutdown of LTV steel production did little to reverse the gradually building optimism      12/11/01 52    The range of opinion of people we talked with ran from those who are expecting noticeable   improvement in their business in the first half to those who merely believe that the economy has   stopped contracting but are not confident that a pickup will occur in the near term  Even the hard-hit   heavy truck manufacturers believe that we are at or have already passed the absolute low, although   most think that it will be late next year at best and more likely in 2003 before there is a noticeable   increase in truck production My guess is that the strong rebound in auto sales plus the continued   firmness in residential real estate markets in our area have helped restore confidence more than just a   little An accumulation of small stories--such as a GM stamping plant announcing last week that it   had openings for 200 people and a data services company in Kentucky saying that it plans to hire   several hundred people in the coming year--has mitigated somewhat the long-expected loss of steel   worker jobs in the region One steel company executive went so far as to say that she hopes the bad   prospects last long enough to get the consolidation that we need in the steel industry  A large regional   bank announced that they are reinstituting hiring bonuses in an effort to fill the continuing large   number of openings that they have  Health-care organizations are now the largest employer in many   of the metropolitan areas in the region and they continue to report hard-to-fill openings and   considerable wage pressure   Construction spending continues to be strong except for the building of hotels and   restaurants, which has stopped completely  We were told by a union official--this probably reflects   what Jack Guynn was saying about his area, too, though I don’t know what share of hotel/restaurant/   hospitality workers are unionized in his region--that nationally the union expects to lose half its   members  A director in the construction industry reported that since September 11, over $3 billion of   commercial construction has been either cancelled or suspended because the lenders cannot get   insurance or its cost is prohibitive     12/11/01 53    On retailing, as Gary Stern was suggesting, we’re all accustomed to retailers expressing   disappointment with holiday sales They’ve been doing it for 50 years at least!  But now what we’re   actually hearing is that they are pleasantly surprised  In some cases such as Kohl’s--one of our   directors is on their board--they actually have had very strong sales  For other companies like   Federated, sales haven’t fallen as much as their worst fears and, therefore, they express some   satisfaction with how the holiday shopping season has played out so far     We surveyed all of our current and former Small Business Advisory Council members last   week and the tone of their remarks was similar to what Cathy Minehan said about her group  They are   weathering the downturn better than they had expected, so their reports were not strongly negative in   tone    On the fiscal picture, I have a little different perspective than what I’ve been hearing so far   this morning  Namely, I think the stalemate between the executive and legislative branches is a very   positive long-term development in that it has gone a long way toward disabusing the public of any   residual notion they had that there was such a thing as a discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy   [Laughter]   One of the interesting developments in this recession--especially since September 11th--has   been the difference as compared with 1990 in both the behavior and the perspective of households and   businesses If you recall, at this point in 1990 with Desert Shield leading up to Desert Storm, both   households and businesses seemed to go into a hunkering down, worst case, mini-max mode--an   “avoid the worst outcome” type of approach  Households simply have not done that this time,   whereas businesses seem to be acting very much as they did in 1990  Everybody in business is from   Missouri! They’re not going to believe in anything good until they see it in their order books or sales    Well, from this starting point one of two things can happen  Either households will belatedly turn     12/11/01 54    pessimistic and become more conservative or businesses will finally shake off their pessimism and   conservatism about the outlook Either scenario has major implications for the set of financial market   conditions that will be associated with whatever economic developments actually occur     GDP in the current quarter, which only has 20 days to go, will be a negative number, if the   Greenbook is right, and it’s going to be negative because of a very large decline in inventories  That’s   not necessarily a bad thing, either for our own economy or for our trading partners around the world    So maybe we ought to be hoping for a negative fourth quarter if inventory liquidation is what it is   going to reflect   I can’t forecast interest rates even as well as most people can, but I’m fairly confident that   we’re going to have a flatter yield curve a year from now  Especially if the Greenbook forecast is   right, I see the yield curve flattening mostly from the short end  It’s a question of how we get from   here to there I’ve been puzzled about all these reports that we are expected to cut the funds rate at this   meeting by 1/4 or 1/2 point  Most people surveyed--and I don’t who these people are--say we’re   going to cut the funds rate One of my directors is on a government affairs council for the American   Bankers Association and they had a meeting very recently, I think at the beginning of last week  Over   100 bankers attended and, after listening to an economic briefing, they were asked to indicate whether   they thought the Fed should lower the funds rate at its meeting today He said no one raised a hand   among the 100 or more people there  And when asked if they thought the Fed had already cut rates   too much, he said almost everyone raised his or her hand  So I asked my Community Bank Advisory   Council that first question last Friday at our regular meeting  One banker did say that she thought we   ought to cut the funds rate by 1/4 point today simply because it was already built into expectations--I   guess she reads the newspaper--and everybody else said no     12/11/01 55    I still think about the level of the fed funds rate differently from the way I think about an   action to cut the federal funds rate  If I look at the level, I don’t see a need for additional insurance  I   believe we are providing an adequate amount of liquidity at the current level of the funds rate  An   action to change the funds rate is news that will be broadcast on CNBC and CNN and it’s going to get   a headline The issue is What is the message we’re sending and to whom are we sending it?  If we   want to send the message to Main Street, then perhaps we ought to cut the funds rate 1/16 of a   percentage point  It doesn’t matter how much we cut it; we get the headline regardless  But I think   there may be some merit, as a few people have suggested, in disappointing the Wall Street   expectations of a cut  By doing so we may signal a more positive tone, indicating that we are   comfortable that the outlook is improving  Thank you, Mr Chairman   I agree with the views stated by Gary Stern  "
6983,2002-01-29," A question  Quite aside from intervening in the narrow and short-run   sense, have your conversations gotten into issues of long-term considerations about the   appropriate level of our holdings of securities denominated in foreign currencies?  We hold   securities in two currencies right now, and we got it down to those two over a long period of   time  But we’ve just been sitting with the inherited inventory of assets denominated in foreign   currencies, and it doesn’t seem as if that is necessarily the right thing to be doing                                                        January 29-30, 2002 Page 8 of 194  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also find it interesting to go through this   kind of exercise, academic as it is, in part because it helps to get one thinking about what we can   learn from our own historical experience and that of other countries  We also learn something   about what the literature has had to say about these kinds of issues over time  What other people   have said in past times might be relevant in the future, even though it hasn’t been relevant over   the mostly inflationary period of the last several decades  Like Bill McDonough, I don’t think   we can learn a lot from the experience of Japan in the 1990s that would help us because the   starting point is so different To me the starting point for the Japanese experience, 1989, was   more comparable to the situation in which the British found themselves in the 1920s than the   problems our country experienced in the 1930s  Japan started off with the price of cantaloupe at   about $70 and the land under the Imperial Palace worth more than the State of California—or so   it was said—and constrained itself on the exchange rate regime  In that environment, if you’re   going to liberalize your economy, either you’re going to have falling goods and assets prices—   what we call deflation—or you’re going to have a falling exchange rate  If you say “no” to the   falling exchange rate and also say that you are going to try to prevent the deflation in goods and   assets prices—futile as it may be—then the notion of having quantitative easing or an interest   rate policy in that setting isn’t going to take you anywhere  Something has to give, and it may   give violently     January 29-30, 2002 Page 40 of 194  Last year, when Japan announced quantitative easing, there was a very interesting piece   by John Greenwood saying that, yes, it was a move in the right direction but it wasn’t nearly   enough He had some estimates, and I’ve forgotten what they were, as to how much Japan   would have to do for the policy to be effective  By the end of the year the amounts probably got   to the order of magnitude that he was suggesting last March when the Japanese introduced this   program  But he also was very clear about the implications for the exchange rate of pursuing   that kind of policy   A problem with a deflation—we talk about disinflation meaning that the real rate rises   relative to nominal rates—is that deflation means, as I look at it, that we get into an asymmetry   where the real rate is above the nominal rate  And if you have a zero-bound nominal rate and   you accelerate deflation and build in expectations of falling prices, that results in a situation   where the more you drive policy in that direction, the more you have the real rate rising  So you   have a self-reinforcing contractionary mechanism unless you can somehow turn that around    This is just the inverse of Parkin’s paradox, where in an environment of accelerating inflation   with people adjusting their behavior, the quantity demanded of nominal balances is going to fall,   so a lower monetary growth is expansionary The inverse is that, if people are expecting a   sustained disinflationary process, then the quantity of demanded money rises and so a faster   money growth is consistent with a disinflationary model  Therefore, it’s called a paradox  The   same thing, I think, applies to deflation  It says that you have to have much, much greater   increases in the quantity of money—you have to engage in quantitative easing—to get out of   that   One of the writers on this, going back several decades, was Axel Leijonhufvud, when he   was working with Clower at Northwestern He said that the problem the general theory was        January 29-30, 2002 Page 41 of 194  addressing is that even a market economy that normally is inherently stable within a corridor can   be blown out of this corridor of stability—into an inflationary spiral or a deflationary spiral—by   various types of shocks Then he brought in what he called a more general theory Keynesian-  type policy Also important is that the distinction between what we would call monetary policy   or fiscal policy wasn’t very useful because the mechanism by which central bank money is   created was no longer there We saw this in some real-life cases in Germany  This goes to   Marvin’s point about how the central bank gets base money into the system or takes it back out    Germany had a situation in 1970-71 and thereafter—when all the exchange regimes were coming   apart—where they had a massive inflow of foreign-owned deposits into their system  They also   had what they considered to be a very expansionary monetary policy, and they didn’t know how   to contain it They could go only so far with reserve requirements and so on  So what they   introduced was a special stabilization surcharge where they added a surtax on personal and   corporate income taxes to constrain demand  I asked, “Well, how does it work?”  They   answered that they put the balance at the central bank and just build that up by as much as the   amount of the surtax  And I said, “Oh, that’s monetary policy, which contracts the base”  And   they said, “No, it’s fiscal policy”  They said that in the political dialogue it was important to call   it fiscal policy Okay, that’s fine with me  Well, they also had sold all their government   securities, again a problem that Marvin raised  And then they asked, “Now what do we do?”  I   said that it was simple—they should just issue money market liabilities on the central bank  And   they said, “How much?”  And I said, “As much as it takes; just offer a positive rate of interest   and sell them and you can contract base money”    As a part of a pedagogical exercise, since this is an academic discussion, I did it the other   way around How would you as a central bank expand the monetary base if you didn’t have the     January 29-30, 2002 Page 42 of 194  opportunity to go out and buy government securities or something like that?  My answer is that   you should simply run a positive sum lottery  There’s no question that you could sell an awful   lot of tickets [laughter] if you have a positive sum lottery offering to credit the winner’s account    You can blow up the monetary base as much as you want, and you can sterilize it as much as you   want   Dave, I have a question about the three-month diffusion index for   payroll employment at the bottom of chart 2  Could you repeat what you said?  I thought I heard   you saying something about 300 large firms   Okay Maybe you can help me out further  I have a question on the   “contributions to the initial recovery in real GDP” illustrated at the bottom of chart 5 and the   differences in the contribution of the consumer sectors—“interest-sensitive elements of   household spending,” I think is what you said We went through a period when recessions had   “victim” sectors  Inflation would push up nominal interest rates, which would lead to   disintermediation because of Regulation Q  The housing and auto sectors would get clobbered,   and then we’d get a big snapback recovery We don’t have that occurring this time  So when we   look at something like a diffusion index of employment, knowing the nature of what caused   contractions in the past, are we looking at the same thing?        January 29-30, 2002 Page 60 of 194  Okay, that helps me Thank you   Thank you Those of you who live in the warmer climates of the nation   probably don’t realize that we are now at the peak of the boating season in the north of the   country! That’s because boating is not about having a large, expensive piece of fiberglass   bobbing up and down in a marina someplace  It’s about boat shows because that’s where all of   the real excitement takes place  The ten-day-long Cleveland boat show concluded this past   Sunday I reported to you a year ago that a vendor of jet skis and personal watercraft had sold   only 9 items last January versus 100 the year before  I had thought that that was actually a   positive development  So I rather reluctantly report that there has been a sharp rebound in         January 29-30, 2002 Page 97 of 194  personal watercraft sales this year  In light of what people were reporting about the excitement   at the Cleveland boat show, I did an Internet search to see what was going on elsewhere  The   boat show season kicks off every year with the big show in New York at the Javits Center  This   year attendance at that show, which was held over the first nine days of the year, was over   100,000 According to some vendors, they saw an increase of as much as 40 percent in sales    Some boat dealers claim that half their sales occur during the January through April boat show   season, so they take the strong sales in these first few shows of the season as an indication that it   may be a strong year  One industry analyst on boating offered the view that the rebound we’re   seeing in that industry involves a shift in consumer spending toward family recreation  He   claims that this is consistent with a lot of other recent developments, such as more family events   at arenas and entertainment centers  He believes people are substituting buying a boat, for   example, instead of going to Orlando or other so-called family destinations, to achieve a sort of   “feel good” effect   As a side note let me mention something about auto shows—a phenomenon kicked off,   of course, with the big Detroit show  This has nothing to do with macroeconomics, but we were   told that the excitement among the crowds was overwhelmingly at the GM exhibits  Second in   popularity was Chrysler There were virtually no crowds and no excitement at the Ford exhibits,   which underscores what we are already seeing about that company and the problems it is facing   In the retail sector, even large national retailers that had reported declines in sales versus   a year earlier expressed essentially relief that the declines were smaller than they had expected    Certainly by the end of September most people were marking down very, very sharply their   expectations about fourth-quarter sales One director with a large national retail company said,   “We were prepared for a complete disaster, and it did not happen”  Let me note an interesting           January 29-30, 2002 Page 98 of 194  twist regarding what is going on in retailing—which may feed into the GDP numbers released   this morning and may reflect my ignorance about how those numbers are put together  A   director said that, even with a year-over-year decline of only about 8 percent, his company   experienced a much, much bigger increase in the volume of goods moved than he had thought   possible Then he said that, of course, inventories were dropping by more  I asked why, and he   said that his company is running sales of 50 to 70 percent off, which means that they have been   losing money on all those discounted items sold  He said that the cost of what comes out of   inventory is higher than the price that goes through the cash register  I don’t know what   deflators are being used to adjust these data, but it’s hard for me to understand how the   Commerce Department knows how to do that  I don’t understand how Commerce knows what is   actually moving and what prices are appropriate—the deflators to use—for either the   merchandise coming out of inventory or that going through the check-out stand  One final note   on the retail sector A number of directors indicated that we should expect in our region a   significant increase in unoccupied retail space because a number of store closings in major urban   metro areas have been announced and our directors think there will be more     From the manufacturing standpoint, as in Mike Moskow’s District, cautious optimism   was the general tone that we were hearing from our contacts except those involved in the   manufacture of large trucks—eighteen-wheelers—or related industries  With the exception of   Ford, the auto assembly and parts plants all indicate that they are operating at high levels  And   probably reflecting the unusually warm weather this winter, going on three months now, both   residential and nonresidential construction are very strong, at least on a seasonally adjusted basis    We’re told that manufacturers of electronics, plastics, and chemicals are now seeing the first   improvement in orders in a year  A large regional bank said that it now has openings for 1,500     January 29-30, 2002 Page 99 of 194   people and is offering existing employees a $500 referral bonus for bringing in someone who is   hired and stays with the bank for at least six months   On the national front, in terms of this Greenbook versus the last one, I probably would   not have marked down the second half as much as the staff did because of the absence of fiscal   stimulus  Then again, given the discussion we had last time about how much of what was called   fiscal stimulus was really an effect on the timing of business fixed investment spending, it is hard   for me to judge the likely effect of the changed fiscal outlook  To the extent that there is a fiscal   impulse on certain expenditures, I do tend to think of it as only a timing effect  So the   Greenbook may be right  Perhaps activity from 2004 or 2003 is not going to be pulled into the   second half of 2002 as much as it otherwise would have been  It’s hard for me to say  But I still   think that the basic trend is more likely to be stronger rather than weaker  I suppose I wasn’t   counting on as much from so-called fiscal stimulus in the first place     To me an emerging risk that we’re all going to have to think about a bit more—and I   certainly am trying to understand it a little better—is what I view as a fallout from the Enron   debacle Yesterday, as you saw, it was announced that   got caught up in   the accounting issues that have emerged of late  That was something we had been addressing, of   course,  for some weeks, and we knew that if there was a disclosure, there could be a   reaction If a sequence of these types of disclosures comes out, I think we’re going to have to   worry about whether people’s general confidence in and the quality of the earnings reports we   have seen for some time are as good as we would like to have believed  That has to be bad for   the equity market because the risk premium is going to be influenced by that          January 29-30, 2002 Page 100 of 194  Let me fold in some thoughts about the national outlook and what Bob McTeer said   about Mexico It is true that, when our economy slowed, the Mexican economy dropped as well    However, that pattern is symmetric  When our economy tends to recover, theirs will also; I think   of it as something of a slingshot effect  The Canadians certainly are hoping for a slingshot effect   if the US economy picks up more than had been expected earlier  I view this $10 trillion   economy as a strong locomotive which, if it starts to perform a little better, will help pull along   not only Mexico and Canada but most of Asia except for Japan  I think those countries are   poised to do quite a bit better assuming that we also do better  As we shake off pessimism in this   country—and that pessimism may have been rational but I do think there has been excessive   caution in the business sector—I believe those countries will also  The result will be a building   momentum of optimism that is going to show through in a lot more commerce on a global basis    There is some lag involved, but I do think it’s fairly short  My conclusion about the risks to the   outlook is very similar to what Tony Santomero said, so I won’t repeat that     Don, you referred to the framework reflected in chart 5, which depicts   the current fed funds rate versus various estimates of the equilibrium real fed funds rate  I find   this a useful framework even though I do have problems with the use of a lagged PCE as a proxy   for inflation expectations Nevertheless, you cited a number of reasons why, in the current   situation, the funds rate may not be as stimulative as it appears  Given that, let’s say you   superimpose on that chart the relationship of the nominal funds rate to other market rates—the   spreads of the two-year, five-year, and ten-year rates over the funds rate  If those spreads are   wider, would you characterize that as more stimulative or the same amount of stimulus for a   given nominal or real fed funds rate?   Okay   Thank you I thought your analysis of the profit situation was very   interesting, and I’d like to understand it better  So maybe in the future the staff could illustrate   for us how sensitive these numbers are to changes in the assumptions about such things as   productivity I would also include an analysis of other factors, such as the repatriation of   earnings under alternative assumptions in a global marketplace  As for the policy action this   time, I have no problem at all with staying at the current funds rate  On the risk statement, I   agree that changing it is a risky thing to do once we already have a statement in place  It is the   changing that bothers me, and I want to be cautious about doing that  At the December meeting I   would have been very happy to leave the funds rate target where it was, and if the consensus was   to have the balance of risks on the downside, that would have been okay  But my second choice   would have been to cut the rate, as was done in December, and to go to a statement saying that   the risks were balanced Had we done that, I can’t see that anything we heard here today would   lead people to say that now the risks on the downside are greater than they were in December   That wasn’t the tone here at all  But what troubles me most about the risks statement is how it’s   interpreted by the markets and the public  And the truth is that I don’t know  The word        January 29-30, 2002 Page 123 of 194  “weakness” doesn’t mean weakening or declining  If it means weak as in not robust, that’s one   thing But none of us is saying that we think the downside risks are such that we could see   declines in economic activity from this point on; we’re simply saying that we expect not very   vigorous growth So I think we’re stuck with the same balance of risks toward weakness, and all   I can hope is that in remarks and testimony it is explained as saying that we’re expecting growth   but not very vigorous growth   I would have preferred to leave our practice as it was  But now I see this   as a done deal because we’re going to release minutes in six or seven weeks that will reflect this   discussion So now I’m going to have to decide whether I want to vote against this and have the   press disclose that I’m against transparency!  [Laughter]  I really wish that this item had not been   on the agenda  "
7010,2002-03-19," I attended a meeting a couple of weeks ago at which Anne Krueger was   present as was Ricardo Lopez-Murphy, who was the Argentine Defense Minister and then for a   couple of weeks the Minister of the Economy  On the inflation question, Sebastian Edwards   made some back-of-the-envelope calculations  These numbers to me just sound off the wall, but   he said it would take about a 3,000 percent inflation in peso terms to get some sort of a balance    I don’t know how he arrived at that figure, but the numbers being talked about were just   enormous  Ricardo Lopez-Murphy’s point was that the attitude in Argentina now is more like   that in the French Revolution than anything any nation has experienced since then  He said that   in the mind of the average Argentinean, if you have ever held political office in Argentina, you   are not qualified to hold office   Thank you First, Al’s comment about his last speech on this subject   reminds me of a story from twenty-odd years ago in the banking industry  The question from   one banker would be, “Have you seen Sandy Rose’s last article on duration?”  And the response   would be, “I hope so!” [Laughter] This story does relate to GNMAs because I was opposed to   dabbling around with them even before I read Sandy and Brian’s memo, and they thoroughly   convinced me that it is a bad idea  In addition to prepayment risk, which is adequately treated in   the memo, there is also the risk of shortening duration and revaluation in a rising rate   environment  I also think there is the issue of how we would subsequently distinguish between   them and GSEs  So my first option might be, other things held aside, to table this whole issue    That is probably not realistic in view of the length of time it will take to come up with a viable   alternative if necessary  I do think a connection ultimately needs to be made between what is on   the liability side of our balance sheet, in terms of where and how it’s held, and what is on the     March 19, 2002 Page 17 of 117  asset side So I would support going ahead and devoting whatever resources are available to   exploring the use of repos in foreign-denominated currencies  I think that’s a sensible thing to   think about for a long-term perspective   Thank you, Mr Chairman  On the region, first I must say that even our   most reliably gloomy directors and other business contacts are finding it harder to sustain their   pessimism, but they work at it  [Laughter] Broadly interpreted, even those who only grudgingly   admit that the situation is not as bad now as it was a few months ago—or at least not as bad as   they had feared—are very quick to add that business has a long way to go to get back to where it   was, in their fond recollections, a couple of years ago  Even the technology sector seems to be   showing some stirrings  The very fond memories that people talked about regarding how great   things were just a couple of years ago reminded me of a bumper sticker I often saw when I   traveled in Texas on business in the mid-1980s  It said, “Lord, permit me one more boom, and I   promise this time not to piss it away”  [Laughter]  I think that’s a prayer that policymakers   should not want to see granted     March 19, 2002 Page 39 of 117  Both residential construction and public-sector infrastructure construction are reported to   be continuing at a solid pace  In fact, one company said that its backlog is now 20 percent above   the level of a year ago One very large construction company that operates not only nationally   but even outside the United States reported that, as of the end of February, it had already booked   40 percent of the new business it was expecting to book this year     LTV Steel has new owners, and they hope to resume operations in May  The   combination of unloading retirees’ pensions and health care costs onto taxpayers, along with   substantial debt write-downs, renegotiated union contracts, plus the new tariffs on imported steel   is said to be enough to ensure a good return on investment for the new owners  And it should   enable them to take market share from otherwise still solvent and from already bankrupt   companies as well  The moral of the episode for the industry may be that the first into   bankruptcy wins!   Airlines that serve the region continue to report improving traffic, and they are adding   flights, although operations are still well below year-ago levels  We checked with major   appliance manufacturers that operate in the region, thinking their reports might tell us a little   about what is going on in inventories for at least one industry  They said that production this   quarter is going to be substantially above that in the first quarter a year ago—on the order of   20 percent in a couple of cases But then they were quick to say, “But remember that the first   quarter of last year was a time of sharp reductions in production because of concerns about   rapidly rising inventories” Now with inventories at more-acceptable levels and final sales   having remained good, they are increasing production and expect to report very good earnings   for the first quarter     March 19, 2002 Page 40 of 117  An increasingly cited concern among business leaders is the sharply higher cost of   insurance In fact, one director who sits on the board of directors of one of the nation’s largest   insurance companies—and this is an individual who spent his own career in manufacturing—   said that he had never seen an industry with as much pricing power as the insurance industry   enjoys today  He added that he believes accountants’ fees also will rise sharply in the near   future   Turning to the national economy, if there ever was a time to practice pedal-to-the-metal   monetary policy, it was last year, especially after the terrorist attacks  We were able not only to   inject a massive amount of liquidity during the days following the attacks but to continue to do   so for a couple of months until economic activity did appear to be stabilizing  Importantly, we   were able to do so with our currency continuing firm in foreign exchange markets and the   apparent inflation premium in bond yields remaining more or less steady  To me that is the best   evidence we could hope for that the credibility of our commitment to maintaining the purchasing   power of our currency is unaltered It took a long time to build that credibility  And the   favorable outcome of our policy actions last year may be due as much to the strength of our   reputation as to our actual decisions   By the end of the year, emerging information about the economy was such that   reasonable people could differ about the desirability of more insurance against risks on the   downside, and in fact, the Committee’s decision in December was not unanimous  In the three   months since our last policy move, developments in the real economy and in the financial   markets—which I thought Dino laid out very well in his opening remarks this morning—have   signaled that this economy is highly resilient and that the outlook for businesses and households   has turned favorable  During this time, financial market commentary has been that monetary          March 19, 2002 Page 41 of 117  policy has been unchanged But the rebound in real activity and the upward movement in   market-determined interest rates tell us that the natural rate of interest has been rising  In that   context, an unchanged nominal overnight rate has become, de facto, more expansionary  If de   jure easing in December was less than a sure thing, then further easing in the subsequent months,   even if de facto, is less compelling  Certainly there is a potential for events that will lead to   further downside impulses and will unmistakably be read as such by everyone  Barring such   events, the odds favor the building of momentum, the time for  raising the funds rate coming   nearer, and the magnitude of the increase becoming larger in order to catch up with the already   rising equilibrium rate     If I were in charge of drafting the risk statement—and after I wrote this I realized that   Don is not at any risk at all of losing his job—I would say, “Recent and prospective   developments in the real economy and in financial markets have tilted the balance of risks   toward the stance of policy becoming pro-cyclical on the upside, and we must remain vigilant of   the need to ease off the monetary accelerator”  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, as for the 1994-95 episode, I really   don’t think that holds any lessons that would help us this time because what preceded our first   action then was quite different from today  In that earlier period we had had, as I recall, some   sixteen months of no change in the funds rate  And part of the lesson then was that any change at   all was huge news This time it has been very recently that we were taking overt actions  Also,   the last actions after September 11 are very well understood in the market as actions taken that   we probably wouldn’t have taken in the absence of the events of that day  So to some extent we   can distinguish between the reversal of the post-September 11 reductions in the funds rate and   whatever tightening we might do after that  With proper statements from us to the public, I think   that first part is easier to explain and to do  Beyond that, though, I think the pace at which we   move rates up may be asymmetric from the pace on the downside  We cut rates rapidly because     March 19, 2002 Page 91 of 117  the risk premium rose rapidly in terms of investment decisionmaking  And if the risk premium is   only gradually revised downward as businesspeople gain confidence, it may be appropriate to be   gradual in a tightening phase even after a very accelerated, aggressive easing phase  Having said   all of that, if we hadn’t been at all constrained at this meeting  by the bias toward weakness in our   statement at the January meeting, I probably would be more enthusiastic about an increase right   now But I do feel that constraint is real  So I think we have to have no action this time, but at   least set the stage for possible actions in the future   I would have preferred 2B as my first option because it involves the   least change and brings the least attention to the fact of a dissent  But I can live with 2A, and   maybe the reality is that that would be forced on us eventually  However, I’m not really   concerned about the people who are not in the press room at the time we release our statement  "
7033,2002-05-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Probably the best indicator that economic   activity in the region continues to improve gradually, yet business people remain very cautious,   is the widespread increase in the demand for temporary workers  Like Mike Moskow, we have   heard more about that recently, especially from advisory council members and from other   contacts, than we had prior to this time  The temp agencies report that starting in March they   experienced a significant pickup in both work orders and inquiries about temporary workers    Some reports of recalls of previously laid-off workers by trucking and shipping companies also         May 7, 2002 32 of 81  suggest that this year will be better at least for that industry than last year, which wouldn’t be   very hard at all because they really had a bad year last year     I’ll relate one good news/bad news story about employment in the banking sector  One   of the region’s largest banks announced plans to hire 2,000 people this year in the greater   Cleveland metropolitan area alone That sounds good to everyone except to the rest of us in the   banking industry in the area who are all wondering where that bank is going to be able to get the   people it claims to want  I’ll be watching my turnover numbers     At our April board of directors meeting, a director reported that a large furniture retailer   said that March had been the best month on record, after a dismal year last year and a dismal   January and February That’s similar to what Mike Moskow was hearing in his District  Our   contact said that the improvement mainly reflected an increase in sales of office furniture to   commercial customers  We followed up on that by contacting a number of office furniture   manufacturers in the region, and most reported the same pattern  January and February sales   were dismal, continuing the decline that had started in the fall of 2000; however, in March and   early April they saw the first uptick in orders in almost a year and a half for some of them    We also contacted appliance manufacturers who mostly produce for the residential   market  First-quarter sales and earnings were up sharply, and sales forecasts for the year have   now been raised One firm reported that efforts were already under way to add full-time workers   in order to cut back on overtime  A manufacturer of high-end tools, not necessarily high-  technology equipment but the high-end tools that laborers worldwide use for all sorts of   purposes, reported that throughout the second half of 2001, even before September 11, their   year-to-year sales were off very sharply in North America  So what they characterized as a   slight increase in year-over-year sales in the first quarter was encouraging  Nevertheless, all         May 7, 2002 33 of 81  capital spending planned for this year will be in foreign countries—and that’s foreign production   for foreign markets, not for re-import into the United States   At a recent meeting of our Small Business Advisory Council, none of the participants had   plans to invest to “increase capacity”  That was the way they characterized it  Most complained   of being in industries with excess capacity—because their competitors are all over invested, I   guess! Yet a majority plan to invest in equipment that will increase their own productivity and   efficiency, allowing them to increase their own output with the same or even fewer production   workers What we were hearing in part was that some of them were saying they had surprised   themselves at how much output they were able to produce  They simply didn’t know how   productive the capital they had previously put in place was until the demand spurt hit them     On the subject of compensation, all who spoke to the issue claimed that productivity   increases continued to be greater than wage increases  Agriculture is one example of a sector   that I don’t normally have in mind when thinking about major changes in productivity or   technology But the head of a large hog raising operation in northwest Ohio told us that because   of the advanced technical skills now required in the ag sector—and he described some of the   very sophisticated equipment that they use—all their recent hires have been college graduates    He now has a full-time recruiter visiting college campuses to get farm workers  And he recently   has been giving wage increases of up to 10 percent in order to retain employees   On the national economy, everything I’m seeing and hearing is consistent with a picture   of an economy that is expanding, although with neither the boom conditions implied in the   Commerce Department’s first-quarter preliminary number nor the slowdown shown in the   Greenbook’s second-quarter projection My belief that growth is somewhere between those two   numbers leads me to the conclusion that the natural rate of interest is rising, even though I would               May 7, 2002 34 of 81  not be able to pinpoint it with any degree of accuracy  And in my view a 1¾ percent overnight   interbank rate is not consistent with a nonaccelerating rate of inflation  In a situation with   competing paradigms, where one is the observed unemployment rate or some measure of the   output gap versus some notion of the natural rate of unemployment and the other is the observed   structure of nominal interest rates versus some notion of the natural rate of interest, I’m much   more comfortable with the latter  It says that a positive productivity surprise does not reduce   inflation potential  It’s quite the opposite because of the endogenous element of what happens to   the stance of monetary policy     As policymakers we must choose between those paradigms, at least implicitly, and I   would like to do so explicitly The measured unemployment rate versus the estimate of the   natural rate says we’re still in a disinflationary environment  I don’t believe that The observed   nominal interest rates versus various estimates of the natural rate—or what some people like to   call the real rate of interest—say that the current stance of policy is reinflationary  One has to   choose Listening to my directors and advisory council members, I have the impression that   business people view the current stance of monetary policy as highly expansionary and fully   expect that it will become less so in the months ahead  For them it’s only a question of when we   start a series of actions to increase the overnight rate  For many it will be a relief once we finally   get started, and it will reduce a source of current uncertainty  Thank you, Mr Chairman   I agree  "
7057,2002-06-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman  First a comment  Microeconomic principles   would have led me to think that a move from a high inflation environment to a low inflation   environment would cause an increase in what we call productivity, though I don’t know how I   would go about directly trying to test or reject that hypothesis  Next I have a question, though   I’m not sure it’s going to sound very different from the question that Bob Parry was just raising            June 25-26, 2002 34 of 179  Certainly we have data problems with the phenomenon that we call inflation  We have problems   with the unemployment statistics—who is counted in the labor force and who is counted as not   working—and clearly we have problems with how we measure productivity  And as far as I   know, the data measurement problems are getting worse not better  Nevertheless, if we look at a   cross-section of currency zones around the world, the similarity in movements of what we   measure as inflation is striking while the divergence in what we measure as productivity and   unemployment is equally striking  How would you explain that?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I want to make a comment about state   and local finances, an issue that several people have mentioned  I think that is going to be a   concern for some time  The census numbers for the State of Ohio indicate that during the decade   of the 1990s—between the 1990 census and the 2000 census—there was a 12 percent absolute   decline in the 19 to 44 age group, which doesn’t seem to bode well for the future  And the   projections for the next decade are that we will have the second lowest population growth and   employment growth on record, which means that the tax base is eroding  A clear implication for   the governor, the legislature, and many journalists is that Ohio needs to raise taxes significantly   in order to address its problems  So I hope everybody else also will raise taxes because this   strategy is not going to work too well otherwise   Within the region, economic activity is generally characterized as slowly improving    While the levels of sales and production are up from their recent lows, the pace of increase is   certainly slow The recovery in trucking and shipping has been earlier and stronger than was   expected at the beginning of this year; but employment, especially at the parts suppliers, has not   yet started to rise Several of the manufacturers in the region believe that they will be able to   exceed prior peak levels of production with significantly fewer workers  I’m going to come back   to that point in just a minute   In the automotive sector, the combination of continued strong sales and optimism   expressed by senior management is not translating into either capital spending or employment   increases so far Instead, both parts and assembly plants are reporting that considerable overtime   is being paid  Reports from two specific companies are worth mentioning because they offer a   hopeful indication of what would be nice to start hearing from others  Timkin reports that its   efforts over the last couple of years—the company has gotten rid of some plants, downsized,        June 25-26, 2002 84 of 179  shrunk its labor force, and so on—will be reflected in much better earnings this year  The firm   also says that both its domestic and its international business have been improving recently    Pittsburgh Plate and Glass notes that demand from both the residential construction and the   automotive sectors remains strong and now its chemical business is recovering after a two-year   slump  Moreover, the weaker dollar is helping exports, and overall profitability is now rising   The tourist destinations in the region are off to a strong start, and industry observers   believe that traffic will easily exceed last year’s levels  But group sales, mainly blocks of tickets   sold to companies that use them for their employees, are down  Hiring at these tourist locales   has been much easier this year  And contacts say that wages paid have remained flat for the third   year in a row, but they are still able to raise ticket prices   One large retailer headquartered in the District, Federated, continues to struggle but   seems to accept that their problem may well be simply that their business model doesn’t fit the   current environment  Another director who sits on the Kohl’s Department Stores board always   provides a cheerful and optimistic report to offset the downbeat report that we get from   Federated In retail categories, furniture, appliances, electronics, and jewelry are all reported to   be strong In view of the low reported levels of inventories in these categories, retailers are   reporting fewer sales promotions and markdowns than a year ago at this time     The housing market at the lower end of the price range is reported to be doing very well   throughout the region while the upper end of the housing market is characterized generally as   being dead in the water Lots and lots of million dollar houses that were built don’t have owners   or they have “upside down” owners The bankruptcy of a large residential builder in the greater   Cincinnati area is creating a lot of problems because it involved a very major fraud  We don’t   know the magnitude of it yet, but it’s very large  So there are a lot of single-family and              June 25-26, 2002 85 of 179  multifamily housing projects throughout the region that are unfinished and abandoned  This has   caused at least three dozen banks to incur significant losses and has left more than 200   homeowners with prior claims or construction loans against their houses  We think there is one   bank whose survival is very much in doubt and two others whose capital has been severely   impaired   With respect to capital spending plans, even companies that are described as sitting on   piles of cash—that’s the way their bankers describe them anyway—have taken a wait-and-see   attitude And the reason given is that management is still unsure how much productivity and   efficiency can be wrung out of prior investments before additional capacity can be justified    That raises an intriguing question If at the micro level individual firms simply claim not to   know their potential or their capacity, how can we be very confident about those measures at a   macro level?  It also says something at the micro level of the firm  There must be a shift under   way in Okun’s law, and where it will end up we don’t know at this point   At a recent meeting of our Community Bank Advisory Council, several bankers   described their business customers as sounding more pessimistic than their actions imply    Nevertheless, it is generally asserted that business customers continue to pay down old loans and   are attempting to build liquidity  The almost total absence of reports of either business or   personal bankruptcies seemed to surprise even the bankers  It appeared that there was a tendency   for each member to believe that his own bank’s experience was the exception and that somebody   else must be incurring a lot of losses  But nobody claimed that that was happening at his or her   bank   Let me turn to the national economy  Whatever the problems of various sectors, regions,   or industries in this country or whatever the problems plaguing many foreign economies, there        June 25-26, 2002 86 of 179  certainly are limits as to how far highly expansionary monetary policy can go to be helpful   before going too far and becoming part of the problem  At some point, and I tend to think it will   be sooner rather than later, it is going to become essential for us to move to a more neutral stance   of monetary policy and to find the patience to wait for other necessary adjustments to work   through the system   I want to say something about the idea of risk versus uncertainty in the classic sense    Risks, of course, are at least potentially quantifiable in some probabilistic way  The staff does a   good job of sensitizing us to the various risks to the economic outlook, and that’s very helpful    But uncertainties are quite different  We face an environment where the uncertainties are more   important than the various risks that we can identify  There are uncertainties associated with   almost certain events in the Middle East, but we cannot quantify those uncertainties in any useful   way There are uncertainties in the form of  “Enronitis” associated with the legacy of the last   few years How much of that has carried into the present and how long it is going to hang over   this economy and our markets is something that I don’t find very easy to contemplate in a   quantifiable way The implication for me is that we are going to be event driven and we are   going to be reactive for quite some time, and in my view that’s the best that we can hope to do    Thank you, Mr Chairman   I support the recommendation I don’t have any trouble saying that the   risks are balanced, but I won’t say that the uncertainties are balanced because that would be an   oxymoron  And in my view we do have to think about that  "
7087,2002-08-13," Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had absolutely no desire to speak last this   morning In fact I thought I had indicated the desire to speak early, but it seems that my         August 13, 2002 62 of 92  presence at the table has already begun to fade!  [Laughter] Had I spoken earlier about the   region, right after Mike Moskow, my remarks not surprisingly would have sounded very similar   to his So at least on that score maybe it was good that I wasn’t next to speak  As for the rest of   what I heard this morning, to a remarkable degree common themes ran through the commentary    Mainly, as far as I could tell by listening to all of you and based on the notes I made for myself,   the go-around has really been a way for everyone to express some of the same concerns and   ideas somewhat differently     The contrast between what I’ve been hearing in the District versus reading about the   national economy suggests that our region is continuing to do somewhat better than the rest of   the country Certainly, the rather panicky tone of Wall Street letters is not mirrored in the   comments that I hear in the region  An article in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago   regarding the effects of the decline in the dollar on manufacturing mentioned a couple of small   Ohio companies  That prompted our research analysts to get a list of over 100 companies and   their phone numbers to call  Most firms reported no increase in export orders  But the reason   turned out to be that over half of all the exports coming from Ohio alone are to Canada, and   another significant chunk goes to Mexico And, of course, the Canadian dollar was only briefly   higher than the US dollar, and the Mexican peso has been fairly steady  For those companies   that did see a pickup in orders, it reflected exports to Asia and not at all to Latin America or to   Europe A few contacts, however, said that, though their orders for exports have been steady, the   profitability of their export business has been improving     We did a roundup regarding capital spending by companies located in the District, and   that produced mixed results, of course  Those increasing spending supply mainly the auto,   housing, and health care sectors Only one company cited the new tax incentives for investment         August 13, 2002 63 of 92  as the reason for undertaking some capital investment that they had not previously planned to do    We asked them why they did it now rather than wait since the incentives will be in effect for a   while Our contact said he was quite sure that the Congress was going to remove that tax   incentive after the November election   Another topic of discussion in the District this summer has been the effects of weather    The farming region tells us that, even if normal rain were to resume now, the corn crops are   wiped out We don’t have irrigation of our corn crops in our District  And the yields of   soybeans would be cut in half even if normal amounts of rainfall were to resume  That, of   course, means that the ag sector lenders have big credit quality problems and are voicing a lot of   concerns We’ve heard concerns registered not only about the smaller banking companies but   also about the Farm Credit Banks  It’s still too early to know who really holds the worst of these   problem loans  The flip side of the effects of the dry weather is that both highway construction   and theme park destinations have lost fewer days due to bad weather  Revenues at these parks so   far this year have considerably exceeded expectations  We also were told that roadside   restaurants and motels are operating at very high capacity levels, while central city hotels,   especially in large metro areas, have very high vacancy rates  Some of that has nothing to do   with recent developments in the economy  In Cincinnati, for example, a lot of conventions have   been cancelled, but that has nothing to do with anything going on elsewhere  Electric power   generation companies, not surprisingly, are also operating at flat-out capacity  So demand for   coal has been strong, and the price of coal has been high   Reports from the residential housing market continue to indicate a very tight market at   the lower and moderate price ranges, while upper-end houses are staying on the market for ever   longer periods of time  The income generated from building houses is being spent  People are         August 13, 2002 64 of 92  buying vehicles to park in front of their houses, and the housing-related sectors, such as furniture   and appliances and other items that homeowners put inside their houses, are all doing quite well    All are generating income, and that income is being spent  Meanwhile the telecom sector   continues to contract Metals companies produce more tonnage with fewer people  And the   commercial and industrial construction sector continues to decline  Nevertheless, in spite of   what we also are hearing—as Tom Hoenig and others reported—regarding state and local   financing problems, public sector construction for schools and that sort of thing is very strong,   based on bond financing   One large employer in the region said that turnover in employment is declining because   of what he described as “the fear of joining the already unemployed”  He said this is reducing   employees’ resistance to the shifting of some of the sharp increases in health care costs to them    Not a very nice thing to do! At a recent small business advisory council meeting I learned that   those manufacturing companies that are getting strong orders are not only using temps but also   mandatory overtime rather than add permanent workers  This, of course, is contrary to the   monthly report indicating reduced hours Union contract negotiations have been reported to be   settling for pay increases in the 3½ to 4 percent range   Regarding the national economy, as always it’s a contest between the strength of forces   generated by the inherent resiliency of market mechanisms versus the frequency and the strength   of various adverse impulses  When asked what is causing so much caution in the business sector   as well as the declared nervousness of households—an attitude not necessarily reflected in their   spending—people point to three major uncertainties And here “uncertainties” is the right word,   not “risks” Somebody else mentioned—I think it may have been Cathy—the word “fear”  I   heard the word “fear” much more than the word “risk” during this recent period  There are         August 13, 2002 65 of 92  uncertainties about where, when, and how bad the next terror attack will be, about the startling   loss of confidence in the quality of balance sheet and income statements of businesses, and about   when and how the violence of the Middle East can be brought to an end  None of these sources   of uncertainty has a clear, easy, or near-term solution  There will not be a VT day—victory over   terrorism day—that we will mark on our calendars to celebrate in the future  The credibility of    financial statements will be restored only very gradually  It may be comparable to when a   central bank loses the credibility of its commitment to price stability; it takes a long time to get   that credibility back And I think the business sector is going to have to wait a very long period   of time before it deserves the public’s faith in the credibility of companies’ reports  Our ultimate   occupation of the Middle East will last decades  People not yet born will serve in our armed   forces in the Middle East   It’s significant that neither business contacts nor economists identify monetary or fiscal   policies as among the negative impulses  If there is a second downward leg of this cycle, it will   be caused by new or strengthened negative impulses that are already present  The staff produces   what I consider to be very useful alternative simulations of various types of risks, but these are   not the things that people talk about when they are asked about their concerns and sources of   uncertainty I look forward to the staff’s forecast every September when they add that extra year   and look further out into the future Of course I don’t know what that projection is going to say,   but I’ll forecast what it’s going to say  It’s going to say that on average over the subsequent   eight-quarter period the economy will have growth of about 3 percent  That’s because for the   last half-century, the last time I looked at the data, it has experienced about 3 percent growth    The last time I did look at the figures—and this was before the most recent revisions of the   data—some 70 percent of the quarter-to-quarter changes in real GDP growth, almost three­              August 13, 2002 66 of 92  quarters of the observations, were below 2 percent or above 4 percent  My guess is that six out   the next eight quarters of the staff forecast will not show growth below 2 percent or above   4 percent, but I bet they will average close to 3 percent   Wow! [Laughter]  I certainly agree with leaving the rate unchanged    Uncertainty about financial statements has created more headwinds than I had expected, and now   I have a feeling that they’re going to last longer than a lot of people may be thinking  So if that   means the balance of risks is toward weakness, I can live with that  "
7113,2002-09-24," Thank you Dino, with regard to your reference to the possibility that   the decline in longer-term US Treasury yields is associated with Fannie Mae’s hedging needs,   I’ve seen that mentioned in the press too  I know nothing about the flows through Fannie Mae    But the presumption must be that the amount that they require compared with the floating stock   is quite large and—it’s sort of a tomato crop theory of bond pricing here—that Fannie has to do   something else  I don’t know what the other balance sheet entries are  What else do they do or   not do if in fact they do buy ten-year Treasuries to hedge?   Okay But that still leaves me a little puzzled about how good of a   hedge this is Except for the idea of callable debt, which I hadn’t thought about as a course of   action they could take, what are the alternatives?  If they had previously hedged, whether by   using ten-year Treasuries or something else, and we got this kind of decline in mortgage rates,   then the hedge could work The gains on the Treasuries, if that’s what they hold, would   compensate them for their losses on the mortgage portfolio  But in their case it’s certainly not   apparent to me that the inverse is true  Somebody else, a mortgage banking company, for   example, can do that  If rates rise, they have a loss on their Treasuries, and they have a gain on   their mortgage portfolio  Is that possible with Fannie Mae?  I can’t see them going out and   saying, we will take losses on our hedge portfolio and we’re going to sell something else and   take gains on it   I understand, but it still leaves me uncomfortable thinking that hedging   activities by Fannie Mae work the same way as hedging activities by anybody else  That’s not                 September 24, 2002 12 of 115  obvious to me, given the nature of what they would have to do if rates were to move   substantially against them   Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s a comfort to me to know that Al   Broaddus is worrying about deflation because it means that I’m free not to give it much thought      September 24, 2002 22 of 115  [Laughter] I want to ask Karen a question about Canada and how much we really know about   the current situation as a basis for the staff forecast  In your staff’s pre-FOMC briefing to the   Board yesterday there was a comment in the text that the housing market in Canada is expected   to slow And there’s a chart in your material that depicts the spike in housing starts and   employment this year  But Canada’s population is less than that of California  Canada has had   an increase of a half million in employment and 40,000 in housing starts in a year  Do we have   current, reasonably reliable information on what has happened during the last year to their legal   and illegal immigration, especially as we make it more difficult to get into this country?  I know   that the ferry running from Kingsville to Sandusky always used to be completely full going in   one direction and none of the passengers spoke English, but immigration via that route is being   controlled for the first time in my memory  Do we know anything about what is going on up   there?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  After listening to all kinds of people over   the summer, I’ve come to the conclusion that perhaps I should always listen to equal numbers of   manufacturers and retirees because manufacturers always want lower rates and retirees always   want higher rates Or maybe better yet, I should just save myself some time and not listen to   either group!   Most reports from our directors indicate that not much has changed recently  That’s   similar to what Mike Moskow was saying about his District only I didn’t sense that the tone   among our directors was quite as negative as I thought Mike was suggesting for his  To me,   neither reports of strength nor reports of weakness tended to dominate  But let me note just a   few things I heard from directors  A fresh report on the coal industry in the region indicates a   stronger demand than had been anticipated earlier, which is due primarily to higher coal   consumption by power plants; that business has been very good  The strength I mentioned in the   spring in business at roadside hotel chains and family style restaurants continued through the   summer, as did the weakness in urban center hotel chains  Employment of unionized truck   drivers was reported to have continued to increase in spite of the bankruptcy of Consolidated   Freight Company And sales at the annual September auction of thoroughbreds in Kentucky   were even worse than the July auction of colts  We were told that dollar sales were down        September 24, 2002 34 of 115  40 percent, and it was primarily because Middle East buyers didn’t show up this time  At a   recent meeting of our Community Bank Advisory Council, several members described their   business customers as being highly liquid  These customers had lines of credit in place, and they   had attractive investment opportunities  They simply lacked the confidence to proceed  As one   banker put it, “Small businesses are healthy but afraid”     On the national economy, I want to comment about some cyclical versus secular trends    A former member of our Small Business Advisory Council who runs a metal fabrication   company near Lexington, Kentucky, attended a joint board of directors dinner where Governor   Olson spoke on September 1l  Actually we were in Covington, Kentucky, so there were a lot of   references to what it was like over half a century ago when the Chairman played with a band   there In fact, it was pretty exciting   So we heard! As for his view on the economy, this small businessman   described it as “saw-toothed with a positive bias”  That’s just the way they talk in Kentucky, I   think The saw teeth are obvious in the month-to-month changes that are regularly reported  But   ascertaining whether or not there is a positive cyclical trend has become especially difficult for   two reasons One reason is that we’re now in a period where year-over-year comparisons are   worse than useless They are highly misleading  For example, people in this room know that, if   I were to say that during the most recent reserve settlement period ending on September 18 there   was a 47 percent drop in nonborrowed reserves from a year earlier, all of you would know that   that is useless information  Of course there was, and we know why  But comparing a period   with the same period a year earlier is the way a lot of data such as retail sales, corporate earnings,        September 24, 2002 35 of 115  and so forth are reported That is not going to tell us anything, and it may mislead a lot of   people For example, when we get the October car sales figures, the headline number is going to   be reported as the biggest monthly drop in the history of the series  That’s pretty useless   information     Secular trends also are hard for people to filter out  When the August employment   figures were released, our directors concluded that the continued weakness in manufacturing   employment suggested that the expansion was not on firm ground  But manufacturing   employment was weak throughout most of the ten-year long expansion of the 1990s  At the end   of that expansion, 24 million more people were working than at the end of the prior expansion,   but manufacturing employment was down 370,000 on balance over the ten-year period  And   even if one assigns a significant share of the help supply employment to manufacturing, it was   still a weak performance  Breaking it down, durable goods employment was reported to have   risen 300,000 over the ten years while nondurable goods manufacturing fell by 670,000 over a   decade of economic boom  And that’s probably an understatement  The chairman of our board   also sits on the board of Hamilton Beach, which I assume still has an SIC code of a small   manufacturer of appliances  But Hamilton Beach has not made any investment in any facility   that manufactures anything in over a decade  All the items that are sitting on the shelves of   Wal-Mart with a Hamilton Beach label on them are bought from contract manufacturers   someplace in the world   The point is that there are powerful secular trends stemming from this continuous   globalization of the economy that are altering the profile of our national economy  They were   doing so before the cyclical contraction, and they will continue to do so during an economic   upturn In fact, these forces are just as likely to strengthen as to abate during a cyclical upturn               September 24, 2002 36 of 115  We will have to look elsewhere for confirmation of any kind of positive bias to the pattern of the   saw teeth   Finally, regarding Dave Stockton’s opening comments  If a year ago at this time Dave   had not only anticipated the subsequent shocks but then went on to forecast accurately what   actually has happened over these past twelve months, I suspect it would have seemed simply not   credible, even given our post-September 11 policy actions  The point is that the US economy   over these past twelve months has performed much, much better than anyone had any reasonable   right to expect, which is a testament to the inherent resiliency of a market economy  And that’s   very important to keep in mind  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I concur with your recommendation because   I think that the near term is dominated by uncertainties of a global nature  For the longer term,   though, all deflations or disinflationary impulses are not equal  And deflationary pressure in the   goods sector coming from extraordinary productivity gains in that sector does not call for a   policy response  "
7138,2002-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our recent Business Advisory Council   meeting wasn’t nearly as downbeat as Cathy Minehan’s, and maybe it’s because at least one   member who didn’t show up was from a company in bankruptcy!  [Laughter] The general   sentiment of the group was summed up by one of the participants who said that the economy has   found the bottom and now it’s only a question of how rapidly momentum builds  There was also   a general consensus that equity markets have seen their lows and it’s only a question of how   slowly or how rapidly the markets strengthen  Several expressed the belief that depressed equity   markets have been more of a factor in reducing job-hopping than has the softness in local labor   markets  In fact, some reported recent firming in their local labor markets         November 6, 2002 38 of 122  Regarding investment plans, two reported that they had taken off holds on investment   spending since the previous advisory council meeting in the summer  Another said that his   company believed that this was a good time for bottom fishing for equipment bargains and for   depressed or bankrupt companies that are for sale  One specific report on investment spending,   from an owner of what I think are now eight McDonalds restaurants in Kentucky, was that the   corporation is shifting emphasis to upgrading existing stores rather than opening new stores    McDonalds announced that $3 billion will be spent in the next couple of years on new   technology for its stores  One of the items mentioned was radio frequency remote order-taking   devices We found from directors that Bob Evans, Applebee’s, Wendy’s, and Kroger’s, all   District companies, also are spending more on technology to improve their operations   As would be expected, suppliers to the residential construction sector are requiring   mandatory weekend work through the end of the year  In commercial construction, one contact   asserted that companies that are capable of build-to-design and turn-key projects are getting   contracts while pure generic construction contracting is, in his words, “dead in the water”  A   maker of upper-end tools reported that both domestic and foreign orders in September and   October were the best so far this year From the bankers on our board of directors we heard that   commercial loan demand and new applications have picked up recently  But members of our   Business Advisory Council said that this may reflect only the fact that even medium and small   companies are now spreading their business over three or four banks rather than relying on a   single lender as they had in the past   A manufacturer of packaged foods said that catalog and Internet sales have strengthened,   with a noticeable pickup in items considered to be holiday season types of goods  Most   important to this director, corporate orders for customer and employee appreciation gifts were         November 6, 2002 39 of 122  coming in strong; this reverses the dramatic drop they saw in sales of such items this time last   year   Regarding corporate earnings, one of our directors who sits on three industrial boards,   Timken, Diebold, and Sherwin-Williams, reported that all three had strong third-quarter earnings   and that their share prices also were recovering  This led our research assistants to turn to their   Bloomberg terminals, and they found that thirty-nine S&P 500 companies are headquartered in   the District; twenty-eight reported improved earnings for the quarter, and their share prices   generally have risen from earlier lows  A director who has an investment management firm said   that after a dismal September he thoroughly dreaded the coming of October  But in the end it   was the best October in his memory  In what I take to be a pure signal of inflation, he also   reported that companies are boosting retainers and meeting fees for directors by as much as   50 percent No productivity there! [Laughter] I suggested that he take up the topic of Reserve   Bank director fees with my successor [Laughter]   Regarding national and global issues, I continue to believe that the near term is   dominated more by fear and uncertainty than it is by any kind of risk and reward considerations    So I have nothing new to add   I want to return to and extend some of the remarks I made at the last meeting about   secular trends in manufacturing, especially nondurable goods manufacturing, that I believe will   overshadow any cyclical trends one might be trying to find Forty years ago, John Kenneth   Galbraith said that the time would come when 2 percent of the population would produce all the   things that we need In that regard he may have been correct, but it depends on one’s view of   what we actually need versus what we want He didn’t say much about the things we might   want He made that statement about productivity trends not because he thought all the items            November 6, 2002 40 of 122  were going to come with labels that said “made in China” but just on the basis of extrapolating   the trends in technology and productivity   In September I traveled to a small town that I’ve visited previously, and there were three   new stores, with names I didn’t recognize, within walking distance of each other  I went into one   of them and picked an item off the shelf, and there was no price label on it, so I asked the clerk   how much it was  She said one dollar So I picked up another item, a larger quantity of a similar   product, and asked how much it was And she said one dollar  I said I didn’t get it She said   everything in the store is one dollar always  I said, “cool”  [Laughter]  This is price stability    But I asked how that could be  Why would anyone buy the smaller quantity instead of the larger   quantity for the same price of one dollar?  Expressing some frustration with my inability to grasp   basic economics, she explained the quality difference between the two but repeated that every   item in the store always costs the same amount  After making purchases there I went to the next   store and asked, “Is everything in this store the same price?”  And the clerk said that everything   in the store costs the same, which is not exactly what I asked but it was close enough  The same   was true in the third store; literally everything in the store was the same price   The additional wrinkle to this story that made it really curious to me is that I was in   Canada Those were Canadian dollars people were spending  I went back and reported this to   our economists, and one of them who also goes to Ontario frequently was curious about it, too    He found a store in northern Ohio called Dollar Tree that works the same way  He said that   exactly the same items that were priced at one Canadian dollar were priced at one US dollar,   which tends to suggest that the actual costs to manufacture these products have fallen to a trivial   level compared with all the other value added involved  That suggests, among other things, that            November 6, 2002 41 of 122  the labor component of what we call nondurable goods is going to continue to vanish to such a   point that international competitiveness will no longer be a factor    This gives rise to what I consider the Rubbermaid effect  That is, there comes a point   where the labor component is so small that, as one manufacturer put it, labor could be free in   China and China still could not compete  That’s because the Chinese manufacturers can’t get   five blue buckets to a south side Omaha store tomorrow morning, but that store knows how   many blue buckets it sold today and local manufacturers can get replacements there quickly    And this is happening not just in the nondurable goods area  A steel manufacturer whose firm is   headquartered in our District said that over the past ten years the average increase in labor   productivity, output per hour, at his firm was 9 percent per year  That means they can produce   the same amount of steel with less than half the workforce they used ten years ago  A member of   our Small Business Advisory Council who has a printing business said that he now produces the   same volume—though I don’t know how he measures his volume—with half the labor force he   employed some years ago and he’s still operating at only 60 percent of capacity  In his view, his   competitors overinvested in technology  All this not only affects what we think about the labor   market data, but over time as this trend continues we’re also going to have to think differently   about the price statistics, at least for certain types of goods  I say that because of what I saw as   very clever tie-in sales in order to price all items at one dollar  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you I think the Vice Chairman’s description of the virtues of   50 basis points and balanced risks versus 25 and the risks tilted toward weakness is correct, and I   won’t repeat that  But to me the issue is more one of a change now versus no change  And in   the spirit of what Gary Stern said earlier about what one thinks one knows with some confidence,   for me it is this  If I look at the sentiment surveys, the risk premiums in markets, and the   inversion of the yield curve on the front end, and if I listen to the anecdotal information about   uncertainties and fears—and give very little weight to the pickup of the stock market in October,   though I wouldn’t dismiss that entirely—it seems clear that the natural rate has moved down    When the natural rate moves down with an unchanged intervention rate, it means that the de   facto stance of policy has at the minimum become less expansionary and possibly restrictive  I   don’t know which is the case here  I may not go as far as Bill Poole might on what is the   desirable growth in nominal money measures, but I do believe that in this environment less   stimulus or a deceleration in monetary growth, if it were to occur, would be undesirable  So I   prefer going with a 50 basis point cut and a balanced risk statement       The first paragraph mentions the discount rate action but without   identifying the Reserve Banks whose pending actions have been approved  Is that going to be   added?  "
7163,2002-12-10," Thank you Dave, I saw a report last week that the 2000 Census had   been adjusted further—by another 33 million people—to correct an undercount  And if my         December 10, 2002 13 of 87  memory is not already failing, the rolling forecast initially had numbers that were 7½ million or   so lower than the preliminary Census 2000 data  We’re talking about close to 11 million people   not counted over a ten-year period  That is huge, it seems to me  Have you had time to look at   those data and think about what the revision does to some of the many numbers we look at on   income and productivity, for example, and also to the divergence between the household and the   payroll employment series?    Thank you again Looking at the information that has become available   in the few weeks since our last meeting, if one filters out the likely effects of the severe winter   weather in parts of the country, the equity market gyrations, the waxing and waning of concerns   over terrorist attacks and a possible war with Iraq, along with the fact that there are fewer            December 10, 2002 28 of 87  shopping days than usual between Thanksgiving and Christmas, there’s nothing left to say    [Laughter] We have all this time to fill up before lunch!    Nevertheless, I will report that the participants in a recent meeting of our Community   Bank Advisory Council as well as our twenty-three directors are less gloomy than they were a   few months ago  Whether this cheerier mood will last beyond the holiday season won’t be   known for some time, of course  But clearly the group dynamics have shifted from a   competition to report more negative anecdotes than the others to a desire to point out things   about which to be positive For example, one director said he believes that a 15 percent increase   in order backlogs and a 25 percent increase in shipments of forklift vehicles versus a year ago   will prove to be a leading indicator of a stronger investment sector  I’ve never studied the   leading indicator properties of forklifts, but my suspicion is that the Chairman has  [Laughter]   In any event, the Cleveland staff is already on the case    That same director is also on the board of a very large insurance company, and he   reported that premiums at that company are on a pace to increase 150 to 200 percent this year    One banker reported that the most significant development to him is that lending on recreational   vehicles has been his strongest line of business this year  I don’t know whether that was   supposed to be good news or not In a go-around of the bankers, most said that the local   economy they serve will be better next year but that their own earnings will decline as a result of   narrow interest margins and an expected decline in fee income  As a side note related to the   subject of potential output and capacity utilization, most expressed the view that their mortgage   departments were operating beyond a sustainable capacity  The bankers also generally believe   that their customers expect higher interest rates in the future, so the bankers’ efforts to extend the         December 10, 2002 29 of 87  maturity of their liabilities by offering higher yields on longer-term CDs have generated little   response   On the national economy, while the various threats and uncertainties about the future that   we’ve been talking about all year have not gone away, there are more-positive forces at work    Those include the narrowing of quality spreads in capital markets and the ample growth of the   entire constellation of reserves and money measures  Moreover, there’s an expectation that   marginal tax rates are more likely to be reduced than increased in the foreseeable future  All   those factors should enhance the inherent resiliency of the natural forces in a market economy     I continue to believe that the overall performance of the US economy in 2002 will be   judged to have been far better than any ex-ante expectation about what the first year after the   terrorist attacks would be like  I trust that the second year will be even better  Thank you   I support the recommendation  "
