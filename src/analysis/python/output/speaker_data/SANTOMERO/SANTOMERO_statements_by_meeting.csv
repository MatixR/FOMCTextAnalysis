4105,2000-08-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Philadelphia District business   conditions have been mixed recently, with improvements in some sectors and slowing in others  In   many respects District developments are similar to what we have heard around the table this   morning but with some interesting differences     The pace of manufacturing activity has picked up after a two-month pause  On the other   hand, recreation and tourism has remained strong as summer spending has hit the region  Certainly   the hotels in the region got a boost from the political convention, filling them to capacity  But in fact   the evidence is broader than that about a good season for our recreational areas  Growth in retail   sales in the region has flattened out this summer, although discount stores and specialty stores did       52  better than department stores  And most auto dealers in the region indicated that sales have slowed   this month  On the construction side, residential, commercial, and public construction activity,   although still strong, has been somewhat reduced in strength over the last several months  The   number of new construction projects coming into the pipeline is beginning to decline  And industry   contacts report that while vacancy rates are low and real estate prices and rents are rising, there has   been a lot of caution, particularly in our urban centers, again noting Philadelphia in that mix   Bank lending continues to rise moderately, but with some slowing on the consumer side,   including residential lending and non-credit-card consumer spending in general  Business lending   continues to be strong, however  Labor markets remain tight, with our region's unemployment rate   slightly below the nation’s in the most recent months, and that is unusual  But reports of outsized   increases in wages and signing bonuses seem to have become less widespread than earlier this year    More retailers in Philadelphia and in Pennsylvania more generally are reporting that they are seeing   increased costs and are passing them on in the retail network  That's not true, however, on the   manufacturing side  Our business outlook survey in August still shows a very high index for prices   paid by manufacturers, but the survey indicates that the index of prices received by manufacturers   declined this month to its lowest level for the year  The manufacturers are still having difficulty   passing on input costs to final customer prices  Businesses and banks generally expect moderate   growth for the remainder of the year   Turning to the nation, we too see mixed signals in the recent national economic data  On   balance these data suggest to us a moderation in the pace of final demand that is moving the   economy toward a more sustainable growth path  Even though the economy remains strong and the   labor market remains tight, recent consumer and producer price measures indicate that inflationary   pressures are not as strong as they were in the first quarter  I also note with interest the Greenbook's       53  latest upward revisions in the trend growth of productivity and potential GDP  I do think that the   outlook for core inflation is not as worrisome as it looked several months ago when I was first   deciding on this position  I also am encouraged by the fact that longer-term expected inflation has   been quite stable, as indicated in the release of our Federal Reserve Bank survey of professional   forecasters and the Michigan survey  The stability of these measures of long-term expected inflation   suggests that people believe that the FOMC will keep inflation under control and leads me to   conclude that the Fed is not behind the curve in this regard     In sum, signs of slower growth are encouraging, especially since we have not yet seen the   full effect of the increases in the fed funds rate and the discount rate that have already been put in   place over the last year  Thank you  "
4106,2000-08-22,"  I support your proposal not to change the fed funds rate and to retain   the statement that the balance of risks is on the side of higher inflation  I think we need more time to   see what is happening with the real economy  Nonetheless, the balance of risks appears to remain on   the side of higher inflation over the horizon  If the indicators of inflation point consistently toward   higher inflation, then we should respond, and I think we should remind the markets of our resolve in   that regard  "
4156,2000-10-03,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is a pleasure to have an opportunity   to talk about conditions in the Third District  Activity in our District is basically flat, with some   decline in interest rate sensitive sectors  Employment declined for the first two months of the third   quarter, but most of that was attributable to the Verizon strike and the layoffs of Census workers    The unemployment rate has remained steady at about 39 percent for the three states, slightly below   the nation's 41 percent rate  Consumer price inflation is accelerating in the District but remains   below that of the nation  Employment costs accelerated in the first half of the year reflecting tighter   labor markets  Somewhat surprisingly, given the recent increases in oil prices, manufacturers in our   Business Outlook Survey reported less upward pressure on prices paid than they did earlier in the   year  Most manufacturers are holding their own prices steady  Signs of slowing are found in   construction and bank loan growth  Housing permits, employment in the construction sector, the   value of residential and nonresidential contracts, and both existing and new home sales are down   from levels at the beginning of the year  At the same time, C&I, consumer, and residential mortgage   lending have slowed somewhat since June  While retail sales did show a rebound as a result of   back-to-school sales, year-over-year increases were below expectations, contrary to some of the      45  comments of others here today  And retail sales were flat this summer  The outlook over the next   six months is that growth will resume but that the pace will be no faster than in the first half   In terms of our perspective on the nation, economic growth in our view slowed in the third   quarter toward its long-term trend rate but may be picking up in the fourth quarter  Household   investment in housing and vehicles slowed from the pace we saw earlier in the year but appears to   have stabilized  Still, if oil prices remain high, the effect on growth could be negative, though   probably not as big as the effects in the 1970s and 1980s  Equity market investors suggest that there   is a fear of a slowdown and their violent reaction to earnings disappointment is noteworthy   On the inflation side, rising oil prices have led to an acceleration in consumer and   producer price inflation  More troubling is the fact that core inflation has also shown a moderate   acceleration  Over this expansion CPI inflation has averaged about 25 percent, but it is not likely to   fall further based on recent inflation figures and the staff forecast  Both of these factors suggest that   inflationary expectations are a real concern going forward, so I share some of the reservations about   the future that have been expressed here today   We like to think about this in an historical perspective  In the fall of 1998 the Fed lowered   the fed funds rate by 75 basis points in three steps in the wake of a financial crisis  It is likely that   the data after that point really reflect the core inflation reacting to the expansion  The Fed has   subsequently raised the fed funds rate to 65 percent and that may be enough to stem the acceleration   of core inflation The tightening the Fed has done to date has not yet been fully felt in the economy,   but higher productivity growth suggests that the equilibrium real rate should be higher  Observed   inflation is likely to be higher and the growth of the goods and labor markets is still something to   watch  Long-term inflation expectations in our Survey of Professional Forecasters have been   holding steady, which is interesting  Respondents still anticipate that the CPI over a ten-year period      46  will be 25 percent  They believe, I guess, that inflation will be held in check by the Federal   Reserve   That is the end of my formal remarks, but I feel some obligation to commend the staff  I   can't do so on a relative basis; I don’t have that framework  But in an absolute sense I can say that I   did enjoy and appreciate the hard work they did in the materials provided to us  Thank you  "
4157,2000-10-03,  I support the recommendation   
4201,2000-11-15,"  There has been little change in my view of the state of the   economy since our meeting six weeks ago  We have more complete data since that time and   those data ratify earlier indications that economic growth has slowed from its very robust pace at   the beginning of the year and that core inflation is accelerating   On the District level, conditions in our region show a similar path  Economic activity   continues to grow but at a slower pace than earlier in the year  Slowing is especially evident in   the interest-sensitive sectors, as one would expect given the Committee’s earlier actions of   tightening monetary policy  Manufacturing, auto sales, housing, and bank lending have eased   off somewhat, but the declines are from relatively high levels of activity  For the first time this   year October’s business outlook survey of manufacturers in our District showed declines in the   general level of activity and in new orders and shipments  That was reversed somewhat in   November, but the latest readings indicate weaker activity than earlier in the year  Housing   permits remain on a downtrend in the three states in our District as they are elsewhere in the   nation    The Third District’s retail picture is also similar to the national one  Dealers in our   region report that auto sales fell in October from September’s levels but remained above the   figures posted in these months last year  Retail sales are coming in below what firms expected   earlier in the year but are up modestly from September to October compared to last year                50      Retailers report that consumer confidence remains high, although there is some concern about oil   prices and stock market volatility   Reflecting the softening of the housing sector, our banks reported fewer residential   real estate loans in October  Consumer lending has slowed somewhat while business lending has   remained fairly strong  Although the banks reported no general signs of deterioration in the   credit quality of local customers, they did see some potential problems in larger shared credits   I would still characterize the labor market in our District as tight despite the fact that   employment actually fell in the third quarter in all three states in our District  Some of that drop   was due to the Verizon strike and reductions in Census employment  The unemployment rate   has remained at 39 percent for the last two quarters, which is the lowest in 30 years in our area    We believe part of the labor market tightness reflects a problem of skill gaps as well as cyclical   activity   It's important to keep in mind the distinction between levels and growth rates in this   situation  Even though growth is slowing, it is slowing from a relatively high level  Our   business contacts give us the first indication of a change and they are talking about a change in   the tone of the economy  But we would be wise not to over-emphasize this anecdotal evidence   while ignoring the level of economic activity  Businesses still see profits rising but not at the   same robust pace as last year and earlier this year  Within this context the news that inflation is   still moving up is troublesome     We conduct three surveys of the business community in our area the Business   Outlook Survey of manufacturers, the Pennsylvania Retail Survey of area retailers, and the South   Jersey Business Survey, which includes businesses in both the manufacturing and the services               51      sectors  All three of the surveys had continued reports of rising input prices, with more increases   than declines  While manufacturers have not found it easy to pass these higher costs on to their   customers, other types of businesses report that they have been able to raise their own prices    Labor costs in our region continue to rise, although they don't appear to be accelerating  In the   Northeast the employment cost index rose 43 percent for the 12 months ending in September,   the same 12-month rate as that reported in June  Our Pennsylvania Retail Survey shows wage   and benefit costs rising in the third quarter but at a somewhat lower pace than in the second   quarter  Similarly, in South Jersey we're seeing record wage and benefit increases and they are   moving to high levels  Anecdotally, firms indicated to us that they are seeing boosts in wages   and salaries by larger amounts this year than in previous years  Firms are also reporting sharper   increases in health insurance costs, as others around the table have reported for their Districts    Perhaps more troubling is that respondents to our Business Outlook Survey continue to expect   their costs and prices to increase over the next six months   On the national level we are seeing pretty much what everyone is talking about here    Growth definitely has slowed in the third quarter--to a reported 27 percent pace, which is below   estimates of potential--and there is an indication that this number might be revised downward    Business fixed investment, an important driver of the robust expansion, grew at half the second-  quarter pace and well below the pace in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of   2000  Residential investment showed a significant decline in the third quarter  Still, this   slowdown in economic growth is from a high level  Recall that growth in real GDP in the   second half of 1999 and the first half of 2000 averaged a bit over 6 percent, significantly above   what many would consider potential noninflationary growth  And even in the third quarter, the               52      consumer, another important driver of the expansion, continued to spend at a good pace  While I   expect that the leveling off of the stock market will mean less impetus in consumption spending,   past increases in permanent income will support spending, and I don't see a major drag on the   consumer side  Labor markets remain tight nationally as they do in our own region  Income is   expected to grow  Thus, while growth has slowed from its extraordinary pace at the beginning of   the year, my feeling is that the economy is still robust   For next year, we looked at our survey of professional forecasters, which will be   released on Monday, November 20th, and I can share the views here  The current outlook for   real GDP and unemployment is about the same as it was three months ago  The forecasters   expect real GDP to grow at an annual rate of 32 percent for the fourth quarter, which is the same   as they reported last quarter  For next year they see the growth rate at 32 percent and   unemployment moving to 42 percent on average  And the median probability that GDP will   decline in any quarter over their forecast horizon is less than 20 percent  They are putting a   slight increase on the probability of a decline, but it is still a relatively small number  One factor   affecting their projection is oil prices  Forecasters were asked to predict these prices, and they   assumed that oil prices will fall somewhat next year to about $29 a barrel rather than the $23 a   barrel in the Greenbook  While they believe the run-up in oil prices in 1999 affected the   economy’s growth rate, they argue that it was not substantial  In our forecasters’ view the   increase in oil prices in 1999 cut only 01 percent from the real GDP growth rate in 2000, and   they forecast that the effect for next year will be only 02 percent     I continue to be concerned about inflation  Measures of inflation continue to   accelerate; and not all of the increase is due to oil prices, since the core measures also have been               53      moving up  Core CPI, the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, and even core PCE inflation have   moved up  This consistency across measures is troubling  And these measures are likely to   continue to accelerate in the short run, as the rise in oil prices passes through to other prices and   the expected depreciation of the dollar puts pressure on other prices in the index  Long-term   inflation has remained steady in our forecasters’ view, but I still believe that the real concern is   one of inflation rather than softness in the economy  So, as for the tilt we were talking about   earlier, I tend to think that's where the tilt ought to be  Thank you  "
4202,2000-11-15,"  I support the proposed statement  I, too, came prepared   with a long list of arguments on why we should remain where we were in terms of the   tilt  I'll forgo those and forgo any request to come back and discuss them further   I find myself in complete agreement with both the wording and the logic   behind it  I recognize that we may not have seen any long-term or major changes in   inflation expectations, but the Fed must remain vigilant against that possibility and focus   the markets on our continued concern over inflation  Given the tools at the Fed’s               95      disposal, the best way for us to ensure maximum sustainable growth is to stay focused on   our goal of price stability  With due regard given to the current economic vulnerability, it   is essential that the Fed maintain its credibility, and I believe the proposed statement does   that  Thank you    "
4250,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming data suggest that the   slowdown in economic growth continues in our region and in the nation  The real question is   whether growth is slowing too much so that the economy will enter a recession  My own reading is   that this is still a growth slowdown and that the economy is not heading toward a recession   Conditions in the Third District are similar to those that I reported at the last meeting    Growth is down appreciably from earlier in the year, with economic activity in the region expected   to grow at a slow pace over the next six months  Manufacturing activity in particular has slowed   considerably since last spring and manufacturing employment has declined this year  Our business   outlook survey of area manufacturers, which will be released this Thursday, shows declines in the   level of economic activity in December, and new orders remain weak  Increased energy costs and   increased import competition stemming from the strong dollar were cited by steel and metal   producers as drags on their businesses  And manufacturers' near-term outlook has weakened   appreciably in recent months   In contrast, indicators in the construction industry are mixed, with the residential housing   sector weakening but the nonresidential sector remaining robust  Housing permits continue on a   downward track in our three states, similar to the pattern in the nation  And home sales are relatively   weak in Pennsylvania and New Jersey  On the other hand, the value of nonresidential construction   in our region rebounded in the third quarter and for the year to date has risen about 6 percent, in   contrast to the 2 percent decline for the nation as a whole  The demand for office and commercial   space remains strong in our region, and rents have moved up as a result   The Third District retail picture continues to be similar to that of the nation  Retail sales   are increasing modestly and area retailers remain somewhat optimistic about holiday sales, expecting   an increase of about 4 percent in nominal sales compared to last year  Motor vehicle sales, by      49  contrast, remain quite weak  Bank lending has improved in recent weeks, mainly in the consumer   area  Bankers report a slowing in demand for business loans and indicate that they have begun to   tighten credit standards because of concern about slower economic growth and declining corporate   profits  Nonetheless, bankers expect overall loan demand to continue at a slow pace for the   remainder of this year and into next   I would characterize our labor markets in the District as still tight  A decline in   employment in the third quarter, which I reported earlier, appears to have been reversed this quarter    The unemployment rate in our region has remained at 4 percent or less all year  Price pressures in   our region appear to be lower than in the nation, with the CPI inflation in Philadelphia running at a   lower pace than the national average this year  And employment costs in the Northeast are also   increasing somewhat more slowly than in the nation  According to our business outlook survey,   there's less upward pressure in industrial prices than reported earlier in the year  And the prices paid   diffusion index is at its lowest level since September 1999  But this good news is tempered by the   fact that businesses in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the nation have suffered sharp increases in the   cost of health benefits  In Philadelphia the cost has gone up 8-1/2 percent this year, the largest rise   since 1992, and many employers are reporting increases in health benefit costs in the 10 to 20   percent range for next year  So inflation concerns remain   Turning to the national condition, the data received since the last FOMC meeting   confirmed that the economy is growing at a slower and indeed a below-trend pace  But a period of   below-trend growth is needed to bring the economy back to potential growth  Compared to a few   months ago, the risks of economic weakness are now higher  The question is whether growth will   slow too quickly and turn negative, given the current stance of policy  In my view, we are about   where we want to be  Consumption and investment spending have been the driving forces in this      50  expansion  A drop in equity prices has had an impact on consumer spending via the wealth effect    However, holiday sales are expected to be fairly good, though not as strong as last year  Sales of   motor vehicles have shown a drop in November but that, too, is not surprising given their recent   extraordinary pace  Investment spending has also slowed over the first three quarters, but monthly   data on orders and shipments of capital goods show continued strong growth  Employment   indicators point to an easing in the labor market; although the unemployment rate edged up to 4   percent in November and initial claims have risen, conditions remain tight   On the inflation front, there are hints that price pressures are easing and that acceleration   in core inflation may be ending  In my view, we would be wise not to reach this conclusion too   soon, however  The core PCE and the core CPI ticked downward in October, but core CPI ticked   back up in November, and the Cleveland Fed’s median price index continues to accelerate  Inflation   expectations have remained in check so far, but recent developments have added to price pressures   and inflation remains a concern to me  Thank you  "
4251,2000-12-19,"  I support your proposal for the reasons you stated, Mr Chairman    As President McDonough indicated, it’s also important that we recognize what we don't know and   not communicate to the marketplace something that we didn't intend to convey by moving at this   point  "
4294,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming data suggest that   the slowdown in economic growth is continuing in our region and in the nation  Neither   the District nor the nation appears to be slipping into recession, however, and there are   signs that conditions have improved since the turn of the year  Still, in my opinion the   risks remain squarely on the down side    Conditions in the Third District are similar to those reported at the time of our   last meeting  Manufacturing is the key source of weakness in our District as well as in   other regions  Our Business Outlook Survey for March shows that manufacturing   activity is still declining, albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year  The indexes of     3/20/01 41  general activity, new orders, shipments, employment, and the average workweek were all   negative  Still, manufacturers were not entirely discouraged, as suggested by survey   indicators of future activity that were mostly positive  Respondents expected general   activity and shipments to pick up over the next six months; moreover, their outlook has   improved somewhat since earlier in the year  Capital expenditure plans are relatively   weak, however, suggesting that respondents do not expect the improvement in   manufacturing to be strong enough to spur general increases in capacity   We have seen a modest improvement in retail sales in our District  January   sales tax collections in Pennsylvania indicated that a slowing around the holiday season   at the end of last year has been reversed in the beginning of this year  Some retailers   have expressed concern that increased consumer expenditures on gasoline, electricity,   and natural gas will continue to limit sales growth  The increase in energy prices added   nearly a percentage point to Philadelphia’s CPI between January of last year and January   of this year  And PECO, the local utility, introduced another 25 percent increase in   natural gas prices effective March 1st  Other retailers appear to be quite optimistic as they   begin placing orders for summer items     Data on the value of construction contracts suggest that work on nonresidential   building and non-building projects will sustain our region at least through the first half of   the year  Housing permits, however, are expected to decline slightly this year     Labor markets in our District are still characterized as tight  The   unemployment rate in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware stood at 4 percent in   January, less than that of the nation  Our directors tell us that it continues to be difficult   to hire skilled labor in such fields as legal, financial services, and health care  But one of     3/20/01 42  our board members reports that cutbacks in manufacturing are increasing the pool of both   skilled and unskilled workers available in the Philadelphia area temporary employment   agency market  In fact, many people who are currently employed are coming in to fill   out applications at temp firms in anticipation of losing their current jobs   To summarize our regional outlook, we still expect economic growth to pick   up to a moderate pace in the second half of the year, but the upturn may well occur a bit   later than we previously had expected     Turning to the nation, incoming real sector data suggest that the US economy   is in somewhat better condition than it was at the turn of the year, but again I would   characterize the risks as clearly on the down side  Growth in aggregate demand for goods   and services appears to have stopped decelerating  The retail sales figures suggest that   consumer spending is growing at a moderate pace, but I would acknowledge that some of   the strength, especially in autos, could be reflecting temporary incentives and discounts    The employment data show that payrolls are increasing at a pace well above that of the   fourth quarter of last year, and the unemployment rate remains low  Manufacturing   remains in decline but the rate of decline seems to have abated somewhat from earlier in   the year  The recent increases in inventories and the cutbacks in production and sales   suggest that inventories remain higher than desired and that the inventory correction will   not be over as soon as originally thought or as I might have hoped   The recent drop in equity prices is worrisome  Developments in the stock   market could have important consequences for real demand and, therefore, economic   growth  The rise in the market over the past few years bolstered consumer confidence   and spending through the wealth effect  Now, with the fall in stock prices, a reverse     3/20/01 43  wealth effect is likely, as are more significant declines in consumer confidence and a   retrenchment in consumer spending  Another risk comes from abroad  The world   economy seems to be slowing, as we heard this morning  That would have a negative   implication for US exports and possibly for the US financial market      The one upside factor I see is the final tax cut passed by Congress, which   might have an extraordinary effect in terms of increased consumer spending  I don’t   believe that is a significant risk, however, given the uncertainty about the effects of recent   stock price declines, which seem likely to overwhelm any concerns about the tax   reduction  Thank you, Mr Chairman    "
4295,2001-03-20,"  I agree with your proposition, Mr Chairman  I think a   50 basis point decrease in the fed funds rate is appropriate at this time  And since I   believe the risks are still on the down side, I favor retaining the balance of risks language   in the direction of weakness, as you indicated   I, too, have become uncomfortable with the possibility that observers might get   the impression that the Committee’s decisions are driven by what the markets expect and   by the direction of stock prices  I’d like to dissuade them of that view  Therefore, I think   it’s important that our press statement indicate that our action was taken to counteract the   real economic effects of falling stock prices, as you suggested  "
4339,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been little change in the   outlook for our regional economy since March  Economic activity continues to edge up overall   and manufacturing activity is still declining  Our business outlook survey for May, which will be   released this Thursday, shows little change from April, with the diffusion indices of general   activity and new orders still showing small negatives  Manufacturers were continuing to cut   inventories in May and more firms reported declines in employment and hours worked than   increases     Our May survey included a special question about firms’ capital spending plans    Thirty-five percent of the manufacturers we surveyed said that they plan to reduce capital   spending this year; 21 percent indicated “by a significant amount”  Fifteen percent reported that   they had raised planned capital spending since the beginning of the year, but for most not by a   significant amount  Going forward, more firms reported that over the next six months they plan   to increase capital spending from the current reduced level than to decrease spending  This is a   slight improvement since April when the firms were more evenly split between increased and   decreased spending in the six months from the survey date  Indeed, most of the indicators of   future manufacturing activity in our survey picked up somewhat in May     Retailers in our District have expressed some concern about their sales going forward    They reported some decrease in foot traffic at the malls in the region  April sales looked slightly   better than March sales, but inventories have continued to rise and retailers are reducing their   plans for inventories over the balance of the year       5/15/01     45   The construction sector has been one of the areas of strength in our region  Residential   real estate activity is fairly strong  Construction activity of all kinds continues at a high rate, as   does employment growth--at least through March, the most recent month for which we have data    Given the sharp decline in national payroll employment in April, the region’s overall employment   picture is likely to worsen in the near term   Turning to the nation, the economy appears to be in a more fragile condition than we   thought it would be by this time  It turns out that the first quarter came in a bit stronger than we   had expected, but economic activity is likely to be weaker in the second quarter  The most recent   data suggest that retail sales and residential real estate seem to be holding up fairly well  And the   mid-May readings of consumer sentiment were up  But those positive signs must be weighed   against April’s employment report, which indicated weakness across many sectors  In January I   said that the one question we were facing was whether the economy in 2001 would behave more   like the economy of 1995 or the economy of 1990  Prior to the April employment report, I would   have said that the economy in 2001 would resemble that in 1995  But the most recent news on   the labor market does raise the specter that the economy’s performance will be more like that in   1990     In our second-quarter survey of professional forecasters, which is scheduled to be   released next week, on average respondents to our special question about the likelihood of a   recession put the probability that the economy will fall into recession this year at 35 percent and   next year at 20 percent  The employment report makes it hard to argue that the inventory   correction is over  The strong drop in employment suggests that firms plan further cuts in   production to bring down inventories  If consumer spending holds up, then this correction could     5/15/01     46   be finished relatively quickly  But how confident can we feel that the consumer, facing   deteriorating job prospects, will continue to spend?     That said, I think the Committee has acted appropriately to forestall bad outcomes    We’ve cut the fed funds rate 200 basis points this year  That drop in rates was aggressive but not   overly so, in my opinion  Indeed, a Philadelphia staff analysis suggests that the FOMC’s recent   behavior is consistent with its behavior in the past  We have lowered the funds rate substantially   but that is a reflection of the speed with which the economic outlook and estimates of the output   gap have deteriorated since the beginning of the year, not a reflection of more aggressive action   than usual by the Committee in reaction to developments  In assessing the economy’s outlook,   however, we must remember the mantra of  “long and variable lags”  Analysis and experience   suggest that we should only now be expecting to see the initial impact on the real economy of the   interest rate reductions that we made at the beginning of the year  We need to remember--and we   need to remind the public--that we will likely get several months of weak economic data even   after the Committee has stopped reducing rates  We also need to remember that the Fed’s long-  term goal is price stability  I’ve become increasingly troubled by the slow upcreep in most   measures of inflation over the past few years; it has occurred despite the strong upward trend in   productivity growth  Those measures may reflect nascent signs of inflation becoming a concern    As short-term interest rates have fallen, long-term rates have increased  The steepness in   corporate and Treasury yield curves suggests either that market participants are beginning to have   some concern about inflation or that they view the current period of economic weakness as likely   to be short-lived  Either way, it suggests that the Committee needs to be more cautious going   forward and even more aware than usual of the need to balance concerns about near-term   economic weakness against the longer-term goal of containing inflationary pressures     5/15/01     47  "
4340,2001-05-15,"  I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  However,   given my view of the economic outlook, I think it would be useful for us to try to telegraph some   message that indicates we’re getting close to the end of this process  If I had my druthers, I’d   probably go 25 basis points today with the tilt toward economic weakness and indicate that we   would be prepared to respond to further indications of weakness  If we go 50 at this point, I     5/15/01     87   believe it’s still necessary to leave the tilt  Nonetheless, in my view it would be useful at least to   include some wording in our press release that indicates we have indeed eased a lot     First, to pick up on a point that President McDonough made, I   think another signal will be the fact that the list of Reserve Banks requesting a discount rate   decrease is an incomplete one; that will be interpreted as the feeling within the Committee  In   my earlier comments I suggested that we should not indicate to the market that we weren’t going   to move again, which I think for all the reasons just stated is counterproductive, but rather that   we have moved 250 basis points  That is a more neutral statement that conveys a fact  And it   can be interpreted as an indication that we feel we have taken substantial steps  That’s the only   way I think we could constructively amend this statement, but that’s your call  "
4384,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As the economy transitions from a     8/21/01 32   period of unacceptably slow growth to a more reasonable pace of activity, we should expect to   see the data shift from predominantly bad news to a mixture of some positive and some negative   observations on the state of the economy  This ought to be true at both the regional and the   national levels I can report that this is what has characterized our District over the last couple of   months But the ratio of good news to bad news is not improving as quickly as I had hoped    When we met in May, I was able to report a slowly improving condition in the Third District    Since then the news has been decidedly mixed and indeed less positive than expected  Our June   indices of economic activity remained flat in Pennsylvania and turned down in New Jersey and   Delaware Our business outlook survey of manufacturers in our region, which had improved in   June, retreated in both July and August The indices of new orders, employment, and the   average workweek all took a turn for the worse this month, while the index of shipments showed   only a slight improvement but remained negative    Our manufacturers continue to pare inventories and they do not see the inventory   correction ending soon They expect to continue cutting inventories over the next six months  In   contrast, our survey of retailers and other non-manufacturing firms shows that they have   successfully worked off any inventory overhang Yet they remain vigilant in their ordering to   avoid a return to excess inventories In a special question, we asked our respondents to what   extent the high value of the dollar had affected their businesses  Almost half of the firms   reported that they had been hurt by the dollar’s strength, and 18 percent said significantly so     Labor market conditions in the region have weakened somewhat  Payroll employment   edged down in the second quarter in the three states in our District  The unemployment rate   moved up but remains below that for the nation  Retail sales, excluding autos, were flat in July    Residential real estate markets remained active, although the sales of both new and existing     8/21/01 33   homes have been running below last year’s pace  Our bankers report that residential mortgage   refinancing activity remains at a fairly high level and that they are actively seeking new business   borrowers among well-capitalized firms  Loan quality remains relatively good     The mixed news has caused people to re-evaluate their expectations about the future    Optimism about the outlook has turned down a bit, with business contacts anticipating slow   improvement at best during the rest of the year  Our staff’s view continues to be that regional   economic growth will pick up somewhat toward the end of the year but that the pickup might   come later than previously thought   Our view on the national economy is similar  Manufacturing remains weak as does   the broad technology sector Neither situation is likely to improve soon  By contrast, the   housing market remains robust and consumer spending remains moderate to good  And there are   signs that labor market conditions have stabilized  The recent data revisions help reconcile some   of what we see in the economy  The substantially faster growth of labor compensation than   previously thought helps to explain the ability of consumers to continue spending; and the   downward revision of profits helps to explain the retrenchment in investment   On the downside, the economic situation abroad has deteriorated since our last   meeting  In many places in the world, economic conditions are proving to be more problematic   than expected and clearly less conducive to a world recovery than I would like  Given the   interdependent nature of our economies, we must remain cognizant of these external factors and   their possible implications for US economic activity going forward     We know that we should only now be feeling the first 100 basis points of easing we   put in place in January, given the lags in the effects of monetary policy  It’s too soon to see the   effects of the additional 175 basis points that came later in the year  Likewise, the fiscal stimulus     8/21/01 34   is only now beginning to come on line  Tax rebate checks started arriving in July, with further   tax cuts to come later  This plus the fact that the data come in with a lag suggest that it’s not   unreasonable that the indicators are giving us a mixed view of the economy at this point  That   said, I must admit that midway through the third quarter I would feel more comfortable if I could   point to some definitive positive signs that a turnaround in the economy is under way  "
4385,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given my views of the economic   outlook and the risks that we observe, I think both parts of your recommended policy are correct    So I support your proposal  "
4431,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Prior to the attacks, the   Third District economy had been flat  Employment continued to decline in the first two   months of the third quarter The manufacturing sector also continued to decline, albeit at   a slower pace than earlier in the year Retail sales remained flat  One sign of a rebound   in activity was an upturn in the pace of residential construction from a weak first quarter    Our calls to business contacts since the September 11th attacks indicate that firms in all   industries in the region have revised downward their forecasts of sales and revenues in   light of continuing uncertainty about possible military action and a retrenchment in   spending by consumers and businesses     Retailers have noted a resumption of consumer spending since the initial days   after the attacks but they say that store traffic and sales have not returned to the levels   experienced prior to September 11th Contacts among general merchandise retailers   expect sales to rise only slowly in the weeks immediately ahead  Managers of local   stores of national chains indicate that corporate marketing plans for the fall have been put   on hold, at least temporarily, though fall and winter merchandise stocking levels have     10/2/01 54   already been set and are subject to only minor adjustment  But some retailers who need   to place orders now for spring merchandise are contemplating reductions from their   earlier plans   Auto sales in the District had been slowing in the weeks before September 11th,   and in the days after the attacks they fell to levels 20 to 40 percent below same-day sales   last year  Auto dealers tell us that they will be reducing their orders to manufacturers for   at least the next month or two  Obviously, the travel and tourism industries have been   hard hit by recent events  In Philadelphia all the conventions scheduled for September   after the attacks were canceled The conventions scheduled for October have not yet   been cancelled but attendance will be lower than normal since some companies have   disallowed air travel for at least 30 days   In terms of employment, while many firms in the region are anticipating   slower sales only a few are considering layoffs, and most of these were contemplating   layoffs before September 11th Much more than the usual level of uncertainty surrounds   the forecast for the regional economy  What is clear is that recent events have pushed the   projected rebound further into the future than previously thought     Our view of the national economy is somewhat the same  The incoming data   suggest that prior to September 11th the economy had remained soft  The terrorist attacks   on the United States have probably pushed the economy into recession  These   unprecedented attacks have raised the specter of further shocks, such as US military   action and more terrorist strikes While we’ve seen some rebound in consumer spending   from the depressed levels in the days just after the attacks, there has not been a total   recovery Uncertainty about the future will cause consumers to delay some purchases     10/2/01 55   and to cancel others While real estate and other assets certainly have cushioned the   negative effects on household net worth, the significant fall in equity prices could result   in a substantial decline in household spending  Uncertainty and a drop in consumer   spending will cause businesses to delay capital outlays   The economic situation abroad has also deteriorated since our last meeting, as   we heard in the staff briefing Data suggest that these economies were weaker prior to   the attacks than we had anticipated  And though not on their soil, the terrorist attacks are   a negative shock to economies outside the United States  Thus, this country cannot look   to strong economies abroad to buoy our own economy     Our near-term outlook is similar to that of the Greenbook  We agree that the   attacks will have a significant negative impact in the short run  However, I believe there   could be some upside risks associated with the Greenbook’s forecast for 2002  The   effects of the terrorist attacks on consumer and business confidence may fade more   quickly than assumed  Expansionary fiscal policy in combination with easier monetary   policy may have a stronger impact than assumed  Indeed, a Philadelphia staff analysis   suggests that forecasters tend to under-predict the response of output growth to   expansionary monetary policy  Thus, it is possible that the economic recovery could   begin earlier in 2002 and end up stronger than projected in the Greenbook  This would   imply that the Committee would have to be ready to raise interest rates sooner than   assumed in the baseline forecast  That said, I find it difficult to argue with the basic   outlines of the Board’s staff forecast  Philadelphia staff analysis indicates that while   forecasters significantly revised their forecasts downward in the aftermath of past crises,   forecast errors were little different during crisis periods than in other periods  So, as     10/2/01 56   much as I would like to, I am unable to say that the Greenbook forecast surely errs on the   downside Thank you  "
4432,2001-10-02, I support your recommendation  
4476,2001-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall underlying economic   conditions in our District have worsened somewhat since our meeting five weeks ago  While there   has been a slight rebound from the initial decline in activity we saw after September 11th, the   underlying trend still has a downward tilt and our contacts acknowledge a good deal of pessimism   regarding the rest of the year  The October business outlook survey gave us our first data on the   District since September 11th Prior to the attacks, manufacturing in our region appeared to be   stabilizing That is no longer the case  The index of current activity took a sharp downturn in     11/6/01 47   October, indicating that manufacturing activity continued to contract in the District and at a much   faster pace than in prior months Indeed, the index is now at levels we saw at the beginning of the   year There was a striking consistency across all the indices  New orders, shipments, and   employment indices all fell sharply in October  Manufacturers’ capital spending plans remained   weak   In our October survey we asked some special questions to try to gauge the effects of the   September 11th attacks First, we asked each firm how the attacks had affected their shipments and   new orders Half of the firms reported that shipments were unaffected  But 40 percent reported a   decrease and 10 percent said it was a significant one  The results for new orders were more   troubling, since over 50 percent of the firms reported a decrease in orders, suggesting that activity   will continue to be weak in the coming months  We also repeated a question from a previous   month’s survey by asking firms when they expected to see a turnaround  The results indicate that   many of the respondents are putting the rebound further out into the future than they had in the past    There was some good news, however, in that 75 percent of our respondents still expect to see a   turnaround before the second half of next year   Other economic indicators for our District are weak  Payroll employment in each of our   three states declined in the third quarter and the unemployment rate increased  It will likely go   higher in subsequent months, given the current pace of layoffs  Retail sales in the District are   running below last year’s pace  Zero percent financing has boosted motor vehicle sales in the   region, as many others have indicated for their Districts, but dealers expect sales to decline later this   year since the incentives are pulling sales forward as well as generating new sales  Indeed, dealers   report to us that they are limiting their orders from the factories Retail sales of other goods and   services have risen in recent weeks but have not regained the levels seen before the terrorist attacks     11/6/01 48   Finally, construction activity in the District, one of our better-performing sectors during   this downturn, has eased somewhat  Homebuilders in the District generally report steady demand   for new homes, with some softening in demand for higher-priced housing  Nonresidential   construction activity has begun to fall off   On the national level, the events of September11th and their aftermath have significantly   weakened the near-term outlook for the economy  Even before the attacks, the economy was more   sluggish than many of us had forecasted earlier in the year  The initial estimate shows a contraction   in GDP growth in the third quarter, which is not a surprise  And most forecasts, including our own,   see a sharp contraction in the fourth quarter  Typically the longer-run outlook is the least certain, but   these days most economists feel more certain about the long-run prospects for the economy than the   medium-term  Assuming no further shocks, we see a pickup in activity next year, driven by the   aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus  The difficulty, of course, is determining when this pickup   will occur and whether further monetary stimulus will help to ensure a better outcome     My outlook is similar to the Greenbook’s, although rebounds have been much stronger   historically than the one we are now forecasting  In addition, a Philadelphia staff analysis suggests   that forecasters typically underpredict the response of output growth to expansionary monetary   policy Nonetheless, the incoming data certainly point to continued economic weakness in the near   term and one could easily argue that the current period represents a break with past history  The   October NAPM survey, like our Bank’s business outlook survey, indicates that manufacturing will   continue to struggle Labor market indicators point to accelerated job losses  The sizable drop in   consumer confidence suggests continued weakness in consumer spending  The surge in October   auto sales drew sales from the future, so vehicle sales are likely to fall in future months      11/6/01 49   Nevertheless, the auto sales data illustrate the stimulative effect of interest rate declines even in   times of increased uncertainty and unease     So where does this all leave us?  In response to the devastating events of September 11th,   the Committee’s focus appropriately turned to the immediate term and we acted swiftly and   significantly The fed funds rate is now 100 basis points lower than it was on September 10th Two   months have now passed since the attack  I certainly do not want to underestimate the amount of   weakness we are seeing in the economy and that we expect to see in the coming months  I’m   sufficiently unsure about the timing and strength of the forecasted recovery, even given the sizable   monetary stimulus already applied to the economy, that I would support some further easing action    However, it seems incumbent upon us to begin to shift our focus back to the medium and   longer term  In so doing, we would acknowledge that a significant amount of monetary and fiscal   policy stimulus has been applied to the economy  By almost every measure, monetary policy is   quite accommodative and there is more fiscal stimulus on the way  Focusing on the medium and   longer term would help us prepare the markets and the public for the time when the Committee   decides that further rate cuts are not needed  It would also shift some of the focus from monetary to   fiscal policy It would give us more flexibility going forward as we gather additional data on the   economy’s current condition and its trajectory  Thank you  "
4477,2001-11-06," I’m sufficiently uncertain about the timing and the strength of the   forecasted recovery that I support a cut of 50 basis points  I do worry a little about endogenizing   expectations regarding what we’ll do next and about how weak the economy really is  Having said   that, I support the recommendation  "
4527,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Underlying economic conditions in the   Third District have remained essentially flat since our meeting five weeks ago, suggesting that the   economy has once again stabilized  This is an improvement relative to the conditions I reported here   at the November meeting, when the District’s economic situation was worsening  We know that   consumer spending will be an important impetus to the recovery  Holiday sales in the District have   not been as weak as many had feared, although it’s still too early to make predictions for the season as   a whole Regional data do not yet show a broad-based pickup in retail sales, and some of our retail   contacts are expressing concern that sales may remain weak into the spring  And consumer   confidence in our region continued to decline through November   The housing market has not fared as well in the region as it has in the nation  While   housing permits and the value of residential construction contracts were up in the spring and summer,   they’ve remained flat since then The falloff in residential real estate markets is expected to be a   modest one, however Business investment is not likely to contribute to growth in our region, at least   until the second quarter of next year  Investment in structures by businesses declined this year and   nonresidential building contracts in our three states dropped dramatically over the last few months    Vacancy rates in the city of Philadelphia and its suburbs are up about 5 percent since the beginning of   the year The market is not as overbuilt as it was in the 1980s, so the real estate cycle will not be as   deep as in the previous recession Of course, this also means that real estate will not be the engine of   growth for the recovery   Equipment spending by respondents to our South Jersey survey, which includes retailers,   service firms, and manufacturers, was down in the third quarter and is expected to grow only modestly   over the next six months  In November, manufacturers in our business outlook survey reported that     12/11/01 50   they expected no rise in capital expenditures, including structures and equipment, over the next six   months Manufacturing in our District remains quite weak  The indices of general activity, new   orders, shipments, and manufacturing employment in our survey have not recovered from the steep   declines reported right after September 11th Survey results suggest that there is some inventory   correction still to come in our manufacturing firms, with about 1/3 of the firms reporting in November   that they plan further cuts in inventory When asked when they thought the recovery would occur,   over 70 percent of the respondents to our surveys, including manufacturers, retailers, and service   firms, expected to see some improvement before or during the second quarter of next year  But the   service firms and retailers were somewhat more optimistic than the manufacturers  This is consistent   with the Philadelphia staff’s forecast, which suggests some modest pickup in employment in all three   of our states by the second quarter of next year accompanied, however, by continued increases in   unemployment rates in our region       It is also consistent with many forecasts for the nation as a whole  For example, the median   forecast from our fourth-quarter Survey of Professional Forecasters also predicts economic recovery in   the second quarter of next year, as does the Greenbook  My own view for both the region and the   nation is a bit less optimistic  I think it will take some more time before businesses and consumers   feel the recovery is in place--perhaps by midyear or the third quarter--although I must admit that the   error bands around these forecasts make it difficult to distinguish among them    Consumer spending is the key element in all the forecasts  Obviously the pattern of growth   will be affected by auto sales, which were pulled forward by the zero percent financing deals and,   therefore, will fall back next quarter  Nonetheless, in most forecasts consumption is the engine of   growth next year beyond the first quarter As growth of consumer spending accelerates, inventory   building resumes, followed by a pickup in investment spending, which helps solidify the recovery          12/11/01 51    Philadelphia staff analysis of the behavior of leading indicators during previous recessions   suggests that we are on path for such a recovery  However, I remain somewhat concerned that the   economic recovery could be delayed, even given the sizable monetary stimulus applied this year,   which no doubt has helped to attenuate the downturn     In particular, two parts of the recovery scenario appear problematic  First, the strength of   the recovery is dependent on further fiscal stimulus, the details of which remain to be worked out    Secondly, weak labor market conditions could undermine consumer confidence and spending  Should   this happen, the timing of the recovery would be later and the magnitude smaller  That said, as I   discussed last time, I believe the Committee should begin focusing on the medium- and longer-term,   recognizing that the full effects of its actions--those implemented throughout the year as well as any   action taken today--are felt with a lag  We need to prepare the markets and the public for the time   when further rate cuts are not needed, and I think a more measured approach today to policy is   appropriate Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
4528,2001-12-11," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  The recovery   appears to be on track or at least visible in the distance  As you point out, the timing and magnitude of   the recovery depend on consumer spending, which is still uncertain  And to counter the risk   associated with that, I support further easing  I also support leaving the risk statement weighted   toward economic weakness at least at this time  But I also feel that the wording of the press   announcement is particularly important this time, so I look forward to seeing the craftsmanship  "
4584,2002-03-19," I believe there’s no easy answer to the question that is being raised   by the Desk If we look at the data on outstandings, that should be obvious  Once one moves   away from Treasuries, what’s left are corporates, agencies, mortgage-based paper of various   kinds, and foreign securities—or at least foreign sovereign debt based assets  Municipal   securities were never a real alternative, given the limited size and depth of that market  If we   eschew credit risk and we shy away from GSEs, we’re left with Ginnies and foreign sovereign   debt based assets The staff has laid out the right issues here   Maintaining a GNMA portfolio is work that involves special skills  These skills aren’t   difficult to find, nor are they difficult for the Desk to acquire  The Desk could, in fact, maintain   a portfolio of mortgage-backed instruments  The industry that we regulate has thousands of its   members engaged in that activity as we speak, and given that our interest is limited to portfolio   investment rather than trading, it’s really pretty simple to accomplish  Alternatively, shifting to   dollar RPs against foreign sovereign securities would appear to be an easier option  The Desk is   already involved in RP transactions, and so allowing sovereign collateral seems like an easy step   From a conceptual point of view this is correct  However, as the staff memo indicates,   the market for cross-currency repos is currently quite small  We in essence would need to create   a market or, as the memo states, create a more vibrant market out of one that is indeed quite     March 19, 2002 Page 19 of 117  small  I have great reluctance to do so for two reasons  First, we would have to define countries   whose sovereign debt was acceptable to serve as collateral in transactions with the Federal   Reserve And we’d have to maintain such a list  More to the point, we would have to be   prepared to remove from our list a country whose fundamental creditworthiness had changed   substantially This would be awkward at best and potentially politically difficult  Second, it’s   not at all clear to me that the Federal Reserve should be placed in the role of market creator  We    currently worry, appropriately, about disrupting markets with our trades  Why should we be   willing to create new markets?  Clearly, if the Desk indicated that it would be trading in such   cross-currency instruments, the market would develop  But this would change spreads and alter   the status quo in uncertain ways I’m not sure that this is an appropriate role for the Federal   Reserve to play in world capital markets     In fact, I more or less come to the conclusion that maybe we should slow this effort   down I hesitate to say this It took us almost a year to get to this point  But the Treasury seems   to have shifted its spending outlook, as we indicated, and maybe not enough by the back-of-the­  envelope calculations But at least at the moment that has given us some breathing room  And   as was mentioned at the outset, the auction credit facility seems to have some promise if we in   fact proceed with it  If we must act, I guess I’d favor the GNMAs  And as a side bar, there are   lots of MBAs out there who would be happy to run that portfolio for us  Given the weakness in   the labor market, there are probably plenty available at the moment  Those are my comments  "
4585,2002-03-19," I’d be interested in some comments about what is going on in the   German and French economies at this point    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I reported at our last meeting at the end   of January that the foundation for recovery was in place in the Third District  I now believe that   such a recovery is under way District economic conditions have improved over the past two   months The manufacturing and retail sectors have strengthened, and the outlook of business   contacts in the region has turned considerably more positive  There are still pockets of   weakness For example, commercial vacancy rates have increased in the last few months    Nonetheless, forward-looking indicators suggest continued improvement ahead     Our most recent data come from the Business Outlook Survey of area manufacturers    The March survey results will be released this Thursday  I reported last time that the index of   general activity had turned positive in January for the first time in fourteen months  That   increase was followed by another increase in February, and our March survey will show another   positive reading at 11 percent  While that is marginally lower than February’s 16 percent   reading, I’m not too concerned about this decline for two reasons  First, the swing we saw in this   index from negative to positive in January had been larger than the typical swing at the end of   recessions Second, though fewer firms reported an increase in activity in March, the number of   firms reporting increases was more widely distributed across industries  The indexes on     March 19, 2002 Page 66 of 117  shipments and new orders also remained positive in March, with about 7 percent more firms   reporting increases than decreases  Last month the index of delivery times rose above zero for   the first time in two years and it, too, remained positive this month  While firms continue to   reduce inventories in March, the reductions are slowing; and for the first time during this   downturn, firms are reporting that they expect to increase inventories in the next six months    Our survey also indicates that manufacturing firms continue to shed workers  They did so in   March, and the workweek continued to shorten However, consistent with the strengthening in   activity, the employment outlook has also strengthened since January  Our March survey   suggests that in general, manufacturers expect to increase payrolls over the next six months     In a special question in this month’s survey we asked the firms that expected to increase   production how they expected to do it Over 40 percent said that they planned to hire additional   workers; about 30 percent planned to increase the work hours; and about 25 percent expected to   increase production solely through increased productivity of current staff working at current   hours I find this last number particularly interesting It underscores the fact that productivity   gains have become a significant component of business strategy in our area  Productivity gains   and weaker demands in earlier months have helped to contain price pressures in the District  In   March, however, the current prices paid and received indexes in our Business Outlook Survey   turned positive for the first time in eight months  Price expectations are positive and rising     My view of the national economy has turned significantly more positive over the   intermeeting period, as the data have been fairly consistently on the high side of expectations  I   now believe the economy has turned  Notwithstanding the strong data, I continue to believe that   this recovery will be weaker than most experienced in the postwar period  As we all know,   however, weaker than usual doesn’t mean weak in the absolute  In fact, the current range of     March 19, 2002 Page 67 of 117  forecasts that have been made for the first quarter and for all of 2002 would support my   characterization of a recovery that is weaker than the average postwar experience  This view   partly reflects the strength of consumption spending throughout this economic downturn, which   has been the primary factor in the mildness of this recession  In the early stages of a recovery,   real PCE growth is typically quite strong, often above 5 percent, reflecting recovery in the   consumption of durables more so than nondurables and services  But during this downturn, auto   and home sales have remained strong  With less pent-up demand, consumption growth should   remain moderate  I also believe that it will take time for business spending to reignite  On the   other hand, the government budget continues to be more stimulative than anyone might have   guessed only a year ago, and businesses have a habit of responding quickly to changes in market   conditions So we may yet be surprised on the upside     In any case, given the revised, more positive outlook, I believe it’s time to refocus our   attention on the longer run  We now see that the recovery is in place  That’s not to say it’s a   sure thing, but economic conditions have begun to improve across various sectors  Our   expansionary monetary policy is having the desired effect  The Committee now needs to   contemplate its strategy for moving the stance of monetary policy back toward neutrality  At this   point, we don’t need to decide where neutral is, but we need to take the necessary steps to allow   us to raise rates in the not too distant future  This means preparing the public and the market for   such a time  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
4586,2002-03-19," I support your recommendations, Mr Chairman  "
4630,2002-05-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting in March I reported   that economic recovery was taking shape in the Third District  That recovery continues, albeit at   a moderate pace  I spent the last month traveling around our District to a series of meetings with   bankers and business people Most of these contacts told me that they have seen increased               May 7, 2002 35 of 81  demands in their markets and that they believe the worst is over  This was true even in areas that   traditionally have been among the weakest in our District  According to our business outlook   survey, the region’s manufacturing sector improved for the fourth consecutive month in April    Our indexes of general activity, new orders, and shipments moved up  The current inventory   index for the last two surveys has been close to the two-decade average  This suggests that the   cyclical inventory reduction has likely run its course  Indeed, the future inventory index from   our April survey rose to the highest reading since 1984, suggesting that firms expect to be   rebuilding inventories over the next six months  Consistent with this, the CEO of a large   chemical company reported increased demand for his products, which are inputs into the   production of many consumer durables   In answer to a special question in our recent business outlook survey, one-third of our   respondents said that they plan to increase capital spending from current levels  The planned   increases are modest, and most are expected to occur in the second half of the year  However, it   is worthy of note that only a few suggested that they were increasing spending in response to the   capital-expensing provisions of the newly enacted economic stimulus package  The   improvement in the region’s manufacturing sectors has not spurred firms to add to their payrolls   yet, although the employment declines are less than we’ve seen in the past  Overall, employment   in each of our three states fell in the first quarter, and the state unemployment rate rose  This   weakness is likely to continue over the next few months, consistent with April’s national   employment report released last Friday  But firms are beginning to report that they plan to add   to their payrolls to meet increased demand  Many will be permanent hires  This is especially   true of retailers and service firms            May 7, 2002 36 of 81  Consumer demand in the District has held up, but Pennsylvania sales tax collections   indicate that retail sales are largely being supported by auto sales  Housing sales and residential   construction have shown gains in the past few quarters, and strong demand has pushed up house   prices This has also meant brisk sales for home furnishings, as you’ve heard around the table    Sales of other types of merchandise have been slower to recover  On the other hand, our first-  quarter South Jersey business survey of retailers, service firms, and manufacturers posted its first   positive reading in over a year  And the index of future sales is at high levels, an indicator that   we may expect a pickup in sales over the next few months   Prices in a few sectors in our region have shown sizable increases from year-ago levels    These include housing and medical costs, as we all know  Nevertheless, overall consumer   inflation remains moderate, tempered by productivity gains and weakness in demand during the   downturn Core CPI inflation in the Philadelphia region for the most recent twelve months is   about 2¾ percent, just slightly above the national average  However, we have begun to see some   signs of rising industrial prices  The price indexes from our business outlook survey are rising   after a period of negative readings, and the prices-paid index in our South Jersey business survey   has also returned to positive territory  I don’t want to overemphasize these signs of firming   prices Nevertheless, they do serve as a reminder that, as the recovery gains momentum, the   Committee will need to take steps to prevent an acceleration in inflation next year and beyond   My views on the national economy are consistent with what I’ve seen in the District  The   economic data we have received during the intermeeting period show that the economic recovery   is under way Earlier indications from our business outlook survey that manufacturing activity   was beginning to recover are now reflected in both the ISM and the industrial production   numbers  The timing of the inventory correction pushed up first-quarter growth at some expense         May 7, 2002 37 of 81  to second-quarter growth, but underlying demand has strengthened since our last meeting    Indeed, final sales came in stronger than expected in the first quarter, and I’m not convinced that   we will see much change this quarter  The Greenbook forecast of final sales growth of less than   1 percent seems a bit too low to me     One upside risk in the near term concerns imports  If the dollar continues to depreciate,   import growth could be weaker and domestic production stronger than assumed by the   Greenbook The April employment reports came in below expectations, but the weakness in   labor markets should come as no big surprise  Cyclical components of both employment and   unemployment typically lag GDP by a quarter or two  Note that the rapid productivity growth   we have seen means slower growth in employment, but it also means a more rapid recovery in   profits I don’t think the rise in oil prices we’ve seen over the last two months is sufficient in   magnitude to affect our outlook   Although I believe recovery is under way, I do have some concerns  At our last meeting   a major question was the outlook for capital spending  It remains uncertain  The March data on   nondefense capital goods were a disappointment, and the capacity utilization rates are still at low   levels, so firms might delay capital spending if sales and earnings slow  This could, in fact, stall   the recovery  On the positive side, our survey data suggest some improvement in the outlook for   capital spending Another hopeful sign is that capacity utilization has been rising since   December, and the change in utilization is associated with future spending on equipment and   software, with a one-quarter ahead correlation of 88 by our estimation    My feeling is that we’re in a transition and that the next few months will be tricky    Employment growth was low this month, and GDP growth is likely to be weaker this quarter   than last  Still, the ultimate policy question does not concern what the economy does over the                  May 7, 2002 38 of 81  next quarter but where the economy is headed by the end of the year  The tradeoff between   short-run and long-run concerns will determine when the Committee must take the first and   inevitable step on the path toward neutrality  Weakness in the labor market and a benign   inflation outlook give the Committee some time to wait  However, historically forecasters have   typically underestimated the effect of policy on the economy  This bears remembering, given   our current very accommodative policy stance  Thank you, Mr Chairman    The 88 was a one-quarter-ahead correlation between the change in   capacity utilization and future spending on equipment and software     Yes, spending on equipment and software    Yes, the cyclical components  "
4631,2002-05-07," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman              May 7, 2002 74 of 81 "
4683,2002-08-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming data point to continued   moderate recovery in economic activity in the Third District, but the pace has slowed from   earlier this year  Retail sales in the region were mainly flat in July but were up from year-ago   levels in most product lines  Local auto dealers report that the new rounds of incentives   supported increased sales in July  Many of the area retailers we contacted did express some   concern that the recent turmoil in financial markets and lower consumer confidence could lead to   a pullback in consumer spending  As a result, retailers have become a bit more cautious in   placing orders for goods Regional real estate markets are consistent with national trends    Residential markets remain strong while commercial markets remain weak  Residential   construction contracts, housing permits, and home sales have all been increasing this year   compared with the same period last year  Housing markets have shown somewhat more strength   in our region than in the nation as a whole In the first quarter, house-price appreciation was   above the national average in New Jersey and about at the national average in Pennsylvania and   Delaware In contrast, commercial real estate markets remained soft  Office vacancy rates are         August 13, 2002 39 of 92  around 12 or 13 percent in the city of Philadelphia and even higher in the suburban markets   where construction of some new office space has been completed  New buildings coming on   line in the first quarter were only half leased   Labor markets in the District remain stable  Employment in our region increased slightly   in June for the first time in eighteen months  The unemployment rate in Delaware, New Jersey,   and Pennsylvania remained below that of the nation  The tri-state unemployment rate stood at   54 percent in the second quarter compared with 59 percent for the nation  Activity in the   region’s manufacturing sector is mixed  In July our business outlook survey index of general   activity posted its seventh positive reading in a row  Although manufacturing activity in the   region expanded in July, it did so at a slower pace than earlier this year  Based on our August   survey, which will be released this Thursday, that trend continued in August  The new data   suggested some contraction in regional manufacturing this month; the August number is minus   31 To me this is not good news  However, I caution you that it is only a single month and that   recoveries are not always linear   Inflation remains modest in the region  Wages and house prices are rising at a somewhat   faster pace in the Philadelphia region than in the nation, but industrial prices are mostly holding   steady The sluggishness of the recovery has taken its toll on the budgets of the three states in   our District All three cut spending to below plan during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002    Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also used their rainy day funds to replace a large portion of   the revenue shortfall The increase in New Jersey’s fiscal year 2003 budget over its 2002 budget   is based upon very optimistic assumptions about income and sales tax revenues  Because state   revenue growth generally lags the end of a recession, state fiscal problems are expected to   continue at least through fiscal year 2003         August 13, 2002 40 of 92  Nevertheless, the incoming data suggest that the Third District has continued to   experience a gradual recovery It is more gradual than I would like, but perhaps I should be   content In the past our District has felt recessions more deeply than the nation and has lagged   the nation in its recoveries  This time we have kept pace     Turning to the national outlook, incoming data on the national economy have been   weaker than expected This is undeniable  And the stock market retreat is likely to further damp   both business investment and consumer expenditures  As a result, my outlook for the economy   has been tempered from my earlier view, which was not overly optimistic  Nevertheless, in my   view the data taken as a whole continue to tell us that a moderate recovery is under way, albeit a   more gradual one than we would like  Consequently, monetary policy will probably have to   remain accommodative for longer than we had previously thought  However, we should keep in   mind that the weak second-quarter GDP growth reflected a surprising surge in imports rather   than unexpectedly weak domestic demand  Inventory decumulations slowed substantially in the   first quarter, and inventories were essentially unchanged in the second quarter  In addition, we   saw a moderate increase in business investment in equipment and software in the second quarter    Labor markets have stabilized, although they have not yet bounced back  All this is consistent   with a recovery   Going forward, the recent declines in the stock market, if sustained, will temper   consumer spending and business investment  But it is still too soon to know by how much and,   for that matter, the market’s future course  In my opinion the sluggishness in labor markets is   potentially a larger downside risk to consumer spending than the stock market declines  Could   the recovery derail?  Yes But by and large the weaker economic data we have seen pertain to a   single month  We should remember that recoveries usually proceed in fits and starts and that our            August 13, 2002 41 of 92  data are subject to revision For example, the data available to the Committee in October 1992   showed that economic growth was weakening  GDP growth had come in at 29 percent in the   first quarter and 15 percent in the second  Employment reportedly had fallen in three of the four   previous months for a cumulative loss of 87,000 jobs  But subsequent data revisions showed that   GDP growth was 38 percent for the first half of 1992 and that employment, in fact, grew by   312,000 jobs for the four-month period between June and September of that year   In short, I don’t think we have sufficient evidence today to make a case that the recovery   has stalled Responding at this point would appear to be an overreaction  Such fine-tuning is   dangerous in my opinion  We are just as likely to generate instability as we are to improve   economic outcomes  At a time like this, when there is increased uncertainty in the markets, it is   tempting to respond  However, we must keep in mind that the monetary policy we already have   in place is quite accommodative It seems prudent to stay the course and keep watching the data    Should the data suggest that the economic recovery is faltering, then we should take decisive   action Nevertheless, I would have to say that, in my view, the risks have tilted toward weaker   economic activity in the short term and a key question is whether we should say so  I think some   recognition of the weakness of economic conditions is probably in order, but that is not   necessarily the same as shifting the bias  We all know that such a shift in the statement at this   time is likely to be interpreted as a signal that we plan to or think it is likely that we will cut rates   at our next meeting in September  At this point I’m not convinced that such action will be   needed in September  So, to avoid sending the wrong signal, I have a slight preference for   leaving the statement unchanged at this meeting  Thank you  "
4684,2002-08-13," I can support your recommendation for no change in the fed funds   rate at this meeting and a change in the balance of risks statement  I have a slight preference for   leaving the balance of risks statement as is  As I noted earlier, however, I do believe that the   risks have shifted toward economic weakness, so I can’t argue about the change in the tilt  I do   worry a little about giving the public and the markets the wrong signal, namely that we plan to   change rates I know it should not be viewed in that way, but it often is  That’s the reality, I   think But I don’t want to make too much of this  A shift in the balance of risks mirrors reality,   so I’m quite happy to go along with the recommendation     I agree  "
4735,2002-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting in August, I   reported that the recovery in the Third District appeared to be slowing from the pace seen earlier   in the year Incoming data reinforce this assessment  Although auto sales in the region remain   robust, retail sales of general merchandise slipped from July to August  Some merchants   remarked that the long spell of hot weather damped sales of fall merchandise, especially apparel         September 24, 2002 40 of 115  Retailers tell us that their outlook for sales over the balance of the year is uncertain, so they’re   being cautious about their inventory plans  Consumer spending on tourism and related activity   has been below last year’s level in each of our three states  While day-trip numbers this summer   were higher than last year, overnight stays and spending per visitor were down, resulting in less   business at most vacation areas  Residential real estate activity also appears to be moderating but   from relatively high levels  Housing permit issuance has moved up this year, but builders   contacted in August said their new homes sales had slowed a bit  Residential real estate agents   reported that sales of existing homes also slowed in July and August but that the rate of sales   remained high by historical standards and price appreciation continued at a rapid rate     Commercial real estate markets have remained soft  Although there has been only a   small increase in the metropolitan Philadelphia area vacancy rate from the first to the second   quarter, rent concessions have become more common and more generous  The value of   nonresidential construction contracts awarded in the region has fallen since spring when the total   was boosted by contracts for casinos, offices, and educational buildings  Our contacts in   commercial real estate say they expect some improvement but probably not until next year    Loan volumes in Third District banks have been flat to down in recent weeks, as strong growth   in residential real estate loans has been offset by declines in business lending     Labor markets in the District have stabilized  After declining in the first and second   quarters, employment in our three states was flat in the first two months of the third quarter  The   tri-state unemployment rate remains below that of the nation—averaging 53 percent in the first   two months of the third quarter, down from 55 percent in the second quarter   Activity in the region’s manufacturing sector paused this summer  In August our   business outlook survey index of general activity dipped into negative territory for the first time        September 24, 2002 41 of 115  since last December  The index strengthened slightly in September, returning to positive   territory with a reading of plus 23, a level that is consistent with not much change in regional   manufacturing activity this month  Our index has a reasonably good track record in predicting   national industrial activity, so the modest rebound suggests that recent declines in manufacturing    activity in the District and perhaps in the nation may have abated    In September the indexes on new orders and shipments also moved back into positive   territory We also saw some improvement in capital spending plans over the next six months    This index rose from about 5 percent in August to about 13½ percent in September, which is   somewhat closer to the range of readings normally recorded in expansionary periods  As a   summary measure, our indexes of current economic activity are indicating slight, positive growth   in the three states   Third District conditions appear similar to those in the rest of the nation  In my   assessment, the economic recovery continues at the national level but at a slower pace than   earlier in the year The real issue is that the recovery has yet to develop any kind of traction to   help it build momentum  It is looking very much like the so-called jobless recovery of 1991-92    Indeed, in terms of job growth, this recovery has gotten off to the second slowest start in any   postwar recovery This partly reflects the fact that the services sector has become a much larger   portion of total payroll employment, and job growth in that industry is normally weak in the   early stages of a recovery But in both 1991 and 2002 the recovery in service employment has   been even weaker than average  In 1991 the financial headwinds included job losses in finance    This time the shock of September 11 and the collapse of the tech bubble have adversely affected   the broad services sector, including airlines and travel, telecom, and IT, as well as the financial   sector     September 24, 2002 42 of 115  Two other similarities to 1991 are the sharp decline in business and consumer   sentiment—although not to the level of 1991—and the concern that the recovery may be stalling    You may recall that by December 1991 the Greenbook had forecast two slightly negative   quarters based upon a very negative November employment report, which was later revised    Today, we face the lingering effects of September 11 on the national psyche, the aftermath of the   bursting tech bubble, the negative reaction and added uncertainty centering around corporate   accounting scandals, and increasing anxiety over the possibility of war with Iraq  These are just   some of the headwinds that our economy must fight through  Nonetheless, there are offsets to   the headwinds, not the least of which are accommodative monetary and fiscal policies  Low   interest rates are sustaining consumer spending on housing and durables, which is an essential   part of the outlook And some categories of investment spending are beginning to post increases    Overall economic growth this year is expected to average around 3 percent, although the risks   remain, as many have noted, weighted toward the downside     The question today is whether more stimulus is needed now or whether patience is a   virtue  My preference is to give the current accommodative policy more time to work  I don’t   want to rule out a rate cut in the future, but in my opinion at this point we don’t have sufficient   evidence for one Thank you, Mr Chairman   "
4736,2002-09-24," I support your recommendation  In my view the key issues are the   uncertainty and the inability to get traction in the recovery  I think we will get some clarification   on where the economy is, going forward  So I think the best thing to do is to wait and see  "
4792,2002-11-06," I’m close to where President Hoenig is  The Ginnie Maes make   sense to me, and I think we should continue to pursue how that might happen  And I believe it   would be useful to look at the ACF alternative in direct comparison with Ginnie Maes to see why   we would need the ACF if we had Ginnie Maes On the question of whether or not we need a   CACF as a contingency arrangement I think we should turn to Governor Ferguson and say, “Do   we have enough contingency arrangements?”  If his crisis management group wants to take the   CACF off the table because it’s no longer perceived as necessary, that’s fine   We should remember that, with the Treasury’s auctioning of TT&L balances, we actually   have had a lot more experience over the last fifteen months than we had before about how such a   system would work  In many respects the ACF could be viewed as that kind of structure  So,   my preference would be for the staff to continue with the Ginnie Maes, which are a logical   extension of our current practices, and to do a little more homework on the ACF  I’d have the   staff come back to the Committee and say, “Here are the costs and benefits of each of these, how         November 6, 2002 107 of 122  do you wish to proceed?” And in that sense my view comes closer to President Parry’s in terms   of looking at both of them for a while and then figuring out where we want to end up    I agree completely  I would urge you to make sure that the cost   issues are indeed on the table We may find out that the shadow price of our involvement in that   market is sufficiently high that we want to look at alternatives  Or we may want to conclude that   it’s not worth the money  I’m not suggesting you would do that, but if we have that sort of   information in front of us rather explicitly, it will give us a better sense of what is really   involved  "
4793,2002-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman I’ll report on developments in our   District, but my comments will be less colorful!  Conditions in the Third District have   deteriorated somewhat since our last meeting on September 24  Indicators suggest that the pause   we saw in the region’s manufacturing sector this summer has worsened  The general activity                  November 6, 2002 42 of 122  index in our business outlook survey moved from a slightly positive reading in September to a   significantly negative reading of minus 131 in October  This was only the second negative   recorded since that index began recovering at the beginning of the year     The indexes of shipments and new orders also turned negative, although the deterioration   was less severe and the results differed by sector  Durable goods producers generally reported   falling demand for their products, while nondurable goods producers, including food product   companies and apparel makers, reported some increases  Our respondents also told us that they   have reduced somewhat their production plans for the fourth quarter since their customers have   trimmed their own expectations   Retailers have also expressed concern that the fourth quarter will be weak  Sales of   general merchandise have been declining  The sales index of our Pennsylvania retail survey fell   again in the third quarter for the second consecutive quarterly decline  This diffusion index   indicates that almost 30 percent more of the surveyed firms reported lower sales compared with a   year ago than reported increased sales  Area retailers tell us that sales remained sluggish in   October as well Some attributed weak apparel sales to unseasonably warm weather, but the   softness was widespread across merchandise categories  Area auto dealers reported that sales   declined in both September and October despite the continued financing incentives on some   models Retailers noted that they are trimming spending on acquisition of new space,   renovation, and equipment And commercial real estate activity in general remains anemic     Labor market conditions in the District remain weak While the tri-state unemployment   rate is still below that of the nation, averaging 53 percent in the third quarter, employment in our   region fell slightly Our BLS respondents reported that they continued to cut manufacturing jobs   in October One hopeful sign comes from the recently completed Manpower employment               November 6, 2002 43 of 122  outlook survey, which indicates that employers in our three states do plan to add workers in the   fourth quarter Also, our contacts in employment agencies tell us that they expect healthier labor   markets in our area after the turn of the year  It remains to be seen whether that will indeed be   the case     Residential construction continues to be the region’s bright spot  Housing permits have   been rising since spring Real estate lending has continued to rise, and some banks indicate that   the pace of refinancings has accelerated   Turning to the national scene, I believe accumulated evidence suggests that the recovery   has either stalled or slowed considerably since our last meeting  It just has not developed any   traction Moreover, activity in certain sectors, manufacturing in particular, has declined  Over   the past six months, job growth has averaged only 36,000 per month, and the growth in the   services sector, which is generally slower during the early stages of recovery, has been even   weaker than average this time  Initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained at high   levels Investment is weak, and the orders and shipments data suggest weakness will continue in   the fourth quarter Inventories are low in many sectors, but firms are showing little inclination to   start rebuilding them    Enabled by accommodative monetary policy, consumers have buoyed the recovery  Low   interest rates have sustained consumer spending on housing and durables  Refinancings have put   money in consumers’ pockets, and research by the Philadelphia staff suggests that this   refinancing activity has had a significant impact on expenditures for consumer durables  In   addition, the increase in house prices has raised the value of collateral used to support home   equity lending, and that has enabled homeowners to bring forward some of their consumption    The consumer continues to be the essential part of the outlook  However, there is some danger               November 6, 2002 44 of 122  that, if refinancing or home-price appreciation slows, the strength of consumer spending will   subside Inflation remains subdued; even oil prices have declined in recent weeks  Moreover,   core inflation is forecast to decline over the next year or so, making the recovery more   vulnerable if there is a negative shock     The Committee can do little to bring investment on line more quickly  Uncertainty over   geopolitical issues will have to ebb and businesses will have to gain confidence in the recovery   before they begin to make the commitments implicit in renewed investment and hiring  The   question is whether the Committee can and should do anything to buoy the consumer in order to   sustain the recovery until investment begins showing real gains    One issue discussed at our last meeting was whether an easing of policy would   exacerbate imbalances in the economy—in particular in the housing market—that would have to   be worked out in the future  I myself shared that concern  But some recent work at our Bank   suggests that relatively moderate growth in household investment during the preceding   expansion leaves the potential for additional investment in that sector today, without fear of   growing imbalances As I’ve said at previous meetings, I have concerns about both trying to   fine-tune the economy and the possibility of overshooting  I’ve argued for patience, saying that   we should wait to see if the policy we had already applied was sufficient  But weak data have   continued to come in, and positive signs in some sectors have begun to reverse themselves  I’m   now losing patience [Laughter] Perhaps it’s time to consider another dose of policy medicine    Thank you  "
4794,2002-11-06," I support your recommendation  I see the two parts of the   recommendation as essentially and necessarily together  I’d feel a little less comfortable with the   notion of 50 basis points and the risks toward weakness because I think the market would   respond as several people have suggested The alternative of a slightly more positive touch with   25 basis points and a tilt toward weakness had some appeal to me, and I struggled with that    President McDonough suggested that favoring that would describe me as a wimp  I would prefer   to think of it as being relatively conservative and deliberate  [Laughter]    In any case, I think it clearly is necessary that we respond to the   economic forces as we see them  So I can indeed support the recommendation  "
4842,2002-12-10," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the short time since our last meeting   we’ve seen a slight improvement in a few indicators of economic activity in the Third District    But overall growth in our region remains languid  Last time I reported on some deterioration in   regional manufacturing activity  Over the past month we’ve seen a modest rebound  In October   the general activity index from our business outlook survey had dropped to minus 131  In   November the index returned to positive territory at plus 61, indicating a slight increase in   manufacturing activity in the region last month  The indexes on new orders and shipments also   returned to positive territory, consistent with the reports we received from our Beige Book   contacts   Capital spending plans improved in November compared with prior months  Our recent   surveys indicate that the number of manufacturers planning to increase capital spending has been   slowly expanding, while the number planning to reduce such expenditures has been slowly   contracting In November, one-third of our manufacturers said that they expected to increase   their budgeted capital expenditures in 2003 compared with 2002  However, most reported that   the bulk of that spending will come in the second half of 2003  Increases are planned for   noncomputer business equipment, while spending on computers and software is expected to   soften  Sufficient current capacity and slim profit margins were reported as the main factors   tending to limit business capital spending  Several of our contacts also cited lack of confidence   in the course of the current economic recovery and the possibility of a Middle East war as factors   contributing to the reluctance to make major spending commitments   Excluding autos, retail sales in our area have improved in recent weeks  Sales so far   during the holiday season appear to be in line with retailers’ modest expectations  Shoppers         December 10, 2002 33 of 87  continue to be cost conscious, and stores in the region have stepped up discounting in response    Merchants generally report that their inventories are at planned levels  Earlier some stores had   fallen behind in receiving merchandise as a result of the lockout of West Coast dock workers    But most of these stores are now fully stocked or nearly so  Despite their continuing efforts to   contain costs, many retailers report that they are hiring their usual complement of seasonal   employees   Economic conditions in other areas of the regional economy remain as they have been in   the last few months Labor markets continue to be weak  Payroll employment in our three-state   area fell in October—the latest month for which we have data—and the unemployment rate   edged back up Commercial real estate markets also remained weak  Office vacancy rates are   elevated And while quoted rents in the Philadelphia region have been steady in recent months,   effective rents have fallen as landlords have offered more concessions to renters  In contrast,   residential real estate markets are still strong  Residential construction contracts and permits rose   in October, and home sales remain at high levels  Residential real estate lending, both for   refinancing and purchasing homes, continues to be strong   Turning to the national economy, the few pieces of incoming data have been mixed    Equity prices have stabilized above their October lows, and credit conditions have improved    But uncertainty about geopolitical issues and the staying power of the recovery continues to   damp consumer and business confidence  Until some of this uncertainty is resolved, it is   doubtful that firms will make the commitments implicit in renewed investment and hiring  A   weaker-than-expected November employment report shows that firms are not yet ready to make   hiring commitments  This raises some questions about the staying power of the consumer         December 10, 2002 34 of 87  So far the data suggest that consumers continue to be cautious and price conscious in   their spending habits Holiday spending is meeting retailers’ modest expectations, but the pace   of spending has slowed from that seen earlier  Rapid productivity growth has contributed to   solid expansion in real incomes this year, which has supported increases in consumer spending    While I expect productivity growth to continue, I don’t expect it to remain at the rapid pace   we’ve had this year My comfort level about the outlook for consumer spending and the   projected acceleration in the pace of the recovery would rise were we to begin to see solid job   growth The Greenbook’s projected 100,000 per month increase in private payrolls in the first   half of next year would be welcome news indeed     Our easing move last time was an insurance policy in an economy buffeted by a number   of uncertainties In summary, I can end by saying that nothing I see suggests that it’s time to   cash in that policy or, for that matter, to take out a larger one  Thank you  "
4843,2002-12-10," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
4895,2003-03-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, growth in   economic activity in the Third District has faltered  At least part of this is due to uncertainty   over the timing, duration, and magnitude of the war, as many others have said  It’s likely that   when this uncertainty is resolved we’ll see stronger growth, but our survey evidence suggests   that economic activity might not necessarily rebound quickly after military action in Iraq    Manufacturing in our area has turned down over the last two months  The general activity index   of our business outlook survey fell from 23 in February to minus 8 in our March survey to be   released on Thursday  That is the lowest reading since December 2001  New orders also   declined in March, and shipments were flat   A special question in our February survey provides some evidence on how soon   economic activity might rebound after geopolitical uncertainty is resolved  We asked our survey   respondents to tell us whether their hiring and spending plans this year were adversely affected   by geopolitical uncertainty, weak demand, or something else  Respondents could choose more   than one factor  About 40 percent of respondents said that geopolitical uncertainties were   affecting their hiring and spending plans this year, but nearly 60 percent said that lack of demand   was having an effect  Of course, the cause of the lack of demand may well be geopolitical risks    It’s difficult to separate the two  Nonetheless, this seems to indicate concerns about the state of   the economy that may go beyond the effects of the current Gulf conflict  Firms in our survey did   not appear to be poised to resume spending upon the resolution of geopolitical uncertainty  Only   10 percent plan to begin hiring and 8 percent plan to resume investment as soon as uncertainty is   resolved  But over 40 percent plan to wait at least six months or have no plans to increase hiring   or capital spending upon resolution of uncertainty  Responses to the special question indicate   that, relative to their plans at the start of the year, about a third of the firms have delayed adding   March 18, 2003 43 of 101    workers to their payroll  Almost one-half of the firms have delayed increasing their capital   spending  These results are consistent with most forecasts, which expect growth to remain   subdued until the second half of the year   Activity in other sectors of the regional economy has also eased since our last meeting    Consumer spending has slowed; auto sales and retail sales of general merchandise declined in   February  The snowstorm undoubtedly had an impact on this  I wish the snow had gone to   Chicago, but that’s another story     Nevertheless, our retailers tell us that, even before the storm, sales   momentum was slowing  Store traffic has been down since January, and merchants generally   indicate that consumers are limiting discretionary purchases except for home-related goods    Commercial and residential construction activity has eased, although demand for homes has   continued strong  Quoted rates for commercial space have been fairly stable in recent months,   but effective rates have fallen  In addition, to attract tenants, landlords are now willing to lease   space for a shorter duration  While the outlook of those in the region’s business community   remains positive, no one is expecting a strong rebound  This is similar to the view expressed by   our business contacts at the last meeting  However, my sense is that the tone has turned more   negative  Perhaps this reflects merely the proximity of military action; perhaps it reflects the   realization that we haven’t seen much positive momentum and that certain sectors, in particular   manufacturing, have deteriorated     Similar to the District, the national economic recovery has been held back because of   concerns about geopolitical uncertainty and most recently because of bad weather  How large   the effect is of these special factors is difficult to determine  The data we’ve received since our   March 18, 2003 44 of 101    last meeting have been on the weak side  Even excluding the special factors of the snowstorm   and the call-up of reservists, the February employment report was much weaker than expected,   with sizable and widespread job losses  It is too soon to determine whether the increase in   capital spending orders we saw in January will portend the beginning of a period of stronger   economic growth  Given the continued level of excess capacity, it would be hard to conclude   that capital spending this year will be stronger than the moderate rate shown in the forecast    There are indications that the growth of consumer spending is beginning to slow  This might   reflect the events involving Iraq, but it also might reflect concerns over job prospects   At this point, it might be useful for us to recognize again the difference between risk and   uncertainty  With risk, as we know, one can assign probabilities to the list of outcomes and act   appropriately given the distribution  With uncertainty, it is difficult to assign probabilities to   outcomes  Moreover, it is difficult even to describe all the possible outcomes themselves    Generally firms and consumers have developed ways of handling risk  Uncertainty is much   harder to cope with  It tends to paralyze decisionmaking  Today we are operating in a world of   increased uncertainty  The result has been the postponement of many economic decisions—and   by extension the economic recovery  A short-lived and successful war in Iraq will resolve some   of the uncertainty—not all of it, though, since winning the peace will be much tougher than   winning the war and there are other problems, as we have noted around this table today  We   won’t have much new data on the real side, given the lags in the data  But we will have oil   prices and financial markets as indicators to look at, as well as anecdotal evidence we glean from   our business contacts  From these we should be able to tell relatively quickly whether a   resolution of geopolitical uncertainty will result in new vitality for our real economy or at least if   it was the main drag delaying the recovery   March 18, 2003 45 of 101    Thus, my reading of the data suggests that the economic recovery has slowed somewhat   since our last meeting  But until there’s some resolution of uncertainty, I believe there is little   reason to expect that a change in our already accommodative policy stance would have much   effect  It might not even be noticed in the present circumstances  Our future path should be   clearer once some of the uncertainties surrounding the nature of military action in Iraq are   resolved  At that point, the Committee may wish to act  We need not wait until our next   regularly scheduled meeting in May  But at this time, in my judgment, any action would be   premature  Thank you    "
4896,2003-03-18,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
4943,2003-05-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The news on economic activity in the   Third District has changed little since our mid-April conference call  The data suggest that our   May 6, 2003 30 of 115    region experienced a somewhat larger slowdown in growth in the first quarter than the nation   did  But since the end of hostilities in Iraq, I’ve sensed an improvement in tone from our   business contacts  The data show that economic activity in the Third District remains subdued    Our business outlook survey showed a further decline in regional manufacturing activity in   April  The index of general activity deteriorated to minus 88 in April from minus 80 in March,   and the indexes of new orders, shipments, and employment all fell as well  Respondents   attributed some of the decline in orders over the past two months to the start of the war in Iraq    Most of the firms, however, said that such war-related declines were slight or moderate   Regional labor markets also remain weak  The recent benchmarking of state employment   data shows that the decline in employment in our three-state area in 2002 was not as large as   originally reported  But there were declines nonetheless, and employment in the region has   continued to contract this year  Residential construction, which has been one of our stronger   sectors, has eased in recent months  The demand for office and commercial space continued to   be soft in the first quarter  Retail sales in the District in late March and early April were running   below year-ago levels in all lines of merchandise  And retailers attributed lower spring sales to a   combination of unseasonably cold weather, the timing of Easter, and the war in Iraq     But amid these reports of subdued activity, I’ve noticed some renewed optimism since   the end of the war  During April and May I typically travel the District, holding a series of   meetings with our bankers and business leaders  My exchanges with them over the past few   weeks reveal an improved outlook and higher confidence that the recovery will begin to develop   some traction in the second half of the year  They’re not expecting a strong rebound in activity   but a rebound nonetheless  Some of my contacts tell me that their firms are starting to undertake   May 6, 2003 31 of 115    major capital investments, feeling that they’ve sat on the sidelines long enough  This is a   definite change in mood since our March meeting and our mid-April conference call     My view on the national economy is similar  The hard data on the real sector have   generally been on the weak side  The initial estimate for first-quarter GDP was weaker than I   was expecting, and we continue to see job losses  But the softer information from anecdotal   reports and the developments in the financial markets have been positive  Equity prices and   corporate profits are up  Credit risk spreads and oil prices are down  In March we   acknowledged that it was difficult to discern how much of the economic weakness was due to   concerns about geopolitical uncertainty and how much was due to a weaker underlying economic   dynamic  We also acknowledged that a short-lived and successful war in Iraq would resolve   some of the uncertainty but that we wouldn’t have much data on the real side of the economy   soon after the war ended, given the lags in the receipt of those data  We pointed to data on oil   prices, financial market indicators, and anecdotal evidence as the initial pieces of information we   could look to as a way to assess postwar economic conditions   Indeed, that is the situation in which we find ourselves today  Most of our real sector   data are dated, so they continue to reflect the influences of the war and therefore are less helpful   in discerning economic conditions going forward  The data from financial markets and on   consumer confidence, which do reflect postwar conditions, have been quite favorable    Accordingly, I have little to say about the Greenbook and its attendant forecast  The baseline   forecast seems right, and the alternative forecasts were helpful to see the sensitivity of the   results  However, given that forecasting generally depends somewhat on retrospection, I don’t   receive the usual comfort from the staff’s effort this time around  That’s not a criticism of the   effort but rather a manifestation of the time period we are in     May 6, 2003 32 of 115    That said, I would like to react to the deflation exercise in the Greenbook  The   simulation exercise implies that the probability of deflation by the end of 2004 is about 35   percent  I might quibble with the Board staff’s definition of deflation; ½ of 1 percent may seem   reasonable, but recent academic work suggests that the bias in price indexes is declining  More   to the point, however, I think our concern about deflation is a concern that the economy may   exhibit behavior associated with deflation psychology, which includes an expectation of   continued price declines  I’m not sure that a four-quarter 50 basis point benchmark captures this   very well  Further, I question how sensitive the staff’s estimate is to using a random selection of   shocks from 1970 to 2000—a time period that includes the 1970s, a decade characterized by both   volatility and a higher level of inflation  I wonder what the impact would be of using a sample   period over which the economy was less volatile and the average rate of inflation was lower—  starting, say, in 1980  My questions regarding definitions and time periods are in part a reaction   to the results of this exercise  The results, in short, are troubling  A 35 percent probability is not   trivial     Nonetheless, given the current accommodative stance of monetary policy and the   prospects of more accommodative fiscal policy, it appears wise to wait to see what additional   data tell us about postwar conditions before deciding how to respond to the slowness of growth   exhibited in the data  If the sluggishness continues in the period after the war, then a reduction in   rates may be in order  In the meantime, I think we should remain alert to new information and   evidence of changes in either direction in the real economy  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
4944,2003-05-06,"  I concur with your decision and support it  I like the idea of   splitting up the two sentences  If I were a wordsmith, I’d argue that the “taken together”   sentence doesn’t need to be there  Let the markets put it together and just indicate what we   believe the conditions are that relate to sustainable growth and inflation  If we put the two   together, in some sense we are trying to summarize our view of the risks, and we’re giving code   words to the market  So my preference is to eliminate that sentence, but I can go either way  "
4998,2003-08-12,  It also gives us more flexibility and time  
4999,2003-08-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Third   District have improved slightly since our last meeting, and our District appears to be faring   somewhat better than the nation  Regional manufacturing has been firming  In July our   Business Outlook Survey index of general activity advanced further into positive territory to   83 percent, up from 4 percent in June  The indices of new orders and shipments improved   significantly in July, showing strong positives for the first time in several months  However, it’s   important to note that these increases were not widespread among the firms in the manufacturing   August 12, 2003 32 of 110    sectors represented in the survey  Rather they were concentrated in firms that make products   used in residential construction—not surprising, given the strength in the housing market     In a special question, we asked our respondents to give us more-detailed information on   when they think their sales will increase and by how much  The majority of our firms are   expecting sales to rise over the next four quarters, with most predicting gains in the 1 percent to   4 percent range  Over half of our respondents expect sales to improve as soon as this quarter,   and the percentage goes up over time  To accommodate the expected increase in sales, our firms   report that they will need to start adding staff before they need to expand capacity  But many   believe that they can wait a while before doing either  One-fourth of the firms expecting sales   growth will begin hiring workers this quarter, but almost 30 percent will wait until sometime in   the second half of next year  In addition, half of the firms say that they will not need to increase   capacity until the second half of next year  These responses are consistent with forecasts that   suggest the pickup in overall activity will be a gradual one   Our labor markets continue to improve slowly and appear to be doing marginally better   than those in the rest of the nation  Payroll employment in our three states increased in June for   the fourth consecutive month  I don’t want to overstate the strength; the increases have not been   large, and employment levels are back only to where they were at the beginning of the recession    Still, the direction is positive  Although the three-state unemployment rate rose in June to   57 percent, it remains below its recession high set last winter, and it is below that of the nation   There has been a modest increase in retail sales since our last meeting  Sales of general   merchandise rose in July compared with June  Nevertheless, the cool weather through much of   the spring has left stores with excess inventories of summer goods  Discounting has been fairly   widespread as retailers attempt to clear the way for fall merchandise  Retailers continue to   August 12, 2003 33 of 110    describe consumers as worried about job security and cautious in their spending  And retail   firms do not expect the recently enacted tax cuts to provide much of a boost to sales  Auto sales   remained steady in July, but cautious dealers have brought inventories more in line with desired   levels than they have been in the last couple of months  The residential real estate sector is still   strong but not as strong as a year ago  Some banks in our region have seen a slowdown in   mortgage applications  Commercial real estate markets remain soft, with little change in recent   months  In sum, I would characterize the tone as cautiously optimistic  The outlook of the   region’s business community remains positive, with most of our contacts expecting steady or   slowly improving conditions   Turning to the national economy, we have seen an improvement in economic conditions   since our last meeting, but the second quarter’s 24 percent increase in GDP overstates that   improvement  The surge in defense purchases last quarter is unsustainable  Even with that,   growth was still a percentage point lower than potential and not strong enough to generate job   growth  Labor markets continue to disappoint  While initial claims have dipped below 400,000   per week, they remain high enough to suggest that net job destruction is continuing   There are some positives, however  Business fixed investment rebounded in the second   quarter, and the data on new orders for nondefense capital equipment suggest that business   investment in equipment, particularly computers, is likely to continue to strengthen  Growth in   consumer spending picked up in the second quarter, although much of that was driven by   incentives on autos  Auto inventories are now sufficiently lean that manufacturers probably will   increase production in the third quarter even if sales decline somewhat in August and September    Manufacturing is stable to up slightly, although the recent rise in oil prices, if sustained, may   damp activity  The tax cut is now showing up as reduced withholding and higher take-home pay,   August 12, 2003 34 of 110    which should help stimulate the economy  Monetary policy is very accommodative, and the real   fed funds rate has fallen since our last meeting     Although we’re not there yet, the economy is poised for stronger growth in the second   half of the year  Financial market indicators also point to such a resurgence  Indeed, bond   market participants have built in a fairly sharp rebound in economic activity, as was pointed out   this morning  I think they’re overly optimistic  In fact, I have some concern that the recent rise   in long rates will retard the incipient strengthening we are seeing  But I suspect that long bond   yields will ease off a bit as traders begin to realize that we will need to maintain a low fed funds   rate for longer than they now expect  We may want to emphasize our resolve in today’s   statement  Thus, I would want to see more signs of a rebound, particularly job growth instead of   continued job declines  Given the positive signs we do see, today I think we are about where we   need to be on monetary policy   Before closing I will note that concerns about deflation and the risks of hitting the zero   bound have diminished somewhat since our last meeting  However, I’m not sure that our public   statements have helped illuminate the situation very much  We are trying to walk a very thin line   here  On one hand, we want to convince markets that we are poised to do whatever it takes to   keep the economy from slipping into deflation; on the other hand, we don’t want to suggest that   such a scenario is a probable one  I’m gratified that we will be discussing our communications   strategy sooner rather than later, as I think it can only become more important as the recovery   progresses  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5000,2003-08-12,"  I support your recommendation for no change in the fed funds rate   and no change in the three-part statement  I think it’s the right thing to do and anything else   could confuse the markets  I have some sympathy with the notion that we don’t want to be too   explicit about where we’re going if we don’t know exactly  So I agree that we ought to be   cautious, along the lines of Bill Poole’s argument about not promising too much, because we   know we may not be able to deliver    "
5025,2003-09-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was about to offer a comment several   hours ago before Mr Parry spoke, but I’m rather glad that I didn’t because at that point I would   have said that Vincent had laid out an impossible task for us  As far as I could tell, he was   asking us to figure out what we should communicate, how we should fashion what we   communicate, and how we should change our current communications  I figured that would take   if not days at least hours more than we had  However, we seem to have come fairly close to a   convergence on a number of interesting and I think valuable points  So let me just throw in my   views on some of them   First of all, I think the Parry contribution was to say let’s try to get it simple and   standardized and let’s make it work  I think that’s the right approach  We can move away from   the term “boilerplate” or even the term “standard,” and we’ll still have a problem explaining   exactly what we mean by the words we use because I think we all attach subtle nuances to them    I don’t think we can make our statements all that clear because we need to allow for unexpected   events as we go forward  In terms of our assessment, I think we should keep it simple  But I,   too, have a problem with the balance statement  On each of the individual elements I think we   need some wordsmithing  I’m not sure that the words we’re using are exactly right, whether   we’re talking about sustainable growth or price stability  But in my view, making an assessment   on the balance of the two risks involves trying to add up things that are virtually impossible to   add up  The most it does is to tell people that, on net, here’s what we want to do and not really   September 15, 2003 65 of 78    how the risks are balanced or add up  So I think that part of the statement needs some work   going forward   In terms of whether or not we need to change the word “risk” to “odds” or any such   thing, our thesaurus works on our Word Perfect programs  If we change it to “odds,” we’ll put   “odds,” we’ll circle it, and we’ll say that it’s Fed-speak for risks  So I think we just have to   recognize that this recent experience involved an unusual circumstance, notably an environment   in which a lot was changing  People were unclear about what we were saying in part because of   the dynamic changes in the markets at the time we were trying to say it     I would be quite cautious about how to deal with the minutes and moving up their   release  In my view there are questions about whether we want a four-week blackout period   because we’re waiting for the minutes to come out or whether we should be working on the   minutes in real time  These are tricky issues, and I think we have to be cautious about moving in   any direction there   We got into the middle of a fourth subject, inflation targeting, which wasn’t even on my   list  I’d be more than happy to talk about that, but nearly everyone wants to see the Dallas   Cowboys get beat up!  So I’m going to forgo comments on that for the moment and say that I   think we have come a very long way toward a convergence of views on these issues  To me the   comments thus far suggest that we need to take some subtle steps but not make massive changes    That gets us to something like option number 4 to 4½, and I think that’s a reasonable place to be  "
5077,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Third   District have improved slightly in the five weeks since our last meeting  Regional manufacturing   output continues to firm  In August our business outlook survey index of general activity   advanced sharply to 221 percent, up from 83 percent in June  In our September survey, which   is confidential until Thursday, the index will post its fourth consecutive positive reading, at   146 percent—down somewhat from August but still clearly in positive territory  The indexes of   new orders and shipments have improved over the past three months, showing strong positives    Manufacturing employment, on the other hand, has not yet shown an increase  In response to a   special question, 30 percent of the firms reported that they have revised up their plans for fourth-  quarter production over the past several months, whereas only 10 percent have revised down   their plans  Of those firms expecting to increase production in the fourth quarter, most expect a   5 to 10 percent rise     September 16, 2003 37 of 106    After improving in the second quarter, our labor market showed a slight weakening at the   start of the current quarter  Payroll employment in our three states declined slightly in July, and   the unemployment rate edged up to 58 percent, but it remains below the national average  Retail   sales in our region have improved modestly in recent months  Sales of general merchandise rose   in August compared with July  Some merchants indicate that they’ve seen a pickup in sales due   to the first round of the federal income tax rebate checks  So I found the discussion we had just a   moment ago interesting  But others say that consumers continue to be cautious in their spending    Although retailers expect the pace of sales to improve in the autumn, they have noted the   tendency for consumers to delay purchasing a product until they feel they really need it  As a   result, retailers plan to introduce cold weather merchandise later than usual this year and to keep   inventories limited   Although the residential real estate sector in our region is not as strong as a year ago, it   continues to perform well, with construction up somewhat from the first quarter  Real estate   agents and builders indicate that sales of new and existing homes accelerated because of the   recent upturn in mortgage rates  That goes back to what President Guynn was saying—that   homebuyers apparently are trying to make purchases before rates advance even further  Builders   report that they expect sales to remain strong, although some indicate that the backlog appears to   have peaked  In contrast, commercial real estate continues to be soft, and office vacancy rates   remain elevated  However, we’ve seen some pickup in the value of nonresidential construction   contracts in our region in recent months     In summary, the economic outlook for the District is positive, and the region’s business   community remains optimistic that conditions will continue to improve  However, the rate of   expansion is expected to be modest   September 16, 2003 38 of 106    Economic conditions in the nation have generally improved as well since our August   meeting, as several others have mentioned here today  The recently released data lend credence   to the staff forecast that a substantial increase in the pace of economic activity is under way  The   data indicate that manufacturing output is firming, and the orders data suggest that business   investment in equipment and software, after growing in the second quarter, is likely to strengthen   further  Yesterday’s industrial production report showed that factory output continued to rise at   least marginally  At the same time, corporate profits are up, which should buoy business   spending  Growth in consumer spending picked up in the second quarter, and that strength   appears to have carried into the current quarter  However, we must keep in mind that some of   the acceleration may prove to be temporary, so I found the discussion about the tax rebate checks   and how they work their way through the system particularly relevant   The improvement in the data has led many forecasters, including the Board staff, to   revise up their projections for the second half of the year  For the moment, the possibility of   substantial deflation appears to have subsided, at least in my opinion  Still, most forecasters do   not expect economic growth to become strong enough to generate robust job growth until next   year  In fact, the labor market remains the economy’s biggest trouble spot  Payrolls continue to   shrink, and new claims for unemployment insurance remain near 400,000, which points to   further employment cuts at least in the near term  Moreover, the rate of job loss is not slowing    Instead, firms cut payrolls at a faster pace in July and August than they did in the second quarter,   and the loss in August was relatively widespread across sectors     I generally agree with the Greenbook forecast that the weakness in the labor market will   continue through the end of the year  However, the Board staff projects a strong rebound next   year, with payrolls rising by over 250,000 per month in the first quarter and by 400,000 per   September 16, 2003 39 of 106    month in the fourth quarter  I think that may be optimistic  Nonetheless, I share the view of   most forecasters that economic growth will strengthen over the next several quarters  Recent   data support that projection  Financial market indicators point to such a resurgence  In fact,   markets are now expecting policy to tighten sooner, as President Poole indicated, than is   incorporated in the Greenbook forecast  They may be right  Nonetheless, at this point I believe   that monetary policy can and should remain accommodative for a substantial period of time    That said, we have to be careful once again about how we couch today’s decision in our press   release  This obviously harkens back to yesterday’s discussion and what Vincent Reinhart   referred to as the communications channel  I look forward to seeing the proposed wording of the   press statement later in the meeting  Thank you  "
5078,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your fed funds target and the   balance of risks—the risk assessments, if you will—as stated  Frankly, if I had my druthers I   would wait one more meeting before I would change anything in the wording about policy   accommodation being maintained for a considerable period of time  I’d come back next time   and change that sentence  At the moment we’re seeing signs of growth and some positive   developments in the economy  I agree that eventually we’re going to have to change these words   and start to exit from this strategy of describing our policy expectations for a “considerable   period”  I just think that “eventually” should be next time  "
5137,2003-10-28,"  I, too, was struggling with the staff’s inflation forecast and had   noticed what Cathy Minehan talked about in connection with the Greenbook relative to other   forecasts  It started me thinking about what I’ll call the integrity of our forecasting processes in a   changing environment  We know our model has long adjustment and distributed lags to policy,   and we’re estimating the relevant variables over a period of time when we haven’t had as   stimulative a monetary policy as we have now  I wonder whether or not others are adjusting   their forecasts to react to that and whether our inability, or our unwillingness, to do so is leading   us to a result that looks the way it does, as we’ve discussed at this table  In essence, I’m a little   concerned that this may involve a regime change in the Lucas sense and each of the forecasting   October 28, 2003 28 of 126    models is trying to play with how to adjust to the data in their forecasts  Can you give me any   comfort that these long lags are appropriately adjusted?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Most signs of economic recovery in   the Third District have strengthened over the intermeeting period, unlike some of the reports   we’ve heard from my neighboring Districts  The exception is the labor market indicators, which   have not shown any improvement  The job market in our region has fared better than in the   nation as a whole  Stronger job growth in education and health services and in the leisure and   hospitality industry in our District’s states compared with the growth in these sectors in the rest   of the nation contributed to the region’s better job performance  That said, District labor markets   still are characterized as weak  Pennsylvania and Delaware payrolls remain below their levels at   the end of the recession  Only New Jersey has seen job growth, as First Vice President Stewart   indicated in his coverage of the northern Jersey employment numbers    We have received better news from the manufacturing and retail sectors  We have solid   evidence of a recovery in manufacturing, although structural change has continued to limit the   strength in that sector  Several indicators in our business outlook survey show strong   improvement this month  The index of general activity advanced sharply to plus 28 percent, its   highest reading since 1996 and the fifth consecutive positive reading  The indexes of new orders   and shipments also advanced and are at their highest levels since mid-1999  Even the   employment index turned slightly positive this month  However, most firms surveyed are not   back to their pre-recession levels of production  Nearly three-quarters said they experienced   October 28, 2003 55 of 126    production declines during the recession, and less than one-fifth of these firms expect to be back   to pre-recession levels in the first quarter of 2004  More than one-third said they expected not to   return to those levels in the foreseeable future, which by that survey question meant the end of   2004  Most respondents cited as reasons long-term declines in their industry and loss of market   share to competitors both here and abroad  These numbers might help us to quantify the degree   to which the current weakness in manufacturing is due to structural as opposed to cyclical   factors     Retail sales in our region continue to improve modestly  September sales were up from   August even though some easing in the rate of sales increase was expected because of income   tax rebates and a good back-to-school season that boosted August sales  Our retailers have   revised upward their fourth-quarter sales forecasts  Respondents to our south Jersey business   survey, 85 percent of whom are in nonmanufacturing areas, reported an increase in equipment   spending in the third quarter and plans for even stronger spending six months from now  And   residential investment in the District remains high despite increasing mortgage interest rates  So,   overall the recovery continues to build momentum in the Third District, and business contacts in   our region, including those on our board of directors, are expressing more optimism than I’ve   heard for a while   Economic conditions in the nation have improved since our last meeting as well  Growth   in the third quarter was very strong, but firms raised productivity and thus continued to shed   workers  I agree with the Greenbook that demand will continue to grow at a solid pace in the   current quarter, although somewhat slower than last quarter, and that we’ll finally begin to see   payroll job growth  Conditions are supportive of continued strengthening next year  Equipment   and software spending is expanding at a good pace  The stronger data for orders and shipments   October 28, 2003 56 of 126    coupled with robust growth in corporate profits should help boost business investment going   forward  I would welcome a period of strong growth since a significant amount of economic   slack in labor and product markets still remains, as others have indicated, and core inflation   continues to be subdued  Nonetheless, I believe that the risk of pernicious disinflation has   subsided somewhat     I agree with the Greenbook that inflationary forces are likely to be muted over the near   term  But I believe that we will have to begin to take some of the monetary accommodation   back to help ensure that we don’t get any inflation—and probably earlier than mid-2005 as the   Greenbook assumes  Accordingly, given the strengthening of the underlying economy and the   forecast of continued improvement over the next several quarters, I think we should begin to   shorten the expected time frame of ongoing accommodation  But this brings me quite close to   the next topic, which is our communication policy  So I’ll end my comments here before I go   too far into that agenda item  Thank you  "
5138,2003-10-28,"  In regard to President Parry’s comment, perhaps the problem here   is that we’re trying to combine two different issues regarding inflation in this chart—namely, the   probability of inflation moving up or down as currently forecast and a qualitative evaluation of   October 28, 2003 77 of 126    that  Maybe we should separate the two—define the risk of inflation falling, say, which the   Committee might then describe as desirable or undesirable depending upon the circumstances    What I’m struck by is the asymmetry reflected in this box  We have value judgments associated   with the columns but no value judgments associated with the rows  It’s not clear why we’d   necessarily want to start off by having value judgments associated asymmetrically     Essentially I’m agreeing with that approach, given the difficulty of   communicating the alternative, which blends the two together     I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  One thing I   will say is that this exercise has convinced me that trying to write down every single contingent   response in a group of nineteen people is extraordinarily challenging  These memos and various   options may be worth reading but not necessarily worth doing    "
5201,2003-12-09,"  It’s a little hard to pick up from the introductory discussion last   time, but let me just respond to what I’m seeing before me  I think the idea of projecting out two   years and continuously forecasting the outlook two years ahead is going to do more harm to our   credibility than aid in clarifying our announcements  So I must admit that I don’t see the use of   these types of statements as likely to be a sustainable scenario  That would be one response   December 9, 2003 112 of 133    Second, the question of how much we want to cover in the announcement, which is   essentially the issue that President Minehan is suggesting that we think about, is worth   addressing directly  If these options are A, B, and C, then option D ought to be an alternative to   pare back the statement  Maybe the best way to get at some of these questions is to have people   give you input in writing on what you’ve shown us today, so that you can determine a way to   respond  If in fact everybody says that “C” is the way to go, that’s fine  If everybody says “D”   is the way to go, that will help the Committee as group figure out what we should do  I think we   still have a lot of open questions here   The third point I’d make relates to the question of time  As the Chairman noted, it’s   approaching 200 pm now  These are critical decisions, and the question of the time we need to   discuss them is becoming an issue  The Committee may want to think about that—whether we   want to move the announcement to 400 pm or start our meetings at 800 am  We ought to at   least address the timing issue, so that we have an opportunity to talk about these matters in a way   that will be constructive  "
5202,2003-12-09,"  This is interesting, but I want to switch gears a bit and ask a   question about the real net export dynamics in our forecast, if I could  The depreciation of the   dollar has improved the outlook for real net exports in a lot of private-sector forecasts, but hasn’t   done so in the Greenbook  What are the reasons for that difference?  Does this imply that we   may be find ourselves with greater depreciation later on down the road?  Could you just   comment on how you view this and why you think it looks so different to the private sector?     That is what forecasters in the private sector have  I was curious   about how it worked and why that difference exists   December 9, 2003 32 of 133      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Third   District continue to improve, and business sentiment has turned more positive  Manufacturing   activity in the region is expanding, and forward-looking signs are positive  The index of general   economic activity in November from our business outlook survey was plus 26, down slightly   from the October reading of plus 28  The forward-looking indicators from the survey suggest   that production activity should continue to strengthen  Although the indexes of new orders and   December 9, 2003 55 of 133    shipments were a bit lower in November than they were in October, they are still at the highest   levels we’ve seen since 1999  Firms that make electrical machinery, instruments, and metal   products were more positive, while firms making lumber products, plastics, and transportation   were among the more negative  That itself I think is rather interesting  Another positive sign is   that more firms are telling us that they plan to increase capital spending in the next six months   than were saying that earlier this year  And positive capital spending plans are more widespread   across sectors than we’ve seen in quite some time     Special questions in our November survey addressed one of the long-term trends   affecting manufacturing and a topic that came up here earlier—namely, outsourcing and foreign   competition  Not surprisingly we found that many local firms are being affected by   globalization  More than half of the respondents reported that they had lost domestic customers   to foreign competitors in the last three years  One-fifth of the respondents indicated that they   had outsourced production for support activities to foreign countries  About 40 percent reported   that they have increased purchases of imports from foreign sources in the past three years  Two-  thirds said that their foreign outsourcing activity had risen in the past three years as well  This   phenomenon is likely to continue to affect the manufacturing industry in the long run both in our   District and in the nation as a whole   Retailers reported that sales picked up fairly well in November from a weak number in   October  They attributed the weakness in October to unseasonably warm weather, which   discouraged sales of winter merchandise  I think this week will solve that problem!  [Laughter]    Auto dealers reported a rebound in sales in November, and manufacturers increased incentives    Our retailers expect holiday sales to be stronger this year than last, but their forecast for sales   growth is in the 3 to 4 percent range, somewhat weaker than the national number   December 9, 2003 56 of 133    In a new development, business lending in the Third District is beginning to pick up  We   have heard this from a number of sources and institutions of various sizes  The increase is in   middle market companies across a wide range of industries, and firms are beginning to   implement expansion plans or purchase capital equipment for replacement needs  Construction   activity maintains the pattern it has shown since the recovery started  Residential construction   and home sales continue to show strength, while the commercial real estate market remains soft    The job market in our region continues to outperform that of the nation as a whole  Payroll   employment in the three states in our District edged up in October after being flat in the third   quarter  The tri-state unemployment rate stands at 55 percent compared with 59 percent in the   nation  So the recovery continues to build momentum in our District  This improvement is   being reflected in a more positive mood and sentiment among our business contacts  I would   describe them as seeing the glass half full now rather than half empty, which was the case a year   earlier  They are now more willing to believe the forecast that economic activity will continue to   strengthen next year   Turning to the national scene, economic conditions have also improved since our last   meeting  Third-quarter growth was even stronger than the initial report indicated, and fourth-  quarter growth ought to be quite acceptable, though not up to the third-quarter figure  Although   significant slack remains in both product and labor markets, businesses have increased capital   spending and have started to hire workers  Both business and consumer sentiment have   improved  The improvement in fundamentals implies that the economy will expand at a robust   rate through next year     I welcome this period of strong growth  Core inflation remains subdued, and more-rapid   growth will help reduce economic slack, putting more people to work  A year from now, when   December 9, 2003 57 of 133    we look back, I expect we will see the autumn as the inflection point in the recovery, the point at   which it became self-sustaining   I agree with the Greenbook that inflationary forces are likely to be muted over the   forecast period  But I also believe, as others have indicated, that the risk of disinflation is   subsiding substantially at this point  Although the level of inflation may be somewhat lower than   my target, the current and forecasted output growth rates make it much less likely that low   inflation will create the kind of zero-bound problem we have been concerned about  In fact, I   believe the risk of inflation moving upward over the medium term is now about balanced with   the risk of it moving downward, a sentiment I’ve heard rather frequently around this room   recently—as a matter of fact over the last twenty minutes  [Laughter]  The recent and forecasted   future depreciation of the dollar, higher oil prices, and continued growth in raw materials, not to   mention higher benefits costs, will all put upward pressure on prices going forward  Obviously,   now is not the time to change interest rates  But it is the time to be particularly watchful and   prepared to counter any substantial negative change in inflation or inflation dynamics as well as   rising inflationary expectations  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5203,2003-12-09,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  When I entered   the room, the questions in my mind were how to deal with these risk-balance statements and how   to deal with the “considerable period” sentence  I wondered whether or not the group would be   willing to take steps to address both of those issues in one meeting  I think the balance of risks is   correctly done in your recommended approach  I share Governor Gramlich’s view regarding the   summation of the balance of risks; I was never quite comfortable with it  So I view dropping   that statement actually as an extra positive  Taking this in a two-step process—recognizing that   we don’t really have to move and that we don’t expect to have to move very quickly—suggests   that the “considerable period” sentence is probably still a factual statement  In that case, it seems   to me that this is the appropriate way of getting the markets and the economy ready for the next   step  So I can support your recommendation  I think it’s the right way to go  "
5250,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been little change in the   economic outlook for the Third District since our last meeting  The Philadelphia staff’s leading   indexes of economic activity are signaling a pickup in growth in all three of our states over the   next three quarters  Current conditions show continued improvement in activity in most sectors   since our last meeting  Retail sales continue to rise at a moderate pace in the District, but some   of the improvement in February compared with a year ago reflects the damping effects of last   year’s Presidents’ Day weekend snowstorm   Residential construction activity remains at a fairly high level, although there has been   somewhat of a pullback in the first few months of the year, which may be weather related    Commercial construction remains hampered by high vacancy rates in the office market, but this   is not a new development  Manufacturing activity in the region continues to expand    The index of general activity in our March business outlook survey, which remains   confidential until this Thursday, will show a reading of 242 percent, down from February’s   314 percent but nonetheless indicating continued expansion The more forward-looking indexes   of new orders and shipments have trended down since the post-recession highs of December, but   March 16, 2004 42 of 107    they remain at higher levels than during the first 1½ years of the recovery  While the   manufacturing sector continues to expand, it is not yet creating jobs—despite the fact that the   survey’s employment index has reached levels that typically signal job growth in the   manufacturing sector   We explored labor market issues in a special question of our survey this month  Nearly   three-quarters of the firms said that they had job openings in the last three months, and three-  quarters said that they expected job openings over the next six months  Some of this reflects   turnover, as about 40 percent indicated that they expect a net increase in jobs over the next half-  year  Nearly two-thirds of the firms with openings reported that they’ve had difficulties filling   these positions, and most said it was because of a lack of qualified applicants  This is a theme   that came up in a couple of places  Obviously, there’s an interaction between wage offers and   labor supply, but less than 20 percent of the firms told us they had trouble hiring because   applicants were asking for too much money, and less than 15 percent reported that the applicant   had another opportunity  These results are consistent with the view that at least some of the   weakness in the labor market reflects a structural change, a skill mismatch if you will, in the   midst of productivity increases and technological advances   The labor market remains the weak spot not only in manufacturing but for the District   economy as a whole  The recent re-benchmarking of the payroll data has resulted in a downward   shift in job levels in Pennsylvania and New Jersey  Instead of showing an increase in jobs since   the start of the recovery, New Jersey now shows no change, and Pennsylvania shows a sharp   decline of 1½ percent  I say “sharp decline” because that was before I heard the decline in   Massachusetts, which was actually rather startling  Delaware has fared better  There was a   substantial upward revision of job levels in Delaware, but still we have seen no job growth in   March 16, 2004 43 of 107    that state since the recovery began  Overall, before the revisions, reported job growth since the   start of the recovery had been slightly better in our three states than in the nation  But the new   data release reverses the ranking, mostly as a result of job losses in the western part of   Pennsylvania and in northern New Jersey  At least I can still take comfort in the fact that we   have not lagged the nation as we did in the 1991-92 recovery  I think that’s one of the reasons   that my contacts in the Third District are positive and optimistic about the recovery this time   Turning to the nation, my overall assessment of economic conditions and the outlook for   the national economy has not changed much from our last meeting  Activity continues to expand   at a strong pace, although employment remains soft  Business investment has strengthened,   supported by strong profit growth  Consumer spending continues to expand at a moderate pace    Thus, the recovery is achieving more structural balance, which puts it on a more sustainable   footing  Core inflation remains quiet in spite of commodity price increases    The missing piece is employment growth, as many have said, but it’s difficult to see how   it can remain missing for much longer, given the pace of GDP growth  Productivity simply   cannot continue to grow at the extremely rapid rate we have been seeing  My sense is that as   output continues to expand, productivity growth will decline and employment growth will pick   up to a moderate pace this year  This is similar to the current Greenbook forecast, which revised   downward the pace of employment increases from the January forecast  As is true for everyone   here, I’ve been quite interested in gaining more insight into the labor market situation  To that   end I spoke to a large payroll processor with a significant presence in our District  The company   processes 16 to 17 percent of all paychecks in the United States and has as clients a range of   different-sized firms  Their data on the number of pays processed show that small firms, defined   as having 50 or fewer employees, have been adding workers over the last six months while large   March 16, 2004 44 of 107    firms with over a thousand employees per firm have continued to cut workers  Payrolls at mid-  sized firms have been about flat  The company’s data also indicate that wage growth has picked   up in the last couple of months and that the amount of overtime pay has been rising  In the past,   this pattern of employment and income growth has been an early indicator of a future rise in   employment  Certainly, there’s some risk that it might not come to pass, but these are hopeful   signs and a new data set to look at     Even in the wake of the weak employment data, in my view the downside risks to the   outlook are considerably smaller than was the case a year ago  And I continue to view the risks   to output growth as balanced  In fact, if we had better employment numbers, I would be more   concerned about the risks on the upside  Given the current state of the economy and the outlook,   I see no reason to change our current policy stance  But I’d encourage us to continue discussing   the conditions that would cause us to adjust policy and the steps we need to take now to ensure   that we have maximum flexibility to respond to changing events  "
5251,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have just a couple of points  First, I   can support your recommendation, although I had a marginal preference for the wording “about   equals”  I think “about equals” is shaded somewhat to the left of “appears almost equal”  That is   to say, we have lots of words in the English language, and “about equals” is an epsilon to the   right of “almost equals”  My guess is that we could come up with another word if we wanted to    March 16, 2004 81 of 107    We could do this ad infinitum on a scale between “really equal” and “sort of equal”  [Laughter]    So my preference on the wording is not a strong one   Let me take this opportunity, however, to make a comment about the Bluebook  One of   the changes this time in the structure of the Bluebook was the elimination of the three options on   changes in the funds rate  I think that made absolute sense, given where we are, but I also   believe it could cause us a problem down the road  Other things being equal, I would prefer to   have the three options presented, and we can dismiss them if we don’t find them relevant  I say   that because I can see a world sometime in the future, perhaps with a different Chairman, where   there’s a minority view for either increasing or decreasing rates and the opportunity to support   such a move is made difficult if it’s not in the Bluebook  This is not to take away from the   obvious decision we’re making this time  But as a general matter, I think that it makes some   sense to leave that structure in the Bluebook and spend the extra page on it  "
5301,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Third District   continues to increase, although there’s still little evidence of job growth  In addition, the   Philadelphia staff’s leading indexes of economic activity continue to signal a pickup in growth in all   three of our states over the next three quarters    Retail sales in our region were up in March and April  Some store executives reported that   the size of the average purchase had increased and also that sales of luxury items had risen    Retailers that generally described inventories as appropriate given the current sales pace have   revised up slightly their forecasts for expected sales this spring  Auto dealers in our region reported   rising sales in March compared with February, but the levels have not matched those of a year ago    They expect sales to remain at about the current pace for the rest of the year, acknowledging that it   will be difficult to achieve the high levels of the past several years     Residential construction activity remains high, although it has eased in recent months    Permits in the tri-state area were flat in the first quarter, and the value of residential construction   contracts was down modestly, but sales remained robust  Our contact at one large firm—a luxury   homebuilder that is headquartered in our region but has operations throughout the United States—   described sales as spectacular, better than at any time in thirty-five years  He has a twelve-month   backlog and is raising prices on an ad hoc basis from one area to the next at a rate of about 1 to   3 percent per week  On the other hand, commercial construction remains hampered by high   vacancy rates in our office market  According to a recent study, the center city Philadelphia area is   May 4, 2004 37 of 112       currently oversupplied by 45 percent of current stock or approximately 17 million square feet,   which is equivalent to about two large office towers  Nonetheless, construction has started on the   first new tower in the center city since 1991  While 65 percent of that building is already leased,   about 50 percent is leased to firms that would be vacating other center city buildings to take   advantage of generous tax incentives offered on the new space     Manufacturing activity in the region continues to expand  Our business outlook survey   (BOS) index of general activity increased to 325 percent in April, up from 242 percent in March    The index has been in positive territory for the last eleven months  The more forward-looking   indexes on new orders and shipments improved in April and are at levels we haven’t seen since the   early 1990s  There was also a noticeable increase in the inventory index in April, as it moved to its   highest reading in sixteen months  The employment index from our manufacturing survey   improved again in April and has been in positive territory for seven months  More companies in our   region indicate that they intend to increase hiring, and help-wanted ads are up  Still, the BLS data   show that manufacturing employment in our three states continued to decline in the first quarter and   total payroll employment was flat  In fact, job growth in our region has been essentially flat since   the second quarter of last year     We’ve been receiving reports from some of our directors about the difficulty of finding   skilled labor  We continued to explore the labor supply issue in a special question in our April   BOS  As I reported last time, our March survey showed that, of the three-quarters of responding   firms that had openings, two-thirds of them had difficulty filling positions mainly because of a lack   of qualified applicants  Our April survey indicated that a majority of firms are having trouble   finding applicants skilled in the use of production machines or with special plant and systems   operations skills  More disturbing is the fact that a large number—40 percent to be exact—also said   May 4, 2004 38 of 112       that applicants lacked the basic “three Rs” of reading, writing, and arithmetic  For the most part,   this cannot be attributed to foreign applicants with poor English skills, as only 14 percent of the   respondents cited the language issue as a problem  Over half of our firms reported that the gap   between required skills and available skills had widened in the last five years  Most of the current   weakness in our labor market is likely cyclical  Firms have been extracting as much as they can   from current employees, which is typical at this point in the expansion  Still, our survey results   suggest that at least some of the weakness may be structural in nature  The implication is that it   might take longer for displaced workers to become re-employed, which means that we may be   overstating the degree of slack in the labor market  These themes, as you can tell, are being   repeated around the table   Although employment has remained subdued, wages in the Philadelphia region appear to be   increasing at a slightly faster rate than in the nation  The same is true for goods prices  Industrial   price pressures have increased in recent months, and there is some evidence that firms are beginning   to pass on some of the higher costs to their customers, another theme that came up around this table     The prices-received index in our survey is at nearly a nine-year high  A distributor of office   furniture in our District reports that manufacturers are passing on some of the increases in steel   prices to their customers  Our survey index of future prices paid, which reflects manufacturers’   expectations of prices they will have to pay for inputs in six months, has increased over the past   year  I don’t want to make too much of this or overstate the case  By the same token, we’re hearing   a lot of this type of news around the table today as well as in our District  It bears watching, to be   sure  Having said all that, during April I typically travel around the District, holding a series of   meetings with bankers and business leaders; most report seeing signs of improvement, and they are   quite optimistic   May 4, 2004 39 of 112       Turning to the nation, in my view economic conditions have improved since our last   meeting, and I believe the recovery may have reached the point of being self-sustaining  Activity   continues to expand at a good pace, even though first-quarter GDP came in a bit lower than   expected  Note though, as has already been mentioned, that the weaker-than-expected inventory   growth is to a large extent responsible for that shortfall  Consumer spending continues to expand at   a moderate pace, and consumer balance sheets remain healthy   House-price appreciation has been strong, and it appears to have been fueled not only by   low interest rates but also by a more sustainable upward shift in the demand for housing  Moreover,   roughly 80 percent of outstanding mortgages are at fixed rates, and most ARMs are hybrids with   some rate protection  But other types of consumer lending tend to be at more-variable rates than   mortgages, suggesting that households may be fully extended and somewhat more vulnerable to rate   increases  This potentially negative effect will be muted so long as labor market conditions   continue to improve   When we last met I said that the missing piece was employment growth but that, given the   pace of GDP growth, I expected to see employment begin to pick up modestly  The most recent   information on the labor market was welcome news  The latest evidence shows that the recovery   continues to move more toward a structural balance, which puts it on a more sustainable footing  I   see the risks to economic growth as being balanced  At the same time, we’re getting an inkling of   renewed but still modest pricing power on the part of many businesses, with various measures of   inflation firming   Given the current state of the economy and the outlook, I believe we are getting close to the   time when we will need to adjust policy, bearing in mind that we’re not considering when to start a   tightening regime but rather when to start easing up on the stimulus  Recent speeches by the   May 4, 2004 40 of 112       Chairman and other members of the FOMC have begun to set the stage, as others have indicated  I   think we should take advantage of this  Today’s goal should be to increase our flexibility regarding   future actions so that we can begin taking back some accommodation whenever conditions warrant   without surprising the market  If we determine that we need to change rates sooner rather than later,   I do not want us to feel constrained by our policy statements     To this end, I think we should acknowledge that there has been some improvement in the   labor market  I think we need to change our risk assessment regarding inflation  At least to my   mind, the risk of an increase in inflation is at least as large as a risk of a decrease in inflation  It’s   also time to remove our statement about “patience”  We added that when we needed an unusual   procedure for unusual times  Keeping it in the statement now or replacing it with something else   that constitutes an intertemporal commitment would reduce our flexibility going forward  And   frankly, I don’t think we know the speed at which we will have to respond  That will depend on the   information we receive on economic conditions and on our assessment of the outlook  Thank you,   Mr Chairman   "
5302,2004-05-04,"  I’d like to go to this point of what the market’s reaction will be    Obviously the market reaction is going to be dependent upon what we do relative to what market   participants expect us to do  Their expectations are the relevant issue here  But I don’t know how   we measure market reaction when we don’t have a way of going out there and asking market   participants, “What would you think if we said ‘measured’?”  The market is expecting an   adjustment, I would argue—an elimination of the word “patience”  But I don’t know how to split   that hair and say that, if we eliminate “patience,” which is what the market expects, but don’t put in   a word that is somewhere between patience and an imminent move—a word such as “measured”   whose second definition is “slow movement”—we’re going to get a 10 basis point increase in rates    More to the point, we’re then going to have to sit around here next time and worry about whether it   is time to be less measured, and that troubles me as well   I thought that the combination of the speeches and the market’s expectations as to the data   would allow us the opportunity to do what the market expects by taking out “patience”  I just   wonder whether we’re generating another problem by adding “measured”  I don’t know what the   reaction to that is going to be  Whatever the reaction is, we’re going to have to pay for it later when   we no longer want to characterize our prospective policy actions as measured  I don’t know if that’s   May 4, 2004 76 of 112       a question! [Laughter]  You answered the question of what you expect the market to do, though I   don’t know how one could even begin to answer that question  I think market participants are going   to scramble to their dictionaries and ask, “What does ‘measured’ mean?”  And then they’ll try to   figure out our intentions and how to react     If they expect us to drop it or modify it, I read that as an opportunity   to drop it  If we really wanted to know more, I guess we should have asked, but I’m not sure how to   do that  There are lots of words in the English language     I support your proposal  I am a little uneasy about the word   “measured” for the reasons I indicated  If I may, I’d like to ask you just one question concerning   your thought process  You indicated that at the next meeting we may indeed be in a position of   responding with a 25 basis point move—to the extent that the incoming data are satisfactory—and   that if the economy gets stronger, then we will go 75     I’m teasing, of course, just giving an example     I agree with you  The question I want to ask is this  If we got   positive surprises between now and the June meeting and we felt we needed to raise the funds rate   target by 25 basis points, would we also conclude that we needed to take out “measured”?     Therefore, the next move could be more on the order of 375 basis   points—that is to say two steps, involving both a 25 basis point increase and the removal of   “measured”     If we move and the economy suddenly improves in a manner that is   consistent with moving further, it may be more disruptive to have put the word “measured” in the   statement than to have left it out     With that said, I support your recommendation  "
5349,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In contrast to the nation and my next door   neighbor, economic activity in the Third District is expanding a little faster now than it was at the   beginning of the year  Job growth in our region had been lagging that in the nation, but it has   strengthened in recent months, at least through June, which is the latest month for which we have   state employment numbers  Payrolls in our three states grew at a 07 percent rate in the second   quarter, after being flat in the first quarter  Each of the states had employment gains, and these   gains were widespread across industries  Job growth in the region was strongest in New Jersey,   especially the southern part of the state  Payroll employment is now above its pre-recession levels   in New Jersey  It remains 1 percent below the pre-recession level in Delaware and 1¼ percent   below in Pennsylvania  The tri-state unemployment rate edged down to 51 percent in the second   quarter, and we continue to receive reports that some firms are having difficulty finding qualified   workers   August 10, 2004 29 of 103          Responses to special questions about wages in our business outlook survey of manufacturers   and our South Jersey business survey—which includes manufacturers, retailers, and service firms—  suggest that growing demand for workers is leading to wage increases  Thirty-eight percent of the   BOS respondents and 50 percent of the South Jersey respondents said that they have raised wages to   retain or attract workers in the past three months  Among those who reported raising wages, the   modal increase was in the 2 to 4 percent range, and these survey results seem consistent with the   BLS data indicating that wages and salaries and total worker compensation in our region have been   rising at a faster pace than in the nation as a whole   The other sectors in our District continue to perform well  Although retail sales moderated a   bit in June, our contacts attribute the slower sales to unusually cool weather, and they reported some   rebound in July  In addition, retailers in our region expect strong back-to-school sales, although we   don’t have hard data on whether that is happening yet  Commercial real estate markets in the region   remain soft  Residential construction activity remains at a high level, although its growth eased   back a bit in June  Manufacturing activity in the region continues to expand and has outperformed   the nation in recent months  Our business outlook survey index of general activity rose to 361 in   July, up from 289 in June, and the index has been in positive territory for the last fourteen months    The more forward-looking indexes on new orders and shipments improved considerably in July,   and a historically large share of respondents also reported increases in unfilled orders and delivery   times  And some firms commented that they were reaching capacity  Service-sector activity in the   region has strengthened, with payroll employment in that sector expanding briskly in the past few   months  Over the first half of the year, professional and business service employment grew the   fastest among the service-sector industries in our region   August 10, 2004 30 of 103          We continue to get readings of rising prices in our region, although the pace of increase is   slightly less than a few months ago  The prices-paid index in our manufacturing survey declined in   the past two months but remains at a high level  Firms seem better able to pass on some of the price   increases to their customers  The prices-received index in our survey rose to a fifteen-year high in   July  In summary, the outlook in our region is positive  Our staff’s leading indicators of economic   activity are signaling steady growth in all three states in our District over the next three quarters, and   our business contacts appear optimistic   On the national level, real GDP growth slowed somewhat more than expected in the second   quarter  First-quarter growth, as reported here, was revised up at the same time  Most of the   second-quarter deceleration reflected sharply lower growth in consumer spending, which was not   totally unexpected, but the size of the decline was greater than most had anticipated  At the same   time, most of the new monthly data have been coming in on the positive side  Auto sales rebounded   in July  Housing remains strong, and new orders for nondefense capital goods continue to trend up    So at least until Friday, I tended to agree with the Greenbook’s earlier interpretation of the second   quarter as a temporary lull in activity, and I expected GDP growth to be somewhat faster in the third   quarter than in the second     Then the July employment report was released last Friday  We know what the job gains   were, so I will skip over the details  Still, a number of other indicators of the report showed   improvement in the labor market  The unemployment rate fell a tenth to 55 percent, and the   household employment number grew by an implausibly large 629,000  I am still puzzled by that   latter number  The labor force participation rate moved up  And the average and median duration   of unemployment moved down significantly; the weekly hours worked held about steady  In   addition, we note that initial claims for unemployment insurance have been trending down, and   August 10, 2004 31 of 103          many business surveys indicate that firms are hiring and expect to continue hiring  Given the   weight of all this evidence, I continue to expect a rebound in employment growth in the coming   months, and I’ll be watching these data carefully   At our last meeting, Governor Bernanke reminded us of Larry Meyer’s rules of forecasting    I found myself thinking about those rules over the past few weeks, as the weaker-than-expected   output was announced and, more recently, last Friday when the employment data were released  I   asked myself, Is it time to apply rule 2 and make a fundamentally new forecast?  My answer is,   “No, at least not yet”  High oil prices do pose a risk to the economy, not only to growth but also to   inflation and inflation expectations  That said, I note that the core PCE has moderated in recent   months     In my view, the FOMC should remain on the course we began at our last meeting and   should continue to remove policy accommodation at a measured pace  Despite the recent softness   in output and in the employment data, my outlook for the economy has not changed enough to merit   our taking a pause  I think the risk of maintaining the current degree of policy accommodation   outweighs the risk of a continued transition to a more neutral stance  The real fed funds rate will   remain negative even after we move today, and thus monetary policy will remain expansionary as   we continue to help the economy out of this temporary lull  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5350,2004-08-10,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I like the basic   strategy of keeping the pressure on to try to get us back to neutral  In answer to President   Minehan’s question of where is neutral, my answer has always been “north of here,” so I’d keep   going in that direction  Neutral may not mean a single number, and the definition of neutral may   not be fixed  But as long as we’re moving north of where we are currently, I think it’s a good idea   On the wording, I know four versions of this matrix have been handed out  Ordinarily, that   would be problematic  I think each actually improved the statement  I like the wording of the last   version and the reference to energy  The way it is posed here actually fits better my way of seeing   the situation, so I’m comfortable with the wording as it is presented  "
5402,2004-09-21,"  Let me just point out that there is a long literature on the   mechanics of our intervention on a daily basis  I support your notion of updating that literature   September 21, 2004 13 of 100          and looking into this; it might be useful  But this is not the first time we’ve looked at these kinds   of issues     I agree 100 percent  But there is a literature on this subject that we   can connect to  And the staff can do a good job of reviewing that and bring us up to date  "
5403,2004-09-21,"  I’ll yield my time; this is more informative     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Third District   continues to expand  Our region did not experience the June lull seen in other parts of the   country, but in the last month we’ve seen some easing in the pace of growth—perhaps a delayed   lull rather than a new trend  Manufacturing is a case in point; our business outlook survey index   September 21, 2004 51 of 100          of general activity fell to 134 in September from a robust 285 in August  In contrast, the index   of new orders strengthened in September, and shipments remained very high  It’s fairly unusual   for us to get disparate readings across the general activity, orders, and shipments indexes   I will note that the comments we received from respondents were generally positive and   more consistent with the readings on new orders and shipments  In a special question this   month, we asked how firms’ investment spending had been affected by the special tax   depreciation allowance  About a quarter of our firms said that the allowance led them to   increase their spending on capital equipment this year, and it appears that these firms have   smoothed out the spending over the year  Consistent with the continued strength in new orders,   half of our firms report that they expect to spend more on capital equipment in 2005 than they   did last year, and a quarter of them expect to spend significantly more     Each of the three states in our region experienced positive job growth in the first two   months of the third quarter  Employment growth in the third quarter has slowed from the second   quarter but is about the average of the first two quarters combined  After five consecutive   quarters of decline, the three-state unemployment rate edged up to 52 percent on average in July   and August  Despite the increase, the statewide unemployment rates in each of our three states   remained below the national average, and we continue to receive reports that some firms are   having difficulty finding qualified workers  I thought that’s where President Stern was going on   the hiring story because I keep hearing that story in the Philadelphia District   Retail sales of general merchandise have been rising in the District, although year-to-year   gains have eased from earlier in the year  Some of the year-to-year weakness in August was to   be expected because last August’s sales were significantly buoyed by the tax rebate checks that   were received around that time  Commercial real estate markets in the region remain soft, but   September 21, 2004 52 of 100          we’re beginning to see a slight improvement in nonresidential construction  This is concentrated   mainly in warehouse construction, with office construction still quite flat  Residential activity is   now beginning to moderate from the very strong pace earlier this year, but home sales remain   strong, and house appreciation continues at a high rate in our three areas  We continue to get   readings of rising prices in our region, with firms expressing concerns about rising fuel prices   and mental and other health care costs  The outlook among the contacts in the region’s business   community is for continued improvement this year, with modest gains anticipated  Our staff’s   leading indexes of economic activity are all signaling output growth in the three states in the   region over the next three quarters and stronger employment growth as well   Turning to the nation, incoming data suggest that the economy is emerging from the soft   patch  Consumer spending has picked up, although it is not growing as strongly as it was earlier   this year, as several people have noted  Manufacturing activity has rebounded, and business   investment continues to expand at a good pace  Payroll employment gains improved in August   after two months of weak reports   Despite oil prices hitting $50 a barrel in mid-August, inflation has eased somewhat from   levels seen earlier this year, and long-term inflation expectations remain steady  The economic   fundamentals continue to suggest that inflation will remain in check  However, I am not as   sanguine about the inflation outlook as the Greenbook  The Greenbook has GDP growth above   potential for the next two years  At the end of that period, the output gap is eliminated, yet   monetary policy remains accommodative, with the fed funds rate below neutral  It’s difficult for   me to believe that the inflation picture could be as favorable as the Greenbook suggests unless   the fed funds rate is at or above neutral at that point    September 21, 2004 53 of 100          On balance, the data suggest to us that growth for the year will likely be 3½ to 4 percent,   in line with what President Stern indicated  In my view, this is a reasonably good showing,   although I must admit it’s about 1 percentage point weaker than we had forecast at the beginning   of the year  At this point, I believe the FOMC should remain on the course of continuing to   remove policy accommodation at a measured pace  The real fed funds rate will remain negative   even if we move ¼ percentage point today; thus, monetary policy will remain expansionary and   will help ensure the sustainability of the recovery despite higher oil prices and diminishing fiscal   stimulus  Finally, I see no reason to alter our risk language at this time  I think it gives us the   necessary room to deviate from the measured pace in either direction, if that proves to be   necessary Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5404,2004-09-21,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
5456,2004-11-10,"  I just wondered, David, if you would give us some sense of the   sensitivity of the baseline forecast to changes in the budget outlook that we made reference to   earlier  What happens if the tax cuts and everything else are made permanent?  What is the   implication of some of the fiscal actions that people have been bandying about?  How much does it   matter in terms of the forecast?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity continues to expand at   a modest pace in the Third District  This is the sense we get from the discussions we have had   lately with our various advisory boards and from the general tone of the data we have been   gathering about the District   Manufacturing has held up well and continues to be a strong performer  This is in spite of   the dip in the September business outlook survey (BOS) index of general activity to 134, which I   reported last meeting  At that time I noted that the decline seemed inconsistent with the strength in   November 10, 2004 43 of 107    new orders and shipments as well as with the positive comments from our respondents  The sharp   rebound in the activity index in October to 28 seems to indicate that the dip was a one-time   aberration from a longer-term positive tone in the BOS  This view is also supported by the fact that   the new orders and shipments indexes have remained at very healthy levels and by the   strengthening in the employment index this month  Our survey suggests that respondents see   strength in manufacturing through the rest of the year as well  In our special question this month,   about 40 percent of the firms surveyed report that they’re planning to increase production in the   fourth quarter, about 40 percent say they will keep production at the current level, and only   20 percent plan reductions  Roughly the same number of firms plan to increase their inventories of   finished goods as to decrease them  If you put all of this together, it suggests that firms expect sales   to be increasing  I’d also note that the survey suggests that firms are gaining some pricing power    There has been an increase in the number of respondents who report that they’re beginning to   increase their prices in response to rising costs of metals and energy   Turning to the retail sector, sales of general merchandise in our region continued to grow at   a moderate pace, which is consistent with retailers’ expectations  Our retailers expect Christmas   sales to be fairly good but not excessively strong  Home sales in the District remain strong, and   housing-price appreciation continues at a high rate in our three states  But residential construction   activity continues to moderate from the very strong pace earlier in the year  Nonresidential   construction remains soft, but we’re beginning to see a pickup in the commercial sector, which   includes office buildings and warehouses outside the manufacturing sector  Contracts for   commercial buildings are up slightly on a year-over-year basis   Our employment data are a bit old  The October employment numbers for our three states   have not yet been released  However, based on unrevised numbers through September,   employment growth in our three-state region was stronger than in the nation  It slowed in the third   November 10, 2004 44 of 107    quarter from the second quarter but remained in line with expectations  Given the upward revisions   in the national employment numbers in August and September, I would not be surprised to see our   state numbers revised up as well  The labor markets in New Jersey are the strongest, and those in   Pennsylvania the weakest  The weakness in Pennsylvania seems to be distributed statewide, but   Philadelphia has been particularly weak  Payrolls declined in Philadelphia over the past quarter    Nonetheless, our business contacts continue to report that they are having difficulties finding   qualified workers  This seems to be true for lower-skilled manufacturing jobs as well as for higher-  skilled technical positions   Turning to the nation, incoming data suggest that the economy has bounced back from the   soft patch it hit this summer  Now even the payroll employment data are consistent with this view    Despite the rise in oil prices, growth this year is likely to be in the 3½ to 4 percent range, as a   number of others have already indicated  Although we saw an uptick in core inflation in   September, inflation remains low, and the latest employment data show that payrolls have grown at   about 200,000 jobs per month this year  This is a fairly good showing for the economy   As far as I’m concerned, the course for policy today seems straightforward  We should   continue on our path of removing accommodation at a measured pace and maintain most of the   language in the Committee’s last announcement  This would be consistent with the economic data   we have received and is also widely anticipated in the market  Nonetheless, I think we should   begin to think about our longer-term policy strategy  The employment report suggests that the   expansion may now be on a solid footing  Of course, it is only one data point, as a number have   said—or maybe three data points if one considers August, September, and October—so I don’t   want to get overconfident  Still, I think we may want to begin to question whether a measured pace   is an appropriate description of the pace of monetary policy tightening we are likely to need over   the next several quarters   November 10, 2004 45 of 107    By the way, I recognize that the Greenbook forecast assumes a very slow movement in the   fed funds rate  Indeed, one might complain that “measured” may be too rapid a characterization    [Laughter]  Nonetheless, we need to consider that at this point two key risks to the outlook—higher   oil prices and a sharper depreciation of the dollar—may put pressure on inflation sometime in the   future  Given the lags in the effect of monetary policy on the economy, we should be prepared to   move rapidly if that becomes necessary  This leads me to think that if the data between now and   our December meeting are similar to what we have been seeing so far, the Committee may want to   consider preparing the markets and market participants for the possibility of a steeper path of policy   tightening going forward  For today, I see no reason to alter either the risk language or the   measured pace language in our statement   "
5457,2004-11-10,"  I support the two parts of your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I   think alternative B′ is preferable to B  I appreciate your observation on the diversity around the   table, and I think President Poole is correct that it’s because each of us has a wider distribution in   our heads regarding what is likely to happen  We’re just talking about where our mean is, I guess,   or maybe where our insecurities are  In reality, my thought is that there is a good deal of   uncertainty on both sides, as I pointed out in my formal comments  There is uncertainty on the   weak side as well as the strong side, for the reasons you noted  Accordingly, I think it is time for us   November 10, 2004 85 of 107    to look at this language issue again  We enjoyed it so much the first time, and the second, and the   third  [Laughter]  "
5516,2004-12-14,"  Why not call everyone participants in the first part of the—?     When I proposed the experiment on early release of the minutes, I   thought that we were addressing a few questions  The first one was, Can we do it?  Do we need to   change the process?  Can we all focus our attention on the minutes, given the time constraints?  And   December 14, 2004 95 of 118           given the new proposed process, were we comfortable with what would be released?  I think that   was the experiment  I think we learned a lot from that experiment, but not everything  We learned,   for example, that we shouldn’t move to releasing the minutes on a Friday  We also decided that we   ought to plan to publish the minutes three weeks after the meeting  Quite frankly, I think that’s a   good addition of a few extra days to allow for contingencies  I believe we would have had a harder   time meeting the publication goal ex post if we had started releasing the minutes on the previous   Friday   But one never learns everything from an experiment  So if there are things left on the table,   it shouldn’t surprise us  Nevertheless, we now have a new process for producing the minutes that is   more timely  It brings more resources to the work, has hastened attention to it, and actually is a   discussion that’s more symptomatic of the time when the minutes would be released  I, therefore,   endorse the release of the minutes in a more timely fashion  I know there’s some concern about   market reactions  Most market participants are grown-ups; they’ll sort that out  I guess I trust   markets enough to think that they’ll figure out how to do it  I also share the concern addressed by   President Guynn that, if we have these minutes and put them on the shelf and then take them out   several weeks later, it’s just a matter of time before someone says, “Why are you doing that?”     So, first of all, I think early release is the right thing to do  I now know we can do it  And I   think not doing it puts us in a situation of less disclosure than seems appropriate  Having said all   that, I think we should do it     Should there be some discussion about nineteen votes versus twelve   in that statement?   December 14, 2004 100 of 118          "
5517,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Third District   continues to expand at a moderate pace  Reports from our manufacturers have been mostly   positive  Our November business outlook survey (BOS) index of general activity stood at 207,   which was down slightly from October  However, the index in our December BOS, which will be   released Thursday, has rebounded to 296  So we’re still seeing expansion in the region’s   manufacturing sector  The new orders and shipments indexes remain at healthy levels, and the   employment index continues to strengthen   Looking beyond our formal surveys, retail sales of general merchandise in our region are   showing continued moderate growth this holiday season, at a pace consistent with retailers’   expectations  This growth has been in most store types and merchandise lines  Retailers in our   region expect current dollar holiday sales this year to be 4 percent higher than last year, which is   similar to the National Retail Federation’s forecast of a 45 percent gain  On the margin, however,   sales of luxury goods continue to show better year-over-year increases than sales of other items    Turning to construction, nonresidential construction remains soft  We had a bit of an   improvement last month, but it was fleeting  It’s probably best to describe this sector as having   bottomed out without any kind of sustained improvement yet  Nonetheless, commercial real estate   firms expect office vacancy rates to move down somewhat in the year ahead in most parts of the   region  At the same time, they continue to report declines in effective rents, as landlords compete   for new tenants and lease renewals  As a result, some commercial real estate investors are   becoming concerned that prices for buildings have risen to a level inconsistent with the underlying   fundamentals   December 14, 2004 23 of 118           In the residential real estate sector, prices continue to accelerate in each of the three states in   our region  Area builders report that they are raising prices for new homes, in contrast to some   other parts of the nation where it is reported that developers are beginning to cut prices or offer   discounted upgrades as incentives to spur sales  Looking ahead, builders and real estate agents   expect the pace of sales to remain roughly steady  They anticipate rising employment and incomes   to cushion the effect of increases in mortgage rates as long as the upturn in rates does not exceed   1 or 2 percentage points   Payroll employment in each of our three states grew in October, the latest month for which   we have state-level data  Growth in October was somewhat slower than in the second and third   quarters, but payrolls went up in all major industry groups except manufacturing and information   services  Employment growth in New Jersey and Delaware continues to outpace that of the nation    Pennsylvania continues to exhibit the weakest labor market in our region  Looking ahead, our staff   forecast calls for moderate acceleration in employment growth and a decline in unemployment rates   in each of our three states over the next year   On the inflation front, some reports suggest increasing industrial goods price pressure  This   is what we hear from our board, and this is what businesses are reporting in their comments to us   around the District  In our business outlook survey, the price indexes remained at high levels, and   firms reported higher prices for their own manufactured goods and higher production costs  For   example, more than 90 percent of the executives polled in our November BOS expected prices of   raw materials, including energy, to increase next year  In all, the outlook among our contacts in the   region’s business community is positive  They expect growth to continue at about its current pace   through the winter   December 14, 2004 24 of 118           Turning to the nation, data released since our last meeting have generally been on the   positive side  Household spending and business investment have been revised upward, suggesting   positive momentum  Recent retail sales numbers were encouraging  Housing construction remains   relatively strong, and manufacturing remains on solid footing  While the November employment   report was a bit on the soft side, the pattern of payroll growth over the past several months, allowing   for the usual monthly volatility of the data, shows continued improvement in the labor market    Payroll growth has averaged over 185,000 jobs per month so far this year, about in line with the   forecasts  While there likely is still some slack in labor markets, this is being worked off  By the   way, for those of you who put some value in the NAIRU model, the recent staff analysis of NAIRU   estimates at our Bank suggests that there may be less slack in the labor market than we assumed    The other positive developments for aggregate demand since the last meeting are the decline in oil   prices and the depreciation of the dollar, as we know   My outlook for economic growth is broadly consistent with that of the Greenbook  I, too,   expect growth in the neighborhood of 4 percent next year, and I’m more comfortable with the fed   funds rate path built into this Greenbook than I was with the path of the last one  However, even   with the steeper funds rate path, I see somewhat more inflation risk  The dollar could depreciate   more and the pass-through to final prices could be larger than is incorporated into the baseline   forecast  I do recall that we discussed at our last meeting the worldwide phenomenon of a reduction   in the pass-through rate  Nonetheless, I think we need to list this as a risk to our forecast  In this   regard, as David Stockton noted, five-year inflation compensation based on the Treasury indexed   security has moved up, even while six-to-ten-year inflation compensation has been stable  One   interpretation of the divergence is that the markets believe that the FOMC will respond to   inflationary pressures and keep prices stable in the long run, but only after we see that inflation has   December 14, 2004 25 of 118           risen  I would prefer that we be more forward-looking than this implies  This, of course, argues for   maintaining our strategy of gradually removing policy accommodation to bring policy back to a   neutral stance  The facts are that policy remains accommodative, the forecast is for continued   growth in the neighborhood of 4 percent, and there is some positive inflation risk  All this suggests   to me that it is prudent to continue on our upward path for the funds rate   Before closing, I’d like to point out that the Bluebook’s measure of the real fed funds rate   uses lagged core PCE  By this measure, we have made some progress in moving the real funds rate   north  However, ex ante measures of the real rate, based on the forecast of inflation, show less   progress by the Committee in removing policy accommodation  I would ask the Committee to   remember 1994  At that time, the FOMC waited to see a year’s worth of strong employment data   before starting to raise rates, on the grounds that falling inflation meant that the real rate was rising    Then once the FOMC started to increase rates, it had to do so quite sharply over the year  Of   course, this time we began raising rates earlier than last time, which may allow us to follow a more   gradual path  However, remember, this time inflation has been increasing, and the real rate has   been moving up only a little  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5518,2004-12-14,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
5567,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been little change in the   outlook for the Third District since my last report  Economic activity continues to expand at a   moderate pace in most sectors in the region, and most of our business contacts expect the current   pace of activity to be maintained through the spring   Recent readings from our business outlook survey indicate that regional manufacturing   activity is expanding The pace is slower than we saw during the initial phase in this sector in late                                   March 22, 2005 33 of 116  2003 and early 2004, but that is to be expected In March, the general activity index fell to 114, a   fairly sharp decline from last month’s reading of nearly 24  I don’t read too much into this  The   index has been fairly volatile over the past three months, but it remains at a level that is typical of   expansions   Consumers continue to spend at a moderate pace  Winter merchandise has been cleared out   through discounting, and spring apparel is selling well Most of our retail contacts have said that   sales are running close to plan   As was true last month, nonresidential construction in our region remained soft  However,   office-leasing activity in the Philadelphia metropolitan area has begun to rise, with five consecutive   quarters of positive absorption Vacancy rates have improved slightly  Residential construction has   remained healthy, but it’s down from its peak last spring  And house-price acceleration continues,   but at a slower pace than earlier last year   Employment is increasing in the region, but our directors and our other business contacts   continue to report on the scarcity of qualified workers Some firms have resorted to trying to bus   people in from other localities, with mixed success  A temp agency customer indicated that they’ve   had no objections to recent wage increases, expecting that they would help ease the labor shortage   But, so far, at least, this has not been the case The manager for the temp agency said that the likely   enactment of a $2 increase over two years in the New Jersey minimum wage to $715 per hour will   have little effect on her business, as her workers already earn more than that  However, the New   Jersey Department of Labor estimates that 16 percent of hourly workers earn less than $715 an   hour   There is some evidence that the pricing power of firms in the region is rising  The   manufacturing firms we surveyed reported paying and receiving higher prices  One manufacturer                                   March 22, 2005 34 of 116  who recently put through a price increase to his customers said he now regrets not having made a   larger increase, given the ease with which it was accepted   In summary, the economic expansion continues at a moderate pace in the Third District    Labor markets appear to be tightening, price pressures may be building, and the outlook among   business contacts in our region remains positive   My assessment of the economic conditions in the nation has changed somewhat since we last   met  The incoming data and forecasts seem to be indicating that the underlying economy has more   momentum than I thought a month ago  At that time, I had characterized the economy as growing at   a moderate pace  I would now say it’s growing at a solid pace   We have transitioned from a consumption-led to an investment-led expansion  Other than   nonresidential construction, no sector is showing signs of weakness despite higher oil prices In   addition, the labor market has strengthened  Payrolls have risen at a 18 percent annual pace over   the last 12 months  That’s less than the 26 percent annual rate we saw from the end of 1992 to   1997, but remember that at the end of 1992 the unemployment rate was 74 percent  With the   unemployment rate now under 55 percent, the current pace of employment growth is probably   about right   We are at a point in the business cycle at which we need to be very watchful about inflation   dynamics and inflation expectations  In the middle of 2003, the 12-month core inflation measures   had fallen to around 1 percent and the Committee embarked upon a reflation policy  This policy was   successful Our actions have increased the inflation rate to the midpoint of my acceptable range    Our job now is to set policy to ensure that inflation does not accelerate beyond that acceptable range   In my view, the signs of a pickup in underlying inflation and in inflation expectations   indicate that the risk to inflation has shifted to the upside There has been a relatively sharp                          March 22, 2005 35 of 116  acceleration in core consumer good prices, oil prices have risen substantially—as we heard this   morning—and the dollar has declined considerably  All of this poses a real inflation risk going   forward More significantly, medium-term inflation expectations, as measured by the spread   between nominal and inflation-indexed yields, appear to be shifting upward  With forecasts of   inflation moving up, albeit not yet to an alarming rate, it would behoove us to respond in some   fashion We all know that we cannot wait until we see a sustained acceleration in inflation if we   want to do something about it   All this suggests that it is important for us to remain vigilant about signs of higher inflation   and to take steps now to increase our flexibility in adjusting the funds rate path going forward   Indeed, with the real funds rate still quite low and monetary policy accommodative, I’m putting   more weight on the possibility that we will have to raise rates at a faster pace than we anticipated a   month ago  It could very well be that a measured pace, interpreted by the market as moves of 25   basis points, still characterizes the most likely path for policy going forward  But, in my view, the   possibility that a steeper path may be needed has risen since our last meeting   If others on the Committee feel as I do, then I think we need to find a way to convey this   shift in priors to the public One way to do that is to reword our statement to clearly acknowledge   the increase in inflation pressures We can do this in the rationale language or in the assessment of   risk language or both Another way is to acknowledge that a faster pace may be necessary in order   to fulfill our dual mandate  I’ll defer getting into the specifics of the language until the next part of   our discussion Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5568,2005-03-22," The only thing that concerns me about the sentence we’ve been   working on is this I’m not sure it actually does anything good  Where we were, to my mind, may be   better than where we’re going I’m not sure what “should” means in the context, and I’m not sure   the conditioning actually moves us ahead  We may be better off staying with the wording in the   February statement, which is ambiguous as to policy action and doesn’t talk about normative   statements like “should”  That has the benefit of not moving us in the wrong direction, so we can   address where we want to be in May    It’s only if we shift at all    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support the proposal to raise the fed   funds rate 25 basis points and I can accept the wording in alternative B I must admit that Governor   Gramlich’s amendment—or maybe it was Governor Kohn’s amendment, I’m not sure which—   makes some sense to me because I think that’s more descriptive than notions like “should be” or   “with appropriate policy” It’s just clearer and, if you will, more direct  But at this point, I’m fine   with your recommendation   Going forward, I think the process question is an important one  It’s not just a matter of   when do we get the page, if you will, it’s also a question of how does one respond and what does one   know in anticipation of the conversation here So, I would encourage the staff to work that through                                              March 22, 2005 94 of 116  a bit and make it a little more transparent as we proceed and as the communication becomes more   and more valuable  "
5617,2005-05-03," The first quote of NIPA [national income and product accounts] data   showed a large increase in inventory accumulation outside of what we talked about in terms of oil   effects I’m rather curious about the inventory issues  Where are these inventories?  Are they in   final goods? Are they in intermediate goods?  Are the inventories produced domestically or abroad?   What is the implication, in terms of the future industrial impact, of this accumulation of inventories?   I was just wondering if you could expand a bit on your view of that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Third District   continued to improve in the first quarter, although at a slightly slower pace than in the previous   quarter Retail sales in the region were up slightly in March, with most merchants noting that   unseasonably cold and rainy weather dampened sales of spring apparel and other seasonal   merchandise  As in the nation, local auto dealers saw a healthy rebound in sales in March, helped by   strong manufacturers’ incentives  Both retailers and auto dealers expect sales to improve this spring   Payroll employment continued to increase in the region in the first quarter, and the   unemployment rate declined  A large national payroll and benefits administrator in our District   reported that in the first-quarter employment growth was stronger at small firms with fewer than   1,000 employees than at large firms  But the positive growth rate at large firms was an improvement   over the zero growth they saw last year   There has been little change in the overall picture in the construction sector Nonresidential   construction in our region remains soft  As in the nation, there has been a sharp drop in the value of   nonresidential construction contracts in the first quarter compared to a year ago  The residential   sector remains strong  The value of residential construction contracts declined in the first quarter in   our three-state region, but remained at a high level  Home sales and the rate of house price   appreciation remained robust   Our business outlook survey indicated that regional manufacturing activity is expanding    We saw a sizable rebound in the general activity index—from 114 in March to 253 in April—   suggesting that the drop in March may have been a random volatility event rather than a signal of a   more persistent slowing  About half of the firms reported that they plan to increase capacity in 2005,   with the modal increase in the 5 to 10 percent range                                 May 3, 2005 51 of 116  The most troubling regional economic news is the evidence of increasing price pressures in   the District Consumer prices in greater Philadelphia appear to be increasing at a faster pace than in   the nation as a whole After some moderation in February and March, industrial price pressures   increased in April The price indexes in our manufacturing survey rebounded this month across   almost all of the industrial sectors represented and are at very high levels  However, while the   indexes of future prices paid and received have risen sharply over the past two years, in recent   months both indexes have stabilized, albeit at relatively high levels  Also, employment cost inflation   in the Northeast region has not accelerated, running at a 35 percent annual rate in the year that just   ended in March   In summary, the economic expansion appears to continue at a moderate pace in the Third   District This is what we gleaned from the data we have available and it’s consistent with the   anecdotal information from our contacts  During April, I typically travel around the region, holding   a series of meetings with our bankers and business leaders  They’re generally upbeat, with positive   outlooks despite the recent negative national economic headlines  This gives me some confidence   that the recent softness in the data will prove to be relatively temporary and is not signaling an   economy that is taking on a new direction   My assessment of economic conditions in the nation is similar  Admittedly, higher oil prices   likely are having some dampening effect on economic activity, and recent monthly data have come   in softer than expected  However, this appears to be a temporary lull, as there is little to point to that   suggests we are seeing a persistent deceleration in real economic activity  Last month was   reminiscent of the soft patch we hit in June of last year, as President Yellen indicated, after oil prices   began to rise You’ll recall that the economy emerged fairly quickly from that lull                                 May 3, 2005 52 of 116  As the expansion continues and the economy approaches a sustainable growth rate, it is to be   expected that we will see growth in some quarters above and in some quarters below that sustainable   pace My reading of history suggests that a low quarter or two is fairly typical during the course of   an expansion and that some of the concerns based on early measures of economic activity are   assuaged by subsequent revisions in the data The bottom line is that I agree with the Greenbook’s   assessment that the economy continues to have positive momentum  This suggests that it is   premature to be too concerned that the perceived slowdown will persist and clearly premature to   alter our policy path based upon the available new data   Of course, there are downside risks for near-term growth, but there is nothing that monetary   policy can do that will affect the real growth in the next quarter or so  Therefore, I think we should   be focusing on a horizon over which monetary policy can have an effect  In that regard, the   acceleration in inflation over the past year is a concern to me, and that sentiment has been echoed   around this table The first part of the increase in inflation was to get us away from the zero bound,   but we are now well beyond that In fact, over the last six months, the inflation rate has been   moving up into the top half of my acceptable range  Of course, these are high-frequency data and   the trend still might prove temporary, but it clearly deserves watching   The Board staff continues to forecast some tempering in core inflation over the forecast   horizon, but the starting levels of their forecast have been moving up as new data have come in  The   forecasted downward path seems dependent on a good deal of slack remaining in the economy   However, this increase in observed inflation may be evidence that there is less slack than we think    By ignoring the acceleration, we could end up in a situation of having to move rates up more rapidly   than we now expect, which could have a negative effect on future growth So this is certainly not   the time to pause in returning to more normal levels and removing policy accommodation                                    May 3, 2005 53 of 116  That said, I’ve become less certain about the particular speed at which the removal of   accommodation should proceed  If the inflation acceleration continues, a steeper path may be   indicated In the event that the softening of activity turns out to be persistent, a slower pace might be   more appropriate   At the last meeting I indicated that I believed the dispersion of likely rate paths going   forward was widening I dare say there was some consensus on this point at the meeting  Given the   recent data, I’d guess that not only is the dispersion around my own expected path wider still but that   there is likely to be more divergence in the Committee’s view of it  Thus, I believe it’s important for   us to craft our statement in a way that gives us considerable policy flexibility  It would also be   useful if we could convey some sense that there is less certainty about policy actions going forward   I will not get into the specifics of how to do this until the second roundtable discussion   However, I want to point out that sometimes saying less offers more transparency about the   Committee’s view than saying more  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5618,2005-05-03," I have just one question on the inflation swap quotes You talked a   little bit about them when you first introduced them in February  How good are those data? Is that   market deep?  Are the quotes indicative?  Are they real transaction quotes?  I’m just curious; it’s   intriguing stuff    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support your proposal as you laid it   out If my earlier comments had any direction, it was that I think there is some benefit to trying to                                 May 3, 2005 90 of 116  shorten up a little what is now conveyed in sentences 5 and 6 and to say a bit less But we’ve added   words rather than subtracting some  I understand the stability issue and I agree with it, but stability   doesn’t necessarily mean using exactly the same wording about areas that are in fact of concern to   us Having said that, where we are here on the proposed language is not significantly far from where   I would be in the best of all worlds So, I have no problem supporting it  "
5661,2005-08-09," David, I thought your discussion of the details of the Greenbook   forecast was very enlightening I want to congratulate you for the presentation  The   implications for inflation that flowed from that were clearly stated  The question I have is   whether the confidence band around your forecast for inflation has changed very much  Is it as   symmetric as it was?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As expected, the economic softening   we saw in the Third District in late spring was temporary, and economic conditions in the region   have strengthened since our last meeting  Retail sales in the District, which had fallen in May,   improved in June and early July  We saw gains in most categories, especially seasonal items,   apparel, and home furnishings  Like elsewhere in the nation, strong auto sales led the way  Our   dealers report that their inventories are now at desired levels, but many are concerned that sales   will ease later in the year unless incentives remain in force                   August 9, 2005 43 of 110  While retail sales have regained some strength over the past month, high gasoline prices   are beginning to impact consumer behavior  Our dealers report a shift away from SUVs—that’s   a plus as far as I’m concerned [laughter]—to vehicles with higher fuel economy  We’ve also had   reports that shoppers were visiting stores less frequently, consolidating shopping to economize   on gasoline expenditures   Manufacturing activity in the District also has improved since June, although it remains   more subdued than last year The index of general activity in our manufacturing survey rose to   96 in July, up from minus 22 in June  That’s quite a large swing in the index, and it is true that   the volatility of the index has increased this year  But a staff analysis indicates that the level of   volatility remains low by historical standards and that the index continues to be a good indicator   of changes in the manufacturing component of the industrial production index   The more forward-looking indicators in the survey, including the indexes on new orders   and shipments, also showed modest improvement in July  Activity in other sectors of the   District’s economy continued to expand in line with recent trends  Payroll employment growth   in the region accelerated to 15 percent in the second quarter, somewhat weaker than the nation’s   pace of 18 percent  Regional unemployment continues to trend down in most of the District’s   labor markets  The three-state unemployment rate fell from 48 percent in the first quarter to 45   percent in the second quarter  Only six of the District’s sixteen labor markets had unemployment   rates above 5 percent in June   The residential housing sector continues to show strength  Construction and home sales   were up on a year-over-year basis in the three-state region  House price appreciation continues   and is especially strong in New Jersey The downward trend in nonresidential construction   appears to have bottomed out, and we saw a strong increase in office construction activity in the                      August 9, 2005 44 of 110  first quarter, especially in center city Philadelphia  The demand for commercial space continues   to expand at a slow but steady pace in Philadelphia, but vacancy rates remain at nearly 17   percent   News on the regional inflation front has improved somewhat  Consumer price inflation   in the region is still running at a stronger pace than in the nation, due mainly to stronger   increases in owner equivalent rents  But it’s down from the pace we saw earlier in the year    Increases in wages and benefits in the Northeast have also moderated, although some of our   business contacts report that they are planning higher salary increases for next year  A   manufacturing survey indicates there has also been a moderation in industrial price pressure this   year Although the prices paid and prices received indexes remain elevated, much of the   significant increase in the indexes seen last year has been worked off   In summary, after a temporary lull in activity this spring, economic conditions in the   Third District have strengthened and the outlook is positive  Regional business contacts remain   upbeat and expect the region’s economy to continue to expand in line with the recent trend   Incoming data suggest that the national economy has also regained momentum since our   last meeting  The data reports received over the intermeeting period on most sectors have come   in better than expected At our previous meeting, I argued that it was premature to conclude that   the softer data we were getting at the time pointed to the beginning of a persistent downturn    Rather, I interpreted it as part of the fits and starts we usually see as the economy approaches   equilibrium  Similarly, I believe it is now premature to conclude that the faster growth in final   demand we saw in the second quarter will necessarily persist   However, I think we need to be particularly watchful at this point to ensure that we don’t   get behind the curve with monetary policy  That risk has increased, in my view, with the risk                August 9, 2005 45 of 110  that aggregate demand may be growing above potential at a time when little slack remains in   product and labor markets  So we must remain vigilant   It is true that the most recent monthly measures of inflation have moderated, and the   revised data on core PCE suggest that it has not accelerated this year Still, the levels of inflation   are significantly higher than previously measured, and the benchmark revisions in the GDP   report suggest that less capital deepening has occurred  The latter implies somewhat weaker   structural productivity growth going forward and more inflation pressures  In our current   economic situation, therefore, it is my view that we must continue on our path of removing   monetary policy accommodation   As for the announcement we use to explain our action, we should point out the   strengthening that has occurred in economic conditions since our last meeting and the fact that   the inflation pressures are indeed elevated Appropriately wording the rationale part of the   statement will ensure that we have substantive policy flexibility at future meetings, even if we   decide to make no change in the assessment-of-risk paragraph today  In fact, to me a better time   to change these paragraphs is when we think a significant change in policy action is called for  I   don’t think that time is today, but it may be getting closer  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5662,2005-08-09," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  The only thing I   would do to adjust the alternative B language is to think about removing the word “gradually”    If this is gradual, I don’t know what rapid is    Just to rejoin, I wouldn’t describe this as a “rapidly” improving   labor market but I would argue that it is improving—period  That’s probably a better   characterization of the last 12 months, the year to date, and the last three months  Numbers of   180,000 are indicative of a pretty good job market  That’s the only issue that I would address  I   wouldn’t object to this wording  I just don’t think it’s as descriptive as it might be     That’s fine    Fair enough  "
5706,2005-09-20," David, I want to talk a little bit about how the Board’s modeling   incorporates higher oil prices on output produced elsewhere and imported into the United States    Is it just through import prices alone?   The reason I ask is that we’ve spent a lot of time talking about the fact that higher energy   costs haven’t really impacted us as much as other countries  We’ve given two reasons for it    One is that we’re more energy-efficient  The second is that the output we produce is less energy-  intensive Presumably, our actual consumption hasn’t shifted as much as our production, which   means that more of the energy-intensive output is being produced externally and shipped into the   United States Now, that would presumably mean that energy-intensive goods would have   higher prices because of the global price of oil, and import prices would go up to a greater extent   than before because of the shift in mix  Yet the forecast has import prices falling  How does that   all work its way through?  What’s that dynamic?     Maybe we’ll get two answers!                         September 20, 2005 31 of 117   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Third District economy continues   to expand at a moderate pace  Consumer spending for general merchandise has edged up    Retailers report that back-to-school shopping got off to a slow start in August, but attributed it to   exceptionally warm weather, which hindered the sale of fall merchandise  Auto sales have been   brisk, with dealers in the region reporting continuing high rates of sales in August, except for   large SUVs Employment is rising steadily in the region, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than   in the nation  While the regional unemployment rate ticked up in July from its second-quarter   level, it remains lower than the national rate   Housing markets remained strong in the District, with sales continuing at a high rate    Price appreciation continues at a steady pace, but several of our contacts noted that higher-priced   homes appear to be taking longer to sell now than earlier this year  The nonresidential market   continues to improve, with construction contracts up and office leasing active  The demand for   commercial space continues to expand at a slow but steady pace in Philadelphia  Although   vacancy rates remain high, we have seen positive net absorption of office space for seven   consecutive quarters Rental rates remain steady   Recent manufacturing activity in the District has been softer than we saw earlier this   year The index of general activity in the manufacturing survey rebounded in August but fell   again in September to a positive 22, indicating virtually flat manufacturing activity in the                September 20, 2005 42 of 117  District this month The downward trend in our index since the beginning of the year is echoed   by a number of the regional manufacturing indexes as well as the national purchasing managers’   index There was also a significant drop in the respondents’ expectations about future activity    There were still more firms expecting an increase in activity over the next six months than   expecting a decline, but the percentage of respondents expecting a decline doubled in September    I should point out, however, that the survey was taken in the days early after the Katrina event,   and that likely had something to do with the large drop  We’ll have to look forward to the next   couple of months   Perhaps the most notable and troubling information from our latest survey is the   significant increase in price indexes  The prices paid index showed its strongest increase since   1973 and is at its highest level since January  The index for prices received also moved higher   Expectations about future prices were also considerably higher this month   Concerns about inflation are not limited to our manufacturers  While the economic   impact of the hurricane has been slight in our District—and our business contacts expect further   improvement in our regional economy—the loss of petroleum products and production in the   facilities in the Gulf of Mexico has prompted a sharp rise in inflation concerns in many of our   firms   Turning to the national outlook, as the Greenbook noted, incoming data on the national   economy pre-Katrina indicated that the expansion was continuing on a solid footing, with GDP   growth slightly higher than potential Labor markets continued to improve, with little or no slack   remaining  Consumers continued to spend at a good pace despite elevated oil and gasoline                   September 20, 2005 43 of 117  prices While there was some softening in the most recent orders and shipments data, this   reflected the usual month-to-month volatility, and business spending remained healthy   Higher energy prices were showing through to headline inflation, but so far had little   impact on core inflation  If Katrina hadn’t happened, it is my view that a decision to continue   our strategy to remove monetary policy accommodation would have been relatively easy  But   Katrina did happen The hurricane is a human tragedy, as was noted, and it has changed the   near-term outlook for the economy    I commend the Greenbook staff for the careful discussion and analysis of the potential   effects on both growth and inflation I acknowledge that there is a wider band of uncertainty   around the forecasts than there had been  However, as a baseline forecast, I think the Greenbook   has it largely right  Certainly, Katrina will have a substantial impact on the Gulf of Mexico’s   regional economy for many months to come  It also has a potentially wider national scope than   other natural disasters  Because of the disruption in the energy and shipping sectors, it will have   ramifications for the rest of the economy   The destruction of the physical wealth and oil infrastructure and the disruption in   economic activity will temporarily reduce the growth of the national economy and add to   inflation over the near term Monthly data over the next couple of months are going to be   weaker than we’d like to see, and our headline inflation numbers are going to be higher than we   would like But these effects are likely temporary  The cleanup has already begun, as was   noted, and rebuilding efforts funded by public and private spending will add to baseline growth   in the fourth quarter and into next year                            September 20, 2005 44 of 117  As the energy infrastructure is rebuilt and the energy markets stabilize, much of the run-  up of inflation should reverse as well Of course, a longer-run negative impact is not out of the   realm of possibility, but I think we will see a reversal of the sharp run-up in oil and gasoline   prices after the hurricane season That, along with the good economic prospects, the good   progress going forward to get the oil and refinery capacity back on line, and the improvement in   governmental response after a troublesome beginning will all help mitigate these longer-run   impacts   The relevant policy options for us to consider at this point are whether to continue   removing policy accommodation or to take a pause  I would argue that the prudent course of   action today is to remain on our previous path, ie, to continue to move rates up gradually    There are ample fundamental reasons for such a policy action  “We are at a whisker from   potential output,” to quote a recent comment by President Yellen  I like that comment—“a   whisker” [Laughter]   And I continue to be concerned about inflationary pressures  The higher energy prices   we saw even before Katrina add to the concern And we now have a significant increase in the   amount of fiscal stimulus in the pipeline, as was discussed, which has the potential to keep   pressure on inflation elevated for some time, even after energy price increases subside  I would   also note the apparent increase in near-term inflation expectations  The recently released   University of Michigan Survey, discussed earlier and in our briefing documents, shows a fairly   hefty increase in both short- and medium-term expectations of inflation—a fact worthy of our   attention                      September 20, 2005 45 of 117  Finally, I believe that continuing to reduce policy accommodation would be the best way   to underscore to both the markets and the public our belief that Katrina will not change the   underlying economic fundamentals and that the negative impact on growth will be temporary    Markets generally expect a rate increase today, so I believe that move would not be disruptive   By contrast, pausing today will do little to improve the temporary effects on growth of   Katrina, which is largely a supply shock And if we do pause today on the grounds that Katrina   has made the short-run economic outlook uncertain, I think it will be very difficult for us to   resume raising rates in the short term  Economic data coming in over the next couple of months   on production, employment, and consumer spending are likely to be weak because of hurricane   effects Trying to craft a statement to explain why we are raising rates in the midst of weak data,   after pausing now, would be a daunting task  So if we pause today, I think we have to consider   that we will be on hold for a while, perhaps even as long as to the beginning of next year  In my   mind, this poses an unacceptable risk that we will find ourselves behind the curve  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
5707,2005-09-20, I support your recommendation both in terms of the rate movement   and the statement  
5751,2005-11-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Third District’s economy continues to   expand, with growth moderating toward its potential pace  After accelerating in the second quarter,   employment growth in the region decelerated in the third quarter back toward its first-quarter pace    But unemployment rates remained steady for the three-state region and remained lower than the   national average                                           November 1, 2005 50 of 114  Consumer spending for general merchandise has held steady  There is some anecdotal   evidence that consumers are limiting discretionary spending due to higher energy costs  And there   is some concern among retailers that fourth-quarter sales may come in below plan because of   subdued consumer sentiment and higher winter heating bills   Construction continues to be a strong sector for our regional economy  Housing construction   and sales remain strong in the District, and nonresidential construction has been on an improving   trend since the beginning of the year—with the usual month-to-month volatility    Regional manufacturing activity accelerated in October  The index of general activity in our   manufacturing survey rebounded sharply from 22 in September to 173 in October  The other   forward-looking indices in the survey, including those for new orders and shipments, also showed a   nice bounce, as did the index of future activity  Perhaps the improvement in expectations should   have been expected, since our September survey was taken in the early days after the Katrina event    Indeed, in response to special questions, half of our firms reported that they had experienced some   change in demand or problems related to the Gulf Coast hurricanes  The changes in demand, some   positive and some negative, were generally slight  Problems relating to obtaining energy and other   materials, as well as transportation problems, were characterized as being somewhat more   significant  Despite these problems, our firms did experience an increase in activity last month   Again, the most troubling aspect of our latest survey is the significant increase in price indices    The prices paid index rose sharply in October for the second consecutive month and is at its highest   level since 1980  The prices received index also jumped last month, suggesting that some of the   higher-priced inputs are being passed on to consumers  The core PCE and core CPI share a   correlation with our prices received index of about 06  While most of this correlation is driven by                               November 1, 2005 51 of 114  the high-inflation period of the late 1970s and early 1980s, I think these early indications of possible   pass-through bear watching   In my view, the national economy seems to be evolving along the lines we had expected at our   last meeting  The economy appears to have weathered the hurricane in reasonably good shape    And, abstracting from those hurricane effects, the economy has retained a good bit of positive   momentum  Of course, uncertainty remains about the magnitude of the hurricane effects, so there’s   a wider band of uncertainty around the economic outlook than there was pre-hurricane  On the   negative side, higher winter heating bills could result in significantly slower consumer demand  But   on the positive side, next year’s rebuilding activity could result in a bigger boost to activity than   expected The growth risks seem to be balanced, and these hurricane effects are most likely to be   temporary   The bigger risk, in my view, is on the inflation side  Core inflation remains contained at this   point, and empirical studies suggest energy price pass-through to the core has typically been small    Where we’ve gotten into trouble during the earlier energy price shocks is when we’ve let inflation   expectations get away from us  Indeed, the only departure between headline inflation and core CPI   inflation as large as the current one occurred during past energy price shocks  In those cases,   accommodative monetary policy resulted in rapid increases in core inflation   We cannot allow inflation expectations to become unanchored, and I don’t believe we will    As the energy infrastructure is rebuilt and energy markets stabilize, much of the run-up in headline   inflation should reverse itself, as many people have suggested  This will help keep inflation and   inflation expectations contained  We’ve already seen a decline in crude oil and gasoline prices  The   latter is particularly welcome, as it could buoy consumer sentiment as we head toward the buying   season                                  November 1, 2005 52 of 114  Nonetheless, in my view, inflation pressures remain elevated  So the prudent course of action   today is to continue to gradually move rates up nearer to the range of the equilibrium real rate  As   we near that range, our language is going to have to evolve, as a number of us have indicated  I   don’t think today is the day for a major change in language, but I would welcome the discussion that   many have suggested we need to have  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5752,2005-11-01,"  I support your recommendations  Just to continue on this topic, I think   we all have to be careful, number one, to read what’s in the minutes and, number two, to think about   what we’re going to say when we’re asked about the minutes and what it is the minutes are   communicating  We know there’s going to be a rash of questions about what it means  And I think                                              November 1, 2005 95 of 114  we just have to be prepared for what we as individuals are going to say to the press when they ask   about what is that ongoing conversation     All I’m pointing out is that the press is going to say, “You talked about   changing  What do you mean by that?”  I think we all just have to be prepared to recognize that   that’s an inevitable part of mentioning in the minutes ongoing discussions about change  Perhaps   it’s obvious to all, but it will be a new area of inquiry by the press, and we have to recognize that     I have a question  I think you read the assessment of risk without the   word “remaining” in it  Maybe I misunderstood what you read     Which one  are we voting on—with remaining or without remaining?                November 1, 2005 102 of 114  SEVERAL Without remaining     I just wanted  to make sure  I got confused about what we were looking   at in that line  That’s fine  My vote stands  "
5795,2005-12-13,"  David, could you give us a risk assessment on your consumer spending   forecast?  In 2006 and 2007, you have consumer spending growth of 3½ percent, while the housing   market cools and savings are accumulating  Would you just comment on how comfortable you are                            December 13, 2005 18 of 100  with that forecast?  You made reference to it in the formal comments, but I wonder if you are quite   comfortable with the forecast or a little uncertain about it    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been little change in Third   District economic conditions since our last meeting  The regional economy continues to expand at its   potential pace, which is somewhat lower than in other parts of the country  Payroll employment is   increasing steadily in our three states, and the tri-state unemployment rate fell to 43 percent in   October, which is its lowest level since May of 2001   Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace  The index of   general activity in our manufacturing survey eased slightly to 115 in November from 173 in October    Although there has been some month-to-month volatility in the index this year, it has generally been   near the average that was recorded in the 1990s expansion   Retailers report a slightly better sales figure for October and November compared to the same   period a year ago  In general, sales of luxury goods and consumer electronics continue to expand   more strongly than other lines of merchandise, and discount stores had better results than mid-priced   department and specialty stores    While construction continues to be a strong sector in our region, we are beginning to see early   signs of moderation in the housing market  These signs do not point to a sharp drop, only a slight   softening of demand  As elsewhere, permits have declined and real estate agents reported slower   sales in October and November  Some agents also noted that the number of existing homes on the   market has risen and that the numbers of offers per house and above-asking-price bids have declined    There was also a slight easing in price appreciation in each of the three states in the third quarter, and   this moderation appears to be continuing in the fourth quarter   We continue to see signs of higher prices for industrial goods in our region  There was a   sharp increase in the price indices in our manufacturing survey in October  This eased only slightly in   November and remains near a high point during this expansion  Firms also expect prices to remain                                    December 13, 2005 44 of 100  elevated  The future price indices are high relative to most readings during the expansion, and the   results of a special survey question indicate that cost increases are widely anticipated for all inputs   next year  These expectations are widespread across firms—and more widespread than during the   summer period when we asked the same question  Indeed, while our business contacts expect   continued moderate expansion in business activity, rising prices beyond those in energy have become   more of a concern for firms in our District   Turning to the national economy, I note that the Greenbook forecast has been revised to show   more underlying strength in the third and fourth quarters compared to last time  It’s more consistent   with my own view on the national economy  Incoming data over the intermeeting period suggest that   the economy retained a good deal of upward momentum  The third-quarter preliminary GDP figures   showed broad-based strength in consumption and fixed investment growth, with strong productivity   gains Despite the dislocation from Hurricane Katrina, we have sturdy underlying job growth and a   low unemployment rate  Consumer confidence has partially recovered from post-hurricane lows, and   consumer spending outside autos continues to advance at a moderate pace  Business spending has   also strengthened since the summer, and manufacturing productivity and business investment   continue to advance  In my mind, the risks to growth are slightly on the upside, as I read the data as   supporting continued underlying strength   The official inflation numbers and readings on inflation expectations have been somewhat   reassuring over the intermeeting period  To date, we’ve seen little pass-through, as a number of   people have noted, of higher energy prices into core inflation, and we’ve also seen some decline in   energy prices  In addition, both near-term and long-term inflation expectations have declined a bit   This news is clearly favorable to the inflation outlook  However, it seems somewhat at odds with   what we’re hearing from our business contacts  They indicate that they’re facing higher input prices                                         December 13, 2005 45 of 100  and have recently found it somewhat easier to raise their own prices in the current environment of   quite strong demand  This view has also been supported by our own and other manufacturing   surveys So I remain concerned about inflationary pressures, and I believe that an uptick in inflation   is, indeed, a risk     Therefore, a prudent course of action today, in my opinion, is to continue to gradually move   rates up Whether such a move is closing in on the equilibrium real rate from below or whether such a   move will put the real funds rate above the equilibrium value or place it in the range of uncertainty   around the long-run value is an interesting question  So is how we will explain what we are going to   do But I’ll defer my views on these issues until the second part of our discussion  Suffice it to say I   look forward to that  [Laughter]  "
5796,2005-12-13,"  Mr Chairman, I support the proposal to raise the fed funds rate 25 basis   points  As to the language itself, I supported the first change we had to alternative B  Since that time,   we’ve played around, if you will, with some of the wording, and I worry a little about wordsmanship   by 19 people over time  I’m not sure how stable that is  So, rather than being one of the 19, I’m very   happy with the language as it stands   On the issue of “measured,” I came into this Committee meeting somewhat reluctant to retain   that word in the statement I was taken by your explanation of the likely market reaction and, on   further thought, I support retaining that word as well  So I’m quite happy with where we are  "
5842,2006-01-31,"  I wanted to go to the housing issue  In the projection in the   Greenbook, as I understand it, you’ve got housing prices going up at about a 5½ percent rate as   compared with last year’s number, which I think is 12 percent  We’ve been looking at the   sensitivity of what happens to our GDP growth rate in ’06 and ’07 to the extent that housing prices   stay flat  Our numbers suggest that a flat housing price associated with the decline in residential   investment would shave about ½ percentage point off GDP in ’06 and about 06 or 07 if you add   the consumption effects  Does that sound like a reasonable sensitivity to you?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Consistent with the national economy,   overall activity in the Third District slowed somewhat more than expected in the fourth quarter    Despite this slowing, the general view in my District is that our regional economy is likely to   expand at a moderate pace in 2006     Payroll employment continues to expand in our three states, but at a more moderate pace   than we saw in the first half of 2005  Overall, market conditions remain firm  The three-state   unemployment rate ended up at 48 percent, slightly lower than the national rate  Regional   manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace  The index of general activity in our   manufacturing survey declined to plus 33 in January, its lowest level in seven months  But the   indexes of shipments, new orders, and employment were all up  This divergence is unusual    Typically, they move together  When they do diverge, I tend to put more weight on the shipments   and new orders indexes, as these reflect the respondents’ own firms rather than the opinions about   general economic conditions  In addition, the fact that our firms have not yet changed their capital   spending plans for 2006 suggests that their outlook remains positive   Retail sales in our District are rising moderately  Retailers still express concern about the   potential depressing effect of higher gasoline and heating costs on consumer purchases in 2006    Our auto dealers have not fared as well  In fact, our District has seen a decline in automobile sales    January 31, 2006 34 of 106    Growth in construction is one of the question marks in the 2006 outlook  In our District,   nonresidential construction continues to improve  In fact, the office market absorption rate is rising   in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and office vacancy is declining in both the city and the   suburbs  By contrast, over the past month or so, we have continued to receive anecdotal reports that   a slowdown in residential construction may be at hand  Real estate contacts report that house-price   appreciation has slowed or even ceased, and there has been an increase in inventories  These signs,   however, seem to point to a softening of activity, not to a sharp drop   We have received some welcome indication of a moderation in price pressures in the   District  Our survey measures of prices received and prices paid were down in January and well   below their October peaks  Expected price increases also declined sharply  The only caveat I   would put on that statement is that the survey was taken before the most recent run-up in energy   prices   Turning to the nation, the advance fourth-quarter GDP report was quite a bit weaker than we   were all expecting  That said, we, too, think it’s too soon to conclude that the weakness seen in the   fourth quarter is more than a temporary soft patch  Our forecast for GDP over the next two years is   similar to that of the original Greenbook that we received this month  We expect growth to be on   average around 3½ percent, near potential  We have a somewhat smoother path than the Greenbook   since we expect the boost in activity from the rebuilding effort in the hurricane-afflicted areas to be   more spread out than front-loaded   We also see somewhat stronger employment growth next year than the Greenbook because   we see somewhat stronger output growth in 2007  We project nonfarm payrolls to rise at an average   of 160,000 a month this year, stronger in the first half as people displaced by hurricanes continue to   return to work  We project an average increase in payrolls of about 150,000 per month next year    January 31, 2006 35 of 106    The Greenbook employment projection is similar to ours in 2006, but the Board staff sees a   deceleration next year to an average of about 100,000, as was pointed out in the presentation    However, our unemployment rate forecasts are similar, about 5 percent, because we see somewhat   higher labor force participation   We anticipate core PCE to rise a bit less than 2 percent in 2006 and then to accelerate to   2 percent in 2007, reflecting a modest acceleration in unit labor costs  In contrast, the Greenbook   sees a slight deceleration in core inflation over the forecast period   Our forecast is predicated on being near the end of the tightening cycle  Exactly where we   stop is yet to be determined; the data will tell the Committee  But all of these data suggest that we   are closing in and we are close to being done  For this meeting, I think it’s prudent for us to do what   the market expects and make another move of 25 basis points  But I think we also want to be in a   position to pause if that is appropriate, given the incoming economic data   Of course, I will not be here for that interesting discussion  [Laughter]  As you know, this is   the last FOMC meeting that I will be attending as President of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve   Bank  I am honored to have had the opportunity to lead that institution  Of all the experiences   during my six years of service at the Fed, none was more challenging and more rewarding than   serving on this Committee  I have enjoyed and learned from the first-rate staff of the Reserve   Banks and the Board of Governors  I feel privileged to have served at a remarkable point in   economic history  In my tenure, we’ve gone through a recession and a recovery, seen concerns shift   from disinflation to inflation, moved to a record low funds rate, and then returned it to more-normal   levels  And all of this was accompanied by an unprecedented degree of transparency in our policy   discussions  I have also been inspired by the leadership shown by our Chairman, I may add, in   forging a consensus from diverse opinions in periods of uncertainty and in fostering a collegial   January 31, 2006 36 of 106    atmosphere among us  I want to thank you all for an important part you’ve played in making my   service at the Fed a rewarding experience  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5843,2006-01-31,"  I support the recommendation in terms of the 25 basis points and also   the wording  I actually like “may” rather than “may well”  I think the data will in all likelihood be   January 31, 2006 72 of 106    a little stronger, which will buy us that “may” to “may well” as time evolves, but not necessarily  I   like the ordering as is presented here  So this fits very well into my view of where we should be    On the last point, I’d like to compliment Vince for predicting that he will yet again be back talking   about it  [Laughter]  I think that’s the right path  I think bringing it to everybody’s attention is a   good thing  But your third solution, which is somewhere in between, is actually the right answer    How one fosters a consensus around that is tricky, and I’m glad I don’t have to do it  "
