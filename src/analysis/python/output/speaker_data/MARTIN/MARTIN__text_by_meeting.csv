2142,1982-03-29,MARTIN, A much better tennis player! 
2169,1982-05-18,MARTIN," And, of course, if we only support the market as it drops, we don't bail out a small margin operator that way We simply prevent the market from discontinuity  When you have six principal dealers and several commercial banks and they're all talking back and forth with their lawyers and their accountants, it's out The question is How much of it is out and what is the reaction of the market? There are no secrets in this business  When Peter says small, he means relative to $2-1/2 billion!  But if there are bankruptcy proceedings, of course, that begins to freeze assets  Where you have one, you have four    5/18/82  He was short; he was long You know how these operations are; they are all over the market These things are always as complicated as the ingenuity of man and woman can make them  Let's proceed with the regular agenda The first item is the approval of the minutes of actions taken at the meeting on March 29, 1930--I mean March 29-30, 1982 meeting    5/18/82  I have to remind you that Freud is out of fashion now You have to use somebody else! It has been moved and seconded and all are in favor All right The second item is the report on the examination of the System Open Market Account Are Clyde [Farnsworth] and the others here? Just Dave Robinson? All right Is there any discussion or are there any questions of the operations staff?  Further discussion? Do we need a formal action?  All right, if there are no objections, we'll proceed to item three Gretchen [Greene] is here to report on foreign currency operations since the March meeting Gretchen  Thank you, Gretchen Discussion?  Governor Partee, did you have further comments?  Gretchen, a $2 billion credit would take care of the Mexicans for how long? How many weeks?  That's very politely put  And I think here we're defining austerity as halting construction on four office buildings  Further discussion? Thank you, Gretchen Peter Sternlight is still working on the gathering of information with regard to the situation involving Drysdale Government Securities and its affiliates, and creditor banks and brokerage houses in New York Why don't we move to Jim Kichline, who is here, and others for the report on the economic situation Jim  Thank you, Jim Ed  Thanks, Ed Mr Timlen  And that's going too far! President Black  It will come roaring back  Thank you, Bob President Ford  Governor Gramley  Thank you, Lyle President Keehn  I think both Ed's and Lyle's comments with regard to the so-called ""out years"" represent a new note in our discussions I can't speak for the March meeting, but there is a different tone, isn't there? There's a different element that we're considering President Balles  You're the rebuttal, John!  Thank you, John President Roos  Thank you, Larry We at last had a rebuttal of some kind  Governor Rice  Thank you, Emmett Comments? Are you commenting on Emmett's remarks or making a separate statement  SPEAKER(?) No, a separate statement  Would you mind if we went to President Guffey first? President Guffey  Thank you, Roger Governor Wallich  Thank you Bob Boykin  At a risk, I've been desperate to close on a positive note for the coffee break And if two or three of my colleagues will indulge me in this, let us adjourn on that 17 percent upbeat note  [Coffee break]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Chairman has asked me to pass on a comment He will be joining us in a few minutes so that we can hear from Peter and Steve, who are still involved in the Drysdale meeting next door [in the Chairman's office] He asked me to indicate to you, knowing that you might want to change airline reservations or whatever, that it looked to him as though it would be necessary to reconvene the FOMC after lunch So, I'm passing that on to you from their meeting We have a number of people who have comments to make If the Chairman is back by then, we'll hope to hear from our market-related colleagues Let me recognize first Governor Partee  Governor Rice  -31-    5/18/82  Thank you, Mr Timlen  Governor Partee  Yes sir  Thank you, Mr Chairman I think we have to be aware that there are limits to the impact we are going to make on this recession at this time with ""A"" or ""B"" or whatever set of targets we choose We must be careful to keep in mind that in addition to a recession, the recovery from which is highly complicated by the level of interest rates, we are also undergoing in this country several structural changes in the overall national economic base And those structural changes are not entirely responsive to monetary policy It is obvious that we are in the process of moving from a heavy industry, smoke stack, economy to a service economy We're well along that path The difficulty of utilizing a more liberal monetary policy to bring us more strongly out of this recession is involved in that Much of what we've read in the Redbook, District by District, has been about the changes occasioned by primary employment contraction And that, of course, produces a multiplied effect on the economic base as secondary employment is hit by that I submit to you that until our structural changes are farther along in that economic base we will have a weak recovery and that our policies here will have only a limited impact  Furthermore, we face changes in the financial structure in this country of which we all are acutely aware Those changes are resistant to monetary policy in the sense that the departure of the life insurance companies and the other long-term investors from the financing of industrial plants, industrial parks, and office buildings --their abandonment, if you will, of the debt side of that kind of growth in private domestic investment--is not going to be turned around by what we do here Those investors are going to equity participations, and in many cases that means that the factory building won't be built and the computer facility won't be installed and the office building will not be constructed, and that's not going to turn around That is a structural change that has to work its way through until there are additional long-term sources of funds to finance business investment The same comment applies to housing and housing- related investment--I'm stretching that term a little The thrift institutions are not going to recover ""A"" or ""B"" is not going to affect their financial health materially Lower interest rates will help, but we can't get interest rates low enough, long enough, to bring the thrift institutions back as the primary financers of housing That is not going to occur So, those are some of the structural changes  There has been another structural change--I use words any way I like when I have the podium, and I may be cut off any second here for that remark--and it is in federal fiscal policy It is not entirely the province of one political party The old days when a $5 or $10 billion dollar appropriation would have bounced through the  -36-    5/18/82  Congress to revive housing are behind us When a $1 billion-a-year program is called generous in terms of a level of housing output of 1 million units, you know we have a changed structure there I don't believe this Administration or its successors will get back into the bail-out of the Chryslers and the Lockheeds and so forth So, ready federal spending in multi-billion dollar amounts is another structural change, and that has implications with regard to the recovery  I note--maybe I was too many years in the supervision of financial institutions--that I am very sensitive to the upcoming financial crisis that we will have, and I know many of you share this view Drysdale is just one; there are going to be a number of others There are thrift institutions that are greatly overextended--and they are multi-billion institutions and they are heavily dependent on large CDs They are buying all the junk assets they can find because of the fees and the yields on those, which are coming down; they will fail They may get through this interest cycle but they won't get through the next one So, from time to time we're going to have to inject reserves From time to time, or over and over again I should say, we're going to have to play the lender-of-last-resort role; and that is going to persist for some years I'm not sure that it will be the Penn Central [situation] all over I don't know that history repeats itself that way I think the recent bulges in the reserves that we provided and in the various measures of the money supply won't go away because there's going to be another wave behind that first wave I don't believe that the markets believe us entirely I think we have a great deal more credibility than we used to have, but don't tell me that part of the disbelief is not reflected in the level of interest rates I feel there is still disbelief and it is so reflected Of course, the awareness of how the Congress works is reflected in financial markets The perfectly normal, usual, ordinary historical process in the way Congress grinds along and finally produces a budget hasn't helped us any in the interest rate situation I don't put much weight to polling results, but there was a recent poll of 1200 families around the country who were asked if they believed that inflation has come down recently About a quarter of them said yes, we believe inflation has come down recently and about 75 percent of them said no; and some of them said it has gone up! So, do they believe us? Do they believe in the effectiveness of our inflationary policy? No  It is those considerations that get me over to ""B,"" not ""A"" Absent the structural changes, absent the disbelief, absent the necessity for us to be the lender of last resort, I'd go for ""A,"" frankly, because our credibility is high enough and we've been able to go from numbers of $49 billion in the M1 weekly changes and have gotten through that without the markets being that disturbed I'm trying not to repeat what my colleagues here have said because they so well covered the other aspects of the economy and the price situation and the growth in the aggregates I'm just trying to add a particular view here Given the situation as I see it, I would go to ""B,"" but I would hope that with the excellent job done by our colleagues at the Desk--and here I'm second guessing the Desk, if I may put it that way --that if the numbers came in a little high, they would be left a little high I hope it would be ""B"" but an easy ""B"" rather than a rigid conformance to these numbers, Mr Chairman  Let's go to 10 percent "
2196,1982-06-30,MARTIN," So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Secret ballot  I would join those of us around the table who have pointed out the downside risks when we consider a consumer-led recovery I think we are all aware that the consumer is in a very different frame of mind and financial frame of reference than he was previously It's all very well to indicate the improvement in the liquid assets of consumers as a group; but in terms of consumer demand for durables, we're likely to witness in the latter months of this year and in 1983 the factor that Governor Partee brought out, which can be built on a little When we talk about residential building and the financing thereof, I would take no exception to his comment But when we think about the mass of consumers--those tens of millions of consumers who already have mortgages and trust deeds, many of whom for some years have been in the habit of refinancing those residential mortgages and pumping that money into durables not to mention trips to Europe and kids going to private schools and a lot of other good things--those same people are witnessing the cocktail party conversation now about how much so-and-so lost when he was transferred to Boston or whatever And they are finding that that source of funds has definitely dried up In fact, there are others within that group of consumers who are having difficulties now meeting the [higher-cost] refinancing that is being imposed upon them And as that kind of conversation wafts its way through suburbia, not to mention exurbia,  -16-    6/30-7/1/82  the tendency is to build up those good old precautionary balances and to have a liquidity preference that is a bit different from what it was when one could go and get $15,000 or $25,000 on the residential mortgage I'm not so sure that those precautionary balances are going to be translated into spending and that we can count on the projected changes in velocity  Indeed, as the shocks that Lyle and others mentioned here occur--and we don't need to attach a probability to failures of major corporations and failures of major financial institutions in the country because I think those failures are a certainty and will be exaggerated by the media--the effect on the consumer of these shocks is going to be significant Talk about a multiplier! This also says to me that there are implications not only with regard to precautionary balances held by consumers on the one hand and business firms possibly on the other, but it has implications for the kind of financial climate that we maintain--a liquidity climate or availability climate, if you will--for the economy in general given that individual crises will be magnified at a time when consumer psychology and attitude are important And it seems to me for us to skate too closely to constraint or to usual or historical norms would be very dangerous  So, to the extent we can do so without upsetting the markets, I lean in the direction of liberality In terms of the question of overshooting versus raising the targets, I think we have to realize-- again thinking in terms of what the consumer understands and what he does not understand--that there have been improvements in the control of inflation The consumer does not understand the [technical] matters; if you start talking to him about velocity, he becomes very glassy-eyed I think the consumer can understand that if we raise the targets, we may be liberalizing [policy], and he may feel that's a bad thing I don't think he will ever understand our explanations, however well expressed by anybody--excuse me, Chairman--about the overshooting phenomenon I'd lament the raising of targets; that would communicate something we don't want to communicate But I think we can explicate the overshooting process on and on and have good reasons and understand that it is more acceptable I hate to see us locking ourselves into what we should call bracketmania or target madness so that we raise the targets and then say okay we raised them, now [we have to] make them I hate to see us overstress the targeting as such and would rather see us have the flexibility of saying sure we're over, or yes we're under, and here are the reasons  I'll reserve on that Yes  Developing countries like the United Kingdom?  I think we should approve it based on the record of other countries with a resource base like Mexico who have finally gone kicking and screaming or however to the IMF and proceeded within certain constraints  They'll have to  Yes  Steve, the Chairman mentioned its applicability this year and last year How about some of the other years?  How about the preceding year?  How about 1980 or 1979?  Mr Chairman, I do not have my calculator and I have no doubt that I would fail to operate it if I had it, so I will not get into the billion dollar question I would be in favor of keeping the [current] targets for the balance of 1982 I would be in favor of a relatively passive form of implementation of our policy so that if we miss the upper limit of the target by September--in due deference to my colleague, President Black--I would not be concerned, provided we went along the course suggested by Governor Teeters yesterday One of her suggestions yesterday was to be more explicit with regard to our attitude of tolerance so that we remove from the markets fears and premonitions or the expectation that we will be coming on hard to bring the [monetary growth] numbers down, which will produce certain interest rate impacts The reasons for my position with regard to the upper limit of the target came out, as was obvious to all of us, in the discussion yesterday It is the downside risk; it is the unusually high degree of uncertainty; it is the peril that corporations and financial institutions confront; it is the great uncertainty of the international situation added to all of these And as the Chairman has indicated, it will be 6 months or 8 months or X months before the Congress begins to resolve a $60 to $70 billion swing between estimates of the deficit  I view ranges and targets as tools My own experience in business and government has been that you use budgets and targets and ranges and brackets in your work And in the real world, either in government or outside it, those targets, brackets, ranges, objectives, and goals are usually missed by whatever organization it is The mature individual understands that these are tools and not the sacred writ Now, I don't have any great insight as to whether velocity will go up enough or not enough Frankly, I don't believe anybody else has That is again a reason for my thesis of tolerance of results relative to goals and targets I think we should keep our targets for the balance of '82 at this time and we should operate in a more explicit, but relatively passive, mode for the upcoming period  I think a 46 percent increase [in M1] is not enough I'm not sure that a 5-1/2 percent increase, as in alternative A, is enough It might be enough if indeed July has a certain configuration So I would go for alternative A, but I'd be quite tolerant if alternative A were exceeded  In the short run  This is not the same as pre-October '79 What we did after October '79 was to set federal funds rate limits, which for a while we regarded as fairly firm, and we said we'd have a special meeting if the funds rate exceeded a certain limit It seems to me that is what we're saying, in effect, now except that we're saying it a little more firmly on the up side  We can talk about the bulges we have already been tolerant of  Or set the upper limit at 5-1/2 percent  I agree Why should we limit ourselves to those technical factors? Why limit ourselves in the actions that we may have to take? What is the point of boxing ourselves in?  Only six?  Seasonally adjusted  SPEAKER(?) It's unseasonally adjusted  I would support Mr Ford on the basis that it's practical to have a little slack in operating and there is no sacred writ about it A rate of 15-1/8 or 15-1/32 percent will not cause the world to spin on its axis in a different direction  How about 15-1/32?  Not if we indicate that we'll tolerate some bulge  -74-    6/30-7/1/82  You're proposing 10 to 16 percent?  I think consulting if it's over 15 percent softens the rigidity, and I would go along with it  I would also for the same reason  If we tell them what the tolerance is, we have a quasi bracket  But isn't it true that the very position that the Mitterand government is now taking is a substantial change from the first period of their operation? At least at the verbal level it's a reversal, isn't it?  But considering the rhetoric in the political campaign, it's quite a step  -87-    6/30-7/1/82  Well, I certainly wouldn't use the term austerity with regard to any of this Three percent of the GNP is hardly austerity, but still it's an admission to constraints on the left wing and that's--  ""Might"" be appropriate?  Do we endorse the first step that they've taken separately? At least there is a resolution, however dubious We have to put some positive--  Would you rather have a phony resolution or no resolution?  -99-    6/30-7/1/82 "
2224,1982-07-15,MARTIN," I think that argues against our maintaining a position that we need flexibility  I would certainly come in, along with Tony and others, on the side of talking about a continuance of the ranges Several of us have referred to the market If we wish to be a little more literal and a bit short termed and realistic, the market people are now talking about illiquidity; they're talking about what bank is going to fail next; they're talking about surprises from the corporate sector The market has an unusual degree of uncertainty and indeed fear right now For us to drop the top of the range would indicate, I believe, to many of these individuals and firms and banks and overseas holders of dollars that we are not taking seriously the downside risk    7/15/82  inherent in an unstable, illiquid market and set of corporations I think that would be the wrong signal to send to them now  Even more than they are today!  Mr St Germain, I believe you meant to say! "
2243,1982-08-24,MARTIN," The $1 billion assumes all the banks hold still? No small banks have to be paid off?  Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela for example?    8/24/82  The month after they pass the first big change in the immigration statute in 30 years or whatever it is!  For 70 million people, you know!  Long live ambiguity!  Moved  I think the arguments for alternative A are compelling I note that the staff in its discussion of its projections, particularly for the third quarter, indicated that there is some uneasiness attached to the 7-1/2 percent nominal GNP number We have question marks on the domestic investment projection, on the residential structures projection, and on auto sales on the down side That has implications as to which of the two alternatives [to choose] I would agree that the two alternatives are rather narrow in their band The weaknesses that we have been noting both in the Redbook and in our own discussions here today affect expectations and, therefore, I believe the actions taken by us and noted in the markets will have a different interpretation from what they would have had a short time ago I think market participants are, as we are, much more aware of the illiquidity of major corporations and of the question marks over the banking system, as well as the general weakness structurally of the world economy for that matter Therefore, I believe we have a little more action space, perhaps, than we've had before Plus, I will reiterate the comment I made at the last FOMC meeting It is that we have a responsibility for the stability of the banking system, which we are meeting Admittedly, there has been a comment or two from the political side with regard to the way to do that But given this narrow set of alternatives, I would go toward ""A"" rather than ""B,"" in part to preserve the climate in the markets that has provided  -22-    8/24/82  a little more action space Therefore, for the borrowings I would lean toward a $350 million number, a rather larger number with a pretty large standard deviation around that We need flexibility in this particular six-week or eight-week period as we seldom need it And I think it's important to have the ability to alter many of these variables in our targeting over this period So, I would strongly urge ""A"" with a $350 million borrowing number, plus or minus  It's 01 above What's wrong with that?  Not the Democrats, that's right  Clark said that?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Yes  Well, that [implies] 10 percent, not 12 percent  We have a very [unintelligible] word in here  What they think is that we provide reserves They are not focusing on the interest rate movements, are they? Because this rate says something else  If the phone system works!  We may not be able to reach you, but--  I certainly do  But that's why we have the ability to consult  [The distinction is] monetary targeting  7 to 11 percent "
2262,1982-09-24,MARTIN," Roger, I think what will happen ex post, when the market players review what we have done and the rationale, is that inevitably they will read between the lines and add all kinds of nonfunctional reasons for what we did in addition to our own reasons I'd lean against a vote  There would be all kinds of fears advanced in the cottage industry of the Fed watchers  SPEAKER(?) Yes  SPEAKER(?) It occurs to me that it might be very supportive, for instance, of the Fed's credibility in the sense of our recognizing what is happening in the economy "
2284,1982-10-05,MARTIN," Let me ask a question with regard to consumer attitudes and the [role] of the consumer balance sheet, if you will, in that Which way, if any, does the substantial improvement in the consumer's liquidity position cut vis-a-vis attitudes toward    10/5/82  residential [property] on the asset side? That is Is the consumer likely to consider his wealth as a plus or a minus factor?  And less valuable perhaps  That was my question How does one come out? You're not coming out?  On the theory that only the lost causes are worth fighting for?  And 1931  Very carefully  The point is the militancy in the unions despite these realities  I think it's necessary  We have the initial claims  A substantial temporary change or a substantial change?  That's the top of the range for ""B""  I'd like to turn the integrity argument around and argue for the second thoughts of the commentators and the analysts of our policy If we move in this direction of minimizing or eliminating M1 temporarily--and I'm not ready to throw it overboard-- and we pursue a policy that deliberately brings down interest rates, the first thoughts will be that we caved in, the election is coming, and here they go again The second thoughts, I think, will be different The second thoughts--which may be based on some analysis rather than on a knee-jerk reaction to what we do--would be that the integrity of the Federal Reserve is that they pursued policies with an eye to the growth of the economy, to the liquidity of the domestic and international system, and indeed, they did this despite the political consequences that occurred in the short run They maintained their integrity as a central bank I think that's a very different conclusion from the second thoughts on the other side which might be that the Federal Reserve should have brought interest rates down but the politics of the situation were such that they couldn't  But this is short run  I would join with Governors Partee and Teeters in the view that the impending recovery is probably not as projected, given today's interest rates I would call your attention to the rather heroic assumption, in current dollars, of the recovery in residential structures quarter-by-quarter running between plus 24 percent and plus almost 40 percent Given today's interest rates and today's lack of liquidity in the financial system, I simply don't feel that those are obtainable growth numbers If that's part of the consumer leading the recovery, it is not likely to occur Much more important is the weakness in business fixed investment; it is too strong as projected The first thing corporations have to do is to reliquify themselves; they're going to have to raise $20 billion or $40 billion or $60 billion in a very short period of time And they're not likely to be able to do that in an economy with the degree of liquidity it has today It appears that there are not uncertainties anymore but fear out there in the capital markets Part of it is derived from the international situation but a good deal of it is the awareness of the precarious nature of our own private corporate sector in this country And I think the need for reliquification extends very obviously to the thrift industry and to the small banking industry as they face the changes that need to be made there But to get back to business investment, which I think is going to decline more than our projections show, corporations face very low returns on investment after taxes despite the efforts of the Congress to change the depreciation and the cost recovery situation As we know, the recently enacted tax revenue measure has taken back half of the benefits, plus or minus, in that area So, we face an extended period of weakness in business investment  I think the best thing we can do is to bring rates down and help reliquify so that sometime out in 1983 or even 1984 we will have a recovery in the private sector I would support a temporary moving away from an M1 target I believe that is consonant with maintaining our integrity as a central bank We would be making a real mistake if we become too mechanical in the application of a policy in a multi- trillion dollar economy So, I would like to see this directive, perhaps with the Corrigan codicil adding language pointing toward the reduction in the growth of the money supply over time I would also like to see a borrowing level of $200 to $300 million with a verbal    10/5/82  directive, if you will, that interest rates be brought down, but in a gradual way, echoing a previous comment here [Unintelligible] that we temporarily target interest rates and that we be overt and candid in our specifications  Yes, indeed, unless we can get the four-week numbers published one of these days in addition  Larry, this is not the problem here  We would explain it  In the meantime, John Deere fails  Yes, ""no substantial""  We'd define it so that--  Of course, if we say 7 to 10-1/2 percent, we're conveying a little more information, which is that we might really tolerate a low rate That 7 percent might get their attention  There may be a confetti parade  SPEAKER(?) I don't know about confetti!  The indifferents have it  SPEAKER(?) Flip a coin "
2311,1982-11-16,MARTIN," I have no problem going ahead today I'd rather see us go ahead today than tomorrow given all this mumble-jumble misinterpretation we've been referring to  I move  Raising it by $1 billion [to $4 billion]    11/16/82  I'd like to speak to the housing sector  I've noted along with President Corrigan a few signs of housing recovery Like Jerry, I've talked with both lenders and developers and found from them the first sparks or glimmerings or very preliminary indications of some recovery But we have to put that into the changed institutional framework in which the lenders and the developers and the sellers of existing housing now operate One of the positive indicators, of course, is the substantial upswing in FHA applications That is a positive, but those FHA applications generally deal with housing, in submarket by submarket, that is at the lower percentiles of the housing market It would be difficult to have a 13 or 14 million housing start number based only on that segment of the market It would be difficult to have that kind of recovery in housing from the 800,000 to 900,000 level unless existing home sales revive and continue to support the month or two upswing in new home sales The question is whether even that one or two month increase in new home sales will persist The question is where the financing is going to come from to handle the need for the financing of the foreclosed properties--and they would be foreclosed if they didn't have to be shown in certain asset categories of the thrift institutions and the commercial banks That kind of financing, of course, is taking and will continue to take first priority over adjustments and accommodations to the regular borrower I note that there is a question about the thrift institutions with this marvelous new account, which is primarily a transaction account and will be looked on by their managers as a short-term source of funds Do we really expect them to make 30-year fixed rate, fixed term loans with 5 or 10 percent down? That kind of contract is going to be what it takes to get to a 13 million level, supported by some multiple of existing home sales of 5 million or whatever it takes to support the 13 million I don't see it that way  I think the public will buy a variable rate mortgage That gets us to the complication of qualifying the buyer, particularly the young buyer, in what more often than not won't be a variable rate but a renegotiable rate mortgage That gets us to the second problem of qualifying the young buyer particularly and other buyers where the lender demands a pledged account mortgage--where a savings account has to be put up in order to qualify the borrower because the income-to-debt-service requirement is such that they can't handle it without debiting a pledged account In other words, the institutional context in this recovery period for housing is significantly different from any recovery period we've had before So, if you foresee a consumer-led recovery with housing as the harbinger, I suggest you take another look  Bob, there's an old maxim that builders use, which is ""I'll build anything [the lenders] will finance""  In Texas, that's low income!  Well, we have the impact of personal bankruptcy behavior patterns that lenders are taking into account a bit more than they did in the previous so-called recovery  Would you?  I think the case for saying that we are in a period of discontinuity is a mixed one I don't think any of us can sit here and say that indeed the liquidity preference schedule has shifted--that the employment of liquidity and debt by the corporate sector or the private sector has really changed But certainly there are a number of indications that indeed this may have taken place To the extent there is credibility in the argument, one can look at the past two or three years and see two recessions back-to-back, with really no recovery My colleague, Governor Teeters, occasionally asks If one discounts the pseudo-recovery, isn't this the longest period ever of depressed growth? It's an intriguing idea Obviously, there are many things to go by That's the trouble We know so many things that aren't [typical] this very recent experience in the holding of liquidity; the recent experience of business firms restructuring themselves in terms of employment and outlook on markets; and the apparent significant change in the international situation Those are facts that can be considered cumulative and they make the discontinuity argument  I am not impressed by the current jargon on how narrow the opening of the window is--that it's only seven months or 19-1/2 days or whatever--because there is an awareness in the markets, as distinct from the flow of articles, Larry I read all those articles and newsletters and whatnot, too That is a cottage industry I'm glad we have nearly full employment there! But I do believe there is a significant difference between what traders and portfolio managers do in the markets and what some very interesting people write in the newsletters and in the financial press I'm relatively unimpressed by the flow of articles, although I'm vastly entertained by them Looking at the recent experience of nonrecovery over more than a 2-year period, looking at the benign effect of lower interest rates, if you will, what has been the effect of the decline of 150 or 200 basis points in short and long rates in terms of the international situation, in terms of the amelioration of the fragility of our own economy? People are still failing there I have major mortgage lenders who come in here and tell me that ""they are still putting our friends out of business,"" a [reference] I take it to adhering to supervisory pressures to clean up the loan portfolio The down side is still a specter that must be contended with and, therefore, I am an ""A"" to ""B"" person I am bothered by a target of borrowing of $150 million; it seems to me too low I can live with $200 million I certainly can accept $250 million in the short run I am greatly bothered by the alternative B notion that we might behave in such a way as to produce a 10-1/2 percent federal funds rate  I think a 10-1/2 percent federal funds rate would be a significant negative in the markets They would understand that They might not pay attention to 19 articles in that direction, but get that funds rate to 10-1/2 percent and I think we will continue to do damage to the economy We have done damage to it We, fiscal and monetary [policy] both, had to do damage But there comes a point where the battering must stop And 10-1/2 percent to me is cruel and unusual punishment So, I'm an ""A"" to ""B"" person I would hope to see $200 to $250 million as the borrowing target  They are holding their breath  6 to 9-1/2 percent?  No, anything about the Fed is a continuing story This is a continuing saga of the mysterious--  Yes, but by that time we've had another meeting  I don't believe that the extreme public scrutiny of our every word and our every action and the pseudo-actions that are attributed to us has made us a better functioning organization I agree with those of you who say that immediate publication of this mysterious [document] would heighten the tension The staff's memo indicates that the actual individual votes would be recited, and that would focus attention on individual differences These are operating statements; they attempt to be helpful operationally The public's right to know, I think, extends to our objectives, our performance, our structure, our composition as individuals here, and our backgrounds The public interest is not endowed in the operational aspects of the organization That's a different category The approaches that we are taking to reduce leaks of information are    11/16/82  separate topics from this release [and putting us] in the spotlight I would lean against the immediate release  Is that good? "
2339,1982-12-20,MARTIN," It's possible also to refinance some of the balloon payment arrangements that have been made around the country  Several of us have commented on the probable length of time of the transition I'm one of those who come down on [the side of] the long transition theory It has been said that the length of time it will take before [we can assess] the behavior of the new instruments and indeed the old instruments, which also may have their interest ceilings changed or removed by the DIDC, depends on the aggressiveness of bankers and their marketing efforts I think that's incorrect because I observe that the commercial banks in the country are going through a few other phases and adjustments right now If you add in thrift institutions, several dozen of them are failing every month That's a rather difficult transition Now they are going to be adjusting to noon presentment [unintelligible] and all that implies with regard to the clearing processes, and to ten percent withholding, which is putting a slight strain on most of their paper shuffling There are loan write-offs, international complications, etc, etc If we shift our view from concepts and abstractions to what is going on in the institutions that are out there, I think one can at least make a case that the transition period is going to be rather extensive And I would suggest to you that the consumer is almost as confused as his friendly neighborhood banker It's going to  -28-    12/20-21/82  take those consumers a while to settle down and determine where they want their balances and how much and what kinds of services they want from institutions that are changing their offerings of services rather frequently these days  I'm not as concerned about the journalistic recitation of expectations of the markets as I am about the behavior of the markets themselves I don't believe that Milton Friedman, my old friend Herb Stein, Lindley Clark, and the rest of those good folks are going to determine how the market reacts to what we do here in terms of M1 or M2 growth targeting, the changes in the directives, and so forth I think market participants are much more likely to react to the continued flood of negative or at best neutral information with regard to the company they underwrote last week, last year, or two years ago --literally to the bottom line of a corporation whose securities they are attempting to make a market for--to unemployment, to the export industry complications, to shortfalls in business fixed investment, and to all the rest of what is happening in the real world, and not to what Lindley Clark says in The Wall Street Journal Therefore, I think we have some action space to pursue some aggressiveness in M2 and some tolerance of M1 because the real world is just not shaping up very well for 1983  So, I'm endorsing what has been said with regard to a continued surveillance of M1 It is certainly attractive We've all exercised our due diligence now and looked at many of the other measures And, certainly, we should try to reinstate M1 in the pantheon But in the meantime, in what I think will be a long transition period, I would hope to see us discuss in our directives and our public utterances both M2 and M3 I'm not wild about M3 as a marvelous measure But look back at those tables on velocity at the end of the excellent work that has been done here I would hate to see us confined to one measure among the aggregates when velocity one year is +4 percent and another year -5 or -5-1/2 percent I'd like to see us have a little flexibility in the aggregates targets and, lacking something better, I would suggest M2 and M3 It's a bit vague; certainly M3 is a bit vague For that matter M2 is not a model of clarity But I'd like to see M2 and M3 specified and a little more emphasis in our public utterances on interest rates We're not fooling anybody, you know The folks out there know that we're paying a little more attention to interest rates Why not come right up front with it? That we look at M2 and M3 as the validator is a plus I think the word flexibility is part of the key to this I wonder back on the discount rate cut, which wasn't exactly a world beater, what the markets would have done, as they firmed up, if we hadn't reduced the discount rate So, I opt for flexibility  Moved  Yes, we'll never be able to make it "
2394,1983-02-08,MARTIN," On that point, that's the only place where it isn't unit labor costs In my own case, it is the expectation of a larger oil price drop than the 8 percent, realizing that the natural gas impact is in the opposite direction if you iterate through here a $350 or $4 a barrel change rather than a $2 or $250 change I think we tend to underestimate the impact of that iteration And I think [a larger oil price drop] is definitely in the cards and will produce a slightly lower inflation deflator number than the staff's  They try, but they don't get them  I wanted to raise a question on the housing forecast for the second year Admittedly this is getting to what we here call the long run--2 years  I thought it was 2 weeks until I read this document In terms of the second year, Jim, it seems to me that there are some lower ceilings in certain other resource areas We have had shifts of resources out of the housing [area]--certain of the major supplier firms I wonder if we won't reach a lower limit this time than 175 million That looked like the good old days to me Do you have any feeling about that?  And you are on the cautious side with regard to the expenditure growth, I noticed, in the residential area for 1984 and that's a comforting--  Hence your 9 or 10 percent increments quarter- by-quarter  I would join those who support targeting aggregates My own predilection would be M2 and M3 at this time, with a statement that we would review Ml I would go along with John that we review this in April and not wait until midyear I think that we need to target aggregates for a couple of reasons and they are important reasons First, they form a basis for communication; they provide a certain degree of understanding not just on the Hill but in the financial community Secondly, although this may sound a bit extreme, I think that despite our exceeding the targets by such a large amount they provide a certain amount of discipline internally on ourselves I believe we must go to wider ranges to reflect the uncertainties, though in so doing it may be appropriate--I would just raise this for consideration--that in communication with the Congress we indicate it will be a rather short-term objective of ours to bring down the rates of growth in the aggregates at such time as the recovery will not be impeded thereby And I'd say that we would attempt to exercise our best efforts not to have such a turn be abrupt or the method in which it was done itself be disruptive I certainly support those who believe we should use so-called informational variables It seems to me that we must mention nominal interest rates, not in the sense of a target but as an information variable, because of the credibility question If we don't mention that we are monitoring that informational variable, I don't think we will be believed We should likewise mention as an informational variable the domestic nonfinancial debt for all the reasons that have been advanced here in that it does move us a bit toward the GNP inference  I think the shock in the market of the very large rates of change that result from using the fourth quarter [as a base] would exceed any kind of side or pseudo analyses that we've shifted the base I think those large percentage growth numbers would be a shock  SPEAKER(?) I agree with--  I would echo Governor Teeter's comment of yesterday I'd rather have a narrower range and then at midyear go back We admit we don't know what the behavior will be and we can continue to reinforce that position and go back in July If we have to change it, we can change it then  All right  Except that we're going to sound like the United Kingdom  Yes I would add to that It seems to me that the thrifts still have a competitive device that they have not exploited My conversations with many of their representatives this week in Washington go to that conclusion This is a vehicle which can get them into a side of the financial markets that they're very interested in And I think this is one of the arguments for separating the [Ml] comment here and not making it pari passu with M2 and M3 We really don't know what is going to happen when certain financial institutions begin to exploit this in this calendar year  Those were also years in which the criterion of business managers for financing was leverage, leverage, leverage without any expectation that leverage would ever work against them There will be some tendency to try to shift toward equity and try to reduce debt We are leaving out the equity sector, and we know we are, for the reasons that were given in the paper  Let the record show  This is the armor plate!  Altered  Yes, let's delete ""closely""  -73-    2/8-9/83  Well, we do everything carefully  The Reuters tape on Friday afternoon--  It would be incomplete without it  Page 4  Close to seven weeks  But I think that language Tony, would be well received in the market Just the mention of [maintaining] restraint and the [expectation of a] slowing [in monetary growth] I think will be well received  It could have the same psychological impact we had the last time we made that move  I agree  We appreciate your vote "
2420,1983-03-28,MARTIN," Move approval of item 4(a)  Second    3/28-29/83  There's a risk on the earnings but not on the principal    3/28-29/83  [Unintelligible] everybody overdrawing?  Peter, about the comment on page 9 with regard to the two firms that are not on the regular government securities dealer roster Is it feasible to drop those two off?  So moved  Are there specific staff recommendations on the mark and the yen?  It isn't much intervention; I would certainly support that  Well, we have some information from the results of the surveys that we do for the setting of compensation levels in the Federal Reserve Banks In some of those surveys state and local compensation is included  That's pretty fragmentary, yes  Back on interest rates I noted in that fairly new survey of commercial bank pricing of their various deposits a 25 basis point backing up in the rate on money market deposit accounts Is that unexpected? Is there some particular factor that caused that turnaround in the pricing of that instrument?  It's up 25 basis points  Why is it a sampling error when it goes up and it's just good information when it goes down?  Yes, the national survey, which is a very large sample stratified by bank size, had a 25 basis point backup That is the reason I'm questioning it  No, the Money Market Monitor, or whatever that new commercial--  It has it by sections of the country It doesn't look like very hard data but, anyway, it did go up  You've seen that?  Yes, it's up 25 points  It's a large sample  I'm not surprised at the numerous positive comments in the Redbook or those that we've been sharing with each other As far as the businessman's attitude is concerned, I think we need to separate his or her little burst of optimism here from the probabilities of their obtaining the results they're talking about Partly their attitudes are those of survivors And as survivors they're looking at ways to increase their market share over the competition and they have good probabilities of doing that I think we may be discounting a little in the forecast the shape of the curve that we have reviewed with regard to profitability The increase in    3/28-29/83  profitability projected a few quarters from now and for next year is very great indeed and that, of course, not only affects the external financing of the business sector but gets good old Keynesian animal spirits going again And once the profits begin to come rolling in with some modest recovery, with the middle management cutbacks and the layoffs and so forth that have trimmed some of these organizations down, you get a positive effect on inventories, you finally get a positive effect on the computer-related or so-called tech kind of purchases in the equipment area But I think we have to keep our eye on the probability of these attitudes not materializing In housing, I am at a point of eating my words I was hopeful that the mortgage lending institutions of our world, particularly the thrift institutions, finally would have learned something and as the MMDAs came in they would not put virtually all of it out in fixed rate long- term mortgages I eat those words I admit being overly influenced by the representatives we have on the Thrift Institutions Advisory Council; those people aren't doing that, but it looks as if everybody else is And it's a small advisory group  So here comes this flood of fixed rate long-term funds It meets the demand of the first time home buyers They are influenced by an improvement in their tax position and are willing to undertake these obligations The thrift institutions are not paying off the Home Loan Banks, as we found out today They've made real progress; they've gone from $65 billion in debt there to $62 billion! Given the flood of funds coming in, they likewise have not paid off their friendly commercial bank So, they're carrying that credit They didn't do that with the money market deposit funds either On the other hand, I separate the positive implications of home buyers from the probability that it will occur in the future Namely, these are people who despite the after tax implications of income tax [savings] are sensitive to the interest rate These are small young families in which two people are working They can wait if the interest rates move up some; they'll simply postpone the purchase and we could have a good deal of that impetus disappear So, again, I separate the positive nature of profitability and equipment purchases around the corner from home-buying--in terms of the sensitivity these areas have to the interest rate  That's right  Those people are all from Michigan!  Mr Chairman, I would join those who are weighing the downside risks more heavily than pleasant surprises I do not believe the consumer has returned to the counter, except to the counter in the commercial bank branch to obtain currency! And, therefore, until he or she does return to the retailer's counter, I think the fragility of the financial system, domestic and international, and the flow of bad news that is going to make footprints through the reports of commercial banks--[unintelligible] Mexico, and the report of International Harvester, and the series of bad news that has not yet shown through--are not going to add to the confidence of the consumer or the depositor  On the other hand, in terms of the operating procedures, I would leave the language alone There's enough confusion out there in the financial markets for us--in the Chairman's speeches or in the ex post review of directives--to look as though we have deemphasized M2 at this meeting, just as the rate of growth of that aggregate begins to come down I would not favor--  I would leave the directive language, sir  Yes I would join Governor Wallich in terms of the passthrough, if you will, from large growth rates in M1 and even M2 through the employment effects and prices I think the good old lead/lag relationship of a year or two from the Ms to prices is highly complicated now because unemployment is not a function of [lax] aggregate demand, but rather reflects very significantly the structural changes in our economy, the more effective international competition, and the changing demographics I think there are a lot of reasons why the good old correlation is going to have a wider band [of uncertainty] around it now  On these bases, I think alternative C is too dangerous I remind the Committee again that the sample of 200 banks shows the MMDA rate actually rising 25 basis points to 847 percent on a national basis There's no geographic difference; it's across the country that there is a firming of rates on that instrument It's across size classes; it doesn't matter how big or how small the banks are The sample--admittedly it's only 200--shows a firming of those rates It shows the Super NOW rate at 730 percent Also, this is occurring simultaneously with the reduction in [the rate on] Merrill Lynch's CMA account, which is a transaction account, of over 50 basis points Back to the consumer I don't think the consumer believes that the Social Security system is safe any more We all have reviewed the technicalities and the funding and assumptions there and have reached one conclusion; I don't think the ordinary consumer believes it I concede that it might be useful in terms of fiscal policy for us to firm rates further, because in my conversations with a few people in the Congress, both in the Senate and the House, it looks as though there's a good deal of pessimism as to any short-run action by the Congress now that the so-called Social Security restructuring has taken place It might be useful for us to firm rates and, therefore, put pressure on Congress, but I don't think that's appropriate in    3/28-29/83  terms of the downside risk that is out there; the price is too high on a benefits/costs basis I would go, therefore, for alternative B and having a good deal of flexibility, which it shows, in the fed funds rate There may be times when we want to put a little upward pressure on rates, but not such as to threaten this fragile recovery  But you would avoid a 9 percent funds rate?  It avoids getting us committed to annual rates of 9 and 8 percent, respectively  ""A"" and ""B"" or--  Unbelievable is a 6 percent number!  How about 6 to 7-1/2 percent, combining ""B"" and ""A,"" if we're going to specify M1 at all?  But not just 6 percent  6 to 8  6 to 7-1/2 percent is in ""A""  I think we should use 6 to 8  You didn't like 7-1/2 "
2439,1983-04-29,MARTIN," Well, I would like to enter my usual caution with regard to the so-called housing recovery, Paul We're still not sure of the new housing sales The anecdotal evidence from developers is that these are still predominantly and unusually first-time buyers, and that sort of market can weaken very readily  Snugging is dead Is that right?  SPEAKER(?) Unbiased "
2461,1983-05-24,MARTIN," Lloyds Bank had indicated a substantial cutback in their overseas committing process Is that shared by National Westminster or other British or European banks? That's a pretty big bank  We've had some Middle Eastern sales  I'd like to join Tony in that caveat by adding the awareness I'm sure we all have of the continued interest in American companies by European and other investors who feel that either a stake in an American company or the acquisition itself has some great advantages, particularly when they buy in below book or at reasonable multiples of earnings That's another factor, despite the strong dollar    5/24/83  Henry, let me comment on that, if I may If we had gotten a different response from the disparate remarks District- by-District and metropolitan area-by-metropolitan area, we almost would have had to reject the survey results because housing markets nationally are a mosaic of little markets and submarkets You must get this kind of result or someone is not doing his homework This is a typical analysis and response of varying markets around the country with varying backed-up demand, different migration patterns, and different local economic base conditions I found it quite a valid survey  This discussion is so different from our previous one It certainly is gratifying to hear what I think is a well founded positive outlook I won't call it optimism because it has some aspects to it that I don't think apply So, let me be Dr Doom here for a minute and remind everyone that Wachovia has raised its prime rate, that Bankers Trust has raised its broker loan rate, and that while one must allow for a good deal of difficulty the Treasury is experiencing because of Congressional inaction--if that's the correct term--on the debt ceiling, nevertheless, over the last few days there has been some upward pressure in the markets Maybe this is very transitory as far as interest rates are concerned But if we look at the LDC debt question vis-a-vis these firming rates and assume anything like even a 75 or 80 or 90 basis point increase in that burden, we are looking at countries with $90 billion or $84 billion or  -12-    5/24/83  $40 billion or whatever projections you'd like to use by the end of 1983 If we consider how much of that debt is nonsovereign debt but is private debt, how much of it is carried by our banks and how much is carried on a variable rate basis, [we see the impact] of the drift in rates on additional funds being advanced in those giant workout situations  If we consider the vulnerability of those countries who are oil exporters--to shift my ground here a little--if prices decline on the petroleum products substantially more, these countries are paying on a weighted average basis higher interest rates Yes, that certainly is offset to some degree by our ability to absorb some imports in some cases The IMF constraints, as the Chairman and others commented earlier in this meeting, [impose] great difficulties on some of the countries--even those who are taking them seriously and attempting to comply And then, of course, finally there are the political implications of compliance and the political implications of higher rates on the variable portion of the debt It comes out to be quite cumulative So, while I share the positive outlook with regard to our own economy--I have some reservations still in the housing area but share generally the outlook--I think we must inject into our discussions here, and we already have, the extreme complications and extreme sensitivities and vulnerabilities on the international side  We may not--  I would join those who would oppose abandoning Ml I don't believe the market makers will abandon that measure I don't think they'll take it off the tape in their offices because we say we are abandoning it Even it they were convinced we were abandoning it, they may not abandon it Some Wall Street types think they are a good deal smarter than we are anyway I don't think the commentators will abandon discussion [of Ml] in the media Once a newspaper reporter learns something--and they only learn a very limited number of somethings--he or she will continue to work that story or alleged story of what will be seen as a conflict between the monetarists' analysis of markets and whatever analysis prevailed within these walls I myself feel we should give Ml some weight aside from the media considerations When it varies as much as it is now, I don't think we can ignore it; a 24 percent growth rate in May is pretty hard to ignore  One comment I would like to make with regard to the recovery I am just as encouraged as anyone else I am a natural born optimist, but I did pick up on Jerry's comment that we are talking about a percentage increase and we started at a very low level Those bankruptcies that occurred in the recession--the four-year recession or whatever it is being called--are rather permanent removals from the  -29-    5/24/83  business population If we seem to be forthcoming with regard to recognizing that a sustainable recovery requires lower long-term rates and we continue to express our view with regard to irresponsible fiscal policy, it seems to me that we can make a reasonable case for actions in the direction of less accommodation now, if these are modest moves The kind of move I would support is perhaps raising borrowings to a $350 million level; I am a ""B minus"" type here If we indicate that we recognize that long-term rates may be positively affected thereby, if we admit our awareness that autos, housing, and consumer credit are all vulnerable to high rates, knowing that consumer credit rates have been so sticky in coming down, and if we couple that with public statements that our longer-run goal is to avoid overcreating credit or money, however measured, at this time, it seems to me that a modest move in this direction might be salutary in terms of long-term rates and in terms of our credibility out there in the market  Maximum 9-1/2 percent  You're all heart!  Is there any comment on federal funds?  That gets the business recovery first  Which is where we all put it  Not the Ml first  Certainly ""anticipation"" takes a bit of the weight away from Ml Rather than say we've done it because Ml is running higher to say we anticipate Ml to have certain behavior takes a little--  That I agree with We're really--  Well, it's forward looking rather than ex post  It seems to me that if we take your language and move the business conditions comment ahead of the Ml comment and add that ""lesser restraint will be acceptable in the context of"" we at least begin to have something to work with It's not completely consistent; now we've got to reconcile--  After the language in your draft ""for the quarter and within the longer-run ranges,"" why not move up ""and against the background of evidence of some acceleration in the rate of the recovery"" Then make your comment with regard to transactions balances in the anticipatory way that it's done in alternative II And then close with the lesser restraint sentence That is, we would have ""The Committee anticipates that Ml would remain above its long- run range,"" as in the alternative II language, ""but that its growth would be substantially reduced in the period immediately ahead"" And then close with ""Lesser restraint would be acceptable"" Now, that isn't completely consistent; it needs a little editing once you tack it all together like that  The lesser restraint?  You're right So it should be ""M2 and M3"" instead of ""monetary aggregates""  That's the beauty of it  So here we are to the central bank money as the German--  Well, if you put in the reversal language, you'll get some of the members  Would you add the lesser restraint?  [Unintelligible]  But it suggests we are moving in a way that would avoid the excesses that sometimes have characterized a certain stage of the recovery and overcreating the--  The Administration [unintelligible] frustrate the Congress and not the economy You could drop them both and frustrate both  He won Poole said 5 percent; we can't get them to agree on how far down  SPEAKER(?) For the year, you mean  Sure you can Put your right arm up  SPEAKER(?) You just did; now we're getting ready "
2477,1983-06-23,MARTIN," I think the advantage in some careful public indication of this kind is in the reduction of the fear that is in the market that we will not take gradual and careful interim steps, but on the contrary that we will sometime down the road, as in the common expression, ""slam on the brakes"" This would be a good signal, if carefully enunciated, to minimize that fear that is in the market "
2498,1983-07-12,MARTIN," Moved  Jim, I wonder if you could enlighten me a little with regard to the interest rate assumptions consistent with the [Greenbook GNP projection] as shown in Appendix I in the Bluebook It seems to me that the projected increase in interest rates, particularly for the Aaa utilities and the fixed rate mortgages, is rather modest It's an increase of 5/8 point or 60 basis points or something of that sort That seems to me to be a relatively low threshold for these rates to achieve Can you help me understand why you have such low ceilings as your--?  So, indeed, if the structure has a higher threshold than you've shown, wouldn't that cast some doubt over the housing forecast and particularly the less creditworthy bank borrowers who resort to the commercial bank window as you've indicated they will be pushing to do in 1984? And that perhaps would affect the volume of consumer borrowing It's all on the negative side  I would echo the comments that have been made with regard to the staff forecast for the balance of this year But in answer to your question, Mr Chairman, I have some problems with the projection for '84 in specific areas As far as housing is concerned, it seems to me that this sector is as usual very vulnerable to the level of rates [rising] 25 or 50 basis points [as shown in the Bluebook] in Appendix I So far as the housing boom--and that's what it has been, conceding it started from very low levels--almost half of it has been a function of the first-time home buyer And it has been fueled particularly by the fixed rate, fixed term mortgage, whose use the various housing financial agencies are now attempting to decrease as strongly as they can--I take it without much attention to what it might do to the total economy, but hoping that it will solve some problems that the thrift institutions have Given a slightly higher set of interest rate assumptions, we can recall the already red figures for the thrift industry; that sort of impact, of course, is itself a downside factor  -17-    7/12-13/83  Moving on from housing, we have not talked extensively about the [interest rate] implications for export markets Indeed, if the interest rate projections here are on the low side, that would reflect a considerably higher interest burden on both our trading partners on the one hand and the developing countries' potentials on the other The impact of these rates on business borrowing I have alluded to before If you take the Aaa figures here and increase them some, that has employment implications which, in turn, obviously have other potential downside effects What I'm getting at is that if it is true that small business firms are the source of much of the increase in employment, which is to say the decrease in the unemployment rate, then somewhat higher rates than these admittedly increased rates have both business investment implications--as far as the smaller firms are concerned there will be less of that--and employment implications with regard to '84, not '83 In other words, it seems to me that we do face a dilemma here in that the interest-sensitive areas are carrying the increase in economic activity and, therefore, a substantial increase in economic recovery does indeed have a very low probability, and we have some downside implications that I think we need to be very aware of as we examine the alternatives for monetary policy for 1984 If we together choose one of the alternatives that is going to push up rates, I think we need to be fully aware of the implications--the social costs, if you will, or at least the costs in an economic sense that we will pay in terms of housing, small business, export industries, and other interest-sensitive areas  But you're not saying that the demand curve has shifted You're saying the demand curve probably has a different configuration  We're pretty high in metaphysics already!  It's not a shift  Balles? They're wide ranges  But under the unchanged alternative [shown in the Bluebook] nominal GNP is 87 percent for 1984 In other words, we're giving up 1/2 point of nominal growth if we follow the configuration of reducing that aggregate  So, we're giving up about 1/2 point of both real growth and nominal growth if we adhere to alternative I for 1984, right?  That's an appropriate caveat but, nevertheless, for 1985 you have a real growth differential there of 100 basis points Is that not right? Our expectation is 100 basis points--  The difference in the real growth of [strategies 1 and 2] is 100 basis points  That's what we're dealing with You might not believe it, Henry, but that's what we have; that's where we started  I'm just looking at page 11, 1985 real GNP  Yes, the percent increase for 1984 and 1985 Comparing the model's output, which we've been properly warned has a dispersion around it that's considerable, under the two alternatives for 1985 the model produces 41 percent real versus 31 percent-- comparing [strategy] 2 with [strategy] 1 And for 1984 the model produces 46 percent versus 42 percent Also, as Governor Wallich has pointed out, the model is showing that there's not as large an impact on the deflator as there is on the real GNP growth And if that's quite right, we must accept the caveat that this is the output of the model  Well, that is--  I'm delighted to hear you mention nominal GNP or something relating to the real world rather than the Ms It seems to me that the tactical discussion has had to do with how we appear with regard to targeting on the intermediate basis of the Ms If there is any strategic aspect through the model's output as delineated on page 11 [of the Bluebook], it is that our objectives are nominal GNP and the other general output data rather than the Ms So, I go back again to the aggregates [relating]--however weakly in the model--to economic activity, not the Ms And I suggest that we look again at those aggregate figures for nominal GNP  Why don't we use the word tactical and concentrate on the strategic aspects of it?  I would too  I think that's right And I think the market-- almost regardless of what we say unless we just repudiate Ml, which I  -42-    7/12-13/83  don't think is the consensus of this group--is still going to follow it, put some weight on it, and think we are putting some weight on it  Jerry, I think we go up to the Congress and tell them that we're tightening because the economy is growing above the rate anticipated and we're beginning to see the first signs of inflation I don't think we go up and make an argument based on the Ms at all We make an economic argument  Well, if the economy is growing very, very [rapidly] That was the assumption Jerry made  That was his assumption  I'm not talking about today I'm talking about his scenario, Tony  But the interest sensitive sectors of the domestic recovery have not had time to react to or [feel] the impact of the slightly higher rate A month from now, six weeks from now, we will see the interest sensitive areas, especially housing, begin to level off or decline  When you associate ""A"" with some tightening, are you referring to a validation by us of the movement in the markets that has already occurred or are you talking about higher rates from today's level or yesterday's level?  Let me shift to ""B"" then Are you talking about validation or further increases?  I wouldn't think it's the end of it  And you're talking about [growth in] total reserves under ""B"" at 2-1/4 percent June-to-September?  It's also substantial  What would ""B"" imply with regard to the prime rate--very considerable pressure upward?  But that's one month of business borrowing and the kind of businesses that provide much of the new employment are paying 2 to 3 points over prime If we get the prime rate up another 50 or 75 [basis] points and add 2 to 3 [percentage points] on top of that, we'll see how much borrowing we get!  Yes, but small businesses are paying 200 to 300 basis points over prime, as we all know In construction with 100 basis point increase on FHA/VA [loans], they're back to paying 6 points again The conventional loan points are much more, maybe 10  And then points on the mortgage  I would support the Chairman's $600 to $800 million range, anticipating that $700 million would be the midpoint of that I would like to see fed funds at no higher than 9-1/2 percent In other words, I'd support some verification on the interest rate side of what has already occurred, for the reasons I have mentioned too many times at this meeting And I would move for the deletion of the automaticity embodied in the language in the two paragraphs that have been called to our attention  I think it's well to say that; I'd suggest leaving it in  I think the 5 to 9 percent is easier to explain You're the person who has to be the expositor here and I think we should go along with your--  This isn't a statement in isolation; this is a statement made at a time that interest rates have firmed and are continuing to firm a little  Or a footnote  Hope over experience "
2526,1983-08-23,MARTIN," I would join Tony only in the comment on housing I was convinced yesterday that the interest concessions have been so narrow in automobile financing that their removal is not going to be a material factor in the fourth quarter But I would argue that housing in the fourth quarter will be down more likely by 200,000 to 250,000 than 100,000 units The cancellation rates in the escrows in Dallas, Chicago, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta are such that the sales will not be completed The rates are floating up 150 and in some cases 200 basis points Those sales are just not going to be closed and that, of course, will back up into starts and other housing figures So, as usual, I would indicate a deeper, further degree of pessimism on the housing front  New single-family homes primarily    8/23/83  Yes, but there, Ted, we have the condition of high vacancy rates for apartments in the major markets in the Sunbelt and a very low household formation rate in 1982 There is some controversy about what the formation rate was last year; some people say there wasn't any for the first time in twenty-five years or something like that I think that's a bit too pessimistic, but the Board's staff indicated that it's several hundred thousand households  The staff comment yesterday [at the Board briefing referred to] the impact of the recession I think it goes beyond that I think there are some changes Some younger folks are staying with Momma and Poppa a little longer and I think there's a definite slowing in the rate of [household] formation  Or a new computer Then there's a question, of course, of the thrift industry problems, if any, at today's interest rates We had some work done here a while back--I'm not sure that Jim would still underline that work--in which we second guessed the thrift industry economists and it came down to this A very rough figure of 100 basis points in weighted average costs for the thrifts means a pre-tax impact of about $1 billion If you remember the rise in rates since June, which is the month in which we received those data from the thrifts and translated that into a post-tax profitability, [it means that] they don't have any [profit] And, of course, for the savings banks you get a figure that's in the red But some of you in your own Districts know that picture of the savings banks a lot better than I do  Jim, in terms of wealth effects for middle income consumers, their assets are tied up in a single-family residence, which they can't sell In city after city those people are sitting there with a number on paper or in their minds as to what the equity in their home is and they can't realize it So, I wonder how important the stock market is to the middle of the pyramid  -14-    8/23/83  And what was the offsetting decrease? I don't have our [forecast] here so I can't-- There was a decrease in the value of the equity of housing of $30 to $40 billion for households Is there an offset? They have a perception of a decrease in their wealth  They've had a decrease in the real value of their housing and, therefore, their equity They're heavily borrowed  I believe that's exactly--  Some, but not all  Give them something to work on, right! "
2554,1983-10-04,MARTIN," Is concessionary [wage] bargaining a part of the so-called short-run solution? You didn't mention it  There is an institutional element in this too that is coming up, particularly next year, and that is the turnover in union leadership In more and more cases the senior captains of those unions are retiring and new faces are appearing And there's going to be a certain amount of motivation among those folks to make the record show that those old boys, and old women in some cases, had gotten tired I think that's a factor that we have to watch in 1984  -4-    10/4/83  MR, FORRESTAL Mr Chairman, we don't have any esoteric tales either to report from the Sixth District We would generally agree with Jim Kichline's estimate I think the Southeast pretty much mirrors what is going on in the rest of the country The economy continues to expand, although there are a few sectors that are showing some signs of slowing Consumer spending remains pretty strong, although the drought and the unseasonably hot weather affected not only farm prices but consumer spending as well because there were not the usual back-to-school purchases Industrial employment is continuing to rise We're looking at some reversals, particularly in the forest industry [That experienced by] Georgia Pacific, which recently moved to Atlanta, is very much apparent to us in that particular industry Higher mortgage rates have reduced sales of new homes from the levels that were attained earlier this summer It seems to me that 13-1/2 to 14 percent rates are about the choke point for most people for new homes as well as existing homes  In the financial sector we've had pretty good deposit and loan growth, although it has been weaker than in June It's going to be interesting to see what the results of the deregulation move on October 1 will be I believe that somewhere in the Bluebook or Greenbook there was an indication from the staff that there was not going to be as much hype in advertising for these new instruments as there was before We don't expect it to be very extensive in Atlanta or in the Southeast, but we do think that it's going to take off to some extent--that there is going to be more advertising and more attempts to draw funds through these instruments into the banks and the S&Ls Tourism is showing some signs of ebbing particularly in central Florida, and in the Miami area the tourist industry is a disaster They are doing very badly and that's true not only in Miami Beach and Miami but in Dade County generally  If we had some concerns to express--where we would differ from the staff estimate--it would be on the up side We think that perhaps there has been some underestimation of the strength of the economy That is certainly true in our area; we get people talking about this quite a lot in our section of the country After all, throughout this third-quarter period we did have some strikes, such as the AT&T strike, which I think had an effect on the economy We had the hurricane in some parts of the country I think we have to take that into account So, we would be a little concerned that the third- quarter number is perhaps on the low side and might be revised upward There is considerable concern in our District, as I'm sure there is in other Districts, about the [federal budget] deficit, and there's a great deal of concern in the export-related industries about the strength of the dollar Interestingly, inflation in two of our major cities, Atlanta and Miami, is running about 13 to 14 percentage point above the national average, so that's a concern Because of already existing inflation in those cities and the threat of increased food prices as a result of the drought, we see some pressure on prices  One other thing I might mention is related to industrial production and capital expansion Some of the contacts we've had with industrial development agencies around the District indicate to us that a lot of the capital expansion is being designed to improve existing productivity rather than to meet additional product demand And finally, Mr Chairman, there is a good deal of concern in Atlanta    10/4/83  and Miami about the Eastern [Airlines] situation Governor Martin's remark about concessionary bargaining certainly bears on this This is a good example of the union leaders not being supported by their own people I'm not sure they're in the old man/old lady category but the flight attendants, for example, are now coming forward and indicating that perhaps they would rather have wage concessions than have Eastern go under In other words, they are tending to believe management rather than their own union  I'd certainly like to join in that [assessment], Tony When you look at country after country and what they have agreed to under IMF constraints, in each case one can make the point that they have to solve their own problems--the deficit has to come down, and the subsidies, etc, etc When one looks across the whole less developed world one wonders how they can increase their exports and how they can slash their imports--not just reduce them but cut them to the bone--and what happens after they cut them to bone We have this whole section of the planet continuing to operate and jointly [trying to] solve their problems, and it seems to me that inevitably there are going to be great difficulties And this  -17-    10/4/83  Argentina thing is a very political action in appearance but there are great, great possibilities for disturbances arising out of that side of it  Maybe we do  When you look at the [projected] increase in our exports from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of 1984, given a 15 percent change [in the value of the dollar] and stipulating all these matters, but assuming that the IMF pattern will work, that we will get the [increase in IMF] quotas, and that we will get the $6 billion and another $7 billion in credits-- The assumptions are cumulative They simply in my mind do not add up to a world recovery  But look at the risks involved, as we discussed them  From whom?  I'm asking--  And [there would be problems in] the flow of foodstuff and spare parts after a period in which the inflow of foodstuff and spare parts has been down They already have cut their imports Add on to that a difficulty of importing--  GOVERNOR WALLICH I tell them that too because I have to make a case I just want to say to you that the case is not very convincing  I think the fragility of the world debt situation is such that probing downward makes sense I think that is the major risk to our recovery on a three-year basis; it's a major risk to the world's recovery; and it's a major risk to the financial institutions, particularly the commercial banking institutions in this country in terms of write-offs and their possible contraction of credit in a different sense than we use that term Therefore, I would be very cautious in probing upward and quite willing to probe down  And the international situation  Now we're talking about rates  That ""compatible with"" sounds like rate targeting  Mention rates and they think we're targeting rates Mention M1 rebasing and they think we're targeting Ml  I don't  Oh, yes  How much unemployment? "
2581,1983-11-14,MARTIN," You didn't mention a more experienced labor force and you didn't mention the impact of these high unemployment rates you project Do you discount those factors in getting back to the 11 percent trend?  Let me tie on to that with a collateral question Is there a one-to-one unemployment increase if you, let's say, come down 1 percent in the rate of growth with contained inflation?  Or higher productivity  It depends on when you have recessions--  Ted, what happened to the negotiations or alleged negotiations with the Mexican private sector credits-- exploring the notion of a rollover that would be part debt and part equity Was that just talk?  But if it were rolled over into part debt/part equity, would the accounting or the reserving or the nonperforming status be affected at all?  It's a bit of price-fixing by the Congress  Could I ask a question with regard to price changes and the price outlook, Jim? As you know, several of us have had some discussion with regard to futures prices and spot prices and commodity and producer price indexes and so forth What would be your judgment as to what the spot and futures markets are showing with regard to the first signs of reinflation or the lack thereof?  -37-    11/14-15/83  Jim, wouldn't you add the question of world capacity and the business relationships that have been entered into by American firms with foreign suppliers over this last four-year period? Obviously, you have built into the forecast changes in the exchange rate, but I think the business relationships, contracts, and so forth to some extent transcend the exchange rate question If you talked to some of Silas' constituents and some of the others, they say they are going to continue to use those foreign sources Now, that's too flat a statement, but isn't that--  Let me ask a second question with regard to labor resources If your productivity figure is indeed too low--as I have said innumerable times that I think it is--where does that leave you with regard to unemployment rates?  Mr Chairman, I would like to address some of the downside risks with regard to the expansion in order to get that on the record and also some pessimism as to prices Obviously, our goals are both disinflation and growth And those of you who have served on the Federal Reserve Board since 1979 deserve all the recognition that you'll never get But this is not an expansion like that of the 1970s We don't have the kind of world inflation or the kind of economic growth in the OECD countries or in the less developed countries that we've had in other periods I wonder if, in a global sense, the problem today isn't the illiquidity of so many financial structures and corporations around the country and the slow growth that characterizes most of the world outside the United States We've talked about productivity, and certainly that is a positive factor in terms of future inflation But that should be coupled with the kinds of comments of an anecdotal nature that I have picked up from my business contacts Certainly, the businessman is going to try to raise his prices Certainly, the union leadership, particularly the new young faces you see in union halls who have taken over from the old guard, are going to try to make their reputation But we have not talked much about the natural rate of unemployment and the current rate of unemployment and the projected rate of unemployment since yesterday That kind of analysis is still before us The anecdote I hear is ""We're going to try to raise our prices but we're not so sure in terms of world competition that we're going to be as successful in that as we have been in previous recoveries""  This is still a typical recovery I think we are talking about it here a little in terms of our awe that we have so exceeded our own forecast But if you look at the 5 or 6 recovery periods since World War II, on an average basis we're talking about 5 percent real growth or so in the first three quarters of a rather typical upswing [As for] the expectational side of what data we can get-- what President Corrigan [mentioned]--I've certainly examined these data If you look at the commodities, spot and future price indexes, other than what has happened in the past few days, you find if you go back a month or two months that index after index on the spot market-- seven or eight of them--is down or pointing in that direction If you take the futures market, it's not so clear But of 10 or 11 indices there 7 out of the 10 are pointing downward The stock markets, once you get beyond the misinformation of the DOW and look at the other market indices, are down; the common stock prices of the NASDAQ and of the AMEX and the general markets are certainly not pointing toward a revival of inflation It seems to me, then, that looking at the world situation and looking at how we stand vis-a-vis previous recovery periods something can be said for steady-as-you-go rather than using out intuitive feelings about a revival of inflation Rates, both short and long rates, have already revived some; they have gone up some since the last FOMC meeting There may be a question that we should keep in mind about 1985 and how we're going to sustain the expansion into 1985 when inflation is still perhaps not as revived as our intuitive sense would say and unemployment is going to be very substantial and the world economy is probably not going to be that recovered  Mr Chairman, I'd like to enter a vote for alternative B One reason is my concern with regard to our leadership in the world economy and our impact as the world's biggest market for the less developed countries Speaking on a domestic basis, though, we are not yet back to a trend line in real GNP, described using the last decade or 1973 to 1980 or whatever you feel is the appropriate period Things have changed so much, though, in the last few years-- financial institutions, financial instruments, business institutions and the way they're dealing with their unions, and the world competition that has now been vectored into this country But I think any fine-tuning, considering how little we know about our institutions and their financial instruments and how they perform today, would go just as fine-tuning has always gone--not so fine So, a slight firming of interest rates or so-called precautionary firming, given the disappearance of Reg Q and given the removal of other estoppels that the government had built into the financial system, means that if we're going to tighten it has to be, in my not so humble opinion, a major tightening--not a firming of a 1/4 or 3/8 of a point And I'm not prepared to support either a fine-tuning or a major move I understand most of us are not willing to support a major move I'd like to see the status quo and borrowing between $600 and $700 million, with emphasis on the lower number  Tony, the variable rate mortgage is coming into its own; it's 30 to 45 percent of the market I mean no disrespect, but we don't have good measures of those rates and how those loans are traded in the markets If we had that data, I don't think you'd find the discrepancy You're talking about fixed-rate mortgages  Let's keep it up  Some of the Committee's concern  Somewhere between ""A"" and ""C""  We could say ""zero or more""!  Yes, 5 to 6 percent "
2614,1983-12-19,MARTIN," So move  Mr Chairman, I join those of our colleagues who have been accepting the hypothesis that we will have more volatility in short-term rates, perhaps spilling over into long-term rates, by a closer adherence to M1 targeting, or by CRR And if indeed there is to be some degree of increased volatility as a result of our moving in that direction, it seems to me that the risks in 1984 and in 1985 should be kept in mind and would mitigate against our moving in that direction I'm thinking, of course, of the international debt situation, of the efficacy of business fixed investment as a sustaining force in the expansion, of housing, and obviously of commercial construction, which I think is going to be the next REIT disaster and which is susceptible to the influence of [interest] rates It seems to me that there is some potential reward, but it's rather a paper reward, of controlling M1 better But how long is it going to take us to learn what velocity is going to be and what trend line is going to emerge--either the old one or a new one? How long is it going to be before we can see what the relationship of this new one is with regard to the economy? I think we may, as a group, have a more favorable look at M1 and at a more automatic procedure later I am sure that many in the markets will continue to feel, surmise, believe in, or have faith in M1 and its close relationship with economic activity As long as that belief is out there, it's something we have to deal with But now with the unknowns with regard to velocity and M1 and the risks to this economy by increasing the volatility of interest rates, I simply think we should wait  Mr Chairman, you asked for comments with regard to some of the downside risk aspects of the economy Let me mention two or three, beginning with the projections we have with regard to commercial property development in the fixed investment sector President Boykin mentioned the speculation in land I want to take that one step further into the commercial property area where the so- called syndications-- companies and others have sales of $50 million, $100 million, $200 million at a time--have bid up the prices of commercial property and brought on to submarket after submarket a supply of this kind of space, which is having its effect on the existing commercial properties in those submarkets I believe that the IRS review of so-called tax sheltered investments, if it results in any kind of substantial change in the tax position of these investors in the syndicates, particularly these privately offered limited partnerships, could result in a very substantial contraction of ownership of commercial property and development--the mortgages thereon--in this country And I think we're headed for a very substantial setback there  As far as housing is concerned, I have never seen in my experience with mortgage portfolios over more years than I would like to admit the poor quality that one sees in mortgage portfolios today-- if we subject them to any kind of analysis The builders who have gotten people into these mortgage arrangements and who now have withdrawn their subsidies--their so-called buydown arrangements--have left a situation in which the value, if I may use that term, of residential property is no longer rising despite what we see in scattered statistics And, therefore, the position of those  -21-    12/19-20/83  households as far as payors are concerned is under severe pressure So, the losses that the private mortgage insurance companies are taking continue to go [up]; the quality of the residential mortgage portfolio has deteriorated; and there are further losses out there in the future with regard to these situations  In terms of inventory, I had the opportunity recently, as did President Corrigan, to spend some time with business people--retailers in several parts of the country I take it, Jerry, that you were talking about manufacturers in the big companies But the information I got at the retail level--here I'm shifting from comments on risk to comments regarding inflation--is that particularly because of the availability of overseas sources for the retailers, so far they have not faced the kind of price pressures that you indicated in other segments of the private sector Quite the contrary, at this stage of the recovery they find that they can get to sources [of supply] and they don't have to maintain a heavy inventory and have no plans to maintain a heavy inventory So, once the Christmas selling season is over, they will have some bare shelves But some of them are willing to trade off at the margin what they consider minor market share losses for the rigid control of their inventory On the plus side, what I have picked up on these matters has been an emphasis on productivity--the profitability, say, of the auto companies in the Midwest They are looking toward break-even points at much much lower levels than before, in part because they have taken out of their costs--as they express it--several billions of dollars  So, it seems to me that we have a downside risk in the mortgage market and in the thrift institutions Savings banks are still very deeply in the red on an operating basis, despite the interesting kinds of ways that their accountants let them ""report"" and ""disclose"" to the public The savings and loan industry--maybe 40 percent of it--is still in the red on an operating basis To add to President Boehne's comments with regard to interest rates If interest rates go up 100 to 150 basis points, that would move the proportion of the thrift industry that is having operating losses to something like 75 or 80 percent Housing doesn't stabilize--all generalizations are false including that one--it either goes up or goes down And my guess is that it's going to go down because of the quality of mortgage paper and because we have now used up that backlog in demand for housing that resulted from low levels of housing starts previously So, I think there are several downside areas in the economy  Mr Chairman, we did have a good discussion at the last FOMC meeting about certain relationships and certain theories of inflation and inflation's forces and factors It seems to me that that discussion is relevant to an outreaching for 1985 and to some extent to our considerations for 1984 There is some validity to the notion that by 1985 the changes in Ml [will be behind us], however uncertain its velocity and however difficult it is to anticipate the results of contemporaneous reserve requirement accounting, and that what we do in the balance of this year and in 1984 will have a bearing on the conditions and activity in 1985 I would, therefore, not forget Ml regardless of the uncertainties that I mentioned, but I believe they are such that we should not yet move Ml up in importance in the exposition of our policies and how we are going about [implementing] them It seems to me that the market is focusing somewhat more on free reserves and on borrowing levels than previously and that the almost obsession with Ml has diminished somewhat; I think that's probably salutary Perhaps that means the market has a better understanding of what we're really trying to do So, I wouldn't forget Ml; I would keep it among the targets, certainly, but I believe the uncertainties are such that we need a wide range for 1984 and, therefore, the 4 to 8 percent is acceptable  With regard to your question on 1985, I would join those who support your presentation of perhaps a bit stronger language regarding our reluctance to fund total expenditures, a part of which is the 40 percent that is [spending by] the federal government But I'd like to pick up those additional tens of billions that are off-budget financing and look at the situation as one in which the financing is much more than 40 percent and getting up to the 50 percent or better level So, I would caution that our 1985 targeting of the aggregates and our policies, framed in view of Ml changes and credit changes, are not likely to be such as to fund the levels of spending that private demand and public demand unreined would imply It seems to me that we are in a position of increasing that warning I would also support some language indicating that, when we know what the actual growth in  -39-    12/19-20/83  the aggregates was in 1984, our policy would most likely be to reduce the targets for 1985 from the actuals of 1984  I would have language indicating that, given the total spending that seems likely to occur in the absence of remedial action on fiscal policy, we would find it difficult in the public interest to fund all of that spending and that our targets would most likely take the form of [lower figures than the actuals in 1984] I wouldn't use any numbers, Tony How do we know what the actual 1984 performance is going to be? I was reviewing last year's Bluebook--no offense intended--and I don't know how in the world we can set numbers for 1985 when the 1984 actual is likely to be way off the expected  Christmas is over already?  On the gold standard we would have to ease, Henry  Mr Chairman, I have observed that the unemployment rate, with the most recent data we have and the staff projections through 1984, brings us to a position well above the so- called natural rate of unemployment that we reviewed at the last FOMC meeting Also, in contrast to some of my colleagues, I observe very, very little evidence of a reigniting of inflation You cannot find it in commodity prices, in gold, or in the usual indices If you accept the staff forecast quarter-by-quarter of the real GNP, it comes down nicely One would wonder, as has been observed here previously, what better configuration of a moderation in economic expansion one would seek in contrast to what has been projected here It seems to me that alternative B, which is essentially the status quo with a $650 million  -58-    12/19-20/83  borrowing level, not $750 million, and with growth of the aggregates as indicated is consonant with an expansion period that is almost textbook I would join my colleague Governor Rice in the hope that we could restore Ml to the pantheon on Olympus in July, having the ex post expertise that we all will acquire so readily in looking backward over [the intervening] period of time I don't think this is a time to signal to a nervous market that we see inflation coming back when only the Wall Street gossip would join us in that expectation  And the same lack of any [new] statistical evidence of inflation  Do you want to be too soon or too late?  And OPEC is having a terrible time trying to hold the cartel together  If it comes out 6-1/4 percent, as forecast, it won't be the most rapid? "
2639,1984-01-30,MARTIN," So moved  Second  May I speak to your question?  To take the analysis of the housing financial situation out to the margin, I note that data on the losses from foreclosures in residential property last year, including the fourth quarter of last year, indeed [support] Mr Prell's premise For example, the mortgage insurance industry, which could be accused of insuring some of the submarginal and certainly a lot of the marginal residential credit, is now experiencing losses from foreclosure at about 3-1/2 times their historical level That industry historically has had a ratio of losses to premium of about 20 percent and now has a loss ratio to premium of 90 percent So, at the margin, there is considerable difficulty in the mortgage market  No I don't have a map of the United States in my mind, Tony, but it's very widespread It includes California, with the so-called creative financing, and it includes overcommitting in the Southwest as well as the smokestack states  Mr Chairman, I would like to join those who have been warning that the interest rate projections may be on the low side, even with regard to 1984 Upward pressures on rates may find their way out even by mid-1984--not in the clash between private and public financing, which I think obviously has occurred and will occur, but between financing the international trade deficit and financing the enormous [budget] deficits Deficits in 1984 of $189 billion or $195 billion--take a number--will give us an interest rate situation, given these other assumptions in the forecast, that may catch us sooner rather than later  I look at the curves depicted in the charts here on the level of housing starts and the line in the diagram depicting business fixed investment I can't reconcile that to my expectation of interest rates rising sooner than projected here The housing curve, I believe, is unrealistic Housing doesn't reach equilibrium; housing is either rising or falling With increased interest rates, I don't think the level of housing in this projection can be achieved I'm not even sure it can be sustained with today's interest rates because much of the first-time home buyer segment has been used up and now we do not have the strength in trade-up purchases that has been typical We have mortgage payers unable to handle their financing in part because the builder points that kept their interest payments down are running out And, with an increase in interest rates in mid-1984, the adjustable rate mortgages will be adjusting upward That will increase the foreclosure rate--a depressing element on the housing market  As far as business fixed investment is concerned, I think we see here that the easy kinds of investments have been made Business firms that did have some cash and could finance themselves to easily modernize the plant or the office building have done that In a rather remote way it's [comparable] to the first-time home buyer, as these people attempt to match the hurdle rates that their boards of directors are going to require of them with what they have to pay in the stock market I would suggest to you that the broad [stock price] measures have decreased since midyear We aren't talking about financing 30 firms whose stocks go into the DOW We're talking about financing a thousand firms whose stocks are represented by the broad measures of the New York and American [Stock Exchanges] and the NASDAQ; and those broad measures have declined, not increased Add to that higher interest rates on raising credit and I think you get a flatter curve than the business fixed investment curve here So, it seems to me that those are two factors that mitigate against what some of our colleagues have indicated here might be a much stronger recovery in 1984 I join those who feel that we certainly will have a cumulative impact of the various imbalances by 1985 It seems to me that we have a considerable downside risk right now in 1984, and it  -17-    1/30-31/84  arises from the difficulty of financing the enormous mega deficit and the mega trade balance deficiency  It seems to me that one message that comes rather clearly from our discussion is that we have the usual difficulties of forecasting, projecting, and tracking what are in some cases new relationships between and among variables here and that we have an even wider range of probable outcomes around any kind of forecast assumptions this time than is typical Add to that the difficulty of looking ahead at the interaction among unknown relationships themselves and we're really in terra incognita here We really don't know when it comes to the elasticity of some components of M1 what the new market situation will be, given changes in exchange rates and given changes in interest rates We don't know what sort of impact the money fund competitors and the thrift institution competitors will have That compounds to me the uncertainties of the elasticities In such a situation, of course, we are subject to the disequilibrium impact of shocks The Argentines haven't come to the table yet; the Brazilians can come back with demands for concessions; and some kind of disturbance could arise from international credits having to be written down over some period of time Translate that into what might be required in terms of domestic lending from write- downs of that sort I only mention this to indicate that we need the flexibility that the Volcker standard would give us Therefore, I argue for utilizing the bit of additional knowledge we seem to have with regard to velocities in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on a verbal basis rather than restoring M1 to the pantheon I don't believe the markets have ever given up M1 As far as the markets are  -32-    1/30-31/84  concerned, I think they project M1 into our targeting I'm not sure there has ever been very much of a belief in our monitoring it If we put it back on Olympus, the market will say that is the Federal Reserve's target; the Federal Reserve has no others  If it's co-equal, I think they will read that as primary, Tony I would stress it a bit more in testimony and in other presentations to the public and that will in effect make it co-equal I think one must be extremely careful with regard to the handling of M1 for another reason and that is that we are as an organization, after all, a creature of Congress The Congressional consideration of the monetary aggregates has been one of a heightened degree of skepticism Therefore, if we aren't sure, why should we subject ourselves to the possible pressure to go to some other kind of perhaps unreachable target such as the unemployment rate? With regard to the alternatives, I would join the majority here with regard to alternative II I'd leave [the M1 range at] 4 to 8 percent, where it is My druthers would be to raise it to 4 to 9 percent, but 4 to 8 percent is a signal to the world that we are still aiming toward longer-range disinflation, whereas 4 to 9 percent might give a different signal I would leave [the M2 range at] 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, right where it is, for reasons of the Volcker standard I'd like to have all the flexibility we can get there, particularly when we still have a good many unknowns As I mentioned before, it is the possibility of shocks and unknowns that troubles me about changing that So, I vote for alternative II as is  Not if you have a chance  I would certainly support that After all, we are talking about 4 to 8 percent [for M1 for 1984] versus 5 to 9 percent [for 1983] Though it might be considered a gesture, we've already made a full percentage point [reduction], which may be a gesture and a half, versus 1/2 point in the [M2 range to] 6-1/2 to 9- 1/2 percent  Well, some of that financing is paid back [unintelligible]; if it replaces equity, obviously it isn't  On page [15 of the Bluebook], in paragraph (b), is it appropriate to use language that might put a little more weight on M1 at this stage, Mr Chairman, or would you rather--?  Until we get the full text?  There's one right across the hall  It's the building of all word processors, and now we can't--  ""Avoid a catastrophe""  That implies it's sustainable  It would be more, would it not? It would be something around the neighborhood of 4 to 5 percent  Yes, but not for the first quarter; we start out higher than that What's our first-quarter nominal [GNP estimate]?  With 10 percent in the first quarter, you could get 5 and 5  -43-    1/30-31/84  But the Chairman's hypothesis was Suppose money growth is below the 6 percent [midpoint], at 5 or 4 percent  It's probably more  Well, if the staff is forecasting--  In terms of this discussion, I think the wording that you have there is perfectly appropriate If you recall the amount of time we've spent on M1 and its velocity, its future configuration, and its components, that expresses the sense of the group  That's just what it says  Steve, did this exploration include exploration of small banks?  I would take some issue with Lyle's thesis I think there were several areas in which the data were disappointing or surprising Some series came out for December and for the fourth quarter that indicate that there are risks and vulnerabilities in several areas The leading indicators, of course, may now have been  -56-    1/30-31/84  reversed But the international situation is certainly not encouraging Housing has vulnerabilities that I think have not been adequately analyzed by anybody--no reflection on our staff And the fact that a lot of equipment has been purchased by industries is not the whole answer; a lot has been purchased from foreign sources It wasn't all just imports to the consumer; there were imports to business And we have not had the kind of investment revival that has been typical in recoveries This has been kind of a defensive retrofitting That's not a gross private domestic investment surge It's a defensive [approach] How can we stay in there with the prospect of a diminishing market share? I think there are a great many vulnerabilities in several areas here It isn't all on the positive side I would go for an evenhanded language format, but I don't think we can ignore the downside risks in this situation  And the GNP isn't back at a 1973-to-1980 trend line If you put any kind of trend line in there, we're still below  Yes  I do also  Where are you reading from, Lyle?  That's correct It was asymmetrical  I would support the need for a little more evidence to tighten  -63-    1/30-31/84  I think it takes more to tighten  Let them guess! Right, that builds character  -65-    1/30-31/84  It hardly meets the criticism that we fail to communicate the nuances of our policies to the public  Commodity prices don't show it  But the premise is that if we have a weak first quarter, we would have very little sign of inflation We would have the Argentineans messing up their restructuring Those would be the circumstances  Unless you're talking about-- "
2669,1984-03-26,MARTIN," It sounds good to me  Deregulation And we're relieving the reporting burden on financial institutions  You're asking for a legal opinion  You wrote 4 headlines  Second  Frank, I would join Jim in that hypothesis of the [likely] scenario What is going to happen to housing will be a credit loss not an interest rate replay of the old disintermediation process, because the thrift institutions can pay the market rate They can go buy the money  Oh, yes Look at the builders that they are working with The Pulte homes people have now issued $4 billion worth of builder bonds so far and it's on a stairstep going up The builders and the developers they are working with will simply put up the points on the front and raise the price of the house They can set the loan payment in accordance with whatever it takes to move the merchandise But I think we will have severe credit problems, maybe in '85 or '86 or whenever, and substantial thrift institution loss problems And that's what will cut off the housing--not the availability of funds  Mr Chairman, I'd like to comment on the thrift industry and housing and very briefly on this situation with regard to commercial property development and the syndication process, the limited partnership process Accepting the staff projection of interest rates, we have a situation in the thrift industry in which the losses could run between $700 million and $2-1/2 billion, depending on certain aspects of the sale of assets by these institutions As we all know, the sale of assets has been one way in which they have kept their profitability and avoided losses Of course, what is happening is that the interest rate increase that has already occurred is affecting the turnover of the 30-month obligations, many of which are coming due now And the weaker institutions may have 40 or 50 percent of their nonbrokered--I say that carefully--funds in and around that maturity category So, we are seeing the beginning of a conversion of 30 or 40 percent of the liabilities at a time when that conversion of assets can run perhaps 10 percent of the assets These interest rate increases, of course, are likely to continue at least in the near term The nonoperating  -45-    3/26-27/84  income of these institutions, which one could look at as 15 basis points or 20 basis points against the asset, is becoming increasingly difficult for them to accomplish As there is more discussion of the credit risks and the overbuilding and the question of values, it is going to be more difficult for them to attain that 15 or 20 basis points That could push them toward the upper end of that range of losses And here I'm talking about 1984 Before, at lower levels of interest rates, there was an expectation of turning over the 30-month paper at lower rates than face rates Of course, the outlook for that industry was one of reasonable profitability for this year That, of course, tends to push these savings banks into very deep operating losses It tends to produce some reliance upon the Federal Home Loan Bank System Perhaps not unduly, it tends to force even more frantic efforts to attain fee income by originating loans without, let's say, complete or careful credit analysis and risk analysis  That means, of course, that the housing numbers that are in the Greenbook could be supported with an increasing exposure of risk for these institutions, with what that means down the road We've already seen the Mortgage Bankers Association delinquency figures The foreclosure losses continue That is almost never talked about in the financial press, but the rate of foreclosure is substantial as the rate of bankruptcy continues to be on a very high plateau; [so], in another segment of the private economy the foreclosure losses are very substantial With regard to the comments on commercial development, of course, the new element in housing is the builder bonds As I've indicated, in one case that is a rather large number The newer element in commercial development is, of course, the limited partnership syndicate that the Congress has been trying to address in some of the so-called ""loophole closing"" proposals Those syndicates continue to flourish; the limited partnership sales are substantial Down the road that is going to mean that these heavy vacancies are going to cause those partnership interests to be of little or no value, with a resulting impact on the commercial development process My only point is that as we witness the interest rates unfolding as given in this scenario here, we're building up a future problem in housing, in development companies, and in the commercial real estate sector of the economy All those things inevitably will produce losses and close thrift institutions and commercial banks and other kinds of enterprises down the road  $100 billion  I would like to join those who indicated yesterday that there are number of signposts leading us to something like an 85 percent capacity figure as in 1978 and 6 percent unemployment--putting us at or even below the natural rate of unemployment But I think there may be some merit in qualifying those trends In talking about 80 or 85 percent capacity in this second year of recovery I think probably all of us are keeping in mind that the importance of imports both to the business sector and to the consumer sector is different this time Capacity of 81 or 82 percent in the United States doesn't mean 81 or 82 percent capacity in Germany or the United Kingdom or Japan or for the steel producers in Brazil or for the exporters to the United States in Mexico and so forth In terms of our stress on industrial production, I think it is appropriate These are rather spectacular increases but the context is that manufacturing--I'm varying my element here a bit--accounts for something like 25 percent of the labor force In the short run, it isn't so much a matter of industrial production as it is perhaps production of value in services and employment in the services industry I recognize that that has shown a strong increase also, but I don't think we are talking about 81 percent of capacity of offices or of computers or telephones or the other tools in the services area So, I think it needs to be qualified a little  Secondly, the vulnerability of some sectors has been mentioned I have some difficulties going from the staff forecast to the alternatives on page 6 My difficulties are--let me characterize it unfairly--the gaps between the rates of growth in alternatives A, B, and C I have a little difficulty moving from a 6-1/2 percent growth in M1 to an 8 percent growth That's a rather heroic jump to me My druthers are for an ""A prime"" where we look at the 7 percent that we've just been told is the [projected] rate for M1 in March We might wind up at 7-1/4 percent or somewhere in between [the 6-1/2 and 8 percent rates of Alternatives B and A] I don't have any marvelous econometric approach here to give you I'm just going in the middle [of the Bluebook ranges]--for the M2 figures and the M3 figures and a federal funds rate that perhaps would stop at 11 percent and not at 11-1/2 percent I'm impressed by the hints of the lagged effect of the interest rate increases we've already had One mentioned yesterday was of 125 basis points on CDs and 100 points in this maturity and 80 points in that maturity We haven't seen the effects of the lag response to those numbers So, I would vote for an ""A prime,"" if you will, with borrowings around $800 million, not a billion, and a 10-1/4 to 10-3/4 or even 11 percent range on fed funds I agree with Governor Rice that we ought to be a bit flexible with regard to fed funds The market is moving and we should to some degree validate the moving But I think too much of a slowing now might indeed be a shock, considering the vulnerabilities and the potential softness that we face, as noted by the Chairman in his usual, very good summary statement So, I vote for an ""A prime""  ""A minus"" Thank you  The old directive also put the aggregates up front  I would not go along with 8 to 12  We were at 9-1/2 percent a long time There is a little arithmetic one can do vis-a-vis 11-1/2 percent  Somewhat  The 7 percent that you're estimating would take us above?  Isn't the federal funds rate under 11 percent then? You quoted 10-3/4 and 10-1/2 percent  I think you're right, Chairman But isn't there some difference of view here as to how much tighter or less accommodative [we should be]?  And in some foreign capitals  I don't think anybody is arguing that we should do that, Henry And that may be the bare minimum I remind the group that the staff forecast is still geared around a statement that the risk of error is on the down side not on the up side, and there is considerable merit in my view in that position So, we do need flexibility in both directions I haven't any problem with a directive--either draft of the statement--that emphasizes the tightening side and not the more accommodative side, but I think both sides need to be in there  I join Roger if Roger is still where Roger was after this discussion--no offense, Roger To have 11 percent after the number of weeks we were at 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent and to have it hold any length of time at all I think would be an undue [increase]  And for those who feel there isn't room for action, there is some some distance between 11 percent and 7 percent  At 11 percent  But it has only been six weeks and rates have gone up 125 points How fast do you want to move?  I would agree with Tony, but I don't think it's 25 basis points; it's more likely 50 I think we're talking [about going from] 10-1/4 percent to 10-3/4 percent  Of course it will  It's way too fast for one quarter  7 to 11  ""Increase somewhat""  Because it moved from 0  I would share that concern I think we need to move up front the language with regard to the economy That's what we've been discussing here--the economy  And may have interest rate effects itself  We could actually use ranges  You could say M1 from a range of 1 to N!  That's the fact of the matter That's the way we've been discussing it We have been talking about M1 all the time; we haven't been talking about M3 much  Isn't the rate of credit growth the end of the parade here? We've been bringing it up in our consideration a good deal more, it seems to me, at this meeting  In our discussions we certainly have given it a good deal of consideration "
2699,1984-05-21,MARTIN," Second  But the focus of the questions is not on one or more individual cases  Peter, have you been able to execute these operations while observing the markets performing more or less normally? I realize that's a matter of definition right now--with the 1-point changes over short periods of time    5/21-22/84  The particular mopping up  Looking into the immediate future then, is there an implication in that behavior that you just described? Let us assume, or let us hope, that the Continental matter works its way through, that there is a merger partner, and that it's resolved in some reasonable way Would you anticipate that the 1-point changes and the volatility that we observed in the market, particularly in the long end, will subside? Or is there a situation or an attitude that may resist improving?  We still have the LDC problem  That was the only time the limit was reached in that period?  But many hedging programs are incomplete Isn't it unusual that a dealer would hedge completely? Usually hedging means an 80 percent hedge or a 70 percent hedge  Well, when the markets see these spot and futures spreads are not necessarily holding-- You can be completely hedged and if the spreads change, you may lose There is no such thing as a perfect hedge  Mr Chairman, I would like to pick up on the comments that have been made already by my two colleagues with regard to the labor situation We had the benefit on May 11 of the economic consultants being in our midst and of the work in that area by Arnie Weber of Colorado, Bob Gordon, and others, coupled with work that has been forthcoming from Kendrick and Dennison and others in the productivity field That work points toward a rather different labor/ management situation, or at least some degrees of difference We are all focusing on the upcoming auto settlements position on that, as perhaps everybody in the room knows, is that the auto settlement will not be a leading indicator this time--that there is a special situation there that won't affect steel that much and won't affect construction and won't affect the other major settlements coming along position stems in part, I think, from a rather more optimistic look at the cost push from unit labor costs He is a bit more optimistic than our colleagues here at the Board, for example He cites the restructuring of bargaining--a company-by- company approach--and even the changes in the preparatory stages for these settlements So, his conclusion was that it is unlikely that the average settlements will exceed the 5 percent range in the next three years There again he's talking about the inertia in settlements and the fact that these arrangements have a way of holding for quite some time as a precedent On the productivity side, I would be the first to concede that none of the people that I've cited, including my [unintelligible] has given any reason to be wildly optimistic On the other hand, there are scattered indications that productivity may come back closer to the trend line of the '50s and '60s [than] the negative or flat trend of the '70s or the staff projection, if I remember it correctly, of something like 1 to 1-1/4 percent You can find quite a bit of evidence that productivity is going to more in the area of 1-1/2 to 2 percent If you recall the work that was presented at a previous FOMC meeting on the subject of inflation, productivity, and labor costs, and the relationship in a leading sense between the changes in unit labor costs and inflation, if indeed the slightly more optimistic numbers are true and if and his people are somewhat correct, then you have a different cost/ push coming from labor this time and one that is more conducive to disinflation or less inflation  There is one other area I would like to mention since I don't dare talk about the thrift institutions and how much they're losing today because all of you are quite sick of my attempt to measure that industry Besides, I think everybody in the room is aware that the three big savings banks in New York City are very much under water, that the thrift industry is now operating in the red, and that they are beginning to run out of the funny accounting practices that they have been participating in They are quite ingenious; they may invent whole new areas in which they can distort their reporting of loss  But turning to agriculture, I simply want to mention--and I do this with great humility considering that those of you who come from the regional Banks in agricultural areas undoubtedly are aware from your own Districts of the continued plight in agriculture--the proportion of farmers operating in the red There was a bank survey showing something like 40 percent of the ag borrowers are operating at zero or in the red The foreclosure or impending foreclosure numbers out of that ABA survey were 2-1/2 percent of the agricultural borrowers; and 8 or 9 percent were in the so-called distressed  -11-    5/21-22/84  category as far as their credit outlook is concerned So, I would join my Cleveland colleague--I refuse to use these darn District numbers--in talking about the vulnerabilities in the bond market, the LDCs, the thrifts, and agriculture It's a different recovery in that sense, in my not so humble opinion  Can't get away from them!  Yes I think it will be extended for both the savings banks, which need it more, and the other thrift institutions  Well, the thrift holding company types, such as Financial Corporation of America, are tremendously leveraged and are betting on lower--much lower--interest rates It's simply a rotten barrel  Well, let me clarify my figures of 87 percent in distress and 25 percent in imminent foreclosure That's an ABA survey published in January of '84, so it's ex post and is prior to some of the increases in rates The lag effects of the most recent interest rate increases are not in those data  I think that's going on, but also what is going on are changes in work rules and the ability to assign workers by shifts and the ability to redefine the job so that the job is not strictly defined by the unions  Peter, my question about the $1 billion in borrowing is Now that contemporaneous reserve requirements have been more understood and more adjusted to, what implication for excess reserves does $1 billion in borrowing have?  We talked about $1 billion and $600 million in borrowings and excess reserves, respectively, last time in the face of the adjustments Do you feel there would be no difference in the federal funds rate at around 10-3/4 percent Is that fair?  10-1/2  We have language that would handle that or we could compose some language--  Excuse me, Jerry Don't we meet on July 10-11?  I think the indications of future inflation are weak I think the relationships among and between many of the aggregates this time are somewhat different and alternative B has the logic of giving us time to observe the lagged effects of the very substantial changes in interest rates we've already had And, in order to add an element to the discussion that we have all been a little too polite to enunciate, I will say that we are in such an intense political environment at the moment, with so much scrutiny from the Hill and elsewhere about what we are alleged to be doing, that holding to the course--if that's what alternative B with $1 billion in borrowing and $600 million in excess reserves means--is called for both for economic and political considerations So, I would vote for ""B"" Obviously, the Chairman and our associates on the Desk need some flexibility It seems to me that excess reserves possibly ought to be $500 to $700 million because of our uncertainties as to how the Continental situation and other developments will affect borrowing levels I would not quite go along with Lyle on this, but I think the borrowing range ought to be $900 million to $11 billion for the same reason  Of course, the real Fed watchers will compare the two operational paragraphs and say Aha! They added ""financial markets""  It's a living for those guys  I agree I think it's a hazard to signal another 1/2 point after the outcry from [unintelligible] and other people for the last 1/2 point  Let's leave it in  So would I  Let's vote  I certainly do "
2726,1984-07-16,MARTIN," So moved  Let me raise a question about your comment with regard to long-term productivity growth I'm going to give you the Kendrick argument--you know whom I'm referring to--and then you shoot it down The demographics are favoring productivity with regard to the age brackets, the experience of the labor force--women in the labor force having been on the job a while--and deregulation Labor and management have negotiated quite a few work rule changes [Management can say] Work on this machine, work on that line, work on this shift, work on that shift There has been a good deal of investment in business equipment, including computers The computers may be a negative, but at any rate a lot of money has been spent on them supposedly leading to some kind of [increased] output There is less environmental investment these days; there is not quite so much worry about what the smokestack looks like but whether or not there is    7/16-17/84  somebody working underneath the smokestack Management attitudes are a little different; there is a younger breed in some cases We have people who have experienced many years of slow growth and a couple of recessions that were close together Supposedly there is some change in that There is foreign competition I could go on and on But we have a whole number of factors that point toward getting back to the more historic trend in productivity--2 percent or whatever that is-- and yet we seem to be gearing on the 1 percent This makes a difference in unit labor cost, etc, etc Can you help me?  I would suggest to you that a part of that is a lag phenomenon That is, the economy took on so many employees so quickly here that even if these other factors that I cited were working toward a 2 or 2-1/2 percent productivity increase, almost 7 million people were hired in this past 20 months or whatever and--    7/16-17/84  Right It has  If the indexing stays in the statute, how does that affect things?  If you took some other period prior to the first oil shock--I don't know what period, but suppose you took 1965 through 1974 or something like that--what kind of independent variables would you get and what kind of model would that produce?  Not only are there firms that are reluctant to raise prices but some firms have raised prices and have had to back off  Well, Mr Chairman, we have discussed whether or not this expansion is typical of cycles, if we eliminate a couple of them It seems to me that this expansion is significantly more vigorous than the typical cycle That's certainly true of employment, as we have already touched upon That always raises the question of whether we try to do too much in too short a period of time--in 20 months or whatever it has been Is this expansion too fast in the sense of being inflationary? It seems to me that there already has been some slowing We all have conceded the difficulties of forecasting and we know numbers are revised and revised and revised But, just looking at the numbers, in terms of nominal GNP the range is 139 to 98 percent [unintelligible] In the [remarks] of our twelve colleagues around the country, the comment that the rate of expansion is slowing is almost unanimously true of that group Is a drop in nominal of 41 percentage points over some period of time enough? If we look at the calendar year 1985, using the staff forecast we get nominal GNP of 84 percent Is that still too high a rate of growth?  -16-    7/16-17/84  I think in terms of those absolutes, it's difficult to make a case Is business fixed investment coming on stream too fast? The first estimate of the rate of growth in the second quarter was almost 21 percent But it is equipping; it is retrofitting; it is productivity oriented; and it's pretty short term Only now are we beginning to build a plant as distinct from equipment, and so the payback in terms of output should be reasonably short term As for capacity utilization, it's difficult to factor in all that retrofitting of plant into the bare number of the domestic capacity utilization and, unfortunately, no one has figured a really good way to figure the capacity utilization of all those thousands of firms around the Pacific Basin and in Europe and the developing countries that are selling to us I don't know how to measure it; maybe no one knows how to measure that capacity utilization Are we expanding too fast? We're not back to any reasonable trend line using various recent periods of time and using GNP growth It seems to me that the case for arguing that we're expanding too fast is a weak one I've tried to reflect that and probably have failed in my numbers, which are somewhat at variance with those of the staff  If it's a target, then that would argue for changing the range  Given the acquisitions, mergers, and leveraged buyout situation, I would argue that it is acceptable  But the 1 percent is a very feeble measure of the volume of leveraged buyouts, mergers, and acquisitions It only measures the very biggest ones And this phenomenon is happening throughout the industrial complex and the services [industry]  It's not enough  Construction union?  Not only the threat, but the utilization by developers of non-union workers  Or the competition that you mentioned yesterday  A million jobs The coal miners Nothing significant!  It may be politically very attractive to go after the budget after the election  It's the going after it; it's the form, not the substance  That would be the reason I would support your suggestion of a standardized assumption, whatever the percentage is  But why did the OECD take the position in the first place, Henry, unless there had been some good and compelling reasons to get them to square one?  Mr Chairman, it is just a matter of emphasis It would seem to me that in the presentation we shouldn't couple the importance of M3 and debt We are learning something about what information the debt numbers will give us My only footnote to that to join the raised hands would be that we differentiate between the two aggregates M3 is more important  And we are so uncertain about the merger/ acquisition/LBO component of debt that I don't see how we could--  We already sent out a caution on the LBOs  It means we would adjust the ranges  Or don't want that much inflation  With velocity growth moving from 2-1/2 to 4-1/2 to a presumed 2 or [a little less than] 2, we better leave some degree of freedom, by going to 7-1/2 percent rather than 7 percent for a top  I think the limitations on that kind of policy would be the emphasis we would then be putting on M1 If we single that aggregate out and reduce that one, that's the signal to watch M1 for a signal of our policy  Is it beginning to behave or are we assuming that it may behave in a more normal cyclical pattern?  Oh, a couple of quarters!  Jerry, you mentioned around 8 percent on nominal GNP for 1985; I'd be more in the 8-1/2 percent area or, optimistically, even 9 percent I think we'll do better on the deflator again as we've done better on the deflator repeatedly in very recent history I demur from the staff's productivity projections, as you know And on that basis, I would leave the ranges for the aggregates where they are for now, as under alternative Roman numeral I Then I'd be hopeful that in the review of 1985 a few months from now, we could either take the top of M1 down to 7 percent or, more importantly, take the top on M2 down to 8-1/2 or even 8 percent, as we see what happens to velocity The velocity variability has been so substantial that I'd hate to have the Chairman saddled with those assumptions in his testimony  But my point is that the economy is going to function in such a way that it will be confined It won't be exclusively [the result of] what we do  A 7-1/2 percent top for M1 wouldn't be enough of a signal?  But the election would be over  Jim, the ranges the Chairman has tentatively suggested would produce some upward pressures on interest rates according to your analysis here I've been trying to re-read this and I can't quite put it all together  I was asking Jim  There would be some upward pressure, you think?  And that would remain?  I do also  What is your evaluation of, let's say, the intermediate-term strength of the fears and the difficulties with regard to bank CDs, bank soundness, interbank market availability and so forth? Is it a passing phase associated with Continental, Argentina, and so forth? Or is something going on here that's likely to be a malaise going forward? What's your feel for it?  Move the ratification  SPEAKER(?) Second  I would certainly subscribe to the Chairman's summary analysis of where we stand I'd support the status quo I'm not sure whether alternative B is that entirely; I will in a minute comment on those numbers for the aggregates In support of the Chairman's position about the evidence of some precariousness in the financial system, I remind the Committee of the size of the largest  -58-    7/16-17/84  savings and loan holding company, the Financial Corporation of America, which is now at about $32 billion with 80 plus percent of its deposits purchased, and the FSLIC insurance fund is running at $6 billion or so I would name also the  [all of] which the FDIC has indicated it will move on promptly And we're talking about assets of $56 billion at  $66 billion at and $75 billion at Add that to the ongoing negotiations with Continental  and you get some interesting arithmetic Let's not run the signal flag up the mast, but the arithmetic [indicates] that there is certainly a vulnerability The small banks have those agricultural loans, which are not improving Well, there's no point in going through the risks; the Chairman has subsumed them in his comments  I would hope that in the implementation of alternative B there will be flexibility, frankly, on the accommodative side I have a slight difference from previous commentators in that I think the risks are rather imminent And I would hope that the usual good sense is applied by the people at the Desk and the people here, as was evidenced in the very recent past so that as these crises develop and as the attitudinal waves pass through the money and capital markets, there will be flexibility on the accommodative side, which hopefully we can pick up coming round the barn, so to speak We should all be aware, if alternative B is the consensus here, that relative to the March-to-June pace for M1 and M2 we're talking of moving from an 8-1/4 percent M1--I believe my numbers are right here--to 5-1/2 percent on M1 We're talking about M2 moving from something like 10-1/4 percent March-to-June to 7-1/2 percent To me, that's too much So, I'm somewhere between ""A"" and ""B"" I don't want to give the false signals of trying to soften interest rates that A implies, if I read this correctly Nevertheless, I'm uncomfortable that we're bringing these aggregates down too fast as implied in ""B"" So it seems to me that we should give authority toward ""B"" but--yes, Steve?  Oh! What is it for the March[-to-June period]?  Oh, all right I'm sorry So it's true for M1 but not M2  I stand corrected  For the three months?  -59-    7/16-17/84  So, I'm an ""A to B"" type, Mr Chairman  I'd like to see the borrowing at $1 billion but, as the difficulties develop, I'd like to see if we could go to $900 to $1 billion In other words, Tony, I'm arguing for a little flexibility on the accommodative side because I take these risks and these vulnerabilities very seriously  I like the first story!  I could not support an asymmetrical directive I don't know whether implicit in such a directive and not enunciated because of the sensitivity of it would be an understanding that if there began to be trouble in financial markets, we would move in the other direction I take it not It would not have that  Well, I'm not sure that's where the bias should be I think it may be a view of our setting policy such that we're accused of bias in the sense that [people say] ""These guys always see inflation coming, no matter what the price figures are"" I think we have to avoid that appearance  ""Knee-jerk inflation fighters"" is the quote That's a very unfair remark, but we do receive it  Yes, but always?  Because of certain--  I think that's reasonable  I don't have any trouble with that  You wouldn't have to take a calculator to Europe then! "
2753,1984-08-21,MARTIN," Move approval  Move approval  Yes, it may be that it will require a FHLB or FSLIC guarantee behind even a collateralized loan to provide enough liquidity even in the very short run on a day-to-day basis  No  Bob, back to your question again, the last figure we had yesterday on the American Savings & Loan borrowing from the HLB--and I can be corrected by staff--was about $23 billion There was a reduction because of the payback out of the  credit extended on a portfolio of single-family residential mortgages So, they paid down part of a HLB balance that was running about $3 billion They--temporarily, I stress--paid it down to about $23 billion yesterday Of course, this morning at 900 am California time, they may be right back to that or even higher  It's a combination of things, including the bit more autonomy that a HLB Board of Directors has compared to a Federal Reserve Bank Board of Directors  Of course they have a run on They have had a run on now--  So, the so-called retail is very frequently a result of telephone solicitation in a city like Washington, DC by an employee of FCA or by American That's so-called retail It's not from Merrill Lynch That makes it retail  1,000  Counting everybody  The only matter that one could say was well done in this whole thing--and not from a moral point of view--has been the management of news by these folks  I was trying to avoid that term, John    8/21/84  Second  In support, Jim, of our outlook for inflation, I think we need to be careful not to assume that the projected changes in the value of the dollar--I'm being serious now--will have the kinds of impact on domestic producers and on prices of both business goods and consumer goods as was true in many other expansion periods It seems to me that the loss of share of the market to foreign suppliers --to the out-sourcing entities--is to a large degree a fairly long- term loss of those markets Domestic producers and domestic sellers may get those markets back or they may not, and those are important market gains to the foreign producer He is going to hold on to that market share if that means price concessions or price steadiness I think the American consumer will benefit from that So, the loss of share of the market has a positive impact on domestic inflation in this country  And those industries will find all kinds of ingenious ways to get around those measures unless they are very, very broad and firm indeed  They are going to have slow growth in their own economies, Tony Their own markets are not expanding the way their share of our markets is expanding They have a very great incentive to hold their prices or not increase them much, and that puts pressure on our price setters These are administered prices and it is very important to keep them steady because they have just gotten that share of the market If you have just penetrated it, you are going to be very careful in your pricing These are cartel mentalities from these other countries They have a different legal scheme where they are going to administer those prices carefully, I think, to maintain their market share in the world's biggest market  I do, sir We're talking about the short run  For a while  I think we'll have more lag  In a recession?  And the rate of productivity increase is much higher  Relative to the 1970s  29 percent and 33 percent are the numbers  I'm glad you asked that question, Henry  The first one was in 1973  Mr Chairman, I think any effort to try to isolate factors that might result in a sharp slowing [of the expansion] or, as you put it, even an indication of a possibility--I won't even say probability--of recession should take into account the possibility of greatly increased nervousness on the part of consumers/ savers/depositors with regard to the thrift industry and to some extent the heightened concern about commercial banking I'm prepared to expand on that theme, as I'm sure you're all delighted to hear We have a major holder of household deposits--$900 billion or a trillion or whatever the number is, including the savings banks--and the news and the facts with regard to those industries are going to be very negative I would guess, not out of any expertise, that the media will find the ongoing saga of difficulties in thrift institutions and questions about the efficacy of the deposit insurance system a potentially depressing factor on consumer behavior I'm only saying this in response to your suggestion that we examine some of the downside factors, and this to me is a real one I don't know what probability to attach to it  Yes  I would appropriate between $5 and $10 billion dollars for the FSLIC and whatever billion the actual analysis showed me for the FDIC  It's a $33 billion dollar savings and loan holding company  They'd have to resort to Section 207 of the Act in the Home Loan Bank System and find that it was unsafe and unsound I shouldn't try to practice law here, but they would have to go  -18-    8/21/84  further than imprudent and that's quite a finding, as we all very well know  Regulation is ex post Supervision of financial institutions is always ex post, by the nature of it  If you recall the Chairman's data on recent major settlements that he gave us six weeks ago, there was a string of no COLA, no COLA, no COLA, small COLA, and so on in that  But the COLAs were almost all absent  Mr Chairman, I appreciated Lyle's brief analysis of the difficulties of estimating productivity He does well to remind us of the errors we've all made in the past Maybe the staff has made fewer than the rest of us; I don't know I think we're making a corresponding error today We are underestimating The 1- 1/4 percent trend line is not the trend line; it's more like 2 percent I think we're returning to the trend line, but I have a different trend line, Jim My reason is that we're a services and information workers society now, not manufacturing Yet we are--maybe not overly obsessed, but--overly concerned with manufacturing output Finally, I think that software works Finally, an ordinary human being, not a wizard, can work a personal computer or a terminal or something like that And that has permeated the services side of our economy--the sector from which people said we could not get productivity increases just as they used to say about restaurants before McDonald's came along and showed productivity in that area This will be the surprise on the productivity side of our society--the rising output in services I'm not saying the services are going to be anything we really need, but I think we're going to have a lot more of them, however you measure that So, I believe that will keep inflation at the staff's [projected] level or even a touch better  The other factor that is going to contribute to less inflation is one that I deplore, and that is the impact on the financial system of failing thrift institutions against a backdrop, of a government institution--namely the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation--that is too small Whatever has to be done about that as institutions fail--whatever receivership or conservatorship pattern we will suffer through in the next few years from that side of the economy and maybe some additional failing banks, given the rate at which banks are failing--will change the consumers' outlook I don't think the American public is prepared for the kind of questioning that will result from these failures And it may well result from substantial volumes of uninsured deposits at one or more institutions having to be paid back at less than 100 cents on the dollar out of asset administration which takes many years If it is thrift institutions, these tend to be long-term assets and the payout period is long and the interest is lost I believe this is going to be a material factor in the thinking of the American public with regard to their own finances and their own consumption function, if you will, over the next few years I think that will affect inflation in a positive direction now, though it's unfortunate that it's coming from that side  To translate that into policy, I would go along with the Chairman's suggestion, which he says he didn't want to make too firmly, to keep policy where it is in terms of the directive of a few weeks ago with the exception that I would join my esteemed colleague, Governor Partee, in favoring $800 million in borrowing I would leave the range on fed funds alone and would prefer the $800 million on borrowing to give us more flexibility--not only because of the aforementioned change or possible change in the commercial banks' attitude toward excess reserves, but because I feel that the financial failures will not only affect the attitude of consumers toward saving and spending, but will affect the attitude of commercial banks and  -29    8/21/84  other institutions with regard to borrowing from their respective central banks  If we reverse it, we need to reverse the sentence that shows that we did contemplate the downside risks in the financial system that we perceive could occur  But ""were"" implies it isn't going to happen  5, 7, and 9 percent "
2778,1984-10-02,MARTIN," I move the minutes, Mr Chairman  SPEAKER(?) Second  I certainly support that  Is there some significance that you didn't articulate to the $500 million?  The inevitability of gradualism! I'd go for a billion dollars Operationally, I think it makes sense  Let's hope not  Move ratification  [SPEAKER(?) Second]  To those bankers who are aware of the wildness and the degeneration in the financial position of the thrift industry in their state and their region and their market area, that surely is a factor because it is degenerating rather rapidly  In fact, they are aware that dozens of the S&Ls in their districts are going to fail and fail with a great public splash And they are aware, if they are operating nationally, that hundreds of them are going to fail I can see that in the bankers' psychology  Exactly They will definitely increase their--  I'm not talking about a bank I'm talking about thrift institutions Some of them are in your backyard, good sir  All right  Move approval  [SPEAKER(?) Second]  We had the McGraw-Hill survey, too  I appreciated Jim's comment on the 25 percent probability from the model of zero growth in the fourth quarter  It seems to me that when we refer to the slowdown in growth we're talking about a change from 101 percent real GNP growth in the first quarter to 27 percent in the third quarter I suppose that's a slowdown rather than a jamming on the brakes, but it is reasonably significant Henry's point is well placed with regard to consumer behavior and the probability of the consumer coming back, particularly in the durables area The other side of that coin is the consumer coming back to a saving rate that might reflect the news that I expect to occur with regard to failing thrift institutions and commercial banks as the year wears on [When] the November 14 report of Financial Corporation of America comes upon the media and other institutions show difficulties, it could even be that the consumer will feel that saving may be a little more desirable I don't know what the probability of that is but there is some    10/2/84  probability Of course, then the question is raised as to saving into what As to the notion of a return in the nondefense capital goods area to a much stronger rate of spending, I think there is a great deal of uncertainty there and that uncertainty stems from the very point that the Chairman underlined previously, which is that interest rates are still relatively high and profit margins, due to foreign competition, are the narrowest in many, many industrial categories that they have been in several decades And that certainly tends to weigh a bit upon a board of directors realizing that because of the financing gap they have to go outside They can't do as they did in the earlier stages of the expansion and finance from internal sources  So, it seems to me, though I don't know what the probability is, that there is a risk--not the risk that we will have such a bad fourth quarter or first or second quarter going forward, but the risk of an earlier end to this expansion than would be desirable considering the need to face fiscal policy decisions in '85 And those are decisions that can best be made in [an environment] of a trend rate of real growth or even a 3 to 4 percent rate of growth rather than an expectation that the recession is around the corner and, therefore, it's too late to do anything in the fiscal policy area I reiterate my concern about financial institutions and their lack of financial soundness and the vulnerability that the expansion has to the fact that this will be developing later this year and into next year So, it seems to me that the Chairman needs to have flexibility and that we need to build into our thinking quite a bit of flexibility so that we can move, particularly to offset downward pressures, in the short- or intermediate-term future  They could come back, [given] the discounting techniques to move the merchandise I've heard [that their approach is] Never mind what the price is; [unintelligible]; let's do something else here to move the merchandise  Mr Chairman, I think that the growth in M1 and the growth in M2 over the last 4 months or so deserve some underlining here The lack of growth in the monetary aggregates and the flat configuration of the curve of reserve growth argue, as one of our colleagues here indicated, for probing in the direction of restoring M1 and M2 to a somewhat higher configuration over the next weeks It also seems to me that the slowing of the economy's rate of growth and the uncertainty with regard to nondefense capital spending suggest a probing in that direction I would join Governor Gramley in his assertion that a 25 percent annual rate of growth of capital spending is not appropriate at this stage of the cycle, but I would also point out that we've had some minus figures in the nondefense capital area for two months and that the purchasing agents indicate strongly that this continued for a third month in September I'm not sanguine that the consumers are going to come back that quickly On top of the rationale stemming from the aggregates and from the reserve growth pattern you add the high uncertainties with regard to a possible growth recession--whatever that is--in the fourth quarter or the first quarter or both We can certainly have two quarters of very, very low growth with the implication that says to the Congress when they come back--after all, we're talking about policies that will have some impact four or six or eight months from now just at the time when the Congress is back--and the question of taking some responsibility for fiscal policy is in the offing If we have 1 or 2 percent real growth at that time, what prospect is there for some degree of responsibility for fiscal policy?  And finally, it seems to me that the behavior pattern that Steve described with regard to borrowing, with regard to fed funds provision, and with regard to excess reserve positions on the part of the banking community will probably be reinforced This aberrant behavior, if you will, that has kept the fed funds rate where it is despite almost daily intervention by us, despite the reserve position, and the borrowing position of the banking community, is going to be reinforced by the bad news that's going to come out of commercial banks and thrift institutions instance after instance And we know this bad news is coming and that it is certainly not going to build confidence It seems to me we should probe from the current level of $750 million of borrowing, from the current 11 to 11-1/2 percent level  -25-    10/2/84  of fed funds, and from the current level of excess reserves carefully down toward the levels specified in ""A"" In other words, I recommend we start at the current levels and move very carefully toward ""A,"" consulting as you will with this Committee, Mr Chairman But, certainly, a $600 million level of borrowing is not out of the question; and if it takes a $500 million level of borrowing to get to that 10 to 10-1/2 percent range for fed funds, then so be it A third reason for probing and moving in that direction is, of course, the dollar situation, which has been thoroughly discussed here and which is giving our central banker colleagues in Europe and Japan difficulties To me, the aggregates, the economy, and the dollar argue for a careful probing movement in the direction of whatever it takes to bring the rate down in the direction of the level specified in ""A""  But not necessarily the money supply  You can't cover every eventuality  When we've had them for four months!  [Is] the short run 3 to 4 months?  Continued moderation in economic activity and inflationary pressures  Then we want 8 "
2802,1984-11-07,MARTIN," So moved  So moved  I just want to underline some of the mixed signals, Jim I note that the Michigan consumer confidence measure was off a little in October I don't put a big weight on that The hours worked quantum always puzzles me a bit, but I notice the hours worked were down in October according to the Labor Department The Chairman has mentioned that initial claims for unemployment were up The purchasing agents survey is not a good quantitative measure--it was revised three times ex post out of the [unintelligible] data--but for whatever it's worth it shows reductions in new orders, delivery speed, inventories, and payrolls, and less price increases I think perhaps more important were the preliminary indications that the third-quarter real GNP may be revised downward due to the merchandise trade deficit number If that is 17, not 27 percent, it may require a rethinking of some of the inventory changes It already has been revised down once from 36 percent I don't know what a soft landing is, but an 80 percent decline from the first half, when we had GNP growth of 84 percent--I don't know how soft that landing is The undercarriage of the vehicle may be slightly bent in that kind of [scenario]  It's above the runway but perhaps without any wheels! At any rate, your comment with regard to oil prices, food prices, and other indications of inflation out there in the future is reassuring Imports are still soaring--I'm tying onto the Chairman's comments as usual here--but those imports are having employment and income effects in US firms We know that It seems to me that there is a risk of a growth recession in the first and second quarters of next year I too have talked to retailers who feel they will get through the holiday selling season well and then have very quiet first and second quarters And I see the risk of a growth recession, with rising unemployment and very low real growth taking off from that 17 or 15 percent I saw one model's output that had 12 percent for the third quarter, which I don't believe, but it begins to get your attention, I think The consumer comes into the first and second quarters with all those new cars bought on credit and all those other consumer durables and is paying the kinds of real interest rates one pays today, and I don't know whether that adds up to a snapback or not It doesn't to me I think that the risk is so high that we should be very concerned about it If we get your [projected] 35 percent real [GNP] for the fourth quarter and run along at about 3 or 3-1/2 percent for 1985--given the margin of error, no disrespect intended--it seems to me that again gets to be a precarious position to be in with a substantial downside risk If we get one or two exogenous factors in there when the economy is hovering around a 3 percent level, unemployment can get started up again The foreign competitor is still cutting into those employment rolls So, I think the margin of error is substantial I would hate to see the Congress come back into this town, this font of all the wisdom in the universe, facing a 1 percent real growth figure and rising unemployment We would just get some dandy decisions in the fiscal area in that circumstance I think we are facing an increasing downside risk  Jim, what about the probabilities in the first and second quarters?  Let's see if they told you the same thing they told me!  They did  Steve, you commented on the possible impact of the MMDA alternative to less interest [on] transaction balances I take it you were referring to the surprise in October?  But why wouldn't that kind of impact occur when the rates first dropped?  But my question is Why wouldn't that have occurred earlier than October? I am trying to figure out October and I can't  Within 10!  Mr Chairman, I don't want to put too much emphasis in our discussion on M1 in a single month, despite the magnitude of that surprise decline of 7 or 7-1/2 percent--I think that's what I heard Steve say--in October If it carries over into this month, though, I think it deserves some weight given that there are so many uncertainties from the real economy that we've all been sharing with one another here It's so difficult to forecast not only the fourth quarter but the first and second quarters of next year when I think there is a high probability of some difficulties Yes, even the third quarter is still [uncertain]  I realize that  So the 7 percent for November in alternative A--  Of course, it is now way out on the curve somewhere I take it so is the 7 percent in alternative B  If it were a perfect world--which it isn't, of course--the ideal targeting would be something around the midpoint for M1 and M2 We're getting somewhat different information from M2 Maybe it is a relief in that we are not getting quite the same message as from M1 But [the midpoint] obviously is not a potential in either of the alternatives as regards what could be done the rest of the year and beginning in the first quarter in terms of getting levels up to a point that would be consonant with a reasonable rate of real growth in the economy There is no point in belaboring the lessons from the real side of the economy And you are tired of hearing me talk about risks in the financial system--in thrift institutions, agricultural banks, and all the rest I won't make my usual [comments] and take up your time--all this overhead sitting around the room--with that But still, it seems to me that we can pay some more attention valuably to the aggregates, particularly M1 and M2, now I am not clear with regard to M3 The risk of a growth recession is greatly enhanced if M1 is allowed to decelerate sharply for the whole fourth quarter And even if we were to set an operating procedure and some short-term targets in which we overshot the midpoint, I don't see under these circumstances--with inflation being under control, the low M1 figure we have had, and the uncertainties in the economy--that that's a substantial risk  So, I come down for alternative A Given what Steve and the Chairman have just discussed with regard to the growth of M1 and M2 for the fourth quarter, those are not modest figures but they're a long way from getting us to the midpoint [of our long-run targets] As I understand it, very temporarily--hopefully very temporarily--the M1 figure is almost at the bottom of the range; it is within $400 to $600 million of the bottom So, it seems to me that alternative A doesn't produce any kind of configuration vis-a-vis the midpoint of either of those two ranges to have any implication of overstimulation or the revival of inflation Given what Steve and his colleagues have laid out here in terms of borrowing getting down considerably below Tony's number, it seems to me it would be well to go for the $400 to $500 million level If that results in a fed funds rate rate below 9 percent or in the 9 to 9-1/2 percent range, that doesn't seem to me a problem It was well said that we don't know what the implications are of the decline in interest rates that has already occurred I agree with that We also don't know the implications of 4 or maybe 5 months of decline in the growth of M1 particularly and to a lesser degree of M2 We don't know what the aggregates track will turn out to be going into the first quarter, so it seems to me that we are in a position of being able to change our targeting in an accommodative direction without any substantial risk of reigniting inflationary  -28-    11/7/84  factors I say again, at the risk of turning you all off, that if a fiscal policy question is going to confront the nation early next year, I would hate to see that confrontation with 1 percent real growth and unemployment heading for 8 percent or something of that sort I vote for ""A,"" Mr Chairman  And if the purchasing agents are right, we're not going to get a plus number  That's right  We don't have any real reason for the shortfalls and how to read them  Yes  SPEAKER(?) I guess so  We don't want to end up being the turkey!  What would the second step be?  -48-    11/7/84  Would it be at $550 million then?  I'd just like to see you have the flexibility to go to $400 million if the market conditions and the economy dictate  7 to 11?  That's the problem  -53-    11/7/84 "
2828,1984-12-17,MARTIN," Second  Steve, with regard to the question of rebasing Are you saying, in the absence of new savings instruments or other institutional changes, that if we were to select the midpoint of the fourth quarter or the midpoint of the year or something of that sort, that based on that rather hypothetical level we would tend to be locked in and have to, in effect, use that procedure in the future?  Precedent  That raises the question of the presentation-- the geometry that is so bedeviling in using that cone When we start off above or below the line so drawn, if we could express it in terms of some kind of plus or minus a parallel line--  SPEAKER(?) Yes, I saw them in the Bluebook  I would agree with Tony that it looks as though it's a major move It's hard to explain I don't think it is a very good idea  But if the FOMC had chosen some percentage [of automaticity], say, 25 or 50, the Committee would know a priori what form the implementation would take  Well, it seems to me that Steve's paper indicates that the reason for this proposal--other than the fact that proposals in Washington never die, they just come back around after a while--is that he detects a tendency to accommodate in part undesired swings in money demand I suppose that is a more eloquent way of saying that we tend to be a little too late in our movements, depending in part on the direction of the so-called undesired swings If that's true, then it seems to me that there is merit in this proposal in terms of ""expectability"" One would know as a member of this Committee, within these very small gradations, the move that would take place I have confidence in not only my own judgment but in that of the Chairman, vis-a-vis his immediate comment here And I'm sure he would in appropriate circumstances overrule the rule What we're talking about are small gradations In the example given,  -17-    12/17-18/84  if you start at $650 million of borrowing, the $70 million [change] for the $2 billion deviation from what I take is a quarterly path, gets us what--25 or 30 basis points change in the fed funds rate, or something of that sort and a 25 basis points change in M1 [growth] or 50 basis points or something like that? We're talking about finite gradations of change, whatever the numbers are  It wouldn't get you that much?  Well, these are small gradations And it seems to me that that argues for building in some technique useful in [making] the judgment If we adopt this, I think this Committee should from time-to-time set that percentage [rather than] simply accept 50 or 25 percent, because isn't it true that the impact would vary depending on the level at which borrowing started? So, I would say this is a good idea, but let's have some setting of the percentage  Mr Chairman, with regard to your question as to the ""satisfactoriness"" of the 29 percent Greenbook projection for next year, I have some discomfort with the confidence factor around that 29 percent It's so difficult to forecast today We have good forecasters here and they have difficulty I would move away from Jim's position that the risks are balanced It seems to me that there are some areas that point toward downside risks--notably the reliance on the consumer rather than a BFI-led third year [of recovery], which was the scenario not too long ago Now we have in our scenario, understandably, the consumer coming back in 1985 and continuing to accumulate debt very substantially, albeit not at as great a rate or for as many dollars as earlier That curve is very steep, as you will recall So, we have the consumer, who has been buying cars and durables and buying on credit and accumulating considerable debt, looked on to come back in 1985 and add to that debt very substantially I'm not sure the consumer is going to do that to that degree I'm certainly not sure the consumer is going to continue to accumulate that kind of debt in housing, despite some of the positive things that have been said about housing It's true that housing starts didn't fall much last month, only 07 percent It's true that there have been some positive figures on house sales But housing prices are not rising in many of the key submarkets around the country and that motivation for taking on housing debt and for trading up in housing is missing The delinquency rate on the residential mortgage portfolio is at unprecedented highs for this stage of an expansion-- over 4 percent There is no sign of that coming down Foreclosures are very high Add to that the need, if you're going to have housing sustained or rise, for an annual rate of 500,000 plus multiple units to the supply in '85 in the face of the syndicators who have been putting up much of this apartment property backing off because of tax uncertainty Who is going to finance the massive blocks of apartments needed to maintain housing starts at 17 million units or some number like that when a third of it has to be multifamily units and the syndicators and the other speculative builders are somewhat deterred by the discussion of a change to the tax situation?  So, I don't think 29 percent [real GNP growth] is satisfactory I think that has a policy implication, Mr Chairman I would be a lot happier with a 4 percent plus or minus number rather than 29 percent It indicates to me that we should address our policy in that direction You raised the question of risks I think there are risks to the forecast I think there are also risks in the broader sense I note that when we reviewed the two graphic depictions of unemployment that we tend to use, the curve showing  -37-    12/17-18/84  insured unemployed has been rising since October, if I can read the graph, and it looks like the number on initial claims for unemployment has been rising since about midyear or July And we're talking about 29 percent growth following two quarters of growth under 2 percent In real terms we have those two quarters behind us and then an expectation of under 3 percent for a target long term Take the confidence limit around the 29 percent in a broader sense Let's consider the Congress returning and starting to talk about spending cuts with unemployment rising or at least unemployment claims high What about the group of political people in and out of the legislatures who would like to take a crack at the Federal Reserve-- who would like to restrict our independence or who would like to have us report in a different way and so forth Are we willing to take the risk of unemployment and very slow economic growth as those folks begin to look at the Federal Reserve and what should be done? To me that's a risk I may be exaggerating  In terms of the world context, I saw a figure somewhere, though I haven't verified it, of 19 million unemployed in the EC Maybe that's not quite the figure but we know what the unemployment rates are in those countries and the Chairman indicated the outlook for growth there There are some political and social risks in those countries of continued unemployment at this stage  The question was raised as to what importance should M1 have Well, I think among the monetary aggregates it should have the premier position But I think too that for us not to weigh more heavily the weighted average exchange rate borders on the irresponsible [given] that the exchange rate and the flood of imports into this country impact upon employment and the market share As Ed Boehne was saying, once that market share is gone, it's gone for quite a while And what does that mean for employment and unemployment in the next cycle? So, it seems to me that we need to put more emphasis than we have been upon the exchange rate We need to put emphasis upon M1, certainly And those indicators that have some reliability and which point toward future inflation, of course, have to be very important I don't know whether they are more important than M1 or not, but obviously those signs of future inflation are important--the wage and benefit settlements and indicators such as productivity that Frank mentioned Well, productivity is coming back Remember that we've had such a disappointment in real growth that, as Frank said, with the services industries hiring people and real growth so low, of course, we have negative productivity figures But I think that the staff's productivity figures are still too low, although I'm delighted to see that they have raised the trend number a touch Thank you, sir But the people I still have occasional contact with have changed their organizations substantially and they are going to get the productivity  Now, that leaves me to question the ranges for 1985 as the Chairman asked There I am greatly troubled by our implicit treatment of velocity for 1985 I'm not sure that 6-3/4 percent will be enough, frankly I'm not sure if velocity behavior is so hard to forecast I've got 4 percent M1 and V1 for last year That's somewhat of a surprise, I believe Talk about confidence level plus or minus around trend velocity! What trend velocity do we need to have 6-3/4 percent be an adequate increase in the short run? What velocity do we need to get the midpoint of the range, to have that 5-1/2 percent be adequate  -38-    12/17-18/84  for M1 in 1985? At 7 or 71 percent nominal [GNP growth] for '85, it seems to me the implication is that the top of the range for M1 for '85 may be too low; I would be much more comfortable if we had a little more flexibility there I don't know whether we ought to go to 8 percent I know it's the wrong signal in terms of Fed policy whose primary job over time is to bring down the rate of growth in the monetary aggregates in order to counter inflation But why start off with a situation in which, if we use that darn geometric cone, we're so liable to start out above the upper limit? I'm a parallel line man myself If these are the categories we're talking about, I think we should seriously consider a higher upper limit for M1 for 1985 And I think we should seriously consider that [complex] of short-term targets which would begin the process of getting a 4 percent plus or minus real growth in the near future  Yes  Mr Chairman, I would support your proposal for a 7 percent M1 and a frictional borrowing level We've had some revisions in what a frictional level is; we are in a position of making up for a shortfall that seems to be haunting us We must be aware too that the way our decisionmaking has to go--properly go--is structured by Congress [unintelligible] some decades past We seem to be after the fact and late It seems to me that the kind of proposal that you made gives us flexibility; we're not irrevocably committed to a large move And I think it is timely, considering the data both on the economy and the monetary aggregates  But note the risks in what Steve has just said We have a 7 percent target for M1; growth has been falling short of target from time to time The instability in the velocity figure quarter-to- quarter is notable Velocity can be 4 percent off, 5 percent off, 7 percent off [Unintelligible] an error of a hundred basis points If velocity is flat or even negative--and it conceivably can be negative, though obviously it's not the most likely outcome--then the 7 percent specification for M1 is not very high in terms of velocity  Steve, isn't there a possibility that a 1/4 point reduction in the discount rate might be interpreted as a last act of the drama--that the market interpretation will be ""All right, that is far as they are going to go""?  Life goes on, I can see that  Yes  But what we're leaving out of the housing discussion is the considerable pressure by the central bank against growth in mortgages and against savings and loan participation in joint ventures for builders--reserves and net worth requirements against rates of growth We've left that out entirely The funding is going to be a lot more difficult for the builder  They are ahead of us  But if we have 6 to 10 percent and it approaches 6 percent, we limit it That's not zero  For how long--two days?  7, 9, and 9  And a discount rate [cut] of 1/2 point  Our own economy  Yes  Less than 3 percent  Yes, under 3  But, Tony, that would be such a departure from the policy of the immediate past Why would they draw that conclusion from that wording?  The basic sentence  If that's a motion, I'll second it  That's what it says "
2848,1985-01-18,MARTIN," But the phrase ""concentrated intervention,"" Mr Chairman, implies that the Japanese and the Germans would be intervening along with us, right?  Okay "
2870,1985-02-12,MARTIN," Mr Chairman, after surveying the membership of this group and thinking of various outsiders who might [unintelligible] a change in the law, I conclude that I wish to nominate Gerald Corrigan as the Vice Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee  So moved  Move to ratify  I support the decrease-to-constant hypothesis, Mr Chairman We increased capacity by over 3 percent last year; there has been a surprising rehiring of experienced labor; and there is all of this talk that we heard earlier about the use of computers and telecommunications equipment and all that stuff that made up the investment boomlet Surely, these organizations are going to do something with this equipment other than look at it and display it to visitors--which are two of the functions of this sort of new equipment It seems to me that they will still have the pressure from foreign competition and that finally someday, somehow, sooner or later, the slimming down of many organizations that occurred--as the charm school middle managers were sent on their way and other adjustments were made in management and staff ranks--is going to have some effect on labor costs in a positive direction My own personal projection was for less inflation--someone has to be an outlier--in 1985, and I would support your statement of a constant or declining [rate of inflation]  Mr Chairman, I wanted to take exception to the [projections for] housing starts and residential construction volume for 1985 As the chart showed, the mortgage commitment rate is hovering around 13 percent on a 30-year fixed-rate loan and the proportion of adjustable rate loans has dropped significantly I don't believe, given the satisfaction of the deferred housing demand that has occurred to date, that we can reach 175 million [in housing starts] or $166+ billion in residential investment in 1985 It could happen with a lower [mortgage] rate but the assumption of the staff is for somewhat higher rates, particularly toward the end of the year In the models I've seen, it would take a fixed-rate somewhere around 12-1/2 percent If you add the servicing on to that mortgage commitment rate for 30-year fixed-rate loans you get about 13-1/4 percent So it seems to me that we're looking at 15 million rather than 175 million [on starts]  There are a number of other institutional changes We know that the investigation of the Bank of America mortgage-backed security fraud situation is only beginning There will be some investor reaction in the mortgage-backed security area The thrift institution  -12-    2/12-13/85  regulators are attempting to slow the growth [of such securities], and to the extent that there is some degree of success, that would affect availability And finally, there is the so-called willingness factor in home buying that is disappearing, in the sense that the appreciation motivation that has been so prominent over the last several decades is waning in several regions of the country The motivation to buy is for shelter and not for appreciation The syndicates have been pushed out of the market in the multifamily area; the multiple unit vacancy rate is terrifically high in some parts of the country It isn't enough to do a macro job and get this very high vacancy shown on the chart For the United States there isn't a national housing market; there is mosaic of sub-markets around the country; and many of those have very, very high vacancy rates So I don't see how we can get 600,000 or 650,000 in multifamily starts in 1985 I suggest that the forecast is [25 million] high That doesn't exactly throw the forecast out  I would couple that remark with a commendation for the analysis in the rest of the structural forecast for the next year in terms of real business fixed investment I think it's a very good analysis, showing a very big cutback in structures in the real business fixed investment area I did a little work prior to the meeting and then found that I was caught in the sense that I was only verifying what the staff has done here I think that's quite accurate  I think the Chairman's memory serves him well I don't believe there was any overt support for rebasing To start from some theoretical level being captured by a range we set some time back has very little to recommend it, it seems to me I would oppose any rebasing now, with all due respect to Bill Poole and his good language in the CEA report  It's not rebasing  Under other circumstances one might draw the geometry the other way  It conveys it a lot better than a geometrically neutral form, if you would  The Volckergram!  I join President Balles in the caveat that, to the extent that alternative II is beginning to emerge as a consensus, I think we may have pragmatic difficulties with the upper bound of M1 Given the staff forecast of income and interest rates, their warning that the projections on velocity have some confidence limits around them, and given the lagged effect of the interest rate drop that we've had, V1 could even be a little negative next year If we're going for alternative II--as I hear you, John--it seems that we ought to do something about the upper boundary for M1; 7 percent may be too low  I'd like to see us shape the economy with a 4 percent real growth rate, Henry  Lyle, we're not raising the targets; we're lowering them by 1/2 a point for M1 I would suggest 7-1/2 percent to go along with the 8-1/2 percent on M2 That would be taking the upper limit 1/2 point [above the tentative target] and a 1/2 point [below  -31-    2/12-13/85  the target] the year before It gives us a little room We're talking about being around the upper limit of each of those ranges  Mr Chairman, I would echo Governor Rice's comments with regard to the understandable shift in our views toward the probability of a bit stronger growth It seems to me that in our discussion yesterday, something like half of us were talking about growth of 4 percent, or at least higher growth than the staff forecast It's obvious also in the tabulation done for the July [Humphrey-Hawkins] Report to the Congress vis-a-vis our most recent tabulation that there has been a shift of 1/2 or 1/4 percentage point, or something of that magnitude That says to me that there is a stronger possibility than existed before that M1 growth for 1985 will not only run above the 6-1/2 percent but that it could easily run 7 or 7-1/2 percent We still don't know what the lagged effect will be of the drop in short-term rates which, after all, was a very substantial drop It hasn't worked its way through and we don't know what that will do to velocity And we can't escape the din of news with regard to the strength of the dollar and the [unintelligible] that's in that news from time-to-time of almost a scramble for dollars in this or that market It seems to me that we easily could have a 7-1/2 percent rate of growth in M1, which would be consonant with a favorable inflation outlook and export performance Regardless of the geometry that we're presenting on this and that The Wall Street Journal is picking up, the implication at least is that M1 will be running above the 7-1/2 percent level and that there will be implicit or explicit pressure on us to adjust  I favor [an upper limit of] 7-1/2 percent with some comments with regard to some of these matters that have developed since July Goodness knows, there have been enough developments of substance since we reported to the Congress in July to risk breaking a precedent! My understanding is that we don't change these outer boundaries of ranges of monetary aggregates once they are set; I don't see why we should be confined to that kind of a pattern I suggest that we use 7-1/2 percent [as the upper limit] for M1 I think some of the same comments could extend to M2 It may run at or above the upper limit that we set in July The 8-1/2 percent doesn't seem to be as important in the way the market looks at the monetary aggregates We have to think of how they--the traders, the market makers--think I would extend that even more so to M3 and to total credit I'm not ready to jettison total credit as was suggested yesterday Obviously, we don't seem to be gigged in the market and in the market comments when we exceed the latter two broader measures So, I would opt for an upper limit of 7-1/2 percent for M1 and leave the other three ranges where they are  Good report  6 percent or more  I would too  I go along with ""B,"" Mr Chairman My only reservation with regard to ""B"" is what the band of confidence is around the 8 percent December-to-March number for M1 It seems to me that the odds are that M1 will exceed 8 percent My only discomfort is that 8-1/4 percent may not be the correct fed funds rate for the short run; maybe it should be 8-1/2 percent But I take it that there is enough flexibility built into our procedures [to allow for] an 8-1/2 percent rate if we need it to get 8 percent [M1 growth] or whatever that is--less than the 10 percent and 12 percent that we've been experiencing in recent months Given that assumption, I would go along with ""B""  I think it should be symmetrical given the unknowns we're mulling over here  12 percent down from 14--  I think the message is that we're giving this a little tap; we're not letting the 10 to 12 percent run but we're not reversing course Isn't that what we're trying to get at? That's what ""some"" says  We would have to say ""some modest""  I think the word ""modest""-- Say ""modest increases would be sought""  I think we should say it in both places  I thought the term of art this season was ""tilt"" We have removed the tilt  I'd much prefer it on M1, Mr Chairman  I could go along with that  The band is a better way to communicate It essentially expresses what we do  Right  Two pages beyond page 10  But only if you have a semi-log scale  But don't forget that the South Koreans are now coming onto the market [Unintelligible] and some of these other companies are coming on strong And the [cars are priced] at $6,000 and under  It depends on whether we can agree with regard to language  They ignore the separate--  It's important to make that comment with regard to velocity That's been a good deal of the substance of our discussion And John Balles has been [suggesting] language with regard to the lagged effects of the interest rate drop in the last year Whether that's appropriate--  That's why 7-1/2--  Oh, I thought you said--  No, we're just quicker!  As is  We might still have a problem with M2  -67-    2/12-13/85  10 percent! "
2896,1985-03-26,MARTIN," With the indulgence of the Federal Open Market Committee, I would like to nominate Paul Adolph Volcker as the Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee  With the concurrence of the new Chairman, I would like to nominate Gerald Corrigan as the Vice Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee  Second  Move the New York Bank  So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Second  Second  Move it  It's debatable  But, Henry, I would suggest to you that it isn't just a monthly up and down In the Greenbook, the staff has revised downward the first-quarter data and has revised downward certain other data that apply to periods of more than a month They are looking at a 33 percent real growth number, which is down something like 10 percent Certainly, the caveats are more imbedded in the material that is being reviewed than was true in February We have just heard caveats with regard to business fixed investment I would agree with those and add the comment, for whatever it's worth, that if I today still had the responsibility for Homart Development Co, I would not be starting one office building, one shopping center of any size, or one multiple unit dwelling in the United States of America If you look at the curve of the starts in that area, it suggests something that is headed for explosion--an explosion downward Okay, an implosion That curve is just unsustainable in that part of the investment area broadly defined We have seen since mid-1984 a decline in orders in category after category of business fixed investments It's not just technology and it's not just heavy industry; it's virtually across the board And it seems to me that a 6 percent growth in business fixed investment, broadly defined, for 1985 is just getting to be a less and less probable event  I would add to that the fragilities that were alluded to If you pick up The Wall Street Journal this morning, there is a story about a major Canadian bank Are we going to go a month without a large financial institution surprising the markets? Are we going to go two or three weeks without or some bank coming up with another $70 million loss in Paraguay or Ecuador or somewhere? This drumbeat of negative news is having its effect, if you can believe the part of the surveys of consumer attitudes toward financial institutions and finance It seems to me that we have a very slow-- not a moderate--growth, a very fragile financial system, and a very dubious [outlook for] business fixed investment, housing, and non- residential investment We are looking at a very vulnerable year  Mr Chairman, I want to comment briefly on the housing market outlook, partly because there have been comments which were rather optimistic in that area that I want to dissent from If you follow the secondary market reports, it's clear that fixed-rate mortgage rates have been rising week-by-week There have been some weeks in which the jump has been 10 or 15 basis points We are all aware that there is a good deal less use of adjustable rate mortgages now And to the extent that there's a shift in the borrower's purview here onto the [lender's], you're talking about a 233 basis point increase in the stated rate, going from adjustable to fixed on average--at least as far as Freddie Mac data are concerned The borrowers who are in the lower down payment category are facing higher private mortgage insurance premiums today if they are unfortunate enough to have to use that device And that premium, of course, goes to the qualification of the borrower as does the higher rate that is shown in the secondary market data The mortgage insurers are reporting very heavy underwriting losses, which means that their credit analyses are more severe Some of these companies are going to lose in last year plus this year an amount equal to their whole capital base of only a few years ago So, they are likely to be slightly more conservative in their underwriting The same comment can apply to the mortgage originator who faces delinquency rates starting with 30-day delinquencies of 5 or 6 or 7 percent--rates they have not faced in their whole careers, unless they're up in years a bit And, of course, the rate of foreclosure losses is significant The motivation of the borrower of having an investment as well as shelter is diminishing in many sections of the country Indeed, there has been deflation in housing prices in certain price brackets in certain parts of the country So, for us to attain the forecast of 175 million single-family units plus multifamily units I don't think is feasible Added to the investment downside risk, I think, is a very substantial downside risk in housing  A lot of them are Canadian  True, true  Well, the vacancy rate is so high and the overbuilding is so substantial that, of course, that too is a vulnerable market I don't know how a developer looks on the proposed tax changes I take it there hasn't been enough debate on those to reverse that hold that it seemed to place on the syndicated apartment developer  In order to glorify the obvious, let me begin my statement with a reminder that we set the upper limit on M1, in my opinion, low relative to our assumptions about velocity this year We attempted to give ourselves some running room by not reducing the upper limit of M2 and M3 so much As you know, we came down from an 8 percent upper limit on M1 to 7 percent It seems to me that lies  -29-    3/26/85  behind the projection that we will run along the top of the so-called band with alternative B, which I support Apparently, M1 is decelerating The Chairman has indicated that the first estimate may be modified somewhat I'm a little troubled that the results in the three econometric models that I follow seem to agree right now, which always gives me pause They seem to agree that M1 at least, and also M2, will be coming down in this quarter Secondly, we have the possible weakness in velocity, particularly in V1 that we discussed in February I don't know what the velocity was in the first quarter but it must have been a minus 3 percent or something like that--74 percent compared with 103 percent If we have flat or negative velocity, then to run along the top of the band does not seem to me to be that risky Once again, I think these cones and bands are useful tools, of course, but I am very encouraged by the universal awareness here of the risks in the economy in so many of the real sectors and so many of the financial sectors and in the international and domestic situation [Unintelligible] some slight difference from a band, the top of which was set in order to give a certain long-run signal, given the almost unprecedented risks matrix here, both real and financial It seems to me, given the uncertainty with regard to velocity and the high probability of having a negative 1 percent or something of that sort, that around 7 percent is not an untoward goal for M1 So, I support alternative B I support the $350 million borrowing and a reconsideration at the July meeting of the upper limit of the M1 band  Especially when we don't seem to understand why it is that there's this demand, particularly in the smaller institutions, for excess reserves  I think it will be interpreted as ""There they go, targeting interest rates"" I would join my two colleagues, or three colleagues, in opposing that  Yes sir  And 6-1/2 percent to 6 percent [on the M1 objective] is a shade tighter  Okay, now we have two shades  I would too  The great compromiser!  Yes "
2919,1985-05-21,MARTIN," Move approval  Mr Sprinkel has not lobbied for this  Are they hedging or are they using some creative accounting?  No, I'm talking about the traders not the banks  I would like to add some rail cars to the locomotive of expectations already alluded to I am struck by the cumulative nature of the vulnerabilities of markets and of the financial side of the economy Notice that in our first two reports this morning there were some comments on the variability in foreign exchange markets Think of the junk bond phenomenon, which continues into this year The SEC indicated that they are not disposed to intervene in the merger and acquisition surge You are talking about $80 or $90 billion at an annual rate of equity retirement replaced by debt In the commodity markets and the COMEX in New York, the three largest traders failed to meet a margin call one day, though it was only a temporary phenomenon As for the LDC debt deterioration, we get reports out of Argentina on a series of private bank failures; the government steps in and this passes Capital flight has resumed from the LDCs and various measures we're all familiar with are being implemented there It is not all one-sided, of course We have what sounds like favorable news out of Venezuela and the Philippines, but still there is the onus of this capital flight situation Newspapers in the last few days have had the Coldwell Bankers survey, which talks about $25 billion plus of nonresidential construction coming on stream--80 percent above 1980 I think there is a kind of frenzy of office building and other kinds of activity Sooner or later that is going to put pressure on major money funds around the country because tens of billions of dollars are coming in there, resulting in overbuilding Multiple unit dwellings are hung on the revenue M bonds, industrial revenue bonds--techniques that are a tax phenomenon in part Vacancies are accumulating there As for government bond dealers, obviously, we know the work that has been done in that area by the New York Fed But I wonder if we weren't so concerned with the cost and we weren't so concerned with the smooth running of this    5/21/85  enormous market, if maybe we might have come up with something a little less voluntary and more like the rulemaking being extended in the municipal securities market But we have the vulnerabilities to contend with and who wants to take that chance? Ed Gray has talked about $100 billion in savings and loan assets in savings and loans that are essentially defunct Well, that's $100 billion out of an industry that is 10 times that large that he has found; and I wonder what else is out there that could come around to haunt us  The President is about to go on the road to present the so- called tax reform and simplification program There is going to be a great deal of attention to top bracket rates and a capital gains treatment a little more favorable than the Treasury proposal Is that going to add to a speculative bubble that seems to be occurring in market after market after market? Where can we find a financial market that doesn't have this feeling of a kind of froth in it right now? And how many of these things need to go down in one day, one week, or one month before we talk about expectations and attitudes? Government securities and mortgage-backed securities markets are enormous markets trading hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars now And one day, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac may decide they are not going to settle Well, all that [happened in the past] and there were negotiations and so forth and every one of these potential crises worked out fine Everybody saluted and got in [line] and did what they had to do and it worked But what are the dangers that we are facing here?  I am not so concerned about the tiny bit of evidence of price increase; I certainly am concerned about unemployment and the lack of employment growth and the 07 percent real growth figure that that implies Think of the cumulative nature of financial vulnerabilities of the country right now I think I voted for--maybe I even made the motion, I can't remember--the [recent] discount rate cut I think we should have done that But my goodness, let us be aware of what we do next in terms of this tremendous pervasive, ubiquitous, financial vulnerability that we have here That is my cheerful message  Picking up on Governor Rice's comments with regard to the economy growing under its potential, I would certainly subscribe to that comment I don't know whether it's 3 or 3-1/2 percent or more, but certainly [27] percent and a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent are under potential It seems to me, though, that that question is properly addressed in the July review rather than in this short-run situation we face Secondly, I would like to address the suggestion that M1 be brought down to the band--I think it was the band, not the cone I won't get too methodical with you here It seems to me that the growth in GNP right now is too low, and that there is a downside risk The 73 percent potential growth rate [for M1] that Steve mentioned earlier--if that is the case for the year--I don't find all that disturbing, considering the discussions that we have had with regard to V1 It seems to me that in the usual model it would take a federal funds rate--what would it be 8-1/2 or 9 cent?-- to bring M1 down within that band And it seems to me that that is not called for under these circumstances  As far as alternatives are concerned, the point I was trying to make by reviewing the horror stories that unfortunately are real and not in the movies anymore is that I think we made the correct move in reducing the discount rate but that there is enough speculative fever out there that if we were observed doing anything further in the direction of ease, we would run a risk that I don't believe is necessary of aiding and abetting that fever So it seems to me that this is a wonderful time for the Chairman--as only the Chairman can do--to make that representation that we are central bankers and we are concerned with orderly markets and inflation and we are going to hold the line, as it were That gets me certainly to voting for alternative B as the closest thing to the status quo I can read out of today's confusing events and the description thereof If the market expects a nudge further in the direction of ease, our failure to satisfy that expectation might be the best thing we could do right now, when I feel there is so much potential panic out there As far as the borrowing is concerned, I go along with Jerry's suggestion of $350-$375 million, partly because I cannot understand how the thrifts' borrowing [fits], and secondly because I don't know how much borrowing will occur as unfortunate events unfold and how that will affect the borrowing level It seems to me that results in a federal funds rate, perhaps as was indicated, between 7-1/2 and 8 percent; and I think that is appropriate in terms of market pressures and the discount rate reduction  Yes  -34-    5/21/85  The Japanese premium ought to start coming in  4 percent and 5-1/4 percent  It's likely to be 6-1/2 percent  March to June  It does April to June  It gives us a little more flexibility  I prefer your recent language  ""Would be acceptable""  [Unintelligible]  I'd prefer ""would/might""  What happened to ""would/might""?  Yes sir  In ""B"" it's 5-1/2 to 9 percent  And all the thrift borrowing out    5/21/85  [Unintelligible] adjustments  $325 to $375 million  Oh, shame on you, Governor Gramley! "
2943,1985-07-09,MARTIN," So moved  Move approval, Mr Chairman  It would still leave margins very, very wide for those sellers into the US market--into the most exciting market they could have market share in They'd absorb it all  Mr Chairman, I am struck not only by the usual difficulties of forecasting but by the degree of uncertainty--not to take away from any of the work of our colleagues on the staff here and at the banks It seemed to me that as you worked through the presentation and the graphics today the theme could be uncertainty about non-oil imports and real GNP Mr Truman, in an attempt to be reassuring, said that even if we hit the higher imports--therefore the lower line relative to the GNP--it won't put us in a recession That was an attempt to be reassuring, which I appreciate But if you translate that into the projection of consumer spending, which over the last nine quarters has represented about 60 percent of the real GNP chain, you note the uncertainty that the import segment of that spending presents I noted in the presentation that that was a reasonable comment that the consumer spending element of the GNP    7/9-10/85  assumes that the domestic segment of that spending will be somewhat higher There will be a bigger domestic share But there again, it seems to me that the uncertainty presents itself  In the business investment area, I have no problem with the inventory projection; but when we get to business fixed investment, I wonder whether or not the computer and the telecommunications spending are indeed going to revive or hold, or whether [such spending] really has topped out and the catch-up in that has occurred It seems to me that there is uncertainty there There certainly is uncertainty as to when the nonresidential building industry is going to collapse--not whether, but when That certainly applies to the industrial buildings, which haven't gone anywhere There are closed plants all over the United States and there is overbuilding of office buildings and shopping centers So, that is a question of when, not whether I don't have any problem with the rather optimistic housing projections but we certainly can have difficulties in the business fixed investment It just seems to me that uncertainty is practically the theme of our forecast, necessarily I am struck by the range [of uncertainty] that we have to have around any of these lines we're looking at  Mr Chairman, you may rule this next comment out of order; I'm experienced in that But I would like to raise a question about the principal assumptions I am aware that it is necessary for the staff in its presentation of materials to make an assumption about [money growth for] the rest of 1985 and for 1986 And it is quite understandable to use an M1 growth of 8-1/2 percent for the first period and 5-1/2 percent for 1986 to hit some kind of middle point Likewise, it is very understandable to use the assumption of level interest rates out through 1986 But given those assumptions and the others, all of which seem to be internally consistent, that produces then 2-1/2 percent real growth As to the Chairman's comment that the numbers in the FOMC's projections tend to be a bit higher, I think that goes back to the Chairman's informal poll here in March, in which as I remember the question he asked was Is 3 percent real growth adequate? As I recall the results--I have a rather fuzzy memory--there wasn't anyone here, among the voting or non-voting participants, who felt that 3 percent was an adequate real rate of growth Well, if 3 percent wasn't, is 2-1/2 percent adequate for this period? Or shouldn't we in subsequent deliberations--the    7/9-10/85  Chairman hasn't ruled me out of order yet--consider the rate of growth and the level interest rates as something that needs to be debated and some decisions made, which normally would be made in our procedures here?  And interest rates [down]  I think it has been very well said by Tom and others that we do not have quite the rationale in this period of time that we had in 1982-83 with regard to the number of new instruments, new minima, new rates, and less rate control On the other hand, we have had the passage of time and we are aware that cash management techniques continue to be employed--perhaps some ways outside the three sigma limit, as in Hutton's case At any rate, those institutional commentators who are likely to react to a rebasing, I argue, are themselves cash managers, and they themselves are shifting funds, even as individuals, between and among their firms' interest- bearing or noninterest-bearing accounts So, I think there is a chance to appeal to the day-to-day experiences of the financial managers and the financial commentators that there is indeed this relationship between the holding of assets with varied degrees of liquidity as a characteristic and the changes in the levels of interest rates Furthermore, I think there is the Hutton phenomenon that is more widespread than perhaps is obvious I agree with Jerry in that regard Furthermore, we rebased to take into account changes in institutions and interest rates once before, in very recent experience This rebasing was not followed by an augmentation of inflation; indeed, if anything, there has been a little--I'm agreeing with Henry that it's unsatisfactorily little--disinflation that followed So it seems to me that there can be an appeal made to what people and institutions and financial managers are doing themselves following changes in interest rates There is a common sense kind of [case] that can be made to justify and explain and communicate the rebasing that I think is necessary here And I think it is important that that be done because I am hopeful that there will be additional changes in the interest rates While the elasticity may diminish--I have no problems with that as the spreads and the increments get smaller--nevertheless, there may well be an additional impact upon V1 and the other velocities, which we will be able to explain if we are successful in this rebasing  A probation status after rebasing as we did just a couple of years ago?  I think if we put M1 in the penalty box now, we will have difficulty getting the door open to extricate it  I think it should be the same  I don't want to  With 2 percent real growth, we could afford something, surely  A 10 percent increase over the two percent? Sure That gets you to 22 percent!  I think we have to be very careful with May and June, particularly June We go back and revise, revise, and revise My goodness, that June could be like May or whatever it was last year it could come down when we revise  I'd certainly concur  We are not above the parallel lines We are above the cone We are something like $11 billion under the parallel lines  My only comment about February is that I think the Greenbook had the federal funds rate rising to 9-1/2 percent by the end of the year And 200 basis points does make a bit of difference in growth rates of the aggregates Was the funds rate 9 or 9-1/2 percent by the end of the year in our February Greenbook? We had the federal funds rising over the year  My only point is--given the high level of real rates and the difficulty of forecasting the rates and a caveat from Steve's excellent paper--that from time to time there is at least the prospect of real and nominal rates coming down I think that argues for more flexibility--that is, rebasing to, let's say, a 4 to 8 percent range rather than a 4 to 7 percent range  -33-    7/9-10/85  Okay Sorry  I certainly don't object strongly to that  Without rebasing  Considering the difficulty in predicting velocity so far in this expansion and considering the difficulty in projecting interest rates, real and nominal, so far in this business expansion, it would seem to me that we would want to give ourselves the flexibility that has been alluded to several times here and that rebasing gives us that flexibility It also recognizes the unusualness of recent events with regard to both velocity and, therefore, on the other side of that coin, the growth of the aggregates Why not give ourselves the operational flexibility that rebasing presents and indicate--to work a word to death--the uncertainty associated with these relationships at the moment? Maybe we ought not use the term ""monitoring"" and so forth if our goal here is [unintelligible] Let us not call it ""monitoring;"" let us call it ""bananas"" or something else But let's give ourselves some operational flexibility We don't know what will happen to interest rates; we don't know what the public's attitude is toward holding various kinds of assets  In a recession?  Interest rates are all they care about  I would like to make the argument for rebasing on a slightly different basis It is certainly important that the financial markets accept what we do here as being operationally dictated and not an abandonment of disinflation as a primary goal of this institution On the other hand, it seems to me that the operational considerations are important here and that we should attempt to adopt those features of a policy which are most likely, with all the difficulty of forecasting, to be attainable We rebased in very recent history There was not a reinflation following those actions, and it seems to me that operationally we would have a little more flexibility [by rebasing] We can be careful with the language in which we ascribe weight to M1, but nevertheless I think it is important to reiterate that M1 is an information variable It does have content; most of the time it does have information that is valuable in the implementation of policy I think that rebasing and the right language accomplish this Why not pick the alternative we are most likely to succeed in?  But we have to raise the top limit so high if we don't rebase, Mr Chairman To be pragmatic, we really ought to use a 10 percent top for that range and who wants to go to 10 percent? I don't  By 300 basis points  Chuck, we have had interest rates come down 400 basis points from their peaks and, in somewhat more recent time, 200 basis points That must have some relationship  If we do neither, every Friday we are going to be confronted by The Wall Street Journal's bad diagrams showing us not just above the top of the cone but at an extreme distance above the top of the cone  That diagram looks out of control  We ran at 88 percent against a top of 5-1/2 percent  I think part of that argument, Mr Chairman, turns on the expectation of what is the real growth trend line Is it really 2 or 2-1/2 percent or is it 3 or 3-1/2 percent?  Yes, I'm talking about real GNP  If 2 to 2-1/2 percent is the trend, then we could be comfortable with the staff structure rather than our own higher projections But if that's incorrect and the longer-term growth line is around 3 or 3-1/2 percent, then the staff model will give us higher unemployment  Personally, I think it's closer to 3 or 3-1/2 percent and, therefore, we're flirting with higher unemployment at 2 to 2-1/2 percent real growth Why should we take that risk?  And given that we will be overshooting-- overshooting, changing, rebasing, and so forth for this year  It's not higher than what actually is going to occur in 1985 It's much lower; 8 is lower than 10, I believe  I wouldn't bet on 8 percent for '85  I have no argument with it  $350 million  I support alternative B with $350 million of borrowing for reasons already given  It's the higher, to give ourselves operating room when the expectation, I think, on balance still is for a higher rather than a lower rate of growth in M1, even given the decisions made in the short run I don't think we should set ranges that we feel have a higher probability that we can't obtain them  I'm arguing for 8 or 9-1/2, Mr Chairman, depending on which way the Committee goes It's operational; I'll join the pragmatists We heard from a pragmatist  Yes  8 percent  SPEAKER(?) 7 percent  Very, very tight  Not with 8 percent  The media will talk about the top of the range; the media will talk about 8 percent They've done it again and again I think, cosmetically, we will have them talking about rebasing for one day and it will be forgotten  Yes, that makes sense; and then preserve the 3 to 8 percent  But I want to go from 3 to 8 percent to 4 to 7 percent, you see, eventually And I want to start at 3 to 8 percent  But they haven't reemerged Why start backwards?  They might, and then we can narrow the range That's when you narrow the range--when you know something  Yes, I agree  Good  3 to 8  I'd rather see it treated special  I don't think you need it I don't think you need the word ""monitoring""  Which they will  We can reduce the discount rate "
2969,1985-08-20,MARTIN," You put quite a bit of emphasis on the Treasury refunding as an indicator that foreigners, including the Japanese, are not going to rush to sell their US securities I am not quarreling with that implication of your comment, but can you broaden that analysis a little? Are foreigners tending to shorten their maturities as they roll securities over? What kinds of, for want of a better term, leading financial indicators are we getting out of the Euromarkets with regard to holdings of dollar-denominated versus otherwise denominated securities--these securities, whatever you call them, on which the interest is paid in one currency and the principal in another? Can you expand on that a bit?  But of course we didn't have a special offering to foreigners either, right?  Not even a shortening in maturities?  Jim, let me address Ed's question in a little different way I don't have any problems with what you said But isn't it true that, as the housing market has matured, there has been a shift in the direction of fixed rate mortgage originations and away from adjustable rate mortgage originations? If you go back a few months and take out the spike in the fixed mortgage rate, you really have a decrease of 100 to 150 basis points in that rate; the shift has been to using fixed rate loans If you go along that line then, the tightening of credit underwriting can offset 100 or 150 points; it can't offset 200 or 300 points, probably Perhaps there has not been that much improvement at the point of sale fixed rate mortgage, [given] that no appreciation in the house is looked for So, just to complicate it further--  I never talk personalities but that is a Sumicrast survey of home builders and the Colton projection is still 16, 17 million Let the record not show that  Laffer says that's the first effective date of the supply-siders' tax cuts  Well, Mr Chairman, I don't have a very positive scenario I think the staff work was careful and conservative It seems to me that if you look at the sectors in which they are picking up that increase in real growth from 17 or 15 percent--or whatever the revised figure is going to turn out to be--to 30 percent, you get federal spending, residential spending, inventory change, a bit of business fixed in the producer durable equipment area, and a little increase in consumption But as I look at those categories and think of the downside risk in most of them, it seems to me that it is not too much like Cassandra to look at the chance of a recession I will take the other end of the spectrum from Steve Certainly, we have the imbalances in this expansion They are not the usual imbalances that we are used to it isn't capacity utilization pressing against a threshold; it isn't rising interest rates But goodness knows, there are imbalances the foreign trade side, the farm situation, and all the rest of them we know about I think that the mortgage backed security market is extremely vulnerable, and that is an $80 billion a year market On the federal spending side, could we have a real cutback there or a real expansion for that matter? I think neither The procurement criticisms, the resignation of one procurement officer, and the hearings in the Congress are all constraints on Weinberger and company So it is quite unlikely, even if they wanted to, that they could give a big push to the economy by saying they have all of this [spending] authority, now let's spend it Nor is it likely, given the philosophical [mind] set of Mr Weinberger and his boss, that there would be the opposite--a real cutback in that area So that's probably a small contribution on the plus side  -14-    8/20/85 -15-  We have spoken of the consumer Employment is still going up a little, unlike the Europeans The debt burden looks like it has adjusted a little With tax refunds coming in, those credit card credits have dropped a little, so maybe the debt burden can be handled In the residential area, I think we are very vulnerable in our forecast Jim, this will come as absolutely no surprise to you I think the talk about a 16 percent spurt in residential spending is overly optimistic It might be half that That's a couple percentage points off the growth increment maybe I already made a comment with regard to the importance of the fixed rate mortgage, but there are the TICOR mortgage-backed security losses and private mortgage insurance companies are already talking about $50 to $100 [billion] in loss exposure I don't know whether the Swiss reinsurance process is going to work here; it has never been tested in this particular kind of insurance I don't know whether REITs, as they are called, will come in and make the settlements and back up the private mortgage insurance companies so that you can get that $80 billion continuing as funding for the residential spending  No, they won't do it willingly--not when you are talking $50 million at a clip per company So I think there is a real exposure there As for inventories, goodness, what swings there are We can get a $50 million help or we can get a $50 million hurt The inventory situation is puzzling all of us, in terms of its swings It could help or not So it seems to me that there are vulnerabilities with regard to the very careful forecast of Jim and his associates for an increase up to 3 percent real GNP The risks are on the down side in every one of those areas and in other areas that we all know about The risk of recession, though, seems to turn on some kind of systemic financial--well, not collapse--but real troubles that are hard to handle I'm talking not just about the ag banks and the thrifts and all of the things that we have talked about so many times, but systemic--[all] financial institutions [unintelligible] private mortgage insurance companies don't pay And the mortgage-backed securities side of the market--I am stretching to get the biggest figure I can--may be in the widest sense a $350 billion market I don't think that is the most probable occurrence, but the risks are on the down side We need to keep those in mind as we set policy  Mr Chairman, to adhere at this time to an emphasis on the monetary aggregates, which has been [our approach] since 1979 or at least from 1979 to 1982, is not justified by what we know about them or what we can predict in terms of the pattern of change in the aggregates, particularly in M1 Well, let me correct myself the narrow aggregate is still behaving in a pattern outside the modeling of projections plus or minus some standard error I think there is increasing merit to the thesis that there has been a shift in the demand curve It seems to me that there's a cumulative effect on the public of financial crises in state after state and in type of institution after type of institution I am not just talking about Ohio and Maryland and thrifts in California and industrial loan companies in Utah and institutions in Texas and so forth; I'm thinking of the cumulative effect on the public's consciousness of this constant news about failed financial institutions following a multi- decade period in which nobody failed Take Chicago--pardon me Silas-- where the two biggest S&Ls and the two biggest banks, the four dominant financial institutions there, are on sufferance There's Bank of America, Seafirst, Financial Corporation of America, Texas Commerce--you could go on and on [There are problem] maritime loans, energy loans, and now real estate loans  I think we will see more evidence as time goes by that there has been a shift in the demand curve And for us now to gear our policies around bringing M1 down simply is not warranted given the extreme degree of uncertainty So I would not support any move which would raise interest rates at this time Think of the leverage--I use the term badly--that interest rates have in the foreign exchange markets, in less developed countries, in debt coverage servicing, and on and on While we should not dismiss M1 entirely, of course, we don't know [what drives] M1 at this time Eventually we will; ex post we will look back on this period and say it was quite obvious that X, Y, and Z were the reasons why M1 behaved in the way it did So, do we lose credibility if we continue to treat M1 the way we have? No one knows But we have a Chairman who communicates pretty well with the financial community After all, we have sublimated or at least set aside to some degree the narrow aggregate to date; we have two other aggregates and we have the debt number and other measures; and we have an able spokesman here What I am trying to say here is to some extent heresy and that is that I think in this six-week period we should concentrate more on the fed funds rate in the execution of policy I would mean by that that we would keep the rate exactly where it is now We would not let it drift up or push it up as some have advocated I believe we can maintain credibility by maintaining the rate While I would go for ""B,"" I would hope that in the implementation by the Chairman and the staff that we would keep rates relatively stable I think stable interest rates might be a contribution to this short-run period We have heard of stable rates; we have experienced those--it is hard to remember--and I think that might add to our credibility and to some measure of stability in an unstable world It might even add stability to the decline, and hopefully the gradual decline, in the dollar I would hope in that regard, Mr Chairman, that in the [wording of the directive] we would  -27-    8/20/85  move the [reference to] foreign exchange markets up in position and/or have language indicating that we are paying considerably more attention to that part of the directive  Well, I was going by the report of our Staff Director who said 7-5/8, 7-3/4, 8 percent I would hope that the Chairman wouldn't see fit to go above 8 percent, and I would think that would be consistent with about $350 to $450 million in borrowing and whatever excess reserve path goes along with a cap of 8 percent I wouldn't want to see 8 percent in the directive but I would hope-- failing some gyration in the dollar, which I think is the thing that would be a more important factor now--that we could keep it at 8 percent to 7-1/2 percent  How about $350 to $500 million and a funds rate of 7-1/2 to 8 percent?  I wouldn't want to specify it  It must be about right!  It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that alternative II is a somewhat fuller discussion of M1 growth--what we expect and what its implication is--than alternative I  Seems reasonable  8-1/2 percent and 6-1/2 percent  Geometrically or arithmetically!  8-1/2 percent  Yes How about omitting it?  That it matters less than it used to  9 percent is the expectation, isn't it? Why don't--  No problems with it  I'd prefer ""might"" instead of ""would"" in the first sentence  -44-    8/20/85  Yes  Yes Given its importance today in all markets and the vulnerability of the financial system, I think we should give evidence that we are indeed more concerned about that sector  If the Chairman had just made a presentation to Congress or a major address on that subject and given a signal, I'd be for putting it up there But since that has not--  Put it in after ""strength of the business expansion"" now, and then when you have made such a presentation move it up "
2997,1985-10-01,MARTIN," Mr Chairman, I note that much of the positive news recently has to do with housing sales and the leading indicators When you take autos out of consumer spending and analyze the [rise in  -13-    10/1/85  the] leading indicators, which has been in the financial [components] up until the very last month, I am not sure that there has been such a turn in the leading indicators as to point to much more strength in the period we are going through I note and support the Fed staff revising the growth downward in some of their projections at least It seems to me that when the labor force resumes its growth, we well could have that two- or three-tenths improvement [in the unemployment rate] disappear, as I think Jim hinted at As the labor force resumes growth and we remain on a 2 percent [real GNP] growth line rather than 27 or 3 percent or whatever, unemployment could well begin to creep up again, given the continued layoff news It seems to me that protectionist tendencies are obvious in the Congress The price situation already has been alluded to wholesale prices, the CPI, and the deflator are all looking reasonably good Commodity prices generally are down OPEC and the Saudis are having their [annual] charade When you look at the revised third-quarter data, you find that CCC purchases are very important as are the purchases of autos by consumers I don't get a very secure feeling about the fourth quarter on that I note in the staff projection that while the inventory buildup, the restocking, is not the whole [explanation] for another quarter of 3 percent real growth, it is most of it We have been disappointed, if that's the word, in the inventory buildup in recent months; we previously were projecting inventory being a [plus] factor for the third quarter I would make the same comment about the [projection for] inventories for 1986 I think that we may be a little too positive in that I feel we are quite optimistic in our analysis of the trade balance and how quickly that is going to help us and how quickly import prices are going to change We are talking about changes by the second quarter of next year So, we well could have 2 percent real growth for the fourth quarter and for the first and second quarters or perhaps for the whole year next year Once again, that gets me to the problems of unemployment and protectionism  In terms of monetary policy, I would go along with alternative B, but given the way the markets have perceived our policy until very recently, the funds rate has been trading down below what might be expected Add the borrowings and the excess reserve position to the federal funds trading range and it looks as though the market really hasn't detected the slight movement toward more borrowing and slightly higher rates from the last FOMC [meeting] Therefore, I would like to see us go back to $425 million as the starting borrowing level and to 7-1/2 to 7-3/4 percent on the federal funds rate, to give ourselves a little action space in interest rates, in case we do have the dollar giving us even more of a problem than we have already If we have to kick the funds rate up 1/2 point, that keeps it closer to 8 percent than to 8-1/2 percent I'd give ourselves a little space there So, I am for alternative B, previous FOMC meeting fashion, of $425 million and 7-1/2 to 7-3/4 percent on the funds rate  And you are implying a symmetrical view here, essentially, or a little on the tightening side because--  I think variant II is a little more direct It's a considerably more direct expression of what we actually have been doing, Paul, and I think it commends itself because it is direct And it starts off with the aggregates; it doesn't leave them out  Use ""about"" in case we get lucky  ""About 6 to 7 percent"" for both of them  -29-  6-1/2 percent in ""B""  Down 11 or 12--  In variant II, it's the sixth line from the top  It's more direct  It's certainly more economical  I think it's better to say to the market what they already know we're doing rather than hang on to what [unintelligible] short-run picture  Credibility is something of believability Why not say what is?  Until we've made them look the same "
3023,1985-11-04,MARTIN," Jim has given us a ritualistic comment that there has been no change in the forecast and I am going to give the ritualistic response to that and say that there has been a change in the forecast in a direction with which I concur--that is to say, it is more realistic in that the numbers are down a few tenths for the next five quarters and unemployment is constant or creeping up a bit, depending on how well the forecast tracks Like others, I [have reservations] about the assumption of the saving rate staying at a little over 4 percent, but we explored that pretty thoroughly and there is no point in going over that further It is interesting that the forecast contains a shift in government spending in the full employment budget deficit sense, which should be a matter of some interest with regard to what Jerry Corrigan has indicated as a very cautiously optimistic outlook with no sector particularly giving a push It does not look as though [stimulus] is going to come from the federal government sector I am delighted to see the housing forecast revised downward a little I like that old joke about the people who lived in [unintelligible] and everybody knew everybody's story, so their stories were numbered I am going to number my comments, so I will simply say ""number 17"" rather than make you listen to my ritualistic housing comment I warn you, however, that tightening of credit standards by lending institutions has yet to have its full effect and that is coming That is down the road and I think it will be in 1986 but that--in other words, ""17""  No, I said ""17"" already, Chuck That means I think it is a little too optimistic  No, I am talking about housing I am talking about that 18 million housing figure and that $56 billion residential spending number, neither of which we will ever reach    11/4-5/85  The banks, the thrifts, the life insurance companies--  I think the reason is different I think it is because there still is, from the '70s, the expectation that those office rents and that percentage lease income from the commercial property are going to increase with inflation down the road--in three, four years, whatever I think that's built in These people have equity positions and they feel that the office rents and the percentage returns off the commercial property will [provide a good] return In conclusion, I don't think the major issue here is downside risk Let me break another rule and say that I think this is a courageous forecast I think the staff was willing to revise it in a downward direction and take the risk that they might be pessimistic It has implications, of course, for our next round of discussion with regard to monetary policy There is that assumption of somewhat lower interest rates over the 5- or 6-quarter period--a drop of 150 points in one case and 100 points in the fed funds rate in the other case We have to consider whether the forecast results are appropriate-- whether the monetary policy we adopt here is consonant with that 150 basis points decline over this period of time I think it's a good forecast  One half percent  MR> KICHLINE Which price measure are you looking at--the deflator?  Steve, let me ask You pointed out some of the similarities of ""A"" and ""B"" with regard to the aggregates Could you help me understand the differences--and I am talking forward now--in alternative A for the next short-run period versus alternative B? You have borrowings on page 8 [in the Bluebook] of $450 to $550 million for ""B;"" you have borrowings of $200 to $300 million for ""A"" on page 10 That seems to me a rather substantial difference Can you help me rectify this?  From midpoint to midpoint, that would be $500 million for borrowing for ""B"" and $250 million for ""A"" So that's 50 basis points?  Mr Chairman, would that argue for a bit wider range in the borrowing without having to consult with this group, considering the wide range of both that uncertainty and the dollar uncertainty and so forth?  -23-    11/4-5/85  $350 to $500 million  It's certainly not consonant with the action plan the notion of stimulating housing and infrastructure spending  It seems to me--I don't know whether Tom would agree with this--that we're talking about the immediate 2 or 3 weeks of the 5- or 6-week intermeeting period I would think by the end of 5 weeks we might have enough feedback from the markets and from our own economy to change our position, which I would certainly agree to We don't need to ease this moment but that doesn't say that 5 weeks from now we might not  Let me play devil's advocate for just a minute We have been talking about what I think is the real risk of a precipitous decline of the dollar We had a good staff presentation yesterday on the same subject On the other side of this issue is the lack of real action by our trading partners of any kind of coordination of policy, fiscal or monetary And the Japanese contradiction is exhibit A Now, suppose the market players feel that there is not going to be any change in fundamentals--we all know the limitation of intervention policy--and the market moves the other way Is that of some probability? It may not be the most probable outcome  We wouldn't want to say ""decrease slightly""?  That's not what's anticipated in the Bluebook It's 7 percent  And ""somewhat lesser would"" and ""somewhat greater might""  The juxtaposition would delight the Fed watchers  They would count the words in prior directives  We don't want to be symmetrical  And a slight bias toward a little more accommodation  Mr Chairman, since the market seems to be largely disregarding large swings in M1, I think to add this paragraph that is on page 12 of the Bluebook would call attention to something in an inappropriate way We had some language in this direction six weeks ago; I think the same logic applies today  If we say it this way, isn't there a slight implication that we're leading up to putting M1 in the future into a monitoring range or something of that sort? If we go out of our way to say this, aren't we saying ""Next week, folks, we are going to put M1 on a monitoring--""  I'm asking Is that the implication of stating  -36-    11/4-5/85 "
3050,1985-12-16,MARTIN," Let me ask a naive follow-up question Let us suppose that these negative factors that Jerry and Tom are talking about do come to center stage What direction would that enormous capital outflow take then? What are their alternatives?  If they want to switch away from dollar investments very substantially, where do they go?  When you weight the components of M1 by some transactions measure or in some more esoteric and wonderful way and you use a 1-quarter or 2-quarter lag, how is the predictability of velocity of this--whatever you call it--weighted aggregate measure? How does that track? Is it any better or any more predictable?  Yes, I'd say that!    12/16-17/85  Steve, first of all, I want to express what I think is the consensus around the table--don't smile--that you and your associates have done a commendable job in laying out the experience and in doing a certain amount of statistical analysis and being forthcoming with regard to the difficulties of using the monetary aggregates at this time The message I take from this is that we're talking about various components of the several aggregates in terms of varying degrees of moneyness--varying degrees of savings characteristics versus transactions characteristics And that suggests to me that the work that you've already begun to do, and that you said you have considerable academic comments and literature on-- namely, some kind of weighting of the components of the aggregates-- would have the merit of continuing our ability to communicate what we know and can surmise about the behavior of these various balances It seems to me that if you have in train a set of presentations that you've done work on, which you've alluded to, that would be a logical follow-up to a good piece of work on the existing aggregates to communicate with us what you know and are finding out about weighted aggregates I wouldn't have made this little comment a year or maybe even six months ago or maybe not before I read the work that you've done here But it seems to me that this presentation argues for another presentation which would inform us about the weighting that you alluded to on a transactional basis and on a turnover basis of the components If we are to communicate our findings with the Congress and with the public, it seems to me that (a) we have a duty to communicate once this group is comfortable with some weighting of the components and the production of such an aggregate; and (b) that it could give us--admitting all of the drawbacks that Steve has alluded to--some kind of an aggregate in addition to the ones we have or perhaps in replacement of M1 down the road So, I'm encouraged by what you've done I strongly support your hint that we could have other presentations with regard to weighting And I think a transaction weighted component aggregate M1 might be easier to communicate than one weighted by some more intriguing interest- differential [unintelligible], from what little I understand about [the divisia] approach  12 percent nominal  I think that argues for a further study of the turnover of components of each of the aggregates I will broaden my comment here as--  Mr Chairman, I would think with regard to M1 that both this study and our own experience in 1982 and 1983 and 1985, coming so close together and being so much a function of the changing instruments, suggest that there is a learning curve that financial institution managers are going through as they learn how to price these things and be more au courant with the market We don't know if we are trying to share our ignorance among ourselves We don't know how consumers are learning to react, although Jerry had some very cogent things to say with regard to attitudes toward these various instruments All that adds up to me to relegating M1 to a monitoring or information variable, without setting a range I am hopeful that, as the Chairman has indicated, we would have a chance to review the work that has been done on various weighted M1 components or perhaps M2 components We could have a justification for M1 being put on the shelf temporarily in that we are making a substantial effort to provide new data in the form of a weighted M1 or weighted M1s while it is on the shelf--that we are devoting resources to producing a better M1, if you will, just as we went from M1-A and M1-B and shift-adjusted M1 to today's M1 as basic underlying characteristics of the instruments changed They have changed and the behavior of both the offeror and the user is changing It seems to me that we could couple [a statement] that we don't have a target for M1 with [an indication] that we are producing new data--a new M1, if you will  I said I would propose that we not have a range this time I admit that, yes, we had a range before But we didn't have as much uncertainty then as we have [now]  This time, yes sir  It says it again right here  Bob, the trouble I have with that is that the monetary policy assumption in the Greenbook carries a 125 to 150 basis point decline in interest rates next year That means you're throwing in another big variable, the same big variable again--a big drop in interest rates  All I'm saying is that that is one of our assumptions  M2 and M3 and monitor M1 and nonfinancial debt  Oh, I see  Talk about missing [a target]!  Interest rates or exchange rates What other alternative do we have?  Jim, what's your impression of the George Gilder argument that the lower top bracket rates in one or another version of the tax revision would actually stimulate the entrepreneurs--the proprietorships, the smaller firms, the Silicon valley types and the Boston railroad people and what not? [He argues] that all the fuss in the Halls of Congress is coming from General Electric and people like that and that actually this might have a positive effect on business fixed investment coming from a different source Is that--  They wouldn't be in the business  Mr Chairman, it seems to me that as we enter the fourth year, if that's what it is--if anyone can measure the beginnings and ends of these expansions--the risk elements continue to build The Chairman mentioned agriculture There is some miracle kind of farm bill, which looks like it has made some progress, that begins to change the game a little--and perhaps in a positive direction--with regard to world prices and targets and other prices from the US government That bill would require a bit of change of format by agricultural producers and traders in the commodity markets, if it passes in that way I think that's characteristic of the export area on which we are depending for late-in-the-year support for the economy What's different about that to me is the much more assertive --I won't say aggressive--stance and approach taken by Clayton Yeider and by this administration I am not criticizing that approach but it complicates the [effort to] increase US exports in that there are [potential] retaliatory actions in Europe and elsewhere I haven't seen anything that really clearly lays out how in this assertive, almost adversarial, atmosphere we get that additional export help in the GNP sense Probably we will, but it seems to me that there is a risk when you approach these negotiations in a somewhat different way  As far as housing is concerned, I am usually the pessimist in that area I think the staff forecast in the housing area is reasonable at this time, but it is reasonable because of the monetary policy assumptions A decrease of 125 to 150 basis points in rates is really necessary if we are to get this more or less modest improvement There is a down side in this too, of course, in that as the regulators put pressure on the originators and servicers of mortgages, there is a risk that this plus in the GNP won't come about because the credit standards will be higher, because they won't be able to qualify the borrowers, and because there have to be more write-offs They are getting to this talk about good banks and bad banks and splitting the mortgage originators into the good institutions and the bad institutions Well, that's another factor to cope with, another bit of uncertainty Uncertainty means risks in that area The risk of a collapse in non-residential spending is obvious We have gone over practically every molecule of that risk in our meetings here, and rightly so There is a slight decrease, 07 percent or something like that, in the model results here And I  -34-    12/16-17/85  understand that Jim warned me that he built some other slow growth rates in there before and the markets raced on ahead But there is a risk, isn't there, of a collapse--of a really sharp negative in that area? One could go on to examine the risks in the financial institutions; 113 banks have changed the name on the door In most cases, it's not a calamity, but the risk goes on And banks really haven't addressed the write-downs that they are going to have to do with the Perus of the world, have they? Some have started, but relative to banks in other countries and relative to so-called tax reform, now characterized as a revision treatment of the bad debt reserves, that certainly is a risk--in terms of facing that question and in terms of bank credit growth (not off-balance-sheet but on- balance-sheet bank credit growth) and the funding of continued economic growth We are only talking about another four quarters of around 2 percent We certainly have had enough quarters of around 2 percent with the downside risk what it is So what I want to stress this morning is the need to keep in mind the monetary policy assumptions in this projection I support the projection but I also support the monetary policy assumptions, which go to a rather prompt-- I almost said a bad word--a rather prompt accommodational posture and carrying that on out for the balance of the year  Yes, I didn't want to say ease  Well, I think that projection for M1 may be a little on the low side, Mr Chairman, and given the interest rate--  I just noted that we get a 7-5/8 percent funds rate pretty quickly and that it's at 6-1/2 percent by the end of the year It seems to me that's a vital part of making 2 percent growth next year with all the downside risk  Just a factual question, Jim Is DRI still sticking to a 19 projection of GNP for next year?  Maybe that's their only floating rate That's not so difficult to counter  You sell and close at whatever rate is then the lower rate  [Unintelligible] in today's technical--  Three or four months from now [unintelligible] I don't think they gave you a very good reason, Paul  Mr Chairman, I think you were quite right in directing our attention to the growth in bank credit and total reserves and other factors They are labeled here the key monetary aggregates I think, though, particularly in terms of Ml, what has come out of our discussion yesterday, which spills over to some of these other aggregates, is that given deregulation--given the pricing and the consumer reaction to new instruments and new spreads and new opportunity cost relationships--we really don't know what those figures mean At least we don't know as much as we used to know about them Secondly, it seems to me that the staff's forecast has not been demolished in our discussions earlier today Therefore, with the forecast, which would be extant if we kept conditions as they are today with the adjustment and seasonal borrowings running $633 million in September, $558 million in October, and $672 million in November, it seems to me that we run a risk of recession--to get that word out in the discussion--rather than a 2 percent growth  It seems to me also that your comments with regard to coordination are certainly in order I believe in the technical information we've had with regard to a discount rate cut that what has been assumed here is 50 basis points I haven't heard anyone mention 25 points; 50 points seems to have been implicit or explicit in the discussion Plus a move to a configuration such as alternative A might be (a) risky as far as the dollar falling; and (b) over- stimulative relative to what little we do know about these monetary aggregates anymore So, I would like to see the Chairman and the staff use the alternative A course in conjunction with a future discount rate cut I think there is merit in removing what appears to be the floor under short-term rates vis-a-vis long-term rates I would hope that we would have an alternative A which would merge in the direction of alternative B down the road I would hope that this Committee would give the Chairman an unusually wide band for the borrowing I don't know what the band should be--perhaps $300 to $500 million or something rather wide so that this operation could take place By this operation I mean to start easing in the market, moving toward $300 to $350 million so that the fed funds rate begins to come down, and to adjust the discount rate by 50 basis points and continue  -50-    12/16-17/85  to work the Desk operations so that the borrowings firm up a little within that range, depending on the Chairman's judgment at that time, back to $400 million, let's say At any rate, [I favor] a start toward providing a 50 basis point change at the short end I think the market expects that and that we run the risk of its backing up on us, including in the short-term rates That, as the Chairman indicates, is certainly a desirable direction But as we all know rates are still at a very high level in real terms And the staff was indicating this morning that the high real level of long-term rates helps produce 2 percent growth for another four quarters which, as has been commented here, is insufficient We should do what we can to bring growth up some Therefore, I vote for alternative A with a wide band around the borrowings; and I'm looking forward to a discount rate cut and some adjustment of the borrowings accordingly  I would too  They have moved more in a week than they used to move in a presidential term! I think 25 basis points is almost--what is it that the advocates call it?--""de minimus"" or some phrase  M1 doesn't  They certainly expect it The media discussion has been revolving around the area of the discount rate and policy  It's a little artificial to look as though we ignored the discount rate  Yes, it goes there better  Let's demote it as much as we can  9 percent plus or minus 6 percent  It's more like 7 to 10 percent, isn't it? Seriously  [Unintelligible] it and missing it all the time  But Jerry, I thought the staff number for borrowing was $200 to $250 and they had 9-1/2 percent on M1 No?  Okay--then we start off missing it  I would rather take it out  I would rather take it out Treat it separately; it's a separate behavior This is the one that hasn't been near the middle or top of the range; it has been off the charts People know it has been off the charts  -65-    12/16-17/85  7 to 10 percent?  Neither is M1 on the charts  May or may not grow?  The foreign exchange markets part--  We'd be criticized if we didn't have it in there  Do you want to take ""appraisals"" out?  -67-    12/16-17/85  Rephrase it ""might"" and ""would""  Don't change it "
3075,1986-02-11,MARTIN," I would like to ask Ted Truman about his vertical bar chart, chart 16, on the changes in consumer prices in foreign industrial countries and in the United States Could you disaggregate that a little for us? What are you and your people projecting for the Federal Republic [of Germany] and for Japan? I was at a European conference recently and there was a lot of talk about zero inflation in the Federal Republic and I wonder what you are--  I heard that too  What are you assuming about policy in the Federal Republic and Japan vis-a-vis their interest rates? When you get to the capital flow, what are you assuming--no change, whatever change we do?  So the totality of that analysis wouldn't be particular downward pressure on the dollar, just from matters such as the interest rate spreads and inflation spreads    2/11-12/86  I thought the index flattened in October, but if you are using year-over-year figures, I don't know how it works out  I appreciate the timing of my turn, getting to debate with my friend, Bob Black It seems to me that the indications for future prices are quite the other way I see no turnaround in the commodity price situation around the globe It seems to me that there still will be almost a dumping behavior and that in some cases the LDCs will be [induced] in various situations by oil price declines and necessity to dump something else into the markets In terms of the oil price change, I think it is more fundamental; I respectfully differ with you in that regard I consider the faint possibility that some day the Iranians and the Iraqis will stop the killing of each other and there will be an augmented supply from that part of the world It seems to me that gluts beget shortages down the road, but it takes many years We have experience from the two oil shocks that we have been through and now we are in a glut situation I believe the inflation outlook is positive from those points of view  I don't know, Jerry, about productivity; I am as puzzled as anybody else I certainly missed forecasting that over a period of time, but I don't share your negative approach to productivity It seems to me that we have yet to realize our trend rate of growth I think 3 percent is too low a guess with regard to potential GNP; the gap could be a couple of hundred basis points that we are falling short by And I am not comfortable with the staff's projections of export growth There is a table in the Greenbook in current dollars that shows an increase--I don't remember the percentage anymore and I've scratched over it once--of about 25 or 30 percent in five quarters I don't think we are going to make that for the very reasons that this special report detailed I won't take the time of this rather large Committee but you may remember the 7 or 8 points made in that report, which added up to a delay of the impact the long-term contracts, fixed investments, special factors and so forth, that we all read in that report I don't think we are going to be able to take market share back; I try to [unintelligible] my experience with Sears World Trade, which goes back a few years, but I just don't see our being able to compete in the manufacturing area with the Koreans and others around the globe I don't think we are going to get that share back, and I think we still are going to be struggling with the difficulties of competing with imports  I think the fiscal drag situation is spelled out very nicely in two of the line diagrams in the staff's presentations we're swinging from a growth in real federal purchases of about 12 percent in 1985 to a decline of almost 8 percent in 1986--and then you add on to that state and local government, as the chart graphically displayed Will that be offset by some of the more positive factors that have already been reviewed? I suppose it will, but I don't think we are going to get rates of growth of 4 percent past the first    2/11-12/86  quarter I go along with Frank Morris' estimate of something more like 3 percent When the Chairman polled us not too many months ago as to what we thought about 3 percent growth, I said it's inadequate It is particularly inadequate when you think of the debt that we have to service in this country; every sector is this country has a huge debt Add to that the less developed country situation and the Germans and Japanese headed for a 1 to 2 percent inflation posture  It seems to me that if we are erring in any direction in terms of the economy, it is that we are understressing the risk of even more inadequate growth after the first quarter The first quarter is fine; but once again we are all so impressed with two months' data, not all of which were positive, yet we are talking about monetary policy that is going to impact the third and fourth quarters of this year and the first quarter of next year The first quarter of next year will be the fifth year of expansion, as Governor Wallich has already reminded us It is a pretty old expansion Whether or not it is obvious where the structural imbalances are, we know they are built in there Goodness knows we have had enough changes in the economy sector by sector, as Karen pointed out, and in industry by industry-- in manufacturing, the thrifts, nonresidential construction and so forth I don't think we are going to achieve the numbers that are in the Greenbook for business fixed investment Looking at the fourth quarter and all the shipments and contracts on Sierra--well, IBM is a fine institution and all that, but you can certainly get distorted data from one quarter's move there I don't think we are going to have big upswings in business fixed investment and nondefense durable goods orders The Defense Department finally seems to be waking up a little with regard to what they are about over there It just seems to me that the risks are on the down side and that we have an opportunity here because there is some disinflation in the totality We have an opportunity to look at monetary policy with a little more action space than in a different economic situation  I would support that view, Mr Chairman It seems to me that our experience last year using the parallel lines that you alluded to, as well as the various projections, are consonant with M2 and M3 ranges of 6 to 9 percent, even On a pragmatic basis, I don't think there's a big argument to go to 6 to 10 percent or something like that Ml is different  But it does for Ml, right? 7 percent?  Mr Chairman, it seems to me if there's one term that applies to the difficult forecasts that were so well done by the  -30-    2/11-12/86  Board's staff and so widely supported yesterday, it is ""uncertainty"" We do face a degree of uncertainty that even for a forward-looking group of economists is notable It seems to me that this is epitomized by a comment on page 6 below the alternatives for the long run as we futilely define it here the reference to the substantial portion of the rapid demand deposit growth of last year, which is unexplained by any concept of interest elasticity Of course, we could experience that again this year I join President Corrigan in the expectation of not putting a great deal of weight on it, but expecting that we probably won't have that continued growth But we don't understand it And if there are difficulties in the Southwest and in some of the oil-exporting developing countries, certainly that phenomenon or something like it could return But we don't understand the very interest elasticity that now characterizes M1, or at least components thereof Therefore, adding these two factors together, I would favor a 3 to 8 percent range around M1 to give the Committee flexibility and to reflect the uncertainty generally--not just the demand deposit uncertainty, but our lack of ability to forecast Ml right now in this context I would not favor taking the 1984 approach, though, of putting M1 too deeply out of the show because I do feel that the money managers in banks will learn reasonably shortly--the market is going to force them to learn--how to price various instruments and what the interest elasticity in their submarkets is That aspect of the interest elasticity, in the institutional sense, will tend to be more understandable over time, I think  So, I would favor keeping M1 in the pantheon, widening the range because of the uncertainty with regard to velocity and other aspects of it, and giving us the flexibility in implementing policy to deal with the unexpected Think of the unexpecteds we have before us right now In the last 10 hours the flow of news [has included] that the Conference Board's consumer confidence index is down; Minister Takeshita again is hinting about a further discount rate cut by the Japanese; and of all things, IBM is substantially cutting the price of its brand new CPU mainframes just as their deliveries are taking place I think we really have to expect the unexpected We need wide ranges With regard to President Corrigan's comment about the language, Mr Chairman, I would like to see symmetrical language indicating that if economic growth falters very substantially--and I think there is a real risk of that occurring--we would be prepared to adjust even our targets but certainly the way in which we implement our monetary policy, regardless of what aggregate or aggregates we were focusing on I think Steve's comment about the triumvirate is impressive And I would join Frank Morris in wondering why we still cite the debt [aggregate], which we can't control We can affect that only marginally; there's no way to hit any kind of target or any kind of monitoring number on the debt range  Mr Chairman, since it is almost a duty of your office to express the policy and views of the central bank, how could we drop it? I am speaking now from a political point of view, not from an economic point of view From an economic point of view I think we ought to drop it, but politically how could we when it is your role, and properly so, to indicate that the leveraging of America has gone too far--that there are dangers and risks in it How can we then turn around and drop it out of the pantheon?  I think it would be very appropriate  It would be appropriate to have language which would say ""and therefore a wide range has been set""--if we set a wide range  We haven't anything to do with whether or not we miss it What difference does it make?    2/11-12/86  I am denying we missed it last year  ""Target"" or ""target range""?  It tilts it toward the inflationary pressures--  There's disinflation in the economy with the oil price [decline] Does that sound consistent with all we've just heard--that oil prices may go down another $5?  Yes, I appreciate the contingency so long as it is symmetrical  ""Developments in the economy that might indicate weakness""?  That makes it symmetric That was your intention  If we don't make that amendment, then we really are featuring Ml; we are starting with M1 and finishing with Ml  Yes, I wouldn't  Yes  It is a little weighted toward fear of inflation whereas if it said ""[developments] in the economy that might indicate weakness""--  Sure  Mr Chairman, I note that the Greenbook's quarter-by-quarter projection has the second quarter of 1986 as a weaker quarter, at 23 percent Whatever the error range is around that, that is still a stepping down of growth from the first quarter which, as I read the consensus around the table here, is for a pretty strong rate of growth--stronger than the fourth quarter of 1985 But what we do here today will have some effect on the second quarter of 1986, although one can debate the time period needed to affect activity It seems to me that almost eliminates alternative C; there is no compelling reason to raise interest rates at this time The markets, of course, are going to start speculating or already are speculating about what we are discussing here right now; certainly, they will speculate once the monetary data are released this Thursday That will [result in] a little headline here or there when we start talking about much lower rates of growth of Ml We will release the record of policy actions for December in a couple of days, so we are going to release some interesting numbers one day and some interesting history the next day And the history is going to point toward the very modest easing in that report for the December meeting  Moving to the alternatives, it seems to me that the market has been telling us something The market has been acting through the commercial bank mechanism and has been keeping the borrowing numbers low relative to our target of $350 million It seems to me that now would be the time to recognize the market signals and begin to move the borrowing target first from $350 million to $300 million and then see what the market response is to that If the response is appropriate--if the federal funds rate begins to come down a little-- then I'd very carefully reduce the borrowing level another $50 million I am not in favor of alternative A either for the same reason I reject alternative C I think ""A"" probably takes us down to below the frictional level of borrowing I don't know whether that is $150 million or $200 million or whatever I think we ought to move in that direction, though, in a couple of stages That would permit the Board of Governors to respond to the 5 or 6 remaining requests--I hope they are remaining--to lower the discount rate In other words, it would give us some room to act in a way that would aim at that second- quarter figure and at the figures the staff has provided us for the rest of the way So, I am a ""B+"" person here with a [unintelligible]  Mr Chairman, it seems to me you've expressed well two of the factors that we must consider in this short-run goal setting and that is the rather overworked [unintelligible] projection of the change in the price of oil and the known change in exchange rates But I would hope that the impact of the change in the price of oil would predate the impact of the exchange rate changes because of the contracts, the business relationships, the investment and distribution systems and all the rest of it And, therefore, I would hope that we would have a window here--to use another overworked cliche; it's cliche day at the Board--for a brief time to move the fed funds rate down by moving the borrowing rate We should take advantage of it  No "
