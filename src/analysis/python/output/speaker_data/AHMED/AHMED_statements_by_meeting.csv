8391,2008-12-15,"  I will be referring to the exhibits that follow the blue International   Outlook cover page  Financial markets in foreign economies remain stressed but  have not suffered further pronounced deterioration since the October FOMC meeting   As shown at the top of your first exhibit, government bond yields in major industrial  economies have dropped, likely reflecting further expected monetary policy easing,  lower inflation expectations, and a firming of the belief that economic recoveries are  not around the corner  Equity markets, shown in the middle left, have changed only  moderately, on net, since your last meeting, compared with large declines in previous  months  The emerging-market aggregate CDS spread, shown in the middle, has been  volatile but remains elevated  As shown to the right, gross private capital inflows to  emerging markets through debt and syndicated loans have continued to trend  downward       The exchange value of the dollar against the major foreign currencies (the black   line in the bottom left panel) has moved down a little since the last FOMC meeting   Some bilateral exchange rate movements were substantial, however, with the dollar  appreciating markedly against the pound and depreciating against the yen  As shown  to the right, the dollar has appreciated somewhat against the currencies of our other  important trading partners, driven by movements in the Mexican peso and the  Brazilian real  Earlier this month, the dollar registered one of its biggest daily  increases against the Chinese renminbi in recent years, although this shows up only as  a tiny blip in the chart  We believe that Chinese authorities will allow the renminbi to  depreciate somewhat in the coming months; NDF (nondeliverable forward) contracts  also imply an expected depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar over the next  year or so        Incoming evidence on economic activity abroad continues to be grim  As shown   in line 1 of the table in exhibit 2, we now estimate that foreign economic growth was  below 1 percent in the third quarter  Although growth in Canada (line 7) and Mexico  (line 12) surprised on the upside, readings elsewhere were generally weaker than  expected, with real GDP contracting in the United Kingdom, the euro area, and Japan  (lines 4 through 6)  As shown by the red bars in the middle left panel, net exports  made significant negative contributions to growth in these three economies   Domestic demand (the blue bars) was also soft  Growth in emerging Asia (line 9)  was barely positive in the third quarter, reflecting subdued growth in China (line 10)  and substantial contractions in most of the newly industrialized economies (shown in  the middle right)     December 15–16, 2008 111 of 284      With data from the current quarter pointing to greater weakness than we expected   and a substantially more pessimistic US outlook, we have further slashed our  forecast for total foreign growth to minus 1½ percent in the current quarter and minus  1¼ percent in the next, before a recovery to a positive but still relatively weak  average pace of about 1 percent through the remainder of next year  The widespread  nature of the economic slowdown in large part seems to reflect trade linkages  As  depicted at the bottom, in recent years US economic growth (the black line) and the  growth of total real exports of our major trading partners (the green line) have been  significantly related  Although foreign exports are affected by many factors in  addition to US GDP, the relationship shown and the gloomy outlook for US  economic activity through next year paint a bleak near-term picture for foreign  exports        Your next exhibit focuses on the advanced foreign economies in more detail    Data from Europe point to a sharp slowing in the current quarter  The timeliest  indicators are PMIs (purchasing managers’ indexes), which, as shown in the top left  panel, have plummeted in recent months in both the United Kingdom and the euro  area, reaching levels well below those observed during the 2001 downturn  As  depicted to the right, in Japan, exports (the black line) and industrial production (the  blue line) have contracted during the current quarter, and conditions in the labor  market have deteriorated further, as manifested by the decline in the ratio of job  openings to applicants (the red line)  Indicators from the current quarter in Canada,  shown in the middle left, point to weakness in real exports and a continued drop in  housing starts  Authorities in advanced foreign economies are attempting to shore up  aggregate demand through fiscal stimulus  As listed in the middle right panel, many  countries have announced stimulus packages, including Germany, France, and the  United Kingdom  We estimate that the actual stimulative content of the packages  announced so far is likely to be small but expect that additional measures will be  introduced next year  The total fiscal stimulus that we are assuming should boost  growth in the advanced foreign economies by ¼ to ½ percentage point at an annual  rate from mid-2009 through 2010  The possibility of bigger fiscal initiatives is an  upside risk to our outlook for foreign growth       Many of the foreign central banks have become more aggressive in easing   monetary policy, as can be seen at the bottom left  Since the last FOMC meeting, the  Bank of England and the ECB have slashed policy rates by a total of 250 basis points  and 125 basis points, respectively, and the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan  have lowered rates by smaller amounts  More rate cuts are expected in all of these  economies, which could bring rates in Japan back down to the zero lower bound  As  shown on the bottom right, inflation in the advanced foreign economies is now  expected to recede at a faster rate than previously projected, reflecting sharp declines  in commodity prices as well as diminished resource utilization     Turning to emerging-market economies, as shown in the top left panel of   exhibit 4, the recent behavior of Chinese industrial production, total exports, and   December 15–16, 2008 112 of 284    imports from Asia is now reminiscent of developments during the year 2001  The  plunge in imports from Asia casts doubt on the notion that China has become an  independent engine of growth in the region  As depicted to the right, Korean exports  and aggregate industrial production in Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan are plummeting   In Mexico, third-quarter output was bolstered by expansion in the agricultural sector,  but as shown in the middle left, exports have moved down sharply, and consumer  confidence has dropped below 2001-02 levels  In Brazil, too, shown on the right,  there has been some softening in exports (the black line), which had been supported  by high commodity prices, although industrial production (the blue line) has held up a  bit better       With prospects for exports in the doldrums, policy stimulus has become all the   more important to the outlook for emerging-market economies  As noted in the  bottom left, monetary easing has continued, with interest rate cuts in many emerging  Asian economies, including China and Korea  China, Malaysia, and Brazil have also  lowered bank reserve requirements  In addition, fiscal stimulus packages have been  announced in a number of economies, most notably China  China’s 16 percent of  GDP spending package considerably overstates the ultimate effects on growth as it  includes some previously announced projects, its implementation may take longer  than announced, and the federal government is slated to pay for only 30 percent   Discounting the headline number, we estimate that the Chinese package could boost  growth 1 to 1½ percentage points per year  Other countries, such as Korea and  Mexico, have introduced smaller but still sizable packages, which we expect will give  some impetus to growth          In sum, our near-term forecast calls for total foreign growth to be the weakest   since 1982, and as sketched out in our alternative simulation in the Greenbook, there  would appear to be downside risks even to this forecast       Your final exhibit focuses on the US trade outlook  Weak global demand has   contributed to falling prices for food and metals, which have led a sharp decline in  nonfuel commodity prices (the blue line in the top left panel)  Oil prices (the black  line) also have continued to move down rapidly, but futures prices project some  recovery ahead  The fall in commodity prices has exerted downward pressure on  US trade prices (shown in the top middle panel); both core import prices and core  export prices dropped markedly in October and November, which for import prices  were the largest monthly declines in the fourteen-year history of the index  A sense  of the extent of weakness in global demand can also be seen in shipping rates (shown  to the right), which have taken a nosedive       As in the 2001 recession, US real exports and imports of goods (shown in the   middle left) are now trending down  Imports (the red line) have been moving down  all year  The falloff in exports (the black line) is a more recent development and, in  part, reflects hurricane-related disruptions and the strike at Boeing  As shown in the  table, growth of both real exports of goods and services (line 1) and real imports  (line 3) was noticeably weaker in the third quarter than we had previously estimated    December 15–16, 2008 113 of 284    For the current quarter, we see both real exports and real imports contracting sharply,  reflecting the slowdown in global demand  Looking ahead, our projections for a  stronger broad real dollar (shown in the middle right) along with our weaker outlook  for foreign growth have led us to revise down sharply our forecasts for exports,  especially in 2009  In the near term, our projections for imports have also been  marked down considerably  As shown in line 5, the contribution of net exports to  US growth is expected to swing slightly negative in the current quarter, following  large positive contributions earlier this year  The current quarter’s contribution is  considerably weaker than projected in both the October and the December  Greenbooks, as last week’s export data surprised us on the downside  Next quarter,  with a substantially greater step-down in imports than in exports, we expect the  contribution of net exports to US growth to jump back up, before returning to  negative territory for the remainder of the forecast period  That concludes our  presentation        I think the deficit goes down to about 3 percent     Looking at the policy that is going forward, first of all, we are forecasting   here what we think they will do, not necessarily what we think they should do  Given their past   December 15–16, 2008 114 of 284    behavior, we think that they will be ratcheting up the rates the first chance they get  The timing   is a bit different, but the rates are broadly in line with market participants’ expectations  In the   case of the euro area, for example, at the end we are even a little lower than the market   participants are expecting     No  This is our projection       It is informed by surveys, yes     Yes  These numbers are less   December 15–16, 2008 115 of 284      I think the latest official numbers don’t incorporate the November data,   which just came out—actually, they came out yesterday—and some trade data since the   Greenbook     In the near term, yes, through the first half of next year     Shaghil Ahmed  "
