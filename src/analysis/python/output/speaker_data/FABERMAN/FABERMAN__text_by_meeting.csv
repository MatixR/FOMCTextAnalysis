9150,2011-01-25,FABERMAN,"  Thank you  I’ll be continuing with the same set of exhibits,   starting with exhibit 4  As Bruce mentioned at the start of his talk, recently some  have speculated that structural factors are a large part of the reason that the  unemployment rate is still high There is no universally accepted definition of  “structural unemployment”  When Ayşegül and I use the term, it will refer to the  amount of unemployment that is not easily remedied by short-run monetary policy     In our briefing, Ayşegül and I will review Federal Reserve System research on   factors that could potentially increase the amount of structural unemployment in the  economy These include extended UI benefits, changes in employers’ effort in filling  their vacancies, the effects of geographic mismatch, or “house-lock,” and mismatch  between the skills of the unemployed and the skills required for new job openings   The latter topic may be the notion of structural unemployment most people are  familiar with  Ayşegül will also discuss the state of the long-term unemployed and  the prognosis for whether the US labor market could fall into a European-style state  of hysteresis     Before detailing the results of this research, we find it useful to couch our   discussion within the framework of labor search and matching theory  Central to  such theories is the notion of a matching function  A standard expression for the  matching function is in the top panel of exhibit 4  If it looks eerily similar to a firm’s   January 25–26, 2011 18 of 282              production function, it is because the two constructs operate in very much the same  way  A production function maps how much output is generated using a given  amount of capital and labor, given the production technology at hand  Similarly, a  matching function maps how many matches (or hires) are generated from a given  number of job vacancies and unemployed individuals, given the matching  “technology” at hand     The matching function is the theoretical underpinning of the Beveridge curve,   whose behavior Bruce discussed during his talk  You can have either movements  along, or shifts in or out of, the Beveridge curve  These will represent changes in the  mix of vacancies and unemployment, or the amount of hiring that they yield,  respectively  Expansions are periods when vacancies are rising and unemployment is  falling—they are movements up and to the left along the Beveridge curve, as the  lower panel of exhibit 4 shows  Recessions are periods when unemployment is rising  and vacancies are falling, so recessions involve movements down and to the right  along the curve     The topic of our briefing is structural unemployment  Going back to the matching   function at the top of the exhibit, changes in the amount of structural unemployment  will occur through changes in the “matching efficiency parameter,” denoted by the  Greek letter µ in the equation  A rise in structural unemployment causes a decline in  matching efficiency  This, in turn, causes the entire Beveridge curve to shift out, as is  shown in the lower panel of exhibit 4  The shift implies that the economy now needs  more vacancies to generate the same amount of hires from a given level of  unemployment     People often interpret this as implying that all shifts in the Beveridge curve   represent a change in the amount of structural unemployment in the labor market   This is not the case  While all increases in the amount of structural unemployment  are reflected as a decline in matching efficiency, not all declines in matching  efficiency reflect a rise in structural unemployment     For one thing, as Bruce explained, a change in the pace of job loss can cause the   Beveridge curve to shift out  It increases the number of unemployed and therefore  increases the number of people who must now search for new work  As Bruce also  noted, when the labor market moves to a new equilibrium, the Beveridge curve tends  to exhibit a looping behavior, the start of which can appear as a shift in the curve  when one looks at the data  This is because firms can open new vacancies or close  unfilled vacancies at essentially no cost, but it takes time for the unemployed to find  new work and subsequently move to the new equilibrium     Another issue with interpretation is that matching efficiency, as measured in the   data, will also capture all other things that are not specified in the matching function   This is a key caveat to keep in mind when trying to interpret how much a decline in  matching efficiency, or a shift in the Beveridge curve, reflects an increase in  structural unemployment  For example, changes in the behavior of workers who quit   January 25–26, 2011 19 of 282              one job for another can appear as a change in matching efficiency because they will  affect how many vacancies are available for the unemployed  This process is similar  to what George Akerlof, Andrew Rose, and Governor Yellen referred to in a paper as  a “vacancy chain”  In these “chains,” one group of individuals can only find work  after someone else moves further up in the chain and frees up their former position  It  is worth noting, though, that some search models address this issue  For example,  some redefine the “unemployed” as all individuals looking for work, regardless of  their status  As another example, changes in the search effort of either workers or  firms will also appear as a change in matching efficiency, if they are not explicitly  accounted for in the matching function  When the unemployed search more intensely  to find new jobs or firms recruit more intensely to fill their vacancies faster, it will  lead to more matches for a given level of unemployment and vacancies     Using the production function analogy again, these examples imply that measured   matching efficiency can operate like the Solow residual  Macroeconomists use the  Solow residual as a measure of technological change in the economy, but they are  well aware that the Solow residual also captures changes in any factor that is not  explicitly part of their production function     Now, let me move on to the empirical research  An obvious policy that could   affect the search effort of workers is the federal extension of unemployment insurance  benefits  The eligibility period for these benefits has been extended to unprecedented  lengths  Currently, individuals in most states are eligible for up to 99 weeks of  benefits  In normal times, they are eligible for 26 weeks of benefits  There are  concerns that these extensions reduce the incentive of the unemployed to search for  work  There are also concerns that extended benefits cause workers to reject job  offers they otherwise would have accepted  The extensions also provide support, of  course; for instance, they can provide liquidity to individuals who have exhausted  their assets while unemployed, and they can decrease the chance that an individual  opts to drop out of the labor force entirely  The result of these responses is that  benefit extensions will end up increasing the amount of structural unemployment in  the labor market, as we have defined it  At the same time, this increase should  dissipate once the policy of extended UI benefits expires     Several studies across the Reserve Banks have attempted to quantify the effect of   extended UI benefits While these studies differ considerably in their methodologies,  they all generally find that extended UI benefits have added between about ½  and  1½ percentage points to the unemployment rate, with most preferred estimates being  just under 1 percentage point     One study, by Rob Valletta of the San Francisco Fed, exploits the differences in   unemployment duration over time between job losers and other unemployed  individuals  Theoretically, only job losers are eligible for UI benefits  The time  series behavior of average unemployment duration for these two groups is illustrated  in the top panel of exhibit 5, with the duration of job losers depicted by the red dashed  line and the duration of the remaining unemployed depicted by the solid blue line    January 25–26, 2011 20 of 282              Average unemployment duration for job losers increased relative to the average  duration for the second group during the recession, but it has since fallen in relative  terms  Valletta estimates that the total effect of the behavior observed in the chart  was an increase in the unemployment rate of about 08 percentage points     Another study, by Shigeru Fujita of the Philadelphia Fed, exploits differences in   the transition rates out of unemployment for individuals prior to and during the  extended UI benefit period  In doing so, he exploits the fact that there is a spike in  the probability that an unemployed individual either finds work or drops out of the  labor force right at 26 weeks of unemployment  This is the time when UI benefits  normally run out  The spike for both types of transitions dropped precipitously  during the period of extended benefits  The bottom panel of exhibit 5 shows this   The solid blue lines denote transition rates in the pre-extension period and the marked  red lines denote transition rates in the extension period  Fujita estimates that the joint  effect of both the lower job-finding rate and fewer exits out of the labor force worked  to increase the unemployment rate between 09 and 17 percentage points     My own research, with Steve Davis of the University of Chicago and John   Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland, examines the behavior of recruiting  intensity over the business cycle  Recruiting intensity in our setting refers to all  efforts firms put forth in filling their vacancies, conditional on the number of  vacancies that they post  Increases in our measure reflect firms trying relatively  harder to fill their vacancies  This can involve relaxed hiring standards, increased use  of informal networks, or job offers with a relatively generous wage  Decreases in our  measure reflect the opposite, including stricter hiring standards and a stingier wage  offer     The top panel of exhibit 6 illustrates our measure of recruiting intensity over the   2000–2010 period  The measure is derived from an analysis of vacancy-filling  behavior of individual establishments that we then relate to an aggregate measure of  hiring  As one can see, recruiting intensity has declined since the onset of the latest  recession  It stabilized following the end of the recession but at a substantially lower  level, about 17 percent lower than its average over the period  The lower panel of  exhibit 6 shows the actual unemployment rate (the blue dashed line) and a  counterfactual rate that holds recruiting intensity constant over the study period (the  solid red line)  It shows that the persistently low levels of recruiting intensity led to  higher unemployment  We estimate that its effect added about 14 percentage points  to the unemployment rate in 2010     Because the recruiting intensity measure does not isolate the effect of a specific   policy (like UI extensions), it captures the effects of both structural and cyclical  factors that can affect a firm’s recruiting behavior  Therefore, while we can quantify  the effect of its movements on the unemployment rate, we cannot say to what extent  this effect reflects an increase in structural unemployment  If the source of the  decline in recruiting intensity were due to something like uncertainty about a specific  policy (for example, a fear that the new health care legislation may permanently   January 25–26, 2011 21 of 282              increase the cost of a hire), then one could consider its effect as an increase in  structural unemployment  If recruiting intensity were low because firms perceived  the real wage to be too high relative to the qualifications they are seeking, then its  effect should be considered cyclical  Unfortunately, our exercise is silent on which  cause is more likely     To sum up, changes in the search intensity of both workers and firms appear to   have had a sizable effect on the unemployment rate, though their effects come with  caveats  The effects of extended UI benefits are likely structural but should dissipate  once the policy expires  Ayşegül will elaborate on this  The effect of low recruiting  intensity, while sizable, may be due to a mix of structural and cyclical factors, and the  current evidence is silent on which cause may be more important  With that, I turn it  over to Ayşegül, who will review the evidence on the effects of mismatch and house- lock on unemployment and discuss the prognosis of the long-term unemployed      I would like to add to that, going back to some of the points I   discussed—and let me note that this is another thing on which we don’t have very good research   at this point  Movements in the real wage are also going to affect the response of people   collecting UI benefits, as well as how intensively firms go about filling their vacancies  If firms   feel the real wage is too high relative to what they’re looking for, that’s obviously going to affect   how selective they are in whom they hire  If workers collecting UI benefits view the real wage   as too low, they may keep rejecting offers until they find a wage that’s acceptable  So mismatch   dispersion measures aren’t necessarily the only way to think about how wages are going to be   affecting some of the things we’re looking at    I just wanted to add to that  I agree that moving towards models that   incorporate search frictions into a New Keynesian or any other type of DSGE model is a great   way to go  But there is one note of caution about search models in general—regardless of   whether they’re embedded into an RBC [real business cycle] model or some kind of New   Keynesian model—that I’d like to bring to the Committee’s attention  People who write down   theories of labor market search incessantly fight each other about how the wage is determined in   the bargaining between workers and firms  Dozens of models have different ways to do it, and   those ways vary quite a bit in the flexibility of that wage in the aggregate  Some are completely   flexible, such as the standard Mortensen–Pissarides type models  Other models, such as those in   work by Rob Shimer and Bob Hall, incorporate wage rigidities, both in a nominal sense where   the price is actually sticky, and in what the workers’ outside options are relative to what they’re   being offered   January 25–26, 2011 48 of 282              My main point is that, in terms of thinking about policy and the real interest rate and   what’s going with the real wage, in these models, the definition of the real wage is very muddy    I don’t know how much simpler it’s going to make your life to use them, because, while they   helped introduce search frictions and some heterogeneity and new ways to think about the labor   market, they also add new complications precisely in the wage, the one thing you want to think   about the most with monetary policy  "
