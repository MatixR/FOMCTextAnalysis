 [Statement--see Appendix]   The dollar had rallied very strongly and very quickly, as I mentioned, almost certainly basically on short covering And that strength had continued through Thursday, January 16th In the morning we had a rather [sloppy] market because of the questioning of how best to interpret the trade figures At that time the Treasury expressed a very strong view that it was "appropriate," as they put it, to cap the dollar and to adjust it downward somewhat   To ratify the Federal Reserve sale of $25 million against yen on January 17th That was our only operation on behalf of the Federal Reserve during the period   Thank you, Mr Chairman At the time of the last meeting the dollar appeared to be in a trading range of around 16 deutschemarks and 125 yen But we mentioned the definite possibility of considerable volatility and larger moves than economic fundamentals appeared to justify That view of the dollar and the market has turned out to be quite close to what has happened The dollar was quite strong early in the period, mainly as a reflection of a weak yen and mark But in the last several weeks the dollar has been strong in its own right as foreign exchange market participants have accepted all bullish data at face value and ignored bearish signals This morning the DM reached [16730], a depreciation against the dollar of just over 4-1/2 percent since our last meeting The exchange rate mechanism within the European Monetary System has been characterized by some strengthening in the narrow band of currencies against the deutschemark and a continuing weakness of sterling, with the pound fully extended against the [deutschmark] within a wide band The sister currency, the Swiss franc, has been weak and the Swiss National Bank intervened last Friday with sales of and the equivalent of of marks This morning the Swiss were in again and sold The weakness of the Swiss franc seems to be a result of weakness in the real economy, some slippage in price performance, and an unsuccessful attempt to have their interest rates lower than those of Germany  The Japanese yen is trading at 13373; that's a depreciation against the dollar of 7 percent since the last meeting The Japanese monetary authorities have sold a total of in what has been a rather ineffective effort to stop this trend The US Treasury joined in the intervention when on February 17th we sold on their behalf $100 million at 12736 yen to the dollar On February 20th, we intervened again by selling $50 million at 12813 yen, with that operation shared equally by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury The Japanese have continued to intervene, in fact as recently as this morning when they sold in their time zone They did not ask the US authorities to join The Canadian dollar has also    3/11/92  weakened by about 16 percent since the last meeting to $11950 to the US dollar And that's despite very heavy intervention by the Canadians totalling about US dollars  Undersecretary Mulford told me that at the G-7 deputies meeting there was general agreement that the yen was weaker than fundamentals would indicate but no agreement on doing anything The Japanese  As Mulford said, and as Governor Angell and I heard loud and clear at the BIS two days ago, the Europeans  The Germans  Their neighbors, led by the British and the French, are  Needless to say, the British government  So, the Japanese are Both Governor Mieno and his international  deputy told me at the BIS meeting that  Mr Chairman, the only intervention for the Federal Reserve since the last meeting was the sale of $25 million against yen that I mentioned a moment ago I would be happy to answer any questions   Mr Chairman, I think what happened is that the Swiss in January reduced their short-term rates and brought them, if I remember correctly, about 125 basis points beneath the short-term German rates The market at that time was also sluggish in its response It didn't attack the Swiss franc until about the last two weeks And then when the Swiss reversed the interest rate movement and sought to close the differential, the market did not respond to that either So, they gambled and lost on the interest rate differentials and paid for it with about a seven-week lag Now they don't seem to be able to stop the market from punishing them despite the interest rate move   No, the stock market and the bond market in the United Kingdom got hit largely because of the increase in the borrowing requirement, which about doubled There is a general conviction that they will not be able to ease short-term money rates There's a British political tradition there In the history of the United Kingdom, they have on only two occasions lowered interest rates after they called the election and before the dissolution of Parliament, which is next Monday And they have never reduced interest rates between the dissolution of Parliament and the elections So, it's this conviction that they probably won't lower interest rates tomorrow or Monday or Friday that is holding sterling pretty steady   [Statement--see Appendix]   I suppose, Mr Chairman, the answer partially [relates to whether] we should reduce further our overall DM holdings The reduction of DM10 billion this year and the sale of our interest earnings, which I mentioned in my note to the Committee last week, is about the maximum amount that would lead the Bundesbank to feel that we were operating in a friendly manner between central banks That was about the maximum, in conversations that President Corrigan and I had with Mr Tietmeyer, that the Germans could really go along with So, that's a partial answer to the question The shift of the DM6 billion was partially to get some additional yield    3/31/92  With regard to our arrangement with the BIS, just in terms of our own liquidity, we do have an early liquidation agreement with them Therefore, from the standpoint of managing our own affairs, I think the move to the BIS is something with which we can be comfortable     Good morning, Mr Chairman, ladies, gentlemen [Statement--see Appendix]   Certainly   It would leave about $147 billion equivalent in DM after the next transaction, which would be about 24 billion deutschemarks   [Statement--see Appendix]   I think it's not routed completely, but it's certainly less important now because of essentially speculative capital flows based on interest rate differentials and views of stock markets As I mentioned, I think what is hurting the dollar at the present time is the interest rate differential, which is clearly against us, and a view that Wall Street may not be as attractive [as previously] People are reading about the flows into equity mutual funds slowing down and so on The capital flow, which was really the source of strength in the dollar, is slowing down; and that is giving us the weakness even though there's no question on a purchasing parity basis that the dollar is far, far weaker than it should be   From what we hear, the Europeans don't have any interest in any multilateral foreign exchange activity And I haven't heard anything from the Treasury as to their planning to [undertake such operations] But the market is quite convinced that there is going to be at least a US/Japanese accord, which the Europeans will probably bless but not participate in    6/30-7/1/92   I believe there are two factions, but they wind up in the same place coming from different directions The Ministry of Finance thinks that it will be very convenient for them politically in the bilateral relationship with the United States to have a stronger yen The Bank of Japan seems to have a very firm view that a stronger yen encourages capital flows into the stock market, and they would very much like a stronger stock market because of, among other things, the positive effect it would have on the tier-two capital ratios of the Japanese banks   I think what you say is accurate, but what I've described is the position of the Bank of Japan, I'm quite convinced They need not necessarily be right   If the Chairman makes a very strong statement without putting himself in too much of a box--in that regard I would support President Corrigan--that there is a commitment on the part of the FOMC to price stability, I think that is what is important And it can be done in a way in which holding the M2 [range] as the Chairman suggests is going to be fully acceptable to the market I think the market would say this "If you say that you really are uncertain about what is going on in the monetary aggregates and therefore are going to leave them alone, that's fully understandable If you say you don't know what is going on in the monetary aggregates and are studying it and are going to come up with an answer but in the meantime you are going to change the range, the story doesn't hold together" I think the market is always very confused about a story that doesn't hold together and is very accepting of a spokesman with [the Chairman's] degree of credibility saying "We're not sure; we're studying it; and we're going to come up with an answer as soon as we have one" That's a very comprehensible, understandable, believable story   [Statement--see Appendix]   I think one must distinguish in foreign exchange intervention between trying to protect a rate level and seeking to avoid markets being disorderly Now, we have something of a [conundrum] with the Treasury on exchange rate policy; they, I believe, would be rather more interested in the rate Our interest-- certainly my own and the one I keep preaching to the Treasury with regard to what we ought to be doing--is that we should try to avoid disorderly markets [It is only when] we make that second judgment that we will be effective in doing anything As to the two interventions so far, I think the key tie-in to short-term domestic policy is that the Committee has a greater degree of freedom this morning than if the dollar were a great deal lower Now, I have no idea what the deutschemark-dollar rate would be if we hadn't intervened I think it's reasonable to say that it would be a good deal lower and the Committee might be worrying about the weakness of the dollar and any inhibiting factor that might be Going forward, if one were to apply the test of "Is the market disorderly?" and "Would intervention do something about it?", it becomes more difficult the more we intervene It's a tool that gets dull pretty quickly One can really see the difference between the two interventions if you [count] the second two pieces as part of one The first intervention    8/18/92  was very successful because nobody expected it to happen and we did it at a time of day when such intervention normally doesn't happen It was as if there were a rookie pitcher on the mound and Babe Ruth was at the plate and they moved in the fences; it wasn't too hard But now it would be really difficult because the market is sitting there waiting for us to come to them, and that's a very awkward position to be in if we are to accomplish something So, my own view would be that at certain periods it gives the System greater flexibility in monetary policy and at other times it is not likely to be effective and could be counterproductive Philosophically, that's where I am Exactly how you apply that is difficult   I guess the best test of that is that last Thursday the Treasury staff up to just below the Secretary was very inclined to want to intervene; I spent a fair amount of time trying to convince them that it wasn't a good idea At one stage I moved in my good friend, Mr Truman, to help And the two of us I think dissuaded them largely, in addition to policy considerations, on the grounds that it just wouldn't work   Sorry, I did mean "sold"   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Intervention is unlikely to be highly effective because it would be very difficult under the circumstances to organize a coordinated intervention It is tough to be effective intervening on our own I think it's a tool and, quoting President Corrigan at the last meeting, I'd be inclined to say "never say never" It is something that we may want to use The reason it would be difficult to organize a coordinated intervention is that most of the Europeans don't have any deutschemarks, which would be the currency of intervention And the Bundesbank, I would think, probably would want commitments from the Chairman on the future of monetary policy that I suspect he would be very reluctant to give Because of their concern about what [intervention] did to the management of their money supply, it would be a fairly tough argument to make in any case In the midst of a political campaign, if one or more of the candidates could be induced to say that a weak dollar policy is not what he has in mind, that could be somewhat useful if it were done with good timing   Well, all during September we were very much in the mode of not wishing to intervene because of the likely counterproductive effect on [our] domestic markets, especially the bond market Therefore, in fact, I didn't have any discussions of "What if?" or "What do you think we should do?" with them At that time the main thing that would have inhibited any desire by the Germans to do an intervention operation with us is that they very much wanted the ERM to come apart in order to stop having the monetary policy problems they had and to establish what they think is the single most important principle of the mechanism, ie that it be flexible So, I think the main concern they had was purely internally European   Right   Exactly When we did intervention operations during the summer, the other European countries were just delighted every time we even mentioned the [possibility] of it The Germans were much more reluctant, but they didn't want to get "noticed" as being against an operation which the other Europeans saw as positive because in weakening the mark it helped them keep the system together   The technical monetary effect of the intervention wasn't what we were concerned about It was the psychological effect of an unsuccessful intervention operation on other markets   Right       As you know, we have this [conumdrum] with the Treasury, and about 55 to 60 percent of US reserves belong to this Committee and the rest belong to the Treasury Perhaps understandably, given everything else that has been going on, the Treasury has not been able to focus on the whole issue of reserve levels or management since we've had these discussions this year with the Committee I think realistically what we have to do is wait until after the election and until this Treasury team or whatever Treasury team is prepared to talk about it, and then we can come back to the Committee   The foreign exchange market, yes   No It could happen, but my judgment is that the highly expected 25 basis point easing in the funds rate would not do much of anything in the foreign exchange market    10/6/92   They definitely don't have all of these operations sterilized yet; I don't have a good feel of what would be a reasonable percentage   Thank you, Mr Chairman There are two things I've learned by this the fourth business day of responsibility for the Open Market Desk, judging from the first three days Deciding exactly how to go about adding or subtracting reserves and in what amount is a lot tougher than I think anybody, especially me, realized   It has been an interesting baptism The smartest thing I could possibly do was not to fake it for the whole period and, therefore, Joan Lovett will give the report    10/6/92   The first couple of days were aggravated, as was the September 30th quarter-end, when Bank of America's computers went down about halfway through the day on Wednesday And I believe, Bob, they didn't get them fully back up until yesterday    10/6/92   Well, I didn't know that Bank of America is usually a pretty good size supplier of fed funds, so I think that was probably at least a marginal contributor But it isn't the whole explanation of why funds have been quite as tight as they have been   I think the attention span of most people who trade securities is relatively short [Laughter] The big thinkers have tomorrow in mind! Seriously, one of the things that makes them think that way is that their bonus systems are based on thinking for rather quick gratification rather than longer term Going back to your earlier question, in most of the firms the Fed watchers have become much less important than the traders And the traders very much look at psychology; they're getting more and more married to the black box which says that the past is the mirror of the future So it has changed a great deal from the period when the Fed watchers and the economists in the big trading firms were really quite powerful I think there would have to be an extended period of this [unintelligible] off to concentrate on the monetary variables for a change to take place because the firms would have to recast their own internal structures and to whom they listen   Exactly   I think we'd like to discuss that Corrigan- gram!   If I could pick up on Ted's comment for just a moment I think we have to recognize that the situation in Europe is still very unstable So, something could happen in Europe whether we lower the fed funds rate here or don't lower the fed funds rate; it could have very little to do with what we do or don't do But establishing that causality necessarily would be very difficult I come to the conclusion that the foreign market does not inhibit the Committee from doing what it otherwise wishes to do   Fourteen and the BIS   Japan as well, and we also have a small swap line with Mexico   The most likely swap lines to be utilized are those with Japan and Germany I think there are circumstances when, given the tie-ins of the EMS currencies, there could be a possibility --less likely I agree--of using the swap arrangements with some of the other central banks You will recall that we owe the Committee a discussion of the general issues of our currency arrangements and our reserve holdings This is part of that picture I would prefer, and I recommend to the Committee, that we renew the lines and then revisit the issue when we have that later discussion and after we have a new Treasury team with whom to discuss their views   [Statement--see Appendix]   Your [inference] is exactly right We're just at the cusp of being able to see whether it's purely a year-end phenomenon or whether it goes past that The rate structure in the market and perhaps even more our very active conversations with banks and the Wall Street firms do lead us to the conclusion that it's a year-end phenomenon   I think the mass of market opinion is somewhere between your possibilities one and two or a combination of those The single greatest driver to the backup in rates across the yield curve was initially the view that, whoever won the election, there would be a fiscal package early in 1993 I don't think the markets have the benefit of Governor Lindsey's memory of the fact that it [usually] takes a while They think it will happen like that There is, I'd say, a [less prominent] view in the market that the Federal Reserve would go along and monetize this increase in fiscal spending I do think that's [held by] a rather definite minority; most bond market participants feel that the Fed is dedicated to the notion of working toward greater price stability I think some of the articles you're reading are meant to throw hand grenades in our path so that the Committee will be tempted to think that continuing the drive toward a reduction in inflation will involve too high a price That's in a way a compliment; [it supports] the view that the Committee, left to its own devices, will continue its anti- inflationary efforts These articles are trying to increase the political, psychological--or whatever the right adjective is--[cost of disinflation] There's very little market [support for] your third possibility and some for the "tomato" theory, your fourth one But mainly the view is that a fiscal package is likely and that the fiscal package will automatically be inflationary   Yes    11/17/92   I think the near-term easing action would get about 95 percent of the Street's attention And there could be a rather unkind view of why you coupled the two, ie that you were trying to fly the anti-inflationary flag and to couple it with the decrease in order to--going back to the theological discussion early in the meeting--have sin and virtue combined   It doesn't in fact come out We let the market assume that we've eased I think there would be an additional benefit because sometimes it isn't altogether clear how much we've eased and it takes us a day or two of fiddling around with repos and matched-sales in order to convince the market what exactly was done To the degree that there's a benefit in not confusing markets, I think we would actually get a plus from this approach   Yes   Yes   As I understand it, yes   [Statement--see Appendix]   A very, very thin market There was a remark by [Bundesbank President] Schlesinger, which seemed to give a more bland approach to his view of inflation in Germany, that helped the dollar; and then Bloomberg came in with a story interpreting what Schlesinger had said in not such a positive view, so the dollar came off a little But we have these very, very thin pre-holiday markets; so if somebody sneezes, the exchange rate moves a half pfennig   We think the view that Clinton is not likely to have a bigger stimulus package than the $25 to $30 billion that Joan mentioned is probably fully in the market But what we're hearing now, especially in our morning dealer meetings, is the view that the yield curve from fed funds out to about 2 years is too steep And we are beginning to get views, although not yet reflected in trading positions because of the tight year-end period, that bonds in the short end of the curve are very good buys So, if you listen to what the dealers are saying, the market structure would say that we're going to have a very strong economic recovery and that the Fed will tighten about 25 basis points per quarter for the coming year But when we talk to market participants and ask what they think is really going to happen, they have a view that is very close to the staff forecast I'd say just in the last 10 days we have begun to hear people say that if this is what we believe the economy will do and the yield curve is saying that there's much more economic growth and much more Fed tightening than seems to make sense, there ought to be a bond market rally We are just beginning to hear that   Exactly And that's why people who are beginning to talk themselves into thinking that there is a great buying opportunity are focusing on exactly that part of the curve   Mr Chairman, there's also some play in the market now because of the view that the new Treasury team may reduce issuance in the 30-year area So, there is some attractiveness to the 30-year bond among those betting that that will happen, and some of the higher yield or back-up in the 2-year note is the opposite effect --that there will be more supply at the short end of the market and less in the long end of the market But I agree with your view of the more basic thing that is happening   No, and we don't hear it discussed in the market at all The assumption is that that which is virtuous on the fiscal side will not be turned into anything negative in the private sector   Gretchen has done that remarkable thing, which is to flip the ball upward Most of our reserves are in marks and yen, and those are certainly the two currencies that I think one would want the reserves to be in We hold for the two monetary authorities approximately $40 billion in total reserves now, which would impress me as at about the upper end of the reserves that one would consider appropriate What I'm less certain about is what the lower end of that is because I do subscribe to the view that on the day when we need them we surely don't want to have to pass the hat and    2/2-3/93  go get them We have a few remnants of reserves from the past in sterling and Swiss francs I would think, as we move forward in our discussions with the Treasury, that we might wish to concentrate on the reserves of the two most useful currencies [for intervention purposes] If one starts with the notion that reserves are good to have, which I do, I don't think the present level of our reserves is too high But I think it is at about the upper limit of what we would need   [Statement--see Appendix]   The growing feeling, prior to Secretary Bentsen's using the number $30 billion, had been that the likely size of the package would be in the $15 to $20 billion range And I think that was very thoroughly discounted and was being explained as about the minimum the new President could get away with given the campaign promises When [the figure] gets up to about $30 billion--and certainly anything beyond that--I'd say the market has not prepared itself for a fiscal package of that size Therefore, when it gets beyond, say, $25 billion, I think it could create something of a backup, especially in intermediate rates However, this will all be done against a background of what degree of credibility there is in longer-term deficit reduction So, the larger the number in the short term, the more convincing the package for longer-term deficit reduction is going to have to be But it still will be looked at as a package with a desire--not necessarily on the part of the Street firms but we think, [based on] what they say, of the ultimate investors--to believe that there may be a fiscal breakthrough There seems to be a desire to believe as [investors] start moving out the yield curve and picking up more duration that they will pick up more yield It's a rather emotional climate that can be easily dissatisfied But it's sitting there waiting to be satisfied That is how I read it now   Until last Friday when the word came out of Roger Altman's comments on the McLaughlin show, which was aired Sunday, I think there was a feeling that the 30-year bond could be reduced in size to, say, as low as $8 billion After Altman said what he did, my guess is that the number has crept back up and that people think the reduction, if any, will be more nominal If I had to pick a number now, I'd say they probably assume it will be $9 billion or a fraction more   We've been in close consultation on the study through Don The subcommittee's work certainly had the full benefit of both Joan Lovett's and my views on the subject   On releasing the fed funds rate [target] we came down in balance that it should not be done, essentially for the two reasons cited in the study That there can be emergency situations like the fall of 1987 in which our principal concern is liquidity and the last thing in the world we would want to do is to say what the targeted fed funds rate is; and secondly, that it would be very, very difficult, as has just been suggested, if we started publishing the fed funds target to ever get away from funds rate targeting Those were the two reasons that led us to believe that it should not be done   No, we could certainly choose not to On the other hand if, as is presently the case, we didn't have the policy of saying what the fed funds rate target is then there's no issue and no additional uncertainty in an uncertain situation   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the particular market reaction last Thursday when the Germans lowered the discount rate was that the market had gotten itself hooked on the notion that the Germans would lower rates further, at least move lower on both the discount and the Lombard rates So, the market disappointed itself But then it corrected So, we had that funny situation of a fair amount of volatility against a fairly stable 165 rate But in answer to your direct question, I think it's just that the market anticipated more official action than took place   Mr Chairman, if I could add something to that I think one of the things that would give the market a fair amount of insulation from a really nasty kickback is that the investment banking firms--the Street--have for all practical purposes missed this rally completely They have been outsmarting themselves consistently by saying "Well it can't be true; inflationary expectations cannot be being adjusted downward" And, therefore, every time they've had a temptation to short the market they've fallen right into the trap The net result is that they're still not long They still are pretty much either flat or fooling around with a short position And, therefore, the securities are being held by safer hands, those less likely just to throw them out if they see a bad number So, from a technical point of view, the markets are in pretty good shape to get some unpleasant news and absorb it very well, which has been the case for about three weeks now  -8-    3/23/93   Bond funds, pension funds, and investors in general That's because one of the things that has been happening as rates have been coming down is that investors are worried about yield; they're pushing their duration out in order to get the yield That's one of the factors behind the strength as you go out the yield curve I don't think it explains the strength of the long bond, but it does explain a fair amount of the strength in the 5- to 10-year area; people are moving out the curve to get the yield   Let me just add a footnote [In the period] before the intervention that Gretchen described and the Chairman commented on there's no question that the Japanese were not resisting rumors in the market reminding the United States that Japanese life insurance companies held a lot of rather long Treasuries and that if they dumped them, the price to the United States would be rather high As soon as the intervention took place, all of that talk disappeared   [Statement--see Appendix]   Assuming it would happen soon enough so that we have the present market conditions--the short end is priced on the 3 percent funds rate--the likelihood is that interest rates out to two or three years would probably go up I think [a tightening] would probably bring the yield on the 10-year bond down a little because it would be interpreted as the Fed being both active in fighting inflation and very concerned about the economy I think you would get those two reactions What it would do to the 30-year bond is really hard to call If investors became convinced--making that distinction I made earlier--that economic growth is likely to be low and that the Fed is very concerned about inflation, my guess is that the long bond would probably go up in price and down in yield But at the present time it's really being played essentially by hedge funds and various other speculators, and in their hands it could go either way It would depend an awful lot in the longer end of the market on whether the investors were back in If they were, then I think we would get a flattening of the yield curve--short end up and longer end down   It has improved a little in the very recent past by Mr Rostenkowski getting the bill through the House Ways and Means Committee in the shape that it did And I think the market assumption now is that the House will pass the Ways and Means bill Then it shifts over to the Senate, and the market is somewhat confused about that There's no doubt that a fair piece of the rally through March [reflected the view] that gridlock was not likely, that there was a serious effort to reduce the deficit, and that the new Administration had the kind of political skills that they showed in winning the election What has happened is that that view has flipped a lot The market went from thinking that the Administration could do nothing wrong politically to a view that, well, maybe it can't do anything too well either So, I think one would [unintelligible] But the pricing in the market--the fact that we're in the same trading range--in my view would say that the market view is still that the deficit reduction will happen   The general reaction has been that it was motivated by the desire to reduce the deficit   Short term And since most market experts, or at least so-claimed experts, advised against the move, they talked to their [unintelligible] and said it was a bad idea It did not go over well   I think people would be so busy trying to figure out what we'd done that I doubt the funds rate would move I think it would just enormously confuse people   Our intervention today was a two-day System repo of $3-1/2 billion   The law of supply and demand doesn't get changed at all by $200 million So it would be only the signalling effect, and the signalling effect would be to confuse   [Statement--see Appendix]   If you were to ask which side had less enthusiasm, the answer would clearly be ours I don't think  had enormous enthusiasm either Rather, there was the notion that with the cacophony of official statements, it had just become so confusing as to what the policy was that some clarification once again was in order    7/6-7/93   Yes, I think so We were promised that there would be an effort And I think if you look at what has not been happening, including in the first 24 hours or so of the Summit in Tokyo, the silence is remarkable   They got their stories straight   If you assume that the likely outcome is a very uneasy coalition, I think there's a fairly decent chance that the dollar would strengthen a little But the single most important aspect is that the fundamentals, with that tremendous current account and even bigger trade account surplus, point toward a gradually strengthening yen and a weakening dollar And we don't have the conviction, as I mentioned, about a stronger dollar against the European currencies From what we can see of the more speculative players, they find the yen situation sufficiently confusing that they'd rather go and play somewhere else where they can figure out the odds better   Yes The market assumes the weak coalition   Yes   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will continue to try to speak loudly and clearly   Second   Thank you   Thank you It's an honor and a privilege Having sat at the other end of the table for a year and a    8/17/93  half, I can appreciate the very real importance of what we do here It also gave me the opportunity to think about whether any sane person would wish to move from that end of the table to this end And I came to the conclusion one should Thank you   Mr Chairman, the economy of the Second District has weakened slightly in recent weeks and probably can best be described as bumping along a trough The passage of the budget deficit bill following the military base closings in June is likely to add further downward pressure in coming months The labor markets have been weak Employment in the state of New York declined by 14,000 jobs in June, and 51,000 jobs were shed in New Jersey In New York there were declines in manufacturing employment but in New Jersey they were spread throughout the whole economy Retail sales have been very mixed Some firms at the lower end of the market in prices have been doing rather well and the firms selling higher ticket items have been doing rather poorly The budget bill is going to affect the Second District fairly negatively A lot of our neighbors, especially those in lower Manhattan, make a great deal of money and would fit into Governor Lindsey's explanation In addition, the cuts on top of the base closings in the bill especially affect New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut So, the rather negative tone in the area is made somewhat worse by recent developments  At the national level, we believe that the Greenbook forecast is essentially right on The only area in which we in fact agree with the analysis but [where] I am somewhat concerned is that the strength for the export markets seen in Japan and in Europe may be slightly overstated I think the political leadership in Japan is going to concentrate almost exclusively on electoral reform and do very little about the economy And it's very difficult to exaggerate the degree of political dismay in Europe Although I think the forecast for those economies in the Greenbook is the best bet, if there's any risk to it, I think the risk is that [the forecast] is overstated; and that could mean that our net exports would be even a bit weaker The offset is that there would be some reduction in price pressures  In market developments, I think it's fascinating that the 2- to 30-year spread as of the close yesterday was 235 basis points whereas for a very long time the spread was about 3 full percentage points If this spread reflects inflationary expectations, we must ask what has reduced them It's very difficult for me to see that the deficit reduction bill in and of itself reduced them significantly in the recent past There certainly was at least in some quarters a breath of relief that the perils of Pauline had ended and the lady had been rescued from the railroad track and that the bill had passed But the economic effects of the bill had been largely discounted I  -25-    8/17/93  believe quite firmly that the reduction in the spread has come from two factors One, the general expectation that economic growth will be moderate; but perhaps more importantly the move to an asymmetric directive on the part of this Committee and the recent Humphrey- Hawkins testimony Even though we had a hiccup in rates after both events hit the news, once the market absorbed the significance of the actions of this Committee I think there has been a positive effect on the level of interest rates and on the yield curve and that we have had a very useful educational effect on inflationary expectations Such expectations are essentially psychological and the fact that an asymmetric directive and the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony are also largely psychological has in my view been a very important and constructive offsetting effect We've done some work at the New York Bank on the comparison between real interest rates at the present time and at a similar point in history, which was August of 1977 At that [earlier] time the real fed funds rate was zero or, if one wants to be exact, -02 percent But other real interest rates were considerably lower Although the core inflation rate at the time was 62 percent, the average prime rate for the month was 68 percent Now, we have a core inflation rate of, let's say, 33 percent with the prime rate at 6 percent And as you go out further on the yield curve, the real interest rates at the present time are considerably higher than they were then That, I think, has two effects One, it contributes to an explanation on top of the feel of both households and corporations that they should restructure their balance sheets They have to note that the effect of taking on debt is quite expensive in real terms, and that would be another factor in the relatively slow growth On the other hand, it still indicates that inflationary expectations are a great deal higher than I believe this Committee should find acceptable or satisfactory So if there is some educational effort that we've been engaged in--and rather successfully in recent months-- it would indicate that there are some educational efforts still lying ahead of us   I think historically--Joan, correct me if I'm wrong--it has been that there would be, if not a likelihood, a distinct possibility of an actual move in the intermeeting period   Rather than a signal of [unintelligible] Is that right, Joan?   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the most important thing is that our policy should promote price stability So I think it's terribly important, whatever the conclusion, that the minutes of this meeting reflect that ongoing view and that public statements, especially by the Chairman but also by the rest of us when we make them, make quite clear our commitment to price stability Between now and the next meeting I think it's highly unlikely that we will change the fed funds rate So, then we come down to the purpose of the [symmetry in the] directive And at the present time I think the market is quite well prepared to believe that we have not changed the directive from a tactical tool to a policy statement, and we are much better off to leave the market with that perception Perhaps at an appropriate time in one of your speeches or in testimony you might include that remark Since I think it's highly unlikely that we would in fact change the fed funds rate before the next meeting, I believe we should avoid shifting the signalling device of the directive to a policy statement And since I don't think we should do that, to stay asymmetric would put us in the position of doing some empty posturing, which is always extremely injurious to the credibility of any institution and especially to one whose credibility is so important Therefore, I agree with your recommendation that we go to "B" symmetric  -40-    8/17/93   Thank you, Mr Chairman As is evident by the fact that we have two nominations, our recommendation is that we revert to the method which has served the Committee very well during most of its life, and that is to have separate managers for the domestic and foreign operations You'll recall that we have had two managers except for a very brief period in the 1970s and then for an even briefer period when I had the joint responsibility A bit of background We are doing some recasting of our research area at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and we needed a very capable senior economist with a strong international background to move in under Dick Davis and take care of [international] economic studies And the perfect candidate for that was Gretchen Greene So, Mr Chairman, I would like to recommend and nominate Joan Lovett as Manager for Domestic Operations Joan is a graduate of Albertus Magnus College and the New School for Social Research from which she has an MA After two years at the US Treasury she has been with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since 1968; she has spent most of that time in the Open Market function although she did also have experience in the foreign exchange area as well, which I think is attractive She has been the Deputy Manager for Domestic Operations Further, I would like to recommend and nominate Peter Fisher as Manager for Foreign Operations Peter is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School He's made his entire career at the New York Fed, originally in the Legal Division where he spent five years He spent two years in Basle, Switzerland and was the principal scribe of the Lamfalussy Report Then he returned to join the Foreign Exchange Department and has been responsible for day-to-day operations for about the last 20 months   So move, Mr Chairman   Could I ask you to refer back to the interest rate model that you discussed in your presentation as to whether there is a policy implication regarding relatively small changes in the fed funds rate? If one were to say there would be some merit in easing, it would appear that the model would say that there is still considerable bang to the 3 percent fed funds rate buck and that this will be transmitted over time, as the model suggests, to lower medium- and long-term interest rates On the other hand, if we were to increase the fed funds rate by, say, 25 basis points, does the model suggest that the change in expectations could have a rather significant effect on the real economy by restraining investment because of the effect on medium- and longer-term rates?   Thank you   The Second District economy remains extraordinarily flat The level of employment in the state of New York is almost exactly what it was 12 months ago And the level of employment in our portion of the state of New Jersey is actually down So, throughout the area--I've been travelling around upstate New York and parts of New Jersey--the level of optimism is very low It's not quite into pessimism but feelings are sort of flat [and people are] very concerned about what's going on  In the national economy, Dick Davis tells me that there has never been such identity of forecasts between that of the New York Reserve Bank and the Greenbook, which probably means the chances of the forecast being wrong are geometrically increased! But we do feel that [outlook] is by far the best bet However, probably because of our proximity to Wall Street I do have stomach rumblings that I think I should share with the Committee There is growing concern in the financial markets about the level of the DOW and of the equity markets in general--and some concern about the debt markets but considerably less--as to the sustainability of these levels of equity prices The question is the effect that anything other than a very modest correction could have on the holders of mutual funds who signed the prospectus that said they understood that what goes up can go down and that the [value of the] investment could turn out to be less than what  -25-    9/23/93  they invested But I don't think there are very many who actually understood what that prospectus said And there is very serious cause for concern on our part and growing concern within the financial community--I suspect in Boston as well, from what Dick Syron said-- about what the effect of a sharp correction would be and what the reaction of the smaller investors will be who by and large were not there in the '87 crash Do they think they can get quick cash and that the cash they will get is at least approximately what they invested? Some of the more astute mutual fund managers are keeping higher levels of cash than they normally would, so that they would be able to handle a greater than usual level of redemption requests But it does not appear that those levels of cash are anywhere near high enough to handle a really sharp correction in the market if there should be a psychological reaction on the part of the small investor who says "I want to get out"  With the tremendous interconnection of financial markets, perhaps that concern from our neighbors in Wall Street makes me even more concerned about certain things that one sees internationally We are absolutely in agreement with Ted Truman's forecast on what will happen in the major economies in Japan, Europe, and Latin America And yet I think one has to worry  For our economy I think it's not just the question of what effect those developments in Europe and Japan could have on net exports, it's the effect that they could have on the financial markets as well, which could exacerbate any of these concerns that we might have about what would happen in the case of a correction in the DOW and the effect on mutual fund holders Domestically, we think, assuming that there is no contamination from abroad, that the economic forecast is quite sound One would think, with the level of consumer confidence not being very high and the level of business confidence not being very high, that one would have to be more concerned about  -26-    9/23/93  the forecast being accurate But it seems to me that the projections on consumer spending are quite defensible and likely to be accurate  In the business investment area, we've been doing some interesting work in New York on where we are in the restructuring of the corporate sector And it would appear that it is really a bit further along than we had thought, pretty close to the point where most businesses could say that the restructuring in the balance sheet is about where one would wish it to be However, it would not appear that they're very likely to increase production with consumer spending not being more robust Then, I think one has to ask the question Is the forecast of rather strong business investment spending likely to be right? We think it is because so much of it is in the investment in increased power of the magic machine; however, that is not geared toward increased production but rather increased productivity and would appear even within the bounds of the economic forecast to be something that one could expect to be very likely to take place  Another rumbling that we get around Wall Street is that the attitude toward official Washington has improved considerably over the last couple of months It went, if you will recall, from euphoria in December/January--a kind of view that if Richard Nixon could go to then-Peking, that a Democratic president could do certain things that no Republican could do Then, [attitudes] went into an enormous funk in the spring months and are now--I think largely because of the budget reconciliation bill--somewhat more sensible, I'd say, in the view that it's going to be very tough to get NAFTA through and it's going to be very tough to get a sound health bill through But there does seem to be a view that Washington is working, if not perfectly, at least better So, I don't think that weight on the financial markets, which I believe was quite serious a few months ago, is quite what it was then   "B" symmetric   This is Bill McDonough Listening to Ed Boehne would convince me that the quality of the FOMC meetings would be seriously adversely affected by the existence of an MOD If the main purpose of the FOMC's existence is to bring about the best possible monetary policy based on a discussion in which we can listen to one another and change our minds in the course of the meeting and share views--especially on foreign governments and their activities of the kind that I did at the last meeting--and share information of a confidential nature that we receive from market participants, I think we are much better off in terms of reaching the best possible decision not to have the MOD at all I would very much be in the camp of saying that we should resist it [As for] the idea of releasing it three years later, I guess if I am very convinced that, say, Hans Teitmeyer and I will still know each other and be working together three years from now, I just wouldn't be able to contribute what I think may be some added value from the contacts that I have with some of those people and with market participants here in New York I very much hope that we can get away with not having an MOD at all   This is Bill McDonough again I think that kind of diversification is a good idea What we don't want to be diversified about is our answers to the basic questions  -10-    10/05/93   The letter that each of us got from Mr Gonzalez says "Please prepare an opening statement presenting your own independent views on this subject" Then he asks the questions If we're going to make rather short statements both in writing and verbally, we need to negotiate with the staff, and perhaps him through the staff, as to what that means about an opening statement on the subject   Having said that, Mr Chairman, would you like a motion for adjournment?   Move adjournment   Mr Chairman, this is Bill McDonough Could I suggest a viewpoint?   I think the thing we have to be most aware of is that we should protect our ability to carry out monetary policy as best we can And at the same time we shouldn't feed our critics by seeming to be excessively--and they might say even pathologically--secretive Now, I would translate that into the following That as of now we go to a Memorandum of Discussion to be released after, I would suggest, three years, although as a negotiating position one might wish to start with four with the thought that we could then retreat to three, but I think that's a tactical issue That we state to the world that going forward we do not think that a raw tape and a raw transcription of a tape serves any particular purpose and that after the MOD is prepared we would destroy the raw material I don't think we can do that going backward but I think we could state it as something we would do going forward For the last three years--let's say we picked the number three--we would say that we would go back and prepare MODs and release them on the three-year lag [schedule] So at the end of this year, if we got the work done in time, we would release the MODs for the meetings of 1990 [As for] the period before three years ago, I think we could probably give ourselves some protection by just stating that the amount of work involved [is substantial] Going back from three years ago--to pick a number, say, eight years ago, and as the work could be done because I think all the world should understand it would take a while--we would prepare MODs for those meetings because we probably still have enough people around who could actually prepare them and more or less remember what happened Prior to that period, I think we could either say it's too old to be interesting and see if that would fly, or have edited versions of the transcripts of the kind that are now used for congressional hearings   Mr Chairman, this is Bill McDonough again First of all, clearly the more that you set the line out, the less the other people there have to give their own versions of how they feel about this The other people can in effect either remain silent or, as was suggested earlier, just refer to the fact that you've discussed the recordkeeping of the Secretariat And after about three people say that, it stops being interesting to anybody But again, I would suggest that the Chairman say that we are aware of the need for the Committee to be able to operate with a degree of confidentiality for a reasonable period of time in order to carry out the best possible monetary policy And then there is the related issue of [after] what period and in what degree of detail the discussion of the meeting should be made available to scholars and the American public If we have to go beyond the present minutes, I think the MOD is a considerably better alternative than a raw or edited transcript But as you suggested, Alan, you can certainly say that this is something that we need to discuss [and] we avoid the notion of sounding paranoid about our secrecy At the same time, I think you're quite right that my suggestion or any other would need a great deal of discussion in a face-to-face meeting of the FOMC so we can form a  -19-    10/15/93  consensus of the Committee There's no way in the world we could do that by Tuesday   Mr Chairman, Bill McDonough I share that view We could get a FOIA request this afternoon So, I think moving ahead is a good idea On the issue that was mentioned just a moment ago [regarding] point 5, paragraph 5, on page 3, I think we should seek legislation In the absence of legislation, we're completely victims or captives of whatever view the Attorney General of the day and of the future would feel on this issue It seems to me that we're better off with legislative protection, even at the acknowledged expense of opening up [the Act]   This is Bill McDonough again It seems to me that, with the attitude of the Justice Department, what    10/22/93  the Chairman has focused on is the real issue That we're going to have a FOIA request as sure as God made little green apples And our choice is whether we're going to be able to negotiate with the Justice Department the release of a probably not very fully edited transcript or whether we're going to be able to create an MOD and then destroy the transcript as part of the deal We don't have a happy alternative here   That seems to me a very good approach because in effect it says to Virgil If in the worst of cases you have to settle for the MOD, we have at least a view that he can explore that We haven't made a decision, as you said right at the beginning And if he can get Justice to take a better deal from our point of view, obviously that's preferable   It's Bill again I think the real conclusion of the meeting should be not to have any conclusion but to do what the Chairman is seeking, and that is to send Virgil off to negotiate with some notion of getting the best deal he can and then report back and see if the rest of us want to buy that   Mr Chairman, this is Bill McDonough; I just came in It seems to me that one could argue that 315, say, was an equilibrium rate before this nervousness [arose] As you put it, they've sustained the rate; they've actually increased their reserves in the process, so they certainly weren't propping it up artificially If NAFTA is voted down, one might argue that economic theory would lead us to believe that the equilibrium rate would be a weaker peso But at the present time, especially since they have been smart enough to allow the rate to move to the 325 area, I think they have handled it rather well and that it would be very difficult to argue that they are maintaining an artificial exchange rate   I agree with that I think it would be unfortunate for us not to support them and to let the rate go --even though it would be in response to market forces, but essentially irrational ones--and then wind up on the 17th with NAFTA [passed] and some damage done that would be very hard to reverse   There was certainly no discussion of it at all at the BIS meeting, which I literally just walked in the door from There was a presentation yesterday to the governors by the four Latin Americans--the number two man from Mexico, the Argentine, the Columbian, and the Chilean [Unintelligible] impressed by that These were four people who were saying such incredibly sensible things and seeking to follow such excellent policies that this seems to me to give us an opportunity, when a situation has been created partially because of the peculiarities of our own political system, to support one of the best behaving nations at a time when it would be very useful to them Certainly it would send a very positive signal that these virtues that we have been preaching about over the last many years are something we still believe in I'm not suggesting that it should create a precedent for other countries that have a problem But NAFTA is something peculiar to Mexico at this stage   I think the reason for what may appear to be not altogether logical, Governor Angell, is that the capital flight that the Bank of Mexico is very much worried about is the flight of capital owned by Mexicans I would suspect that they are probably better at [understanding] the psychology of their  -9-    11/9/93  countrymen than perhaps we are and that the existence of a pot of money sitting presumably at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would be more likely to impress their fellow citizens than swap lines that they wouldn't altogether understand I think we are dealing with posturing and flag-waving here in essentially a psychological battle   Mr Chairman, I think it would also be a good idea, if the Committee [so] voted, that it give permission for you and the [Foreign Currency] Subcommittee, which consists of you and me and David Mullins, the authority to use that [enlarged facility] We have some limits on drawings; they can be no more than $300 million in a given day, for example Since the Mexicans do not plan to use the funds, that limitation may not be particularly relevant But if the Committee is going to authorize the enlargement of the line, we might want to have them enlarge the use thereof, because one could argue that if [the funds] were drawn down  then we would need the [clearance] of the Committee because of the amount involved   I think we should give the Chairman the full authorization of the amount that has been discussed so that he can go about negotiating with the Treasury and with the Mexicans   Why don't we make it 90 days and that would mean that we have an automatic period to look at it again at either our December of February meeting in Washington?   Governor Angell, that's the way it should be done, [I might say], since I used to have that job The FOMC should increase the swap line and then authorize either the Chairman or the subcommittee to [act on a request to] use the swap line so it isn't hung up [by the process of getting clearance from the full Committee] Also, we renew all the swap lines normally at our February meeting, so rather than 90 days I think we should adjust the motion to take us through to the February FOMC meeting  -13-    11/9/93   It's agreeable to me, too   Yes, Ted   Yes Governor Mancera, who is the head of the Bank of Mexico, called me and did request a central bank- to-central bank facility   That is not at all clear What Miguel Mancera said was  Therefore, even though they would have the right under the facility, as Ted Truman described it, to draw down in our case up to the amount of that first billion dollars, it is not at all clear that in fact they would do so   I fully agree with that analysis   That's certainly consistent with the tone of the conversations [I've had] The two I had today with Governor Mancera were exactly the kinds of conversations that one of us would have had with one of the major central bankers of Europe   In the [briefings] by Virgil and Don, I believe Virgil mentioned that when he was speaking with the Archivist a suggestion made from that quarter was that we use an annotated version of the [raw] transcript Could one of you explain why you feel that a lightly edited version is preferable to an annotated version? I must admit when you described it that I found myself rather attracted to the annotated version   That's exactly why I found the annotated version to have a more attractive aspect   It says somebody said something 29 years ago that really doesn't appear, in the context, to make much sense And we'd say that Whereas if we lightly edit we cannot--   Yes  -14-    11/16/93   Well, I'm glad that the opportunity to speak came immediately after the Chairman's declaration of our need to go public and fight for our cause It seems to me that what is really at issue here is the ability of the Federal Reserve to make monetary policy and execute it properly And that ability to carry out our most basic responsibility has to be protected We cannot continue to fight a battle in which we get letters of evermore pejorative tone released to the press and then we reply as gentle persons I think the right place to take our arguments is to the public, and asking the House Banking Committee for a hearing is the right place to start Beyond that it may be necessary for the Chairman and others of us to seek opportunities to speak out on this subject It really seems to me that our ability to carry out our most basic mission is what is seriously in question  As to the specifics of the Chairman's recommendation regarding [what we should do] going forward and going back, I think there could be a modest benefit to going in the direction of an edited transcript instead of a Memorandum of Discussion simply because it does give the impression of being, and in fact is, marginally more forthcoming and therefore beneficial to us Going back, I think that the five-year period is appropriate largely because of the rights of individuals who did not know that their remarks would be made public Therefore, we should insist as much as we can on the five-year period And I think the lightly edited transcript is the appropriate form   Three years going forward   My first choice would be light editing without annotation and my second choice would be the raw transcript with annotation   Five years; second choice, three years   Yes   Edited transcript first choice; MOD second choice   May I ask a question for clarity?   The enhanced minutes has a very different timeframe than either the MOD or the--   I'd like to make a comment because I was not one of the seven The reason I was not--and I have to be very direct despite my normally very high opinion of Mr Kohn--is that he expressed his recommendation in such a way that I think it is very dangerous It is far, far too defensive   Correct   My positive sense is to go back to the [statement] that you made earlier, which I rather belligerently endorsed It was that we have to go on the offensive now It's tough to go on the offensive when we say "Well, we're thinking about what we're going to do next" It's not impossible, but I think--   I agree I just want us to understand that if we're going to ask for a hearing and we're going to start defending ourselves, which I really think we have to do, deciding to wait--and I think you're right that deciding we need to wait in order to form a consensus has great wisdom, but it creates a difficulty for you or anybody else--   I just hope we understand that   I do recall making such a statement The likelihood of our having to use the swap line with Mexico obviously says that it is possible that these things can be used and, therefore, I suppose puts some merit in discussing their [continuing] existence I'd probably come out essentially where Ted Truman just suggested and that is that they are alliances that have been in place since the 1960s and it becomes an immense dog that didn't bark in the night if we decide to deconstruct what was put together at the time And we would have to have a whole new view of what we wanted to do on international currency arrangements and what we would put in place of these reciprocal relationships which we've had for so long Personally I wouldn't put an immensely high priority on what we'd get out of such an exercise; if other members of the Committee thought it would be a good idea, I wouldn't oppose it But again, I'm not sure just how much we'd achieve by doing it   The economy in the Second District remains very flat as it has been most of this year, with our part of New Jersey going a little south and New York State staying at about even The financial services industry and such people as lawyers who work for them are doing very well, so the yuppie restaurants are crowded and that tends to give a feeling of affluence and prosperity about the city that Mr Giuliani is about to take over But we now read that the level of the homeless has been underestimated And New York City, I think, is very much getting to be a Disraeli two-nation phenomenon that is going to be tougher and tougher to govern and could be a good-sized challenge for a mayor who I think will respond to his election by getting tougher on the criminal classes, or those who are alleged to be by the people who voted for him It could be an interesting situation  -78-    11/16/93  At the national level, we're right with the Greenbook on the fourth quarter of this year and a bit higher, at about 29 percent, for 1994 The difference is spread pretty much throughout the forecast; our forecast is just a little more robust in general Our forecast for the CPI is exactly that of the Greenbook at 31 percent But if anything that's eyeball adjusted up a bit; if we applied purely the analysis we'd probably have it at 30 or conceivably even 29 percent I suppose the concern that we have in general, and I in particular, is with the robust fourth quarter and that if for some reason the first quarter of next year should start out with a more positive feeling I wonder if businessmen will try to take advantage of the situation to experiment with getting some price increases to stick My guess is that the possibility of that could be quite high; that would mean that even though normally one would expect that a 29 percent growth forecast and inflation--without the eyeball correction --coming down would not demand a monetary policy response, I think it could well shape up that fairly early next year we will be challenged by some price actions which we would have to respond to   The Second District is still relatively flat except for the financial services firms; both commercial banks and investment banks are doing very well The industrial and service firms in the District, especially the larger ones, are still concentrating on reducing staff and improving productivity They are not looking at price increases as a way to improve their margins How long that discipline will continue, with growing market talk around New York that any increase in growth automatically translates into price increases, leaves some doubt But at least as of now the price discipline in the larger firms in the District seems to be in good control  On the national picture, we part company with the Greenbook for the first time in quite some while From fourth quarter '93 to fourth quarter '94 we're forecasting GDP growth of 3 percent compared with the Greenbook's 27 percent The unemployment rate we believe will fall to 61 percent compared with the Greenbook's 64 percent  -21-    12/21/93  The components where we show more robust growth are consumer expenditures, business fixed investment, residential construction, and Federal purchases; it's just a little in all cases but enough to result in the larger growth picture overall Not surprisingly, since we have faster growth we have a bigger drag from net exports We show the GDP deflator next year at 3 percent as compared to the Greenbook's 2-1/2 percent And in 1995 we are even more apart because we have the deflator going up to 33 percent Now, those differences are enough that we believe the assumption of the fed funds rate remaining at or about 3 percent throughout the year is almost certainly not going to be the case The question is When does one have the certainty of one's forecast to say that if a policy move is evident, it should be taken? We are not yet sufficiently certain of that forecast to think that it should lead to a policy move The possibility of a slowdown in the first quarter is sufficiently great that we would be well advised in our view to wait for some additional data to come in We're particularly [waiting for] two [statistics] One is the first look at fourth-quarter GDP, which comes out in late January; and the other is the employment data for the month of January, scheduled to come out on the first Friday of February, which will be the second day of our next meeting Even though our forecast as of today--if we had absolute certainty--would lead one to say that the time to take policy action is imminent, our view is that we would prefer to wait for those additional data before reaching that conclusion   Governor Mullins    12/21/93   Mr Chairman, I agree with "B" symmetric and let me say why I think that a combination of a great many outside remarks accompanied by the remarks that a number of us--first person plural--have made have led the world to believe that we are anti- growth, and that's a very bad position to be in It's bad monetary policy, it's bad economics, and it's bad within the public sector in which we live So I think that we need an educational exercise on the part of the central bank to explain what our goals are, that they involve a combined objective of sustained growth and price stability Some of that probably [can be said in] the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony or, if it's difficult for the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to be clear enough for the average intelligent layman to understand, then perhaps a speech should be taken advantage of by you at about that time to lay out what sustained growth and price stability mean [in terms] that the average voting citizen can understand I really think that we need to do that  -36-    12/21/93  As regards the data that will come out in early 1994, my mention of the existence of such data--the first measurement of fourth-quarter GDP and the January employment data--was only [to point out] that, if the forecasts are wrong on the high side and we are having a first-quarter flop again, it could affect our timing I'm absolutely convinced that we have to bring monetary policy into a neutral stance in the early part of next year The timing to me is more related to this education effort I find necessary than to the release of any specific data I would in fact be opposed to doing it in a way that would seem to lead the observer to the conclusion that the data led to the [action] As far as whether the directive should be symmetric or asymmetric, I believe--maybe more strongly than anything I've stated--that it should be symmetric Since it is highly, highly likely that if we don't firm policy today, we will not do so before the next meeting, to have an asymmetric directive and then not do anything--on top of two asymmetric directives when correctly we didn't change policy in the summer of 1993--could very easily put us into the posture of substituting asymmetric directives for action, even though we all think that policy has to be firmed, and sooner rather than later The valiant central banker could appear to be somebody who waves a little flag but as soon as any shots come across, he pulls it back down again So I think there could be a very unattractive public relations impact of an asymmetric directive, which would be quite counterproductive to what our real purpose is   I don't have any questions I have a comment when you're prepared for that   I know the recommendation you are making to us has to be one you've reached after both pain and a great deal of thought And I think it is, in fact, what we should do That particular meeting and the tape and transcript that go with it are    12/21/93  different from all other meetings and all tapes and transcripts The subject was preparing ourselves for testimony on the Hill by a great many people present here Obviously, there was no conspiracy nor any intention on anyone's part to conspire for anything and certainly not to deprive the Congress of information However, that is what we are accused of and the accusation is continuing It has taken on a considerable life of its own and it is being promulgated among members of Congress and among the population in general, both of our own country and others, in a way that is placing in question the very integrity of this Committee and the Federal Reserve I think we have to respond You have responded in your letter, but I don't think our defense can be complete without taking the very painful step that you recommend I can't imagine that any of us will say that we agree with you with great joy But I agree with you and I recommend to others that they do so as well   I have a follow-up question to Virgil The Chairman made a distinction, I made a distinction, and others have also between discussions of monetary policy and discussions of other matters But as a legal precedent all we're saying is that we are giving them access to this particular tape; and that doesn't give them access to any other tapes, whether those other tapes include discussions of monetary policy or other matters   Okay   So move   So move   Would we conclude correctly, Joan, that as far as you can see today, if the Committee decided that action should be taken tomorrow, the technical condition of the market is such that it would not create a problem for us?   So move   Well, after some extended period of a very flat regional economy, economic activity in the Second District has actually been improving at a moderate pace for about the last three or four months The December establishment survey showed modest job gains in New York State, New York City, and New Jersey Over the October-December period, personal income tax collections, which as you know are an advance indicator of personal income, were growing at a moderate to strong pace The cold weather conditions seemed to have delayed some output, but our sources feel that it is not any worse than that The inability of consumers to get to the sales taking place in January slowed down some of the activity at the retail level, but again our sources feel that retailers can recoup that over the President's Day weekend, assuming the weather is decent then I think what's particularly good about the District is that, despite the fact that we have the corporate giants like IBM, Citibank, and Kodak downsizing, New York State gained 15,000 jobs from November to December That's the third consecutive month that we had some job gains in the area New York City also had some growth in jobs as did our part, the northern part, of New Jersey  With regard to the national forecast, we are rather similar to the Greenbook with some exceptions We have stronger real growth in the second half of 1994 Some of that comes, as does somewhat stronger growth in 1995, from our view that residential construction will be somewhat higher than the staff forecast has indicated That's an area in which there are some capacity constraints, so it could be an additional cause of some inflationary pressures In general, we think the gap between actual and potential GDP is now quite small, and certainly that which remains will be used up in the course of 1994 with our forecast, the Greenbook's, or any of those we've heard around the table Consequently, with the unemployment rate coming down to what we think is a reasonable estimate of the NAIRU--in the low 6 percent area--we do have to be considerably concerned about inflation And our inflation forecast is, in fact, somewhat higher than that of the Greenbook   I very much support what Governor Lindsey just said I think this is something that we absolutely must do because of the importance of this As Jerry Jordan said, this would be the first time that we've increased--if we do so--interest rates since 1989 And, therefore, it is something that we should step forth and state I believe as Larry said that you should be doing it in your words We might have to think rather carefully about the precise timing of the Desk's action in relationship to any announcement that may be made tomorrow I'd be very worried if the Desk's action were first Then we would be giving some essential market insiders an opportunity to move on it before the general public was informed So, if you can't do it simultaneously, I would favor any statement by you coming out marginally ahead of that time, but definitely not behind it   Thank you, Mr Chairman I believe very strongly that we should firm policy and that we should do so today and announce it today in the manner described in our late afternoon conversation yesterday Let me give some of the reasons that drive me to this conclusion We are very near potential GDP and  -45-    2/3-4/94  all of our forecasts, whether they are fine-tunings of the Greenbook or right on it, say that we will reach full potential this year That would mean that labor market pressures should show up relatively soon on a more generalized basis, and as the Chairman just described, they already are showing up in some areas of skilled labor I agree that an inventory cycle could well be at hand, especially in certain areas where there are resource constraints already--those involving residential construction, automobiles and light trucks, and home durable goods  Therefore, it seems to me that the question is not so much whether we should tighten but by how much And rather than comment on the alternatives of an asymmetric directive and a move of 25 basis points, let me evaluate my own view of whether the move should be 25 or 50 basis points Why would one think that a firming of 50 basis points might be appropriate? Well, it might be deemed to be closer to a true adjustment away from what by our forecast is now excessive accommodation However, I think there are two downside aspects to a 50 basis point firming First of all, it could be interpreted--and in my own view would be interpreted by a fair number of market participants--as a one-time fix, a one-time adjustment which would be followed by a "Fed-on-hold" period Secondly, I think it could be deemed, especially in light of some of the discussion in this town and others, a macho response, and I've always thought macho responses confused brains and bravado A 25 basis point move, on the other hand, I believe would send the right signal in the sense that the Federal Reserve, the central bank, is being watchful, as it should be And we would be moving earlier in the economic cycle than the Fed has done historically and, therefore, we are doing our job even better than in the past I think it would be interpreted as the first of a series of moves and thus would be deemed, in my view, to be a stronger signal than a 50 basis point increase--if the 50 basis point increase were seen, as I believe it would be, as a one-time adjustment to be followed by the "Fed on hold" So, I support the recommendation of the Chairman that we tighten My own preference is for a 25 basis point firming today   Could I make a comment?   I very much share the view that the effect of a 50 basis point move today in the marketplace is highly unpredictable It's sufficiently likely to be damaging in cracking the markets that I think it's a step we should not take   I would very strongly prefer that we not set a precedent that the Chairman, particularly this Chairman, has to agree in advance on the need for a phone call His record is that he's going to call us if there's something to talk about or if a few of us call him and say we think there's something to talk about and request a telephone conference I think it's demeaning to the process, to the nature of this Committee, to say to the Chairman, "I'll vote for what you want but we've got to have a phone call" I really think that's a terrible precedent to set  -56-    2/3-4/94  SPEAKER(?) I agree with that   I agree with maintaining the provisional ranges and believe we should not release a forecast for 1995 There's no question in my mind that it would become a forecast with which we would be expected to live and there's no consensus in the Committee on what such a forecast should be   She is also here, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, this is Bill McDonough from New York The views expressed by Al Broaddus are rather consistent with my own It is very likely, as you suggested yourself, that we will have to take a rather close look at where we stand on policy at the next meeting However, I think it would be very much more advisable for us to wait until then than to do anything now I do feel that the markets overreacted somewhat to a variety of news around the world, both in Europe and in the United States We have had some very significant losses--not just that by Mr Soros and company in the exchange and fixed-income markets but to some degree in equity markets as well We're still dealing with very nervous markets, which we might confuse rather than convince I understand Jerry Jordan's position; but the answer to his question is, without doubt, a matter of judgment My own judgment is that we are better off to get the additional information that we could get on the economy in the next few weeks, and let the markets calm down to a degree, which I think they will do largely because they are oversold In conclusion, I believe that the best course of action for us is watchful waiting with the likelihood that we would make the next policy decision--which could be a change of policy or not--when we are physically together at the next meeting   I generally agree with what Joan said I think to a very large degree one is dealing with the psychology of markets If we were to move now, I think we would be perceived to have decided that inflation was getting ahead of us and that we were fearful of being behind the curve If that interpretation is accurate, which I think it is, I believe that a move now would not, in fact, make them believe that the other shoe has dropped but that there is a multifooted critter in the hotel room above The only question is how many, and with what frequency, quite a number of other shoes will drop    2/28/94   So move   And to increase the leeway   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   I'd also like to make a comment I think that one of the functions of the Federal Reserve is to seek monetary stability in a broader framework than just the American economy itself because of the obvious interlinkages of world markets, as we have heard this morning in Peter's and Joan's presentations I think that has a great deal to do with why we created swap lines with the major trading partners of the United States and countries that in the past have been a very important part of the world's interlinked financial system Mexico, because of a very much better performance over the last twelve years, has now reached a stage where its economic performance seems to me to justify being included as a major partner of the United States and the other participants in the world economy It also is a country, being on our border, in which serious financial instability would have a very definite possibility of spreading across the border and creating problems in our own markets So to me it is appropriate to have the swap line used in times of market instability, which may or may not be related to years in which there is a presidential election, as long as we are careful that it is not used to prop up the value of the Mexican peso when all the fundamentals say that that would be inappropriate I think it's very consistent with our general responsibilities So, I don't share the view that it is something that is inconsistent with the role of the central bank and therefore would demand approved funding from the Congress I think it's just as much a part of the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as the swap line with Germany is   To continue Governor LaWare's train of thought, it would appear that at some stage we may need a greater  -10-    3/22/94  and deeper philosophical discussion of swaps But that isn't really what we should be talking about today, it seems to me We do have swap facilities Also, we are not discussing whether we should have a swap facility with Mexico; we have one So the only question before us is to give the Board's staff advice on how to proceed in the discussions As Ted pointed out in his opening remarks, he's not asking for a vote; all he's asking for is some guidance I am very much in sympathy with what the Chairman said about the role of the Federal Reserve among the American monetary authorities--the Treasury and ourselves--that it is important for us to continue to have the very positive influence that we have had And having participated in that responsibility myself, I think we have used it very wisely and constructively both at the level of the Chairman and the governors and Ted and the New York Bank when it has been involved I think it would be very unfortunate if the Federal Reserve were not involved at this particular time given what is soon to be an important event in Mexican history And that is that in a country in which the power of the government is almost unmatched anywhere in the world, they have decided to have a truly independent central bank That's a major structural reform which it seems to me that we as the central bank of the United States should be supporting by responding to a request which in any case appears to be reasonable  As for what purpose swaps should be used, again I'd suggest that we look at the record of the American monetary authorities, which is very tough-minded and very good Ted has been a kind of permanent feature for many years and anybody who thinks he has been a pussycat in these matters would be very confused Our experience with the present Treasury so far is that they seem to have a rather serious, sensible attitude toward international cooperation on monetary matters The difficulty with saying swaps can be used for X, Y, and Z is that nobody can define a disorderly market You know one when you see one, but they take on various forms I think our conversation has been very good in reminding Ted of the views of the Committee, which he probably already knew and shared anyway It reminds us all that the view of the Committee, in my phraseology, is that the swap facilities should be used wisely and well But figuring out exactly what that means is best done at the moment that a request comes in, which also in my view supports the Federal Reserve's traditional position that instead of putting a lot of conditionality into the agreement we should establish the conditionality and the whole financial arrangements in light of what's going on at the time of the request Then we can be very tough-minded; we can be very specific and demand what's appropriate at that time, which is very, very difficult to anticipate in advance   Sure Just a very brief response I think where honest people could differ is if we were moving toward what we were very certain was going to become a disorderly market very  -11-    3/22/94  quickly--for example, if we and the other central bank involved knew that the reserves were really moving out Then we'd have to decide whether use of the swap line was appropriate We wouldn't want to fight the market and defend an artificial exchange rate But we might be inclined at least to entertain a request for a drawing on the swap facility I'm not sure the answer ought to be "yes" It may very well be that the answer is "no"   But since disorderly markets are so hard to define, to have the combination of, say, Summers and Truman raise their hands and say this is a disorderly market and then we debate whether they are right or not is not something I think we want to get into   The Second District is mirroring what Cathy Minehan said about the First District It has begun to participate in the economic recovery, led by very strong exports, especially to Canada, and what you are all very familiar with, the strong performance of the financial sector So wages are beginning to move up General economic performance is doing rather well and the feel of the District is considerably better  Regarding the national scene, our forecast has somewhat higher growth and somewhat, but not very much, higher inflation than the Greenbook My main concern, to borrow a notion from Ed Boehne, is whether there is anything around that could break the momentum of this recovery, and therefore have even the Greenbook forecast wind up being a bit optimistic I think there are two possibilities I certainly would not label them as probabilities but I think we need to be attentive to them There has been considerable concern about what would happen if all the people who have moved from bank deposits into mutual funds of various types were to become sufficiently nervous that they started pulling their money out of the funds What would that do to markets? I think perhaps a more likely event would be not that they would pull their money out of markets but that as they got their reports on what really happened to them in February and so far in March, which by and large they haven't received yet, they would become aware that they are not as well off as they thought they were and therefore they would become less likely to spend We could have a diminution in consumption as a result  The other possibility, and I certainly do not wish to be alarmist, is a major problem in the financial markets I think we were quite fortunate in that the financial markets, which were very, very rocky in the first days of March, settled down rather quickly But we were working the phones at least as actively with the money center banks in New York and with the central banks of Europe-- specifically including the Bank of England, the Banque de France, and the Bundesbank--as we ever have in earlier better known episodes of financial problems An indication of what was going on is that rumors began to spread very rapidly in London on the Wednesday of that week, the 1st of March, about possible very large losses at two money center banks, J P Morgan and Bankers Trust As a result, on the New York Stock Exchange that morning neither stock could be opened Eventually Morgan could be opened In the case of Bankers Trust, the chairman had to make a public statement that his corporation was profitable for  -29-    3/22/94  the year to date I remind you that this is a bank that has a AA rating and had a 26 percent return on equity in 1993 It may be that the good news is that the rumors were about two banks that are perhaps most skilled at funding themselves and therefore can handle adversity with unusual ability But these kinds of rumors were there And let's remind ourselves that in our ongoing concern about derivatives and the lack of transparency that goes with them, the thing we have been most concerned about is exactly that--that we could have a rumor, well founded or ill founded, about a major market participant and that it would spiral into a liquidity problem That danger was there It was resolved and resolved with almost no publicity, which is the best of all worlds But certainly if we have more market turbulence and this kind of thing is repeated and is not resolved quite so quickly or quite so quietly, it could be enough to shake people's confidence to the point that spending would be less, capital investment would be less, and we would have a lower track for the economy  My own conclusion is that even though one always operates with some degree of concern about where the economy really is going, I personally have much greater uncertainty about whether the economy will perform about in line with the Greenbook forecast; yes, it could be a bit stronger but it is not at all impossible that it could be somewhat weaker And, therefore, in my own notions of what that tells me about policy, it is that a certain amount of caution should emanate from the uncertainty Thank you   Mr Chairman, I must admit that I have been absolutely certain about the need for a move of both 50 basis points and 25 basis points at least as frequently as daily in the last several weeks But I've come to the conclusion that your recommendation on the change is the safer course of action for us and sufficiently bold to maintain our credentials If the Greenbook forecast is accurate and if it should materialize quickly as  -52-    3/22/94  projected, I think it would be good for us to give ourselves the opportunity to see how the economy is evolving, which also leads me to the 25 basis point increase Even though every bit of my stomach lining says we are heading toward a funds rate of 4 percent or higher, I don't have any concern about waiting past this meeting So I very much prefer the 25 basis points just for economic reasons  The reaction to our 25 basis point increase at the last meeting, as Peter and Joan pointed out, was added to enormously by the various other developments that they mentioned There is a tendency for financial analysts and maybe ourselves to think that we caused it all, but we certainly were the first to get things moving So I think we got a good deal more market effect and a good deal more tightening out of 25 basis points than we had in mind when we met on the 4th of February As regards the market effect, I don't think we normally should be deciding monetary policy based on trying to fine-tune the markets unless one is convinced, as I am now, that the downside weakness to the economy could come from a crack in the market As I said earlier and as you quoted me, I think that's not very probable, but I think the risk is significant enough that it's worth taking seriously Therefore, since I cannot anticipate exactly what the reaction of the market would be to 50 basis points and since we had such an overreaction the last time, I think we are better off to avoid a risk where the risk/reward ratio is very difficult to calculate  As regards symmetry or asymmetry, your reasoning for the asymmetric directive in a way introduces a new use of the asymmetric directive, or at least it's new to me I think it could be explained with Don Kohn's usual verbal skills in the minutes, so it is something that I could live with Left to my own devices, I would prefer symmetric; but if you prefer asymmetric, I would support you on it   I have a very strong preference to make an announcement in some form On this particular afternoon, whether it's the Chairman or whether it's the Committee making the announcement has mainly the significance that if the Chairman does it, it doesn't lock the Committee into having made a decision to do it So I think that actually has some merit I have long had what Ernie Patrikis after consultation with Virgil Mattingly assures me is not a legal concern but an ethical concern; and that is, if we go into the market the way we have done it for years and we "announce" a very significant policy move by our operations in the open market, the pros with whom we deal know it before anybody else does It may be a minute or two before, but that gives them a market advantage, which I don't like To me it's an ethical matter, which I take quite seriously That doesn't mean--unlike in the case of the chairman of a well known committee--that my ethics are necessarily the law of nature But that's where I come down on the issue I would prefer that we announce our decision and I think it's probably better on this occasion if the Chairman does it rather than the Committee  -57-    3/22/94   There was; it's over   That's part of the timing issue--to get it out after the auctions are over   This is Bill McDonough I certainly support this proposal The details of it are identical, as has been pointed out, to those we spent a great deal of time working on last fall, and I think are completely acceptable In the broader philosophical area we discussed last Tuesday, it seems to me that this is a very appropriate responsibility of our country's central bank We also discussed the fact that Mexico was close enough to us that it could have a destabilizing effect on our financial market if things should go wrong there, and we had a very good indication of that today There's no question that the events in Mexico had an adverse effect on both the stock and the bond markets in our country I think both to support Mexico and to carry out our responsibilities to our own country we should definitely take part in this operation   This is Bill McDonough We might want a comment from Peter on what the Euro-dollar contracts are telling us about Fed policy   In short, we look at both of them   Mr Chairman, this is Bill McDonough May I make a comment?   I think, just to agree largely with your own presentation, that the economy is clearly a good deal stronger than we thought it was at the last meeting Although I happen to agree with Mike Prell's position that this tremendous strength in motor vehicle sales is not likely to continue, a lot of people in the market think it is more likely to move along at about the present pace, at least for a while The financial markets are healthier than they were in that the unwinding, as you described it, from weaker hands to stronger hands is continuing But I also agree that it's in no way over and we have to expect that it will continue at least through this quarter The market, as Joan and Peter pointed out, has factored in at least a 25 basis point rise at this time and then ongoing 25 basis point increases But it has not assumed this timing I think that we will see something of a surprise to our moving as early as today And that leads me to believe that the 25 basis point recommendation of the Chairman is a considerably better choice than anything stronger We in New York have not recommended an increase in the discount rate I believe there was a time when we were alone in that position I have the view that we have to be concerned about not appearing to know more than the market does about inflation expectations I think the combination of announcing the fed funds rate increase--as I agree we should do if we should determine to move this morning--with the big banner of a discount rate increase would be overdoing it Certainly, it is not something we should contemplate until we are all together at the next meeting Thank you   So move   So move   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second District's economy appears to be advancing at a rather nice pace this spring Preliminary March reports indicate that establishment job growth was strong in most sectors of the economy Tax receipts suggest that personal income grew at a reasonable pace Retail sales surpassed the optimistic expectations of the merchants, with actually some problems in April because inventory levels are lower than the merchants would like them to be The commercial real estate market is showing considerable signs of revival except in the lower part of Manhattan Island The anecdotal information for April and the first part of May suggest that this growth is continuing And consumer price inflation is quite subdued in the District There is something of a malaise around the financial services industry because of the difficult markets in the first four months of the year and because of some concerns about individual firms and problems related to them--for example, the case of Kidder Peabody and the death of Lazard and then the New York Times article on Sunday regarding what would appear to be some questionable relationships among firms in the municipal finance area  On the national level, we differ somewhat from the Greenbook in having a little slower growth in the second quarter and a little higher growth in the second half of the year, but the net result is that we are just 01 percent above for the Q4 to Q4 period We also have a slowdown in 1995 to 24 percent growth in GDP, which is just about where the Greenbook is However, we're not quite as optimistic about the CPI We've got it up 31 percent whereas the Greenbook has it up 28 percent I would not be very satisfied with an upturn in inflation as something that we would anticipate So that raises the question of what really is going on in the economy and what if anything the Federal Reserve can do about it We think that growth has to be slowed down because we think that, certainly by the end of the year, potential GDP will be fully used up We will be at or very close to the NAIRU and at the use of manufacturing capacity that has historically given rise to cost and therefore price pressures One of the things that those who don't want to find inflation, especially among journalists, are looking to is the possibility that the capacity availability outside the United States will help us avoid inflation We looked at that quite carefully and find very little solace there  In the area of interest rates, one of the things that's most difficult to forecast--and it has been discussed by Mike Prell both in the Greenbook and in his oral presentation and then by various members  -26-    5/17/94  of the Committee this morning--is to try to figure out just how much the policy that we have put in place so far and its effect on medium- and longer-term interest rates will slow the economy down In the very sensitive areas of, say, the 7- to 10-year maturities, it's difficult to figure out exactly what has caused that increase in interest rates, but we've done a rather large amount of work on the relationship between the Treasury market and therefore interest rates in general and mortgage-backed securities; Joan Lovett referred to that rather briefly in her presentation But quite clearly, as interest rates go up and the duration of any mortgage portfolio increases, the hedging requirement moves out the yield curve And we think that has a fair amount to do with the considerable increases in interest rates in the 7- to 10-year area, especially in the 10-year note itself If that is so, it means that we've got a closer linkage than we have had historically between short-term interest rates that the Fed directly can control and the medium- and longer-term rates that have a rather direct effect on the interest-sensitive sectors I think all of us would have to agree that we are not quite sure exactly how that will play out in the future  Another area that we find has to be looked at very closely is the attitudes and therefore the likely spending habits of the consumer The consumer is a good deal more confident than he or she was a couple of months ago But it's very difficult to find out exactly what they are so confident about except that the increase in employment would seem to have lowered the anxiety level about losing jobs Still, one hears enough about layoffs especially in the white collar sector to wonder how consumer confidence that is a large part of all of our economic forecasts, and which Governor Kelley discussed very well I thought, is going to affect the future So we're in a situation I think where we have policy actions that need to be taken, but it seems to me that at this particular time the question marks are rather larger than usual--although as Mike Prell pointed out, all economic forecasts have question marks--and therefore make decisions on policy that much more difficult   I support the 50 basis point increase in the funds rate and the symmetric directive I think it is going to be seen as a very powerful action by the marketplace both inside the United States and out I do think that we have to make a statement There will be people whose only view of the world is based on their own trading positions who will be disappointed by our not saying the word of God is that this is it for some extended period of time We can't say that and shouldn't say that, but I think we should be aware that it is not a sure thing that this action plus the statement, which I think makes a great deal of sense, will necessarily stabilize the financial markets I hope it does, and it probably will after a couple of days, but it need not happen in the hour or two or even a day or so after the meeting I believe it will be very well received outside the United States where attitudes are to a substantial degree affected or influenced by our fellow central bankers The Chairman was at the last BIS meeting and, if I may say so, did an unusually good job of explaining the US position, and I don't think anybody who attended that meeting will have any doubt that this is a very firm, decisive action And I think we will be very much applauded by our fellow central bankers in many of the countries around the world   So move   I'd like to make some comments in two areas One is on the operation itself because, like the Chairman, I was involved in the decision to do it The previous Friday at about midday, as Peter mentioned in his prepared statement, there had been a very significant weakening of the dollar on no volume We had what is technically the worst of all worlds a price correction with no position correction So we had all the people who didn't feel good about the dollar sitting there with exactly or essentially the same positions that they had at the start of the day On the particular Friday morning when we intervened, the market had very much the same feel about it The question, which always plagues one after an intervention as it should whether it is successful or not, is what would have happened if we had not intervened The answer is we don't know But the likelihood of the dollar having been considerably weaker is significant in my view I would agree with Peter's comment that the ability of the dollar to stay in the 98ish area against the yen since that time had a relationship, perhaps the main beneficial one, with the intervention itself Secondly, I think we should realize that the dollar's weakness is essentially against the yen The dollar/deutschemark is about in the middle of a range within which it has been floating for some considerable number of months So, having made the policy statement to accompany the intervention, I think people are now correctly thinking that the main thing going on in the exchange market is that we have a very strong Japanese yen and that's a very big problem for the macro economy in Japan  On the policy issue, I very strongly support the Chairman's view that it would be unwise, I think in the extreme, for the Federal Reserve to distance itself from active involvement in the decisionmaking in this area First, as a purely technical matter, the world does not know until the next quarterly publication of our exchange market activity by Peter as the Manager for Foreign Operations whether the intervention by the US monetary authorities has involved both the Treasury and the Fed or just one or just the other So, in order to establish that we were not involved in the operation, since the Federal Reserve Bank of New York carries out intervention operations as the fiscal agent of the Treasury, we would have to make a public statement that we did not sympathize with an action by our own government That is something which I do not think any of us would wish to do, at least I certainly would not The ability of those of us involved in these discussions to have a very positive influence on the Treasury is considerable They pay attention to us I think they believe that both our knowledge of economics and of markets is considerable; we hope that belief is well- founded but the important thing is that that is what they appear to think Therefore, we do have a considerable amount of influence on what happens The Chairman and I have both stated that we supported the operation on that day It does not appear to have been a success, but again we do not have a clue as to what would have happened had we not intervened  -7-    7/5-6/94   I have a question for Mike as well In preparing for this meeting, we had the research staff at New York play the game of what would be the result of various tightenings In the model that we used, which is partially in our heads, we got about the same result from a 50 basis point tightening that you get from the 100 basis point tightening, and a fair bit more, ie, a much weaker economy from 100 basis points Do I assume correctly that the policy point is not so much that policy will have to be firmed by 100 basis points, but that policy will definitely have to be, to pick an adverb, substantially firmed in order to avoid the inflationary result that you are convinced the Committee would not wish to see?   Mr Chairman, the economy in the New York District continued to advance at a moderate pace in late spring Unemployment rates fell and payroll employment rose State tax collections for retail sales, personal income, and corporate franchises have risen moderately so far this year, suggesting growth in the underlying streams of personal income, corporate income, and retail sales Vacancy rates for commercial office space continue to decline in most metropolitan areas, while permits for residential construction of new, single-family homes have snapped back from the weather-reduced lows of the first quarter For New York City, however, several recent economic indicators, including establishment employment, city government payrolls, and initial claims for unemployment insurance suggest that an economic pause may be developing The financial sector, needless to say, is not having quite the happy experience that it had in the first half of 1993 On an overall basis, the District economy maintains a reasonable pace, although we still compare rather poorly with most areas of the country  Our forecast on the national level is that, even given an unchanged monetary policy, real GDP growth will gradually taper off from the roughly 3-1/4 percent rate in the first half of this year to around 3 percent in the second half and about 2-1/2 percent in 1995 We think that slowing growth is likely the lagged result of the run-up in long-term interest rates The forecast is a bit softer on growth than the one we prepared for the last meeting and it reflects the 50 basis point increase in the funds rate at that time and a slightly higher path of long-term interest rates than we had anticipated We think this increase in long-term interest rates will particularly affect housing and related elements of consumer spending, such as furniture and appliances Indeed, available evidence suggests that single-family housing starts may have begun to slow, although how convincing those data are remains to be seen We think that higher rates should also affect motor vehicle sales and perhaps slow down capital spending That forecast would put us rather along the lines that Gary Stern suggests Our problem is that we think the risks to our forecast are asymmetric There is not much risk of the economy being less strong, but there is a major risk that we are underestimating the upward momentum in both real output and inflation The housing market could recover later this year when households adjust to higher interest rates, while export demand could pick up strongly with a decline in the dollar and overseas recoveries Therefore, we think it is very important at the present time to watch very carefully the real economic data coming through to see whether the rather benign path that is possible is in fact taking place or whether the stronger growth, which we think is the likely alternative, would indicate that rather strong policy moves will be required   I have just two comments The first is on whether we should change the debt range I have a very strong feeling that that is a good thing to do but that the likelihood is that it would take on a life far greater than it has any reason to have You will recall, Mr Chairman, that when you presented your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, it included the concept of the real fed funds rate as one of a variety of things we look at The press reacted to it as if it were the new "North Star" for our policy, which you never intended it to be   I think a change in the debt range would almost certainly have the same fate Secondly, just briefly on my pet theory on the problems of inflation, we tend to think--and we should because our job is economic policy and the economic results--in terms of the economic effects of inflation But inflation also has socio-political effects There is a traditional economic view that an increase in inflation transfers wealth from lenders to borrowers; I think that is probably valid But there is a whole segment of our society, most of whom live in inner cities, who don't borrow for all practical purposes I think any increase in inflation makes their lot worse, and since their lot is already very seriously bad, it risks sufficient social imbalance that society would have to react with a very heavy allocation of resources to solve that problem That can lead to very serious economic difficulties, which we ought to think about when we decide how we feel about the overall effects of inflation That is very, very hard to put into an economic model But I think that if some day we come back to a general discussion of  -47-    7/5-6/94  how we really feel about inflation, we ought to try to crank that reality, if others agree that it is one, into our considerations   I am in favor of alternative I across the board for both 1994 and 1995 Perhaps, living in the city where financial journalists swarm, I am not at all convinced that, by leaving M2 and M3 alone and changing the debt ratio, we would not have much more discussion of the meaningfulness of that move than anybody in this Committee really thinks is meaningful  As regards 1996, I find myself in the awkward position of being trapped in the middle of Alan Blinder's syllogism I believe it is the major I agree that we should be more open to disclosure, but my concern at the present time about forecasting 1996 is not unrelated to the fact that it is a year divisible by four, which may be the interest behind the request If we ever forecast that far out, it would be better that we do it after considerably more discussion and thinking than is possible now So as a tactical matter, I prefer that we not release a forecast for 1996 Perhaps as we meet in February or get prepared for February, we may want to think more fully about whether we wish to forecast out for a longer period I suspect the answer to that would be "no," partly because of what Larry Lindsey just said But it may very well be that we need to be somewhat more forthcoming about just what we mean by price stability I don't have a conclusion for that, but I think it's probably a debate that we may wish to have   Mr Chairman, I agree that we definitely should not make a policy move today, because I think there is no doubt whatsoever that the move would be associated with an effort to strengthen the dollar For reasons you have cited, I believe the only way to help a reserve currency is to manage domestic monetary policy appropriately by stabilizing and, in the longer term, bringing down the inflation rate I believe that any move that would make sense for domestic policy, be it 25 or 50 basis points, would be deemed to be an effort to strengthen the dollar, which would fail Therefore, it could well put us into the kind of market instability that would require a sharp increase in interest rates, something that would be completely inappropriate for the domestic economy As I  -66-    7/5-6/94  stated yesterday, I believe that the economy could conceivably be moving to a path that will bring us sustainable growth and a decreasing, or at worst for the short-run a stable, inflation rate However, I think that all the risks to that forecast are on the high side, that is, that the economy will in fact be stronger than that Since we are quite close to capacity as is indicated by virtually all of the statements yesterday, a stronger economy would almost certainly bring increased inflationary pressures Therefore, it seems to me that we should have a definite bias toward tightening, which says that we should have an asymmetric directive I think it's entirely possible, as the incoming data give us a better feel for what's actually happening, that we would in fact wish to make a tightening move before the next meeting That tightening move could well be as much as 50 basis points Therefore, I am very much in favor of alternative B with an asymmetric directive   Is that fully clear to you?   Thank you, Mr Chairman We did discuss that For those unfamiliar with the Basle regime, there is a G-10 governors dinner on Sunday night, which was attended on this occasion by Alan Blinder and me We used that occasion to mention    7/20/94  that the Mexican authorities were interested in the possibility of European support and, therefore, that we were bringing this desire on the part of the Mexicans to the attention of the other G-10 central bankers If that sounds as if we were not selling the product, that's how you should interpret it We were not advocating this as something that the United States wished the other central banks to do, but we were merely being to some degree a messenger for the Mexicans The response was considerably more positive than I had thought it would be or I think that Ted Truman or Alan Blinder or Peter Fisher thought it would be We had some question and still do about whether the Mexican authorities would find this in their interest, and that's, of course, why it's up to them to decide when and if to announce it The support for the Mexican possibility of a request was quite strong, largely because of concern expressed particularly by  about possible systemic risks of an exchange rate crisis in Mexico spreading to other countries in Latin America, specifically including Argentina There was a discussion also regarding the fact that such a facility should not be used in a way artificially to support an exchange rate that was no longer justified; I believe Ted has covered that concern quite fully in his remarks   I think it would depend very much on what happened on the specifics We've had clearly a very serious deterioration of the situation in Venezuela That does not seem to have adversely affected the other Latin countries a great deal, although I'm sure it didn't help the Mexican situation It doesn't seem to have created problems for the better performing countries like Argentina and Chile I would think that if after the Mexican election there is a period of political uncertainty, which is not impossible, it could create problems in the Brady bond markets for some of the other countries But I believe the general feeling here and at the Board is that the likelihood is that the market would continue to distinguish among the various Latin American countries as to their particular creditworthiness, so that there isn't a high risk of a contamination effect At the same time, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile have been seen as the three top performers and, therefore, I think anything that affects one of those three does hold out at least some concern that it could affect the others as well   So move   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me speak briefly about the economy in the Second District; it continued to expand over the past month, but we are seeing some weak spots, especially in the state of New York Payroll employment declined at an annual rate of 1 percent in June in New York State and 2 percent in New York City There were some rather large declines in manufacturing jobs in many areas throughout New York State Continuing announcements by manufacturers of additional cuts suggest weakness in New York State manufacturing employment for some time to come The latest announcements, each referring to worldwide staff, were a 10 percent cut at Bausch and Lomb and further paring at IBM and a major pharmaceutical company Trading losses and dampened bond market activities spurred layoffs in fixed income departments at three major securities firms and additional cuts appear likely Multiple mergers and acquisitions within the thrift industry also are taking their tolls on the job count In contrast, New Jersey added another 10,000 jobs in June, and I'm not sure what the split is between Ed Boehne's District and mine, but that is an annualized gain of 29 percent Manufacturing employment has been stable for the past three months, and small job gains accrued in most other sectors of the economy So we now have an unemployment rate that has fallen to 64 percent in New Jersey, just above the national figure, an unemployment rate in New York State of 71 percent and in the City 88 percent One of the things that I've been learning as I have been traveling around New York State is that there is a growing malaise in the business community, a belief that New York State is not a particularly good place to run a business That has led to some of the moves to Connecticut and to New Jersey by the financial industry  What I think is a somewhat greater concern, but I don't know enough about yet, is that in the tier of the State between Albany and Buffalo where there had been a rather successful transition from making carpets and clothing to rather more computerized activities like check clearing both by the Fed and by the major New York banks, one of the major attractions of that part of New York State was the quality of life If you don't mind a lot of snow, it has kind of an idyllic climate, a beautiful countryside, and a very fine lifestyle That has changed or is in the process of changing largely as a result of people doing what would appear to be good things, and that is putting correction facilities and prisons in that part of the state However, the families of the prisoners and the kids in the correction  -26-    8/16/94  units also move into the community and it has transferred something of an inner city to unlikely places like Rome, Utica, Rochester, and Syracuse That is switching off the businessmen from thinking that this is a particularly friendly place to situate themselves in order to grow, and they don't have to go particularly far because they are seeing Pennsylvania, which isn't too far away, as having a somewhat friendlier environment I think if there are two states in the country where you wouldn't wish to have a malaise, they would be California and New York, or at least those would be two of the three candidates with Texas probably We are going to have to continue to watch what's happening in the State of New York because the trend is not a very happy one  On the national level, our staff forecast is so close to the Greenbook that it is something of a rounding error even to talk about it Our staff forecast is somewhat more benevolent on inflation in the second half of this year, but that appears to be more than anything else that the Greenbook is somewhat more concerned about increasing energy prices than we are So, for example, next year we have real GDP growing at 21 percent and the Greenbook is exactly in the same place The main difference is that we don't think it's going to take quite as much official action We have the same macro results with a funds rate of 5-1/4 percent whereas the Greenbook, as you know, has a funds rate of 5-1/2 percent We have the CPI at 29 percent and the Greenbook has it at 30 percent In looking at these forecasts myself, I'm somewhat more optimistic than either the Greenbook or my own staff, and I think the difference largely is that I am really very strongly convinced that by historical reference this FOMC is well ahead of past experience in taking appropriate monetary policy actions If we continue to do the right things, perhaps even including today, at some stage that is going to become more apparent to the practitioners in the economy, and I think that we have a pretty good shot at that If that is true, although the numbers would not be great, the significance I think would be substantial I think we could get somewhat better economic growth of the kind that Alan Blinder was talking about at a somewhat lower rate of inflation I recognize that that would be a very happy outcome and one always has to try to abstract one's wishes from one's analysis, but I do think that there is a significant possibility that we could achieve that   Mr Chairman, I support the package very fully This may well be all we have to do in the adjustment of policy that began the fourth of February We may have to tighten some more next year, but we have seen that the effect of monetary policy since February 4th, because of the steepness of the yield curve, has been somewhat greater than it was in previous periods If that continues, we could very well get into next year and decide, as Governor Phillips has just suggested, that the next policy move should be an easing of policy I think a very forthright statement, like the one that you have read to us, is most important A nuance that I feel about it is that it is an indication of self confidence on your part and the Committee's that such a statement be made A self-confident Federal Reserve that is seen as doing its job well gains the kind of credibility that makes people think when the next move is appropriate we will take it, whether that is up or down   It is my pleasure, Mr Chairman, to move the election of Frederic Mishkin as associate economist Rick, as he is known to his friends, has just joined the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as our head of Research He is a distinguished tenured professor at the Columbia Business School, and we are very happy to have him join our staff   I have a follow-up on Governor Blinder's question If there were to be rhetoric of a warlike nature from Japanese government officials, I would assume that the effect on the dollar/yen could also be quite dramatic   I think it might be worth reminding the Committee that the present Minister of Trade and Industry has in fact had some very tough comments to make, and he would be the official who could very well be deemed to be the appropriate spokesman from their side   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   The economy of the Second District actually improved over the last several weeks Retailers were quite pleased with August sales--reporting year-to-year gains of 3 to 8 percent depending somewhat on the area Demand in interest-sensitive markets such as housing, cars, and light trucks slowed, however In the labor markets, the unemployment rate fell a bit in August to 69 percent in New York and 6 percent in New Jersey, and payrolls grew in July by 30,000 in New York and 10,000 in New Jersey People are worried about personal income tax collections going forward; as a proxy for personal income, they grew by 3 percent in New York and 5 percent in New Jersey in the most recently available months Something that has improved, perhaps at the expense of Florida, is tourism which has rebounded in New York City A possible explanation is that the press is playing up very strongly the "law and order" approach of the new mayor and the new police commissioner Although the crime statistics have not changed very much, people are feeling safer The hotel room occupancy rate is up to 776 percent, which is a 5-year high The New York airports are bustling and Broadway attendance is up 15 percent compared to last year The convention business is coming back  On the negative side, it appears that there is a hole of about $1 billion in New York City's budget for this year, which is now into its third month, and so there will be a further reduction in City employment The talk is a cutback of about 7,000 jobs Perhaps more important over the longer run for the financial services industry is that Swiss Banc Corporation has just announced that it is going to be moving a good deal of its activities, including its trading, to a building that is being constructed in Stamford, Connecticut, a place that already has a lot of empty buildings When their new building is finished in 1997, they will be moving most of their New York-based activities there As I think all of you know, the conventional wisdom has been that trading activities have to be in places like Manhattan or the City of London, and so for a major bank like Swiss Banc Corporation to be flying in the teeth of that conventional wisdom is really quite important If it caught on, it could take a lot of very highly rewarded jobs out of New York City where they are very much needed  The national economy appears to have less near-term momentum than we thought earlier, but fundamentally our forecast is about where we were at the last meeting That is, we expect growth of real GDP to stay in the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent range in the second half of this year and into 1995 So, we have a soft landing occurring but probably not soon enough to avoid a pickup in consumer price inflation from roughly 2-3/4 percent in 1994 to around 3-1/4 percent in 1995  -16-    9/27/94  Although we believe the risks in this forecast are fairly well balanced, there is a range of uncertainty about the strength of growth over the rest of 1994 In particular, as the Greenbook would suggest, there is a significant risk of stronger near-term growth than we are projecting So, an alternative path of short-term interest rates, other than staying where they are, may in fact be necessary to combat the inflationary tendencies that could come up What we are really concerned about is that the near-term risks to our forecast are symmetric but we think they are quite large, since the strength and sustainability of the rebound in consumer spending are unknown  Given the firming of the price data and the significant risk that a surge of consumption could push growth above 3 percent, we think that there are two alternative feasible paths for policy One would be to stay about where we are and the other would be to firm policy at an appropriate time by about 50 basis points As we compared our forecast with that of the Greenbook, what we came down to was that the Greenbook forecast looks like our upside number That is, if all the risks that we see for stronger economic growth were to materialize, we would be about where the Greenbook is We don't deny that that is possible, but it is the upside rather than the midpoint of our forecast So, I think we are as far away from the Greenbook forecast as has been the case since I have been attending these meetings   Mr Chairman, from what we know and can observe today and based on the discussion around the table, I think the right thing to do today is to retain interest rates at their present level I think we have removed all the accommodation from monetary policy and are the closest we can get to a neutral position I believe we removed it at the right time and along the right firming path It is possible that the risks may be essentially balanced, but they probably are not Therefore, I think an easing of interest rates before the next meeting is highly unlikely, and a tightening of monetary policy could be called for by incoming data over the  -39-    9/27/94  intermeeting period Therefore, I agree with your recommendation that an asymmetric directive tilted toward tightening is appropriate  I do not believe that the statement that we made after the August meeting should keep us from tightening today if we really thought it was the right thing to do I'm against tightening today because I don't think it is the right thing to do That statement should not make us feel at all unwilling to change monetary policy between meetings if the data indicate that is the appropriate step to take I do believe making such statements makes sense; I think the statement we made in August served a useful purpose But the incoming data in the meantime may lead one to believe that waiting until the November 15th meeting just may not be possible On the other hand, I am not at all convinced that the credibility argument demands, because there's a greater probability of a tightening move than we might have thought at the last meeting, that we have to tighten today When the next move takes place, as you already mentioned in your presentation, it would likely be a move of 50 basis points I agree very strongly that that would be the appropriate move--that it should be either zero or 50 I think a 25 basis point move, if that should present itself as an idea to anybody, could very easily and almost certainly would be inappropriately construed as either indicating a degree of timidity, which would not reflect the view of the Committee, or worse still would indicate a compromise So then somebody could write a learned article about the hawks and the doves and who did what to whom, and that at the end of the day we did 25 basis points because we couldn't decide which of the other things to do   So, Mr Chairman, I firmly agree that "B" tilted toward tightening is the appropriate policy decision   So move   No questions   Whenever you are ready   Let me begin, Mr Chairman, with just a brief remark about the goings on in the Second District The New York State economy is continuing to grow but at a slightly slower rate than that of the nation The major source of strength is the consumer Retail sales have been strong and the sales of existing houses have been quite high Needless to say, there is great uncertainty about the fiscal future of the state The new governor inherits a $4 billion hole in a 1995 budget of $34 billion, but he continues to promise to cut taxes New York City dwellers wonder about how well the city will fare given the dynamics of the recent campaign So, I think any investment decisions in which the state tax burden is an issue will almost certainly be put on hold  The banks in the District are lending very aggressively, and that seems to reflect a combination of two things Regional banks both inside and outside the Second District seem to be trying to increase market share Secondly, the money center banks that in some cases have had a considerable reduction, modest in others, of their trading income seem to be somewhat more aggressive in lending in order to improve their earnings The spreads are sufficiently low now that it is not clear to me that they are getting an adequate return on capital from such activity There is no question in my view that  -14-    11/15/94  their lending standards, as evidenced by the covenants being required of their borrowers, are slipping excessively  Switching to the national economy, the question we have been asking ourselves is What do we know that we didn't know at the last meeting of this Committee? Well, the first thing we know is that current and recent GDP and employment growth are even stronger than my colleagues at the New York Bank and I thought would be the case at the time of the last meeting That is the case both as regards the third quarter, which came in stronger, and our view of the current quarter, which we have ratcheted up even more Second, we believe that even if inventory investment slows enough so that it becomes a modest drag on the economy, real growth will stay above 3 percent through most of 1995 We do not have growth slowing in 1995 and 1996 as much as the Greenbook does Third, the interest-sensitive areas are in fact major contributors to growth and show very little response to higher interest rates, even though one must state, of course, that the full effect of the tightening to date has not yet been felt Automobile sales are strong, and if General Motors could straighten out some of its production problems, they would be even stronger Housing is robust The fourth thing we think we know now that we didn't know then is that the surge in average hourly earnings in October of 07 percent is not traceable to unusual factors The Bureau of Labor Statistics' announcement of a pending major upward revision in payroll employment means that the help that we thought we would get from productivity is much lower, causing an upward revision in the trend of labor costs Fifth, even though medical costs were beginning to be better behaved before the health care debate of the last 18 months, we do not think that the improvement in medical costs and therefore the cost of benefits to employers will continue to be a help in controlling inflation Sixth, the rate of unemployment in our view is below the NAIRU, which we think is 6 percent, give or take 01 We could be wrong Since unemployment is now below 6 percent and the CPI is rather well behaved, the question could be asked, is God kinder and has the NAIRU become lower? We don't think so History in the late 1970s and in the late 1980s gives us a lesson, we believe At those times there was hope that the NAIRU would come down Certainly in the late 1980s it was thought that it would come down somewhere within a range of 5 to 5-1/2 percent Unfortunately those hopes turned out to be ill founded I think that what was overlooked is that monetary policy works with a considerable lag and inflation, when it starts, doesn't leap out of its cave; it starts rather slowly and almost imperceptibly  In the meantime, have the financial markets given us any new information? The first thing that I think we should all pay no attention to is the zigs and zags of the financial markets from one day to the next as they absorb the most recent data and as 35-year old bond dealers make profound remarks to the media What I think the market is telling us is that inflationary expectations are high and that our tightening to date has not reduced those expectations One can look at a variety of places on the yield curve to measure inflationary expectations or look at consumer surveys and so on We find the spread between 3-year and 1-year Treasuries a very helpful indicator in large part because it covers just the period during which monetary policy should have its effect initially on inflationary expectations That spread has jumped around because of the volatility of markets this year, but on average it has stayed quite steadily  -15-    11/15/94  around 85 basis points despite the choppiness It has not improved; it has not narrowed as a result of the tightening since the 4th of February  I suppose I should really stop there, but I think that the Greenbook and Mike's presentation place the stance of monetary policy rather front and center At the last meeting, we decided that it was appropriate to have an asymmetric directive, which the world will know about this Friday That meant that we were ready during the intermeeting period, when we didn't know all those new things that we think we now know, to increase the fed funds rate and perhaps the discount rate by 50 basis points We think that because of all the additional information available since the last meeting, such a move would no longer be adequate It could in fact increase inflationary expectations not because young bond dealers would raise questions, but because sensible people could question the resoluteness of this Committee Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation with considerable enthusiasm The New York Bank has had a recommendation in since November 3 for a 75 basis point increase in the discount rate I am very pleased with that piece of it I think 50 would be too little and 100, for the reasons that Ed Boehne suggested, would be dangerous on the high side I believe that the symmetry is as important a part of your recommendation as the number Janet Yellen's eloquent explanation put into economics what had been in the lining of my stomach and therefore was very helpful But I do think deciding what we do in December at that time rather than prejudging it in any way now is very appropriate   I have a question   Was the second-day success the result of the sheer brilliance of the operation? Just say yes [Laughter]   Just say "yes;" that's enough!   I think we have to talk as a practical matter about how we would go about this disengagement At the present time, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York operates as the agent for the US monetary authorities, which means the Federal Reserve and the Treasury The way the conversations take place is that the Desk, Peter and his colleagues, are the technical advisors  -51-    11/15/94  Typically, the people at the Treasury talk with Ted; they talk with me; they talk with the Chairman; and sometimes they talk with other members of the Board as well They get our advice and they pay a great deal of attention to our advice It is very, very rare that if we really say you should not do it that they do it The last time we didn't participate in an intervention was in February 1992 The fact that we have that threat can give us some additional leverage with them, although I think it is not something that one would wisely use very often  If the Federal Reserve were to decide to disengage itself from being part of the US monetary authorities for foreign exchange purposes, we would have to announce that to the world We can't just let it slip out That would impress me as saying that the Federal Reserve--at the risk of some backslapping to this wonderful institution, it is a part of the US public sector that is universally highly regarded outside of our country, sometimes even more than the Administration of the day--would be seen by the world as retreating into a kind of Fortress America That, I think, would be a terrible signal to give It would be a great disservice to the American people and a great disservice to financial stability in the world Our ability to have these operations done at sensible times and in a sensible way is very great, which obviously brings upon the Federal Reserve in general and the Chairman in particular an additional amount of responsibility It is a serious burden, but I think one that we really have no choice but to accept and carry forward There is no question that if we undid the swap lines, it would be mainly a signal to the world We haven't drawn on the swap lines since the 1970s, if I remember correctly They are much more symbolic than real But if we wanted to say to the rest of the world that we are beginning a retreat into Fortress America, it would naturally be through the swap lines It is the classic case of the dog that didn't bark in the night When we renew the swap lines, it is such a routine matter that nobody pays any attention If we didn't renew the swap lines, it would create an international hoopla of very considerable seriousness and, I think, a very negative one   Mr Chairman, I am sure it is no secret to the Committee that this kind of a debate  -55-    11/15/94  They know very well that there is not wild-eyed enthusiasm for intervention on this Committee In fact, that they know that is a very helpful tool for us We don't need that you are describing; it is already there   Nothing is more sure than that   Move approval   So move   So move   Sounds just about perfect   You'd never be a good foreign exchange trader!   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second District continued recent trends of a robust economy in New Jersey and a slowing expanding economy in New York State Data for the most recently available month indicate that employment grew 27 percent in New Jersey and stagnated in New York Consumer sales throughout the District in November grew quite moderately, but the data and the anecdotal evidence indicate a strong Christmas season in all parts of our District  On the national level, I feel that there is great uncertainty about where the economy is going, or at least I am very uncertain I do not believe that growth in the very strong fourth quarter, which could well be 4-1/2 to 5 percent or even more, is the real world but a happenstance of all possible positive elements coming together If it is not too good to be true, at least it would seem too good to continue, and growth next year should slow down to a sustainable pace Our Q4/Q4 GDP growth forecast for 1995 under current policy assumptions is 24 percent with the CPI at 33 percent and going up We think that the cost pressures that have been discussed by many people probably are already baked in the cake  The greatest uncertainty is to figure out where current monetary policy is and its effect on the economy Is it tight and, if tight, in relation to what? We did some work on comparing the present policy stance at full employment, and we tried to find some previous periods when one could say the economy was more or less in the same macro performance position We came up with April 1972, May 1978, and November 1987 as periods to be compared Then we looked at various indicators of whether monetary policy is tight or not If you look at the real fed funds rate, which we compared with the latest 12-month  -18-    12/20/94  CPI, it's now 26 percent, which is considerably tighter than in the 1970s and somewhat tighter than in 1987 The monetary aggregates, M1 and M2, are very much tighter than in all the previous comparison periods The Treasury yield curve is flatter, which would indicate that the market feels that policy is better positioned than it was in those previous periods Even the crude PPI, which has been rather troublesome lately, if you look over the 12-month trend it too indicates that price performance is better, and therefore one would think that monetary policy may well be tighter I'm not sure that that tells us that current monetary policy is perfect It doesn't tell me whether it's a little too tight or a little too loose or very much, except that it tells me that if I were to leap over what tiny bit of fence remains, that waiting might have something going for it Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I support your conclusion that alternative B with an asymmetric directive is appropriate As I remarked earlier, the degree of uncertainty about the effect of existing monetary policy suggests waiting Also, the markets are very thin as Joan described earlier, and as Susan Phillips suggested we could have some remaining effect of governmental actions on Bankers Trust, which would create some uncertainty in markets Therefore, I think that to make a move that is not absolutely necessary right at this time involves some degree of risk It is difficult to quantify and would be better if we avoided it Why asymmetric? We get enough data in the first half of the month-- nonfarm payroll employment on the 6th of January, retail sales on the 13th, and industrial production on the 17th--   We do?   The world gets it later In any case, I think what is important is not so much what we know but what is known outside It might very well be the case that by the middle of the month, roughly, our strong views on price stability could be questioned And, therefore, we should have the capability of moving We can move in fact without an asymmetric directive, but I think that we are better off with the asymmetric directive toward tightening Therefore, I believe that the combination of doing nothing today with an asymmetric directive toward tightening is the appropriate mix   We have an answer by this time, yes   Thank you, Mr Chairman It might be helpful for the Committee to see why we decided it would be appropriate to bring the non-NAFTA BIS countries in As late as the meeting on Monday that the Chairman described when the Mexicans came to Washington, we had evaluated the situation as one in which we should try as much as possible to have the new Mexico, as we call it, not look like the old Mexico of 1982 What has made the new Mexico new was a very good set of domestic financial economic policies with the exception of an exchange rate policy that had resulted in a progressively overvalued currency Therefore, we thought that the support that was already existent in the swap facility of $6 billion from the United States jointly and equally funded by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve plus a $1 billion Canadian line, which is equal to $07 billion US, would be adequate and sufficient in bringing in players from the past such as the BIS as a source of pesos However, as this week has progressed, it became very clear that the marketplace needed some additional source of psychological strength, even though I could not agree more with the Chairman that the market's view about how much this outside support really contributes tends to be exaggerated  -4-    12/30/94   Could I interrupt for a second, Mr Chairman? I think it would be more consistent with our conversations with the Mexicans to date if we made this supplementary portion 90 days with a possible extension of 90 days rather than a year   They'd have the facility available for 90 days plus 90 days   If they draw on the 179th day and then they have 90 days, there is a possibility of rolling over the drawing for another 90 days You could wind up to about 359 days But all our conversations so far have been that the facility would be available for 90 days plus 90 days   I think we ought to stick with that   We're giving them more than we've been talking about   Mr Chairman, I hate to continue a technical debate, but the terms of the facility remain in place until the final repayment is made But if you say that the facility is available for a year, then we're talking about a potential year and a half That is six months longer than anything that we have been encouraged to believe We can fix that up   I think we may be confusing the Committee         I share that view, Alan   Mr Chairman, they definitely do plan to include in the speech, as we understand it, anything that they have available in the way of international support, though probably not in a lot of detail Assuming they don't get leaked in the meantime, the details would be more likely in the form of a briefing  -10-    12/30/94  by the new finance minister probably right after the speech or the next morning   Mr Chairman, this is Bill McDonough Let me add for the Committee's benefit that the other Latin American countries are very anxious that this effort be successful We had the finance minister of in New York for three days this last week, and he is convinced as is the  that they are being very badly contaminated by the spillover from Mexico They are very anxious that this US government effort to help Mexico be successful There had been some question as to whether some of the other countries might feel that separating out Mexico and making it special could be adverse to them That certainly is not the view of the two most obviously vulnerable countries in the hemisphere   We are looking at probably Tuesday or Wednesday to get the documentation   I was worried about that pause   So move   I am very strongly persuaded that we should announce policy decisions As I have mentioned before, our previous practice would make it possible in today's very sophisticated financial markets, had we continued that procedure, to give an    1/31-2/1/95  advantage for only 10 seconds or half a minute to the more sophisticated market participants We do, in fact, say when there is no policy action that the Committee has met and there is no further announcement That is an announcement of sorts Therefore, I think whether we do that or whether we say the Committee has met and there was no change in policy is--   It is the symmetric directive issue   That is right; I had not heard that argument   The point I want to emphasize is that we should continue to have Joe Coyne announce that the Committee meeting is over and that there is no further announcement   I think the content of what we have had to say in our announcements of policy changes has been quite good Personally, looking back to August 16, I wish that we had not said that these actions are expected to be sufficient at least for a time to meet the objective of sustained noninflationary growth Since I was very supportive of the decision, I understand why we did it I think, henceforth, we might want to be even more careful about making such a statement   A very brief explanation   I would like to raise a minor, or maybe not so minor, objection to that Don Kohn, I believe, has been the drafter of the statement, but the fact that he has had it in pectore rather than on the table means that the debate is not inhibited by people looking at the statement and seeing what the party line may be   I thought you were suggesting that you were going to have it available for people while they were voting   I understand how it has worked I, at least, got confused by what you said just now   I think, Mr Chairman, we could distinguish between organizational matters that would not be taped and monetary and central banking matters that would be taped   I suggested that organizational matters, which we discussed as examples, would not be taped Other matters would be taped and those would be monetary policy and central banking matters I do not know of anything else we talk about   You could leave it as monetary policy because to me, monetary policy is a very broad, broad church   It certainly would include a discussion of anything we may do vis-a-vis Mexico   Yes   This is a different human nature than I am familiar with I think I am closer to Bob Forrestal's view of it as a privilege rather than a right   I think it is an unfortunate bit of history that people who dissent make a statement explaining the dissent It is fine to dissent if one thinks he or she ought to, but I think the dissenting vote is enough So, it is very easy to understand why I think that consenting opinions are truly a terrible idea I believe the function of this Committee is to make decisions on monetary policy That is best done when the Committee reaches its decisions after an open and frank debate The notion that, well, I supported the majority but here is why I think my view is a little different from what is stated in the minutes opens us up to factionalism I think Bob Forrestal is right First there would be one statement, and then there would be two, and then there would be heaven knows how many The press and the Street would have a field day deciding who is in one camp and who is in the other camp I think it would be a terrible disservice to the great reputation and the enormous responsibility of this Committee   I have always looked at Joe's very good guidelines as a reminder to all of us to be prudent That can be between the meeting and the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony because we do not want to preempt what the Chairman is likely to say That is easy because usually we do not know! [Laughter] But now that we announce the decision, we could all look rather foolish if somebody were to say, "Well, you raised interest rates on such-and-such a date, didn't you?" We don't want to say, "Sorry, I can't say anything about that" So I think the blackout is a reminder to be prudent I think it is very, very important for us to be quiet during the week before the meeting so that we do not provide the entertainment in the Sunday supplement After the meeting, it would seem to me that one has to be careful not to reveal positions for just the reasons that we do not want concurring opinions   This year we have one Wednesday meeting in November because of the BIS conflict   Although the Humphrey-Hawkins Act is in fact full of goals I reduce them, as I think Governor Blinder did, to two that I describe as sustained economic growth and price stability But I find that to be really a single goal, since I am absolutely convinced that the best way to achieve sustained economic growth is through price stability I prefer to state the objective of price stability in words rather than as a numerical goal I believe that in achieving our goal of price stability, we should seek a downward secular path in inflation from business cycle to business cycle That goal means somewhat more disinflation because I do believe that the present level of inflation at, say, 2-1/2 to 3 percent is higher than one wishes to have for either economic or social reasons  I question the whole idea of credibility Nobody has been able to prove that credibility has bought the Bundesbank or any other central bank the benefit of a lower cost to reduce inflation In fact, Stanley Fischer presented a very good paper at the 300th anniversary of the Bank of England proving rather the contrary There is no particular benefit in the so-called credibility, and I think credibility mainly makes central bankers feel better about themselves It seems to me that the record of this Committee over recent years has been as good, if not better, than any central bank I can think of, including specifically the Bundesbank I think it would be very unconvincing as a public policy goal for us to position ourselves as driving toward some number for inflation, which presumably if one could figure out how to measure it accurately would be zero, where we know the costs of achieving it would be very high and we are very, very uncertain of the benefits   It's $6 billion for the Mexicans with a take-out from the Treasury   Could I clarify something? What Governor Mancera said just a couple of hours ago was that, if before the end of the day today he is informed that we the United States are willing to make these $2 billion available, he would envision when he announces his reserve figures to say that they have X, say $24 to $28 billion, and in addition, because I don't think we can get value to them today, that he had agreement from the Federal Reserve and the Exchange Stabilization Fund for an additional $2 billion, value tomorrow presumably So he will lay it out accurately, I think   The Mexicans historically have been very sensitive about that Now the whole world is informed that there are oil payments as an assured method of repayment The Mexicans, for reasons with which you would be very familiar given Mexican history, have been rather sensitive about that being quite so open as it is now   As president of the Bank where the money will be kept, I can assure you that we will keep a very close eye on it!  -73-    1/31-2/1/95   So move   Thank you, Mr Chairman A pause has developed in New York City, which has slowed the economic expansion in the Second District despite sharp recorded drops in the December unemployment rate in both New York and New Jersey The weakness, fortunately, is largely confined to the New York metropolitan area In the remaining two-thirds of the District, recovery appears to be intact, led by moderate gains in New Jersey and more modest growth elsewhere in New York State In December, New York State payroll employment was stagnant following four consecutive months of decline The comparable New Jersey figures have not been  -90-    1/31-2/1/95  released, but employment growth has averaged 16 percent at an annual rate over the past five months Probably because of reduced earnings and bonuses in the financial industry, personal income tax collections for New York State and City fell 7 percent below a year ago in December and were up just 2 to 3 percent for the year In contrast, personal income tax collections were up nearly 20 percent in New Jersey in September, the latest reported month, while the year-to- September gain in the state was over 9 percent Realtors reported that the sales rate of existing homes declined from the third to the fourth quarter and the median price fell between 5 and 10 percent, depending on the location in the District The aggregate consumer price index for New York and northeastern New Jersey rose at a rate of just 21 percent in December and 24 percent for the year In the finance sector, people continue to be very blue Members of the securities industry reported sharp declines in fourth-quarter earnings, ranging from 50 to 80 percent Numerous new layoffs were announced among banks and brokerage firms, including the very strongest  Despite all that, there does seem to be something of an improvement in attitude in New York State Even in the area between Albany and Buffalo, traditionally a strong manufacturing area and where the unemployment rate is not that high--ranging in about the 4 to 5-1/2 percent area--the attitude that I encountered up there six or seven months ago was generally very dismal and now it is improving quite a lot Fortunately, it is not that people think the new governor is going to wave a magic wand and fix everything It is rather that with the likelihood of a more pro-business state government, they are getting more of a notion of helping themselves For example, in Syracuse where I was last week, a manufacturing company could not find enough workers and was planning to leave the area The Chamber of Commerce managed to find enough skilled workers from among its member businesses to enable the company to stay in the town That attitude of "let's do it for ourselves" is something that I have been encouraging in speeches up there We do seem to be making some progress in spreading the notion that if the governor can do something good, that is terrific But if business can help itself, that is even more so  On the national level, we too have a general difference with the Greenbook in that under the current policy assumption, we have real GDP somewhat stronger, almost 1/2 percentage point higher Unfortunately, we also have the CPI at 33 percent Q4-to-Q4 We have a very low unemployment rate at 51 or 52 percent We have done some "what ifs" Even if the optimists are right and the NAIRU is 5-1/2 percent instead of 6 percent, it would appear that we have a rate of economic growth in the system that is going to create more inflation anyway It is only if we have very low employment growth and relatively slow additions to the work force that in our forecast we would get up to the 5-1/2 percent unemployment rate So, we do have considerable concerns about the likelihood of inflation picking up, and in fact our economic forecast under current policy assumptions shows a pickup  I also applaud the new approach in the Greenbook I think it has, among other things, helped us to talk about the economy and not talk about policy in this part of the meeting  -91-    1/31-2/1/95   Thank you, Mr Chairman I very much agree with your conclusion, but I would like to state just briefly some of the reasons Every possible conjuncture that we have been able to put together on the economy indicates that we need to increase official rates by 50 basis points--possibly by more than that, but certainly by 50 basis points Therefore, just on the economics, I think the time to raise those rates is today, and I do not have to justify the increases in my own mind by the fact that financial markets clearly are looking for a 50 basis point increase I do think that market expectations are a substantiating reason but perhaps from a slightly different perspective It is reasonably  -114-    1/31-2/1/95  likely in my view that this will be the last interest rate increase It is important that we do it decisively and that we not gratuitously create a problem in financial markets, especially at a time when I think the dollar is extremely vulnerable and likely to fall There are going to be two times, possibly this year and maybe even probably this year, when we will disappoint financial markets The first will be at the meeting at which they expect us to increase interest rates and we do not, especially if we accompany the decision, going back to our discussion at yesterday's meeting, with a statement that we have decided not to increase interest rates The financial markets won't be ready for that We will disappoint them even more when we decide that it is appropriate to reduce interest rates at a time when unemployment probably will be below anybody's notion of the NAIRU and when we could be having some uptick in inflation That forward- looking move, which I think will take at least as much courage as any of the moves that we made last year or contemplate for today, will induce much confusion in financial markets I would much rather confine the confusion to those two important times and not cause it this time for, I think, no earthly benefit for us   We have heard from everybody   He was on background from last night   Ted, I have two questions One has a preamble Since we are an independent central bank dealing with the Executive Branch and because we are a bank, the analogy would be that we are a bank dealing with an affiliated company--something that we take very seriously as regards the way it is done by the banks we supervise Is it safe to assume that we will have very, very clear documentation of both the warehousing facility and the take-out of the swap line?   The second question If a bank says to a customer, we are making a line of credit available to you but as soon as you repay any of it, it goes away, that discourages the customer from repaying until the last minute So I am not sure that that particular piece described on the first page, paragraph 4, is really in our interest, and you might want to rethink that   Two years from now   That was earlier; yesterday he spoke with Ted   Mr Chairman, I think you have described the situation very accurately The credit risk to the Federal Reserve, as I view it, has been removed Certainly, Virgil and our other legal colleagues can draft the documentation to be sure that it is removed and stays removed I believe very firmly that you had no choice but to get involved Since you got involved, the Federal Reserve got involved, appropriately in my view, even though it is uncomfortable for you and all the rest of us Essentially, we are in a situation where our involvement has to be maintained and where we have to do the best we can to ensure that the terms for our involvement are done in the best possible way This means some very tough conditionality, but as for the two items for which we need approval, I think we may have reached the point where a motion would be appropriate for both of them  -133-    1/31-2/1/95   Mr Chairman, I further move that the Committee approve the expansion of the warehousing agreement to $20 billion as established and set forth on the second page of Mr Truman's submission to the Committee   Mr Chairman, I might contribute something that has happened fairly recently Domingo Cavallo, the economics minister of Argentina and Roque Fernandez, the president of their central bank, called me They were doing something of a round robin They had already talked to Eddie George, with John Claude Trichet, and with Helmut Schieber in the absence of Hans Teitmeyer They have asked the International Monetary Fund for a $2 billion standby A Fund mission is leaving Washington this afternoon and will be in Buenos Aires in the morning with the possibility that, if things look good, Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer will follow them in a day or two In addition to the support of the IMF, in order to shore up the banking system--  --they are going to try to put together a fund of approximately $4 billion to serve as a lender of last resort That would amount to about 10 percent of the total deposits in the banking system, which have fallen $3 or $4 billion since the Mexican crisis to $40 billion We all know the Argentine peso and the dollar are equivalent, so they talk in dollar terms The source of this $4 billion is to include $1 billion that is available to the central bank in the form of reserves that it has over and above those needed to back currency in circulation and the reserve deposits of the banking system with the central bank Through a sale of 3-year bonds, they will also seek to raise $1-1/2 billion from cash-rich multinational and Argentine corporations resident in Argentina They will ask a number of foreign banks, to be led by Deutsche Bank and Citibank--at least those are the banks that were asked to be the lead banks--to put together a coterie of approximately 20 banks for loans totaling $1-1/2 to $2 billion; the loans would also be for a 3-year period with amortization beginning at the end of one year They believe this fund is necessary for the support of the banking system There is every reason to believe that President Menem, the minister of finance, and the central bank governor are as resolute as they have been in insisting that they have to maintain the convertibility of the peso with the dollar They do not have a "phase two" or an alternate plan They are insisting that they are going to make this work regardless of the difficulties and that's what they are seeking to do    3/10/95   The IMF mission has been announced, Ted, in the last hour or two   You've been busy doing other things However, there have been very well-founded rumors about the request for the money from the Argentine resident companies There was a Bloomberg story yesterday suggesting the Club loan   This is Bill McDonough again The Treasury, as you've suggested, has been getting some very ardent entreaties from the European countries There is a view over there that the dollar weakness adversely affects the European crosses, and there is a little truth to that There's also, I think, a greater amount of truth that the problems within the European crosses create weakness for the dollar   I'll go for the European crosses adversely affecting the dollar I think it is highly likely that early next week there will be a request coming from the European side that will place us in the position of having to respond as to whether we are still members of that community of Treasury officials and central bankers working together We've been hearing that argument I've been playing bad cop and saying, "no, that doesn't make sense" and "no, we won't play" in the last few days while you, Mr Chairman, have been up on the Hill testifying But I think we're going to hear an increasing amount of that early next week   I would share that view I think that we would have to be very careful that a modest showing of the flag would indicate that we cared but not lead to our standing in there getting our brains beaten out That could really be counterproductive and rather dangerous   I would like to put in a minority position here There isn't any amount of money that the central banks are likely to come up with that is going to beat a market that wants to take us on They have more money than we do There is an advantage in the kind of operation that we did Thursday and Friday of last week in that it indicated an interest in our currency on the part of US monetary authorities, and then we went away That's why I think the people most actively involved in this are not very enthusiastic about doing anything next week I think the Chairman is preparing us for the notion that we may get a very strong request from the Treasury, which I suspect would be based at least in large part on a very strong request from our allies The problem of trying to look as if we are wading in there like the invasion of Normandy is that we may not be successful And so if we come in with what would be a lot of money--$3, $4, $5 billion a day and intervene at that level for two or three days--it would be nice if we were successful But if we were not successful with such a major effort, then we really would have a mess on our hands I think the risk/reward ratio gets very unattractive   Yes   Alan, I've got another matter that I think we should share with the Committee when you are finished with this topic   While we've been having this meeting, Bankers Trust Company put out a press release in which they reported that they filed a Form 10K this afternoon estimating that they would be reporting an after-tax loss of approximately $125 million for the first quarter of 1995 The estimated loss does not take into account a possible charge in connection with the corporation's expense reduction program Charlie Sanford is quoted as saying, "The firm's strong capital reserve position and the high quality and very liquid nature of our balance sheet together with the expense reduction program now underway will sustain Bankers Trust through this difficult period" This is not a direct FOMC matter, but I think the markets probably will be somewhat concerned about a major money center bank reporting a loss To the best of our knowledge, that is not true of any other money center banks located in this city   That's correct The $125 million is their estimate of their operating loss for the quarter It is meant to convey the notion that they may very well take a charge related to their expense reduction program, but they don't estimate the amount of that   So move   Thank you, Mr Chairman Ernie Patrikis, who has been serving in that position, has been elected with the approval of the Board of Governors to the position of First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, effective June 1 His successor as the General Counsel of the New York Bank and the person we recommend as Deputy General Counsel of the FOMC is Thomas Baxter Mr Baxter is 40 years old, even younger than most of us, and a graduate of Georgetown University His specialty has been litigation We consider him an outstanding attorney and a very fine person, and we are proud to recommend him to you   So move   Yes, Mr Chairman I think that a very basic issue that exists even in light of the very changed international financial markets is whether an individual country is responsible for its own conduct, including paying the price for its own mistakes The debates that were very difficult on occasion in the Mexican situation were those where some of our normal allies questioned whether we were forgiving Mexico excessively for policy errors We took the view, as you know, that Mexico was unique, not just unusual, and that there was very serious systemic risk involved That was not the easiest case to make as Alan Blinder and I discovered at the January and February BIS Sunday night dinners and Mike Kelley at the March dinner Having been the permanent feature from the Federal Reserve at all three meetings, I got to get my head bloodied at all three!  I think one of the difficult questions in moving toward elaborate discussions of the IMF becoming the lender of last resort, which I think is a terrible idea as you do, and even whether we should modify significantly the swap lines and the other central bank relationships that exist from the Bretton Woods era is just that basic question Is it the responsibility of each country, including our own, to manage its affairs in such a way that the market does not turn and punish it severely? The main thing that the speed and size of capital flows have changed is that the punishment is very quick and very severe It's not all that different; it's just faster and deeper There is great reluctance on the part of leading central banks in Europe and Japan, and I think by and large those of us around the table here, to think that we should shift to a world in which everybody can misbehave and the world will take care of them The world doesn't have the riches or the resources to make that possible I think we have to be careful, including in meetings like the Halifax Summit, not to be moving in this excessively and unrealistically permissive direction  The Federal Reserve, it seems to me, has been handling brilliantly the very difficult balancing act involved in being supportive of US policy on Mexico, which we thought was basically a good idea at least in substance--I say that as a compliment to you, Mr Chairman, because you had to do most of it--without getting confused that it should be translated into something that is much more broadly applicable That policy was to consider the Mexican case unique, which was very difficult for us to do because the next deserving case in the view of many people was Argentina One could argue that the Argentines have had better policy and that they are taking much more aggressive actions to fix themselves And therefore it was tough for us to say that we thought Mexico needed support, including support from the Federal Reserve, but that we did not think Argentina needed our support I think the single best argument that we had is that Mexico is unique If it isn't, if it's only unusual, God knows where you decide the line gets established   So move   That was with my President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York hat on That's why I chuckled   So move   So move   Mr Chairman, the Second District economy, which has been flat for about the last six months, had a little positive flurry, mainly in New York State, in February with retail sales and employment up a bit However, the continuing announcement of shrinkage by major employers, the difficulties on Wall Street, and certain base closings would lead one to believe that for the rest of the year the economy in the District is likely to be flat  Regarding the national economy, we, like everybody else, are uncertain as to where the economy is going--whether it has slowed enough to sustain a reasonable level of growth and progress toward price stability On the positive side, we have consumer spending moderating, retail sales down, auto sales down, a little fall in the Michigan index of consumer sentiment, housing starts declining substantially, exports to Mexico and Latin America decreasing, and wage growth continuing to be moderate indeed On the other hand, one has to look at the fact that in recent years we have had a pattern of a first-quarter slowdown followed by a strong rebound, and none of us can be certain that that won't happen again Employment growth is still quite strong The stock market is very strong indeed and the long bond rates have declined Capacity utilization is still above 85 percent and employment below 5-1/2 percent CPI inflation has crept up in recent months  Regarding any differences with the Greenbook forecast, we do have differences that are somewhat troubling in that we have the real GDP growth rate slightly higher in 1995 and somewhat lower, down to about 2 percent, in 1996 But the unemployment rate is still low, and we are less sanguine about wage pressures Consequently, we have the CPI up 34 percent fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter in 1995 and up 37 percent in 1996 In the financial markets, the strong stock market and the strong bond market would seem to reflect the notion in these markets that we have in fact achieved the soft landing, which none of us is quite sure is true, and that the Fed is about to declare formal victory, given the number of comments by some members of the Committee about having raised interest rates high enough I think the financial markets may have it right, but if they don't, they have it wrong by being euphoric on the top side If in fact we get a rebound in the economy or any continued pickup in inflation, I think the Federal Reserve would have to tighten even further because of this attitude in financial markets, and perhaps in part because we have contributed to this attitude in those markets So in my view this is very clearly a time for us to be attentive to what's happening in the economy but perhaps attentive in the sense of looking for a demonstration of price stability from the economy rather than looking hopefully for an indication that we already have been successful It seems to me it is too early for that   Don, am I right in thinking that one of the messages from your very interesting presentation is that we may have reached a point at which quarter point changes in the funds rates would be appropriate again? When we were going through the tightening exercise, we went 25, 25, 25, then a couple of 50s, then 75, then 50 If we are as balanced as you say we are, and based on your presentation, would you not feel that 25 basis point moves are quite appropriate now?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I find myself in the awkward position of advocating asymmetry as a signaling device, having spoken against the use of asymmetry for that purpose a number of times in the past But at this particular time--although there is no question in my mind that "B" is correct, ie, that we should not change interest rates at this meeting--to the degree we  -43-    3/28/95  believe that our primary responsibility is price stability, I think the inflation forecast that most of us have discussed is such that we should be on record the Friday after the next meeting as having indicated a concern about the trend in prices even though the use of our directive for that purpose is a somewhat puny weapon I think the fact that those minutes would indicate that the Committee had decided to maintain interest rates but had decided on an asymmetric directive toward tightening would have a reasonable amount of merit in enhancing our position as understanding our responsibility for price stability Therefore, while it is hard for me to throw my Celtic enthusiasm fully into the ring for something that I usually think is not terribly important, I do feel rather strongly that an asymmetric directive is preferable   Move approval   Move approval   Move approval of the $10 billion limit  SPEAKER(?) Second   Mr Chairman, the Second District economy remains fairly flat On balance, the data indicate that the rate of job layoffs is slowing, but job creations and new business incorporations have yet to show any kind of a typical post-recession surge in growth In April, the unemployment rate rose to 68 percent in New York and 63 percent in New Jersey Preliminary reports suggest that April retail sales were up only 3 to 5 percent on a year- over-year basis despite the favorable timing of Easter, and merchants reported widespread disappointment with such growth Everything seems to be for sale in the greater New York area The realtors in the metropolitan area reported that existing home sales fell about 10 percent below year-ago levels in the first quarter and that prices were comparably weak In the same period, vacancy rates for prime commercial office space rose throughout the greater New York City metropolitan area, largely as a result of ongoing corporate restructurings The boost to business confidence that we had hoped would come from the change of government in New York State is not materializing The new governor has been completely tied up in knots by the opposition party, which has the majority in the General Assembly in New York State He is giving up a great deal in order to reach an agreement on a state budget that is still in the "hoped for" stage  At the national level, we have moved to such proximity to the Greenbook forecast that the closest we can get to a disagreement would have to be described as a rounding error But we are looking, as I think everybody is, at what developments would point to weakness and what would point to strength in this rather difficult forecasting period Obviously, the factors pointing to weakness affect mainly the interest-sensitive sectors, with consumer durables weak, especially automobiles, and housing starts down On the other hand, two of the major channels of monetary policy point to strength The stock market is near record highs; bond prices are up; higher household wealth and net worth of firms bode well for spending by households and firms; and the declines in long-bond rates have a very positive effect on fixed mortgage rates Those rates are at about 7-3/4 percent, only 3/4 percentage point above the levels in 1993 So, I think one might anticipate some bounceback in housing There is a little evidence in that direction, with starts flat in April and the Mortgage Bankers Association survey of applications for purchase up 18 percent in the week of May 12  Our bottom line is that there is substantial uncertainty about the forecast so that an open mind is very much indicated We think that the likely risk to the forecast is that growth will be somewhat stronger than both our own forecast and that in the Greenbook, although we don't completely dismiss the notion that Al Broaddus suggested that the consumer could get spooked by present weakness and lose confidence The place where we are still a bit distant from the Greenbook forecast is on inflation You may recall that at the last meeting we had inflation up to 38 percent in 1996 We have now modified that forecast to 36 percent So, we are appreciably less optimistic than the Greenbook, which has the inflation rate at 3 percent by the end of 1996 There is no reason to say that the Greenbook is necessarily wrong, but perhaps heartened by the fact that we caught the increase in the spending level in the  -15-    5/23/95  early part of this year we are emboldened to think that perhaps our forecast of 36 percent might be more likely After all, if the Chicago Cubs can be in first place this late in the baseball season, anything can happen! [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation for "B" symmetric I think that the last time we were, somewhat appropriately, more concerned about inflation than we need be now, even though I think we must stay alert And therefore the "B" symmetric resolution is the appropriate one   As long as they are the same   Yes   Wouldn't we just have a change of assets on the balance sheet?   But on the Cleveland bank's account their share of SDRs goes up and another asset goes down, right?   That's what happens to Cleveland's balance sheet   So ceteris paribus, the total on Cleveland's balance sheet stays the same? SDRs go up and Treasury securities go down   Correct   It's an acquisition of an asset, not a swap   So move   I can, if you don't have another volunteer   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy of the Second District remains weak, but earnings in the key financial sector appear to be on the rebound That bodes well for the financial industry itself, for the service sectors which support it, and for needed tax revenues in New York City and the states of New York and New Jersey Sales of existing homes are down from 1994 but are less weak recently than in the first quarter; they are now down about 5 percent as compared with 10 percent in earlier months In the most recent month, permits fell 10 percent in New York and 14 percent in New Jersey, year over year Payroll employment in May fell 12 percent in New York, reflecting cutbacks in local governments, and payroll employment was flat in New Jersey Retail sales in May are up 2 to 11 percent over last year depending on the region, and they seem to be snapping back from disappointing sales in early spring  On the national level, we see the economy working through the present weakness and growing stronger in the second half, entering  -13-    7/5-6/95  1996 at about a 2-1/2 percent annual growth rate and achieving a 2-3/4 percent growth rate in 1996, Q4 to Q4 We see CPI inflation somewhat more pessimistically than the Greenbook at 3-1/4 percent in 1995 and inching up to about 3-1/2 percent in 1996 You will recall that traditionally we are rather bearish in our view of price trends Not surprisingly given the foregoing, we see the unemployment rate reaching 6 percent this year and dropping back to about 5-3/4 percent toward the end of 1996  Looking only at the domestic economy, I believe that the risks to our forecast and the risks to the Greenbook forecast are rather well balanced However, I am very concerned about the possible dangers from what may be at least somewhat greater than projected economic weakness abroad to considerably worse than that I do not say that the international part of the Greenbook is lacking in its usual realism, but rather that the risks are mainly negative  In the last several months I, like many of you, have had an unusual number of Japanese visitors including  They would be less optimistic than Karen Johnson on the growth of the Japanese economy in the next year and a half Manufacturers must invest in capacity outside Japan to be competitive in world goods markets, leaving real and disguised unemployment behind in a country that is not accustomed to handling that problem We believe the Japanese price data are distorted on the up side, and therefore there may be price deflation in the neighborhood of 2 to 4 percent With few exceptions institutions in the financial services sector--banks, securities firms, and especially life insurance companies--have been severely weakened by operating losses and bad debts Land prices fell 20 percent in 1994, and I agree with Karen that the land prices are likely to drop another 10 percent or so this year, at least that is how I interpreted the graph The paper profits of many firms are largely gone at a Nikkei level of 14,000, which we are relatively near, and at 12,000 they disappear altogether The Bank of Japan finds itself in the trap of low nominal and high real interest rates Monetary policy is tight, A series of fiscal packages has been inadequate to provide needed stimulus In the confused political situation, career bureaucrats have both more power and more fear of using it A downward spiral of the real economy and the associated declines in financial--especially equity--markets are possible and could have a serious negative effect on world markets both directly and through generalized investor concerns  In Europe a not very robust recovery suffers from two possible threats to European unity, which is the underpinning of recovery in many European countries Those two threats, it seems to me, are the growing awareness of the difficulties of monetary union and the possibility that an even worse conflict in former Yugloslavia could separate the major European powers based on traditional and conflicting friendships with the various protagonists  -14-    7/5-6/95  The jury clearly is still out and the verdict uncertain on the three major economies of Latin America--Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil Positive verdicts are largely reflected in financial markets I was in Brazil at the end of last week and met with the President, his economic team, and leaders of the private financial sector Ongoing success of Brazil's Real Plan depends on superb financial management and near magic in working constitutional reforms in the fiscal area through a divided Congress Among other things, the members of Congress from the various states have to agree to reduce the automatic division of tax revenues to those states, an act of considerable political courage Any problem in Brazil would almost certainly mean further backsliding on their trade opening-- particularly their Mercosur arrangements with their two small neighbors and, of special interest to us, with Argentina And absolutely key to Argentina's ongoing success is market belief that Argentina will benefit from exports to the much larger Brazilian market Private-sector investment, both domestic and foreign, is based on that assumption, and the future of Mr Cavallo's convertibility plan in turn depends on private investment Now, these foreign risks may remain risks and not realities, and let us fervently hope that is the case However, the existence of these risks is of particular concern as our domestic economy passes through the present adjustment process when it is especially sensitive to shocks Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I agree that it would be ill-advised to change the M2 range at this stage, especially in light of the possibility, as you postulated, that we might ease monetary policy You would spend an hour and a half of your Humphrey- Hawkins testimony explaining the changes in something that we don't take seriously The risk of the body politic thinking, thanks to the press, that the central bank had decided to undertake a major softening of monetary policy would be very high, and I think it would be very unwise to take that risk So, I agree very much that we should keep M2 where it is, and that would be alternative 1 for both 1995 and 1996   Are we returning to the ranges and the vote on them?   There was a big majority in favor of 2 to 6 percent  CHAIMAN GREENSPAN That was my impression I think nearly everyone was more comfortable with that higher range So, let us vote on 2 to 6 percent for both years   Mr Chairman, policy changes should not be based on reaction to present data, but rather on our views of the economy and prices about 18 months from now I say that because if we were dealing only with a response to recent data I would want to keep policy unchanged because I don't like the price numbers that we have seen thus far this year But based on a view toward the future, I do think that the real,federal funds rate is too high It is higher than it either should be or needs to be and thus we should ease The question therefore becomes when and how much Especially because of my very great concern about possible shocks from weakness abroad, I think the time is now From what we know now and not giving credit for fiscal restraint until the appropriations bills are passed and  -67-    7/5-6/95  signed by the President, I believe that the likely total easing requirement is 50 basis points I think a single 50 basis point move now would be very likely to destabilize financial markets and lead to a concern that we know much more than we really do, or fear more than we really should, about a likely recession That would disturb markets greatly, and I agree with Governor Lindsey on the likelihood that it would disturb the dollar/yen relationship and disturb further the already weak Japanese economy that is a source of great worry to quite a number of us So, I think the downside risks that many of us discussed could become downside realities as a result of a 50 basis point move now  But I think we also have another reason to be concerned that our fears about downside risks could become downside realities, and that would be if leaks were to come from this meeting that would reveal our very considerable discussion of downside risks We are in a particularly delicate period of the business cycle We are also in a very delicate period for financial markets, and I think we have to show an unusual amount of discipline and restraint about what we have to say for ourselves Ideally, it would be very nice if all of us were to maintain a stoic silence until the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony when he could lay out a very balanced presentation of what the Committee really thinks Therefore, I support the 25 basis point asymmetric proposal   So moved   So moved   So moved   Thank you, Mr Chairman The recently released data show no clear-cut trend in the Second District's economy In the real estate sector, our contacts reported declines in existing home sales and home prices in the Greater New York City metropolitan area in July and August to date In June, permits for construction of single-family houses in the District fell below year-ago levels for the fourth consecutive month Unemployment rates rose in both New York and New Jersey in July, but the payroll reports were mixed New Jersey reported moderate, broad-based job growth while New York reported a contraction reflecting a decline in    8/22/95  government employment On the more positive side, tax collection data suggested some underlying strength in personal income and retail sales  The considerable concern and pessimism regarding the international situation that I mentioned at the last Committee meeting has been lessened but only a little It has been lessened slightly because the Japanese have made some rather modest steps to encourage economic growth and a more rational flow of capital from their financial institutions Much more needs to be done, however European growth is weak as demonstrated especially by recent German data In our own hemisphere, the major countries--Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Canada--are working through very difficult macro- economic situations, and that is likely to continue So, we need to continue to look at the United States domestic economy against the background of a rather weak international environment  I view the movements in exchange rates since our last meeting as positive in that the dollar was weaker than it needed to be to make the United States a very formidable exporter, and the strength of the Japanese yen was a major source of concern, then and now, about the basic financial stability of that country, especially its banking sector But I think the present exchange rate levels, given the current fundamentals, are more rational and more likely to lead to economic growth in Japan and Germany And as I said earlier, I believe the United States dollar is still at a level that makes us quite attractive I think that all or most of these exchange rate moves would have happened if we had not intervened As Peter Fisher and others have suggested, the success of the intervention had a great deal to do with the fact that the market was moving in that direction anyway You never know whether all of this would have happened if we had just stayed home and relaxed, but it is important that we not get confused into thinking that we can have exchange rates where we would like them to be rather than where market forces say they will be I certainly support the Chairman's wish to have everybody decide that it is nice that we were successful; we were lucky three times; and now let's cool it  Domestically, we think, as all of you have suggested, that the economy is bouncing back very much along the lines that we and others have been forecasting for the last several months We think the downside risk has been reduced considerably and that the risks to the forecast are now rather well balanced Signs of strength Single-family housing starts are up 11 percent in May and June; nonauto retail sales are strong; consumer confidence is strong; and the stock market is quite robust On the other hand, auto sales are weak and, as has been suggested, could continue to have an adverse effect on the economy in the fourth quarter Employment is growing but not very strongly Our forecast and the Greenbook's are very similar in terms of real GDP and the unemployment rate We are slightly less sanguine on inflation but just slightly less We had been considerably more concerned or at least we had a higher forecast of inflation than did the Greenbook until now; we have been revising our inflation forecast down I think it's easy to get confused about how much better the price data look because used car prices early in the year pushed core inflation higher than it should have been and are now making core inflation look a little too good If you take car  -24-    8/22/95  prices out of core inflation, it slows from around 3-1/2 percent in the first quarter to about 3 percent in July   Prices for both I really applaud the approach of the Greenbook I think we have to be careful, especially in New York, not to fight the tape and to accept the fact that price performance is in fact better than we had thought it would be On the other hand, it's a little early to declare victory, and therefore I applaud the decision of the authors of the Greenbook not to say that the NAIRU is coming down from the 59 percent level I think it would be very nice if we could conclude sometime in the future that that has happened, but I believe it is smart not to reach that conclusion quite yet Thank you   As do I, Mr Chairman   Maybe I could expand on this a little, Mr Chairman   He was dealing in cash government securities and making up the losses by taking securities out of the custody account He was in charge of the custody section of the Daiwa branch in New York and also was allowed to trade in government securities   Yes His confession, which was written in mid-July when he paid a visit to Japan, indicates that he falsified the records, managed to set up a separate clearing account on his trading as compared with that of others, and suffered capital losses of about $850 million and losses of about another $250 million in interest that is now owed to the people who actually have rightful ownership of the securities that he sold over these many years The facts are going to demand a good deal of time by our examiners and the US Attorney As Ted suggested, the tale as we know it as of now has certain apocryphal characteristics that I think are going to demand a    9/26/95  good deal of looking into One of our principal concerns is that he confessed to the authorities of his bank in Japan in the middle of July and the Reserve Bank was not informed According to the Daiwa Bank, the MOF and BOJ were not informed until Monday of last week As all of you would immediately agree, we do not take kindly to the management of a bank that has this information and doesn't share it with regulators for two months I think our kindness toward the Daiwa Bank will be somewhat less than  You will be happy to hear that the president and the chairman are going to take a 30 percent salary cut for six months  SPEAKER(?) Does their chairman earn several billion a year?   No The confession is really extraordinary It would lend itself to a great soap opera He suffered losses that were small initially He wanted to hide them because of the disgrace that it would bring to the bank The pressure was so great that he went through a divorce The confession implies that he made a mistake and that he got in deeper and deeper and deeper   No The confession does not lend itself to an interpretation of personal greed Obviously, that's one of the things we have to look into   He certainly was in a position to do so because he was in effect running a separate bank that nobody, according to the confession, but himself knew about Therefore, he certainly was in a position to siphon off funds for his own benefit very easily   At this stage, we're assuming that that could be the motive; we're assuming that he could have accomplices; we're assuming all kinds of things over and above that which this confession would lead one to believe   The answer is, I don't think so but--   I think the ability of somebody who was as successful as this guy was at fraud--a lot more successful than he appears to have been as a securities trader--   According to the confession, he managed to lose money whichever way the market went [Laughter] I think that a very successful dealer/operator of a fraud could go on for a very extended period of time and never be caught   In three examinations that were done by the New York Bank on the Daiwa branch, the constant theme was that the audit controls were not adequate We actually got them to improve the audit controls very considerably Just an interesting anecdote They had two locations, one in the World Trade Center and one in Rockefeller Center According to their permissions from both the MOF and the State Banking Superintendent of New York, they were supposed to be doing the government securities trading only from the midtown branch Mr Iguchi, the culprit, was at the downtown branch When we did the inspection in 1992, they took all the dealers from the downtown branch to the midtown branch, turned out all the lights in the downtown trading room, put a bunch of boxes in it, and told our examiners that it was a storeroom   It's a little difficult to believe that nobody had a clue as to what this guy was up to when that sort of thing was going on   He has been fired as of the 25th of September Officially, we do not know where he is, but we are reasonably certain he is in the hands of the US Attorney   Mr Chairman, broad measures of employment suggest that economic growth ticked up in recent weeks in the Second District If, however, as President McTeer suggested, our two Districts are the weak Districts, I'd like to merge immediately In August, payroll employment rose at an annual rate of 2 percent in New Jersey and 07 percent in New York Mergers, closures, and layoffs continue to monopolize the headlines and to affect confidence adversely In fact, new business formations continue to exceed closures and the number of firms increased by about 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter in New Jersey and about 1/2 percent in New York That suggests support for a slow-to-moderate expansion in regional employment and renewed confidence among regional businessmen On the other hand, consumer demand appears to have weakened Our contacts reported that existing home sales in August were 10 to 15 percent below a year ago while permits for new home construction declined significantly Senior loan officers reported a marked deterioration in consumer loan demand, and our retail contacts reported disappointing August sales The newspapers are full of clothing  -24-    9/26/95  advertisements The decline in August tax collections tended to confirm our survey results  On the national level, assuming an unchanged policy, our forecast agrees so closely with that of the Greenbook that our slightly higher forecast of CPI inflation next year--31 percent as compared to 29 percent--has little significance and is more in the category of a rounding error We do believe, however, that the risks to the forecast are somewhat slanted to the down side, in part because the remaining level of manufacturing inventories seems to be higher than desired by manufacturers We also wonder whether business fixed investment could be somewhat weaker in 1996 and 1997 because of some recent weakness in sales of durable goods We are not so concerned about this downside risk that we think it requires immediate action on monetary policy, but we do think that the risks we had deemed to be about balanced are now noticeably shifted to the down side Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support both your conclusion and the reasons that you gave for it   Mr Chairman, I think the single most important thing about the bill as proposed is probably that it repeals Humphrey-Hawkins I, like Governor Kelley, am very opposed to having statutes on the books that we are supposed to be following and that we cannot follow I think that maintaining such legislation creates something of a contempt for law in society, which is very counterproductive I believe that long-term price stability is the  -48-    9/26/95  appropriate goal of monetary policy But monetary policy with long- term price stability as a goal is really a means to achieve an end, which is maximum sustained economic growth and maximum creation of employment I know that I have on occasion caused some eyes to cloud over when I have expressed the view that the reasons for that are at least as strongly social and political as they are economic I think a democratic society is not stable by its very nature, but rather that it can be made stable if the people in the country feel that they really have a reasonable opportunity for a better life ahead We need sustained economic growth to do that Therefore, price stability is a wonderful thing, but as a means to an end, not an end in itself  It follows that I do not have any particular interest in associating myself, nor do I think we should associate the Federal Reserve, with the hair-shirt school of price stability--namely, that price stability is such a wonderful thing that we should achieve it at whatever the cost to society I share President Jordan's concern about some of the nonsense that one could hear at committee hearings from people who do believe that, and I would be worried about the effect that they could have on the general societal view of what monetary policy is all about, since I think that would get the more exciting headlines I think that the best legislation would say that the goal is to achieve price stability and would leave the definition of price stability up to the central bank It would not ask the central bank to define price stability numerically from time to time I think we would have great difficulty in doing that in a reasonable way and still have the flexibility that we need to deal with the business cycle and with external shocks It also would create an absolute zoo for the people who are of the hair-shirt school to appear not just once while the bill was being considered, but semiannually It is likely that after the Chairman concluded his testimony, he would be followed by a group of learned types whose opinions on whether their view of the numerical goal for inflation was better than our view of the numerical goal would be given almost equal weight at least by some members of the Banking committees I think that would be a terrible contribution to public policy  So, I am in favor of the bill, but I would like the bill to make it even more clear, although it does make it reasonably clear, that price stability is a means to an end I don't like the requirement that the Federal Reserve establish moving numerical goals for the level of prices I also would want to improve the language to make it clear that the Federal Reserve does include twelve Federal Reserve Banks and that the boards of those Banks have a role to play in the formulation of monetary policy   I have the view that these arrangements have long outlived their usefulness I have been in Peter's position and largely have argued that we may as well renew them because not doing so would be a newsworthy event Each year there usually was something happening so that we didn't want that newsworthy event to occur It would seem to me that, without    11/15/95  mandating that a year from now Peter and Ted come back with a proposal not to renew the swap lines, we should become reasonably active in an effort to work out a more meaningful alternative that probably would include ending the swap lines Whether or not one needs to substitute for them some notion of how we would cope at a time of some real liquidity need, I think terminating the swap arrangements would be a step very much in the right direction   I don't think that we would need even an informal agreement, as our discussions with the Bank of Japan have suggested If a need comes along and we have the kinds of relationships that we now enjoy with the other central banks, at that time we can sit down and figure out what if anything has to be done If the approval of the FOMC were needed, we would ask for it I think I would prefer that approach   I think the question has two aspects, Mr Chairman One is the purely practical view of people whose expertise is in markets, as mine used to be, as to what is the best thing to do to maintain an orderly market in the event of a default I am in complete agreement with Peter's and Sandy's and Don's view that the best thing to do is to take these in repo operations because that would maintain their status as securities and keep them alive That's by far the best thing to do Then you can get into a question of high purpose Is it in the best interest of the central bank to do it? That's the second question I happen to agree with Peter on that one, too This is one case where pure pragmatism says we should do what they suggest, and I think high principle leads us to the same conclusion But we don't even need to get into the high principle Pure pragmatism is such an absolute no- brainer that that's what we ought to do in any event   Thank you, Mr Chairman The private sector economy of the Second District grew moderately in recent weeks In September, private payroll employment rose at an annual rate of 12 percent in New York and 09 percent in New Jersey In October, the unemployment rate fell from 68 to 63 percent in New York State and was unchanged at 58 percent in New Jersey Loan officers are reporting that demand for most types of consumer and nonresidential loans at small and medium-sized banks was higher than it was two months ago Consumer confidence also improved in October, rising 12 points in the mid-Atlantic states That still leaves the index at the lowest level of the nine regions reported by the Conference Board Consistent with that low level of confidence, the levels of retail sales and existing home sales have fallen sharply over the last four to six weeks The major problem in the District continues to be the lack of business confidence in the economic climate, which stems especially from the attitude of government in the city and state of New York The problem, I think, is actually getting more severe We had a seminar last week co-sponsored with the Academy of Sciences on regional economic development in the tri-state area New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey It provided an opportunity for the private and public sectors to talk to each other, which they don't do as often as one might like Rather dramatic were the two senior businessmen who spoke, the CEOs of American International Group and Pfizer, both of whom are board members of the Reserve Bank They talked about why it would make sense to reduce substantially the number of employees in New York City The following morning the Mayor was talking about how he was trying to improve the business climate in New York City, and I suggested to him that he better increase his  -35-    11/15/95  pace We actually put him together with the two business executives at a meeting yesterday  On the national level, we have been concerned, as all of you have, about the explanation for the rather benign performance of inflation in the last couple of years Rick Mishkin and the staff have been pulling apart everything that they can think of that would be normal causes both on the demand-pull and cost-push sides of inflation Essentially, the only thing we can find that is not performing pretty much as it has over the last 10 years or so is labor compensation, which is considerably lower than any model results based on performance before the last couple of years I think the only problem is that nobody, including us, is very certain of exactly why that benign inflation has been happening There are various bits of psychology, sociology, and political science that people are attributing to it But I think the real fact is that nobody knows or is absolutely sure why it is happening Therefore, it is rather risky to predict that it will continue to happen On the other hand, we don't know whether that is certain, either It makes us rather concerned about our forecast in general The reason we have been so anxious to try to figure this out is that the Bank has been very good in its growth forecast over the last couple of years and until very recently was overestimating CPI growth Now we know why we were overestimating it, but that does not give a pure sign of where to go in the future  We do, however, find ourselves unusually at variance with the Greenbook, not on the CPI forecast where we were bickering with them a year ago but rather on real growth For example, in looking at real GDP based on current policy, whereas the Greenbook has 2-1/2 percent growth in 1996, we have 21 percent For 1997 the Greenbook has 23 percent; we have 19 percent There are three major sources of this difference We find the expansion rather long-in-the-tooth, and therefore we are less confident about the growth of business fixed investment than the Greenbook is We are somewhat weaker on net exports, and we are a fair bit weaker on housing For example, the Greenbook has 145 million housing starts for next year; we have 14 million Actually, that makes both the Greenbook and the New York Reserve Bank higher than the consensus We are about equal with the Greenbook on the forecast of the CPI Therefore, we are looking at a situation in which a maintenance of current policy may in fact not be appropriate So, we have been doing some modeling based on what would happen if the funds rate were to drop by 1/4 percentage point sometime late this quarter and by another 1/4 percentage point early next year That gives us a somewhat better mix It does very little to the CPI forecast even though we are not assuming that the current wage restraint will necessarily continue But it does crank up GDP growth by 2 percent from 21 to 23 percent in 1996 and from 19 to 22 percent in 1997, not highly robust growth because we do continue to have the view that monetary policy should be somewhat restrictive to continue to work for stable prices What we are concerned about is whether it is somewhat too restrictive at the present time   It lengthens   I will reverse the trend toward the lack of loquaciousness, whatever that is I am somewhat surprised by the commentary today because I thought one of the things that we managed to do at the February 1994 meeting was to move away from fine-  -51-    11/15/95  tuning the economy from one quarter to the next and toward an anticipatory monetary policy If that's so, we ought to be more worried about what happens a year from now or two years from now than we are about what happens next week, about which we can do nothing Based on my own Bank's view of the economy in late 1996 and 1997, I think the appropriate thing to do today would be to ease At the same time, the confusion created by the very strong third quarter and what it may tell us about the economy going forward is sufficient to move me to the point of being comfortable with doing nothing at this meeting But I am sufficiently convinced of the likelihood that monetary policy is too tight and therefore has to be adjusted that I would prefer an asymmetric directive toward easing It's always difficult for me to get overly excited about symmetry or lack of symmetry, but I think the latter would make more sense in terms of being consistent with an anticipatory monetary policy   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   I move approval of the $3 billion swap line renewal, Mr Chairman   You are our official source on the matter of long-term bond rates! [Laughter]   I move approval of his domestic transactions   This isn't a question, just a comment on the economic situation   Yes The Second District continues to show slow growth essentially across the board Retail sales for the holiday period have been quite weak in New York, although the more    12/19/95  upscale stores like Saks Fifth Avenue have been doing reasonably well, perhaps to some degree because of the considerably higher bonuses from the financial services industry  Our forecast for the national economy is somewhat lower than that of the Greenbook, but the general shape is similar Under present monetary policy we have growth slowing to 22 percent in 1996 and 20 percent in 1997 as compared with 2-1/2 percent for both years in the Greenbook Not surprisingly, inflation is a bit lower in our forecast, 29 percent in 1996 and 28 percent in 1997, with the unemployment rate rising to 59 percent and 62 percent in the two years We have, of course, tried to produce a forecast that has the risks balanced However, I am concerned about a number of factors that I believe slant the risks to the down side In an atmosphere of continuing rationalization and restructurings of business, job security, especially for white-collar workers, could cause concerns that would make consumer spending lower than that in either forecast Second, business fixed investment has held up extraordinarily well; both we and the Greenbook have it slowing down But it is still the primary driver of growth and could be less strong, especially if consumer spending should be somewhat weaker Third, the growth we are assuming in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Europe is not terribly strong But if we are wrong, I think it quite likely that growth will be weaker in those countries and not stronger Because inflation has been lower and we believe it will continue to be lower than we thought it would be when we last adjusted monetary policy in July, we have had an effective real tightening of policy, and in our forecast this phenomenon will continue For a central bank with a goal of price stability, a somewhat firm and firming policy may be a good and desirable thing, especially if you think as I do that an inflation rate of about 3 percent nominal--say, 2 percent real if we take out the bias in the CPI--is too high However, I would prefer that policy not be so tight as to be a source of additional weakness to the real economy, which we consider to be the case now We must be flexible in our policy This year we finished tightening in February and eased slightly in July If growth should turn out to be stronger than we or even the Greenbook suggest, clearly the Committee should evaluate that strength and what it tells us about the future; and if policy has to be adjusted, it should be adjusted However, we generally believe that the approach to an even lower inflation rate should be opportunistic Our policy should be slanted toward fighting inflation if it should move up; but rather than force it down at the excessive expense of real growth, we should be opportunistic in taking advantage of lower inflation when it happens  There is a question whether the present market conditions in either the stock or bond markets should be allowed to inhibit policy Clearly, despite the slight correction yesterday, the stock market by any historical standard is overvalued If one relates it to dividend payout or price earnings ratio or market-to-book, it is considerably overvalued, but it has been considerably overvalued for about three years What one isn't sure of is whether this is a phenomenon that could continue or whether a correction will take place In any event, I don't think that the stock market should drive policy It seems to me that the present level of the bond market, given what we have been able to do and what the market and the economy have been able to do in reducing inflation, is not unrealistic at all    12/19/95  Lastly, as regards the budget debate, it seems to me the best thing we can do is to distance ourselves from the debate I don't believe we should be punishing politicians for what we don't like or rewarding them for what we do like, but rather that monetary policy should follow an independent path In my view, to the degree that we have opportunities to show that that path is independent, we should take advantage of them Thank you, Mr Chairman   Don, without benefit of your very good two pages, which would have saved me a good deal of work last night, I spoke in favor of the opportunistic approach this morning Since we don't agree with the Greenbook, I guess our model would fit in your matrix where you have disinflation pressures and would then move down to the box that indicates a permanent drop in inflation expectations and ergo a reduction in nominal rates that leaves real rates unchanged My question is, is it safe to assume that opportunistic versus deliberate are two different policies without implying that one is necessarily more virtuous than the other?   Just a comment I think you could be equally convinced of the benefits of getting to the low inflation rate but just decide that the price of getting there very quickly is excessive There would be no difference in the goal, in my view, only in the speed at which you are willing to get there and the cost to society that you are willing to incur   Mr Chairman, on the basis of my earlier comments, nobody will be surprised that I think your policy recommendation is right, for the right reasons, and in the right  -41-    12/19/95  amount I don't think we should expect the market to be particularly pleased with our action There is a fair likelihood that the market correction in both stocks and bonds will continue, partially because even though the market is erratic, some will think our move is not as big as they would like it to be But more importantly, we are near the year-end, the markets are relatively thin, and people have some very large gains that they may well decide to realize so that 1995 will look like a good year for them We might also have some additional stock selling shortly after the turn of the year There does seem to be a fair number of investors who have held off selling stocks, or selling bonds for that matter, in the hope that the capital gains tax will be lower effective January 1, 1996 How much of that sentiment there is, nobody knows, but I believe that there is some In my view, it is very important that we not do more than 25 basis points and that we not touch the discount rate because there is sufficient uncertainty that, even though I happen to agree that your hypothesis is likely to turn out to be right, I think we should proceed cautiously While I am very much a member of the opportunistic school for achieving price stability, I am a near- fanatic believer in achieving price stability I think that the 25 basis point move leaves our price stability drive very much intact   Symmetric is fine with me   I move approval   I second that and move a favorable review of the series of dances he briefed us about [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman The anecdotal evidence in the Second District in recent weeks has been very negative, but that is probably more the mindset of the people in the District than anything else The broader economic data have been somewhat more positive recently In the labor markets, private payroll employment rose at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent in December in New York State and was stable in New Jersey The monthly unemployment rate rose in December in both states, but we tend to smooth that rate over a quarterly average On that basis, the unemployment rate in New York State actually declined from 67 to 62 percent from the third to the fourth quarter and was unchanged in New Jersey Consumer spending as reflected in retail sales tax collections rose moderately in December in New York, led by strong gains in New York City Our manufacturing contacts reported that the blizzard had minimal effect on production in the Second District, and that any losses would be quickly made up In fact, our recent survey of manufacturers, some of which are among the nation's largest employers, was quite fascinating The majority of them expect unit sales to increase in 1996, but they say that competition will prevent  -23-    1/30-31/96  them from raising prices Wages are expected to rise 3 to 4 percent, and capital spending will be similar to that of 1995 Their most optimistic view of the world is that they think their exports will be growing in the 5 to 10 percent range, about the same as in 1995  On the national level, assuming that monetary policy remains the same, our forecast is somewhat different from that of the Greenbook We have real GDP somewhat weaker, growing 17 percent in 1996 and dropping off slightly to 16 percent in 1997 We have the unemployment rate going up to 59 percent in 1996 and 62 percent in 1997 We have found the employment picture somewhat confusing, as I think many people have One of the things we have found difficult to explain is that participation rates in the labor force by women and by teenagers of both sexes are holding relatively steady, but the participation rate by adult males has been coming down over the last few years I am not certain that anybody has a very good explanation, but it may be that the 56 percent unemployment rate is suggesting greater tightness in the labor markets than really exists That will be one of our research projects  We have the CPI about the same in 1996 as it came out last year; we have it at 28 percent and dropping off to 27 percent in 1997 Again, we have trouble, as I think most people do, in anticipating exactly what will happen to prices because neither we nor any other countries that seem to provide a relevant comparison have a whole lot of experience with what happens to prices when the CPI is at the 28, 29, 3 percent level We have essentially no experience in estimating the cost of going to price stability, assuming as I do that it is something below 3 percent But if we want to reduce inflation, it would be nice to know what that will cost, rather than saying it is something that warms the cockles of our theological heart That again is a major project that we are looking at Without the knowledge of the cost of lowering inflation further, we are not very content--I am not very content--with our economic forecast A real GDP growth rate of 17 percent this year and 16 percent next year, essentially no gain on price stability, and, we think, a rising unemployment rate do not lead us to believe that the basic assumption of unchanged monetary policy has a whole lot going for it Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, the idea that these ranges are mainly a communications device is what guides me Since the Humphrey-Hawkins report and your testimony no doubt will point out that we do not find the monetary aggregates to be a particularly useful policy tool, adopting Alternative I, II, or III would not result in a strong market reaction or great excitement except perhaps in some corners of the academic community However, at a time when we are still in an easing mode--certainly the last move of the Committee will have been an easing action, whatever we do today--I think using Alternative I would best communicate our long-term goal of price stability So, that alternative is definitely what I prefer If the majority of the Committee were to prefer some other alternative, that is not something about which I would get very excited and I certainly would not object by dissenting But I think Alternative I conveys the message most reliably   I would like to associate myself to an absolute degree with Ed Boehne's remarks I believe that the degree of credibility that we enjoy at the moment has been hard earned, but it is very high I don't know of anybody--even in the  -42-    1/30-31/96  world's capital of cynics, New York City--who really believes that this Committee is not absolutely resolute in the pursuit of price stability I think that, as Ed suggested, we are better off to continue as a Committee performing with deeds, with good solid, sensible, anticipatory monetary policy As for words, I for one have been giving a number of speeches recently to groups like the National Mortgage Bankers in which I state as firmly as I can that my whole view of monetary policy is that price stability is the means by which we achieve sustained economic growth Therefore, I don't really need a change in the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation To me, that legislation is not in fact contradictory It says that we want sustained economic growth and we want price stability I think they are the same goal because sustained economic growth is achieved through price stability By speaking out publicly, one of the things we can do--and it is a role that I have taken on myself--is to confront the traditional anti- price stability group by reversing their argument The reason very sensible people have been against price stability is that they believe it is socially and politically harmful to the poor whom they feel they represent I think they have it absolutely backwards I believe the best thing for the poor in the South Bronx is price stability I have argued that, and believe it or not, some of the people who have been most vocal over time as attackers of price stability sort of begrudgingly tell me that I may have it right  I am very much in favor of a Mack Bill because I think formally establishing price stability as a goal of the Federal Reserve is a major political judgment Major political judgments should be made by Congress with the agreement of the President In my view, it would be very much in the national interest to have the Mack Bill or something very much like the Mack Bill enacted into law So, as an individual and as the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, I have publicly stated that the Mack Bill is a very good idea I am not endorsing all its details; it's too early for that But rather I think that legislation establishing a single goal for the Federal Reserve has great merit That is what the Congress and the President are for, and we would be ill-advised in the meantime, as the Chairman suggested, to preempt that debate and in a way make it unnecessary The whole history of this country is that the Federal Reserve does its job best when we are carrying out what the American people want us to carry out Over time we have brought this issue to a point where the American people as represented in the Congress are really in agreement that price stability is what makes sense We should let that political process take place   Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation of alternative A, symmetric, for the reasons that you gave I also found Jerry Jordan's intervention just now quite convincing as well   I move approval of the domestic operations   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy of the Second District continues to underperform the nation as it lumbers along on its slow growth path Recently, retail contacts reported that February sales rebounded to plan levels following the very disappointing January and the record blizzard Senior loan officers at small- and medium-sized banks reported that demand for nearly all types of loans has strengthened over the last two months, with the largest increase developing in the consumer loan segment Of course, we all know that the consumer loan debt level is a bit higher  -15-    3/26/96  than we might wish In the securities industry, a major investment bank reported a three-fold increase in pretax profits for the fiscal quarter ending in February compared to the same period a year ago, and our market soundings indicate that its competitors also seem to be having a robust quarter The profits in that industry are an important contributor to income growth in New York State Overall, the District's housing industry has remained weak in February and early March, but we have a glimmer of hope in the commercial real estate market, with continued improvement in the vacancy rates in midtown Manhattan We continue to be concerned about the District and why it underperforms the nation We are going to be moving even more of our research capabilities into that area and look forward to having a couple of meetings toward the end of the year one consisting of economists will try to identify the problems and the other of policymakers will discuss what might be done to get the area growing a bit faster  At the national level, our forecast is very similar to that of the Greenbook The Greenbook, as you know, has growth at just about 2 percent in 1997, and we have it somewhat below that Not surprisingly, therefore, our CPI forecast is more attractive, at 28 percent this year and 27 percent in 1997 We have the unemployment rate moving up some, in fact to about 62 percent next year That is to some degree related to our view that the participation rate, especially by adult males, has been unusually low, and there might be some rebound in labor participation that would raise the unemployment rate So, with the favorable data recently on employment, consumer sentiment, auto sales, retail sales, housing starts, and net exports, the major shift that we have made in our forecast is that we think that the risks to the forecast are now quite well balanced At the previous meeting, we were concerned about the risks on the down side and therefore thought that the "insurance" easing, as the Chairman described it at the last meeting, was appropriate Now we think that the forecast looks rather good and that the risks are quite well balanced   Symmetry?   Mr Chairman, I support the "B" symmetric proposal I agree that the most likely forecast is the one that we all agreed on, and I think it also is highly unlikely that it will materialize We will have to adjust one way or the other and stay extremely wary and ready to move in the interim But certainly for now, the "B" symmetric proposal is the right one   So move  SPEAKER(?) So move   Second   Mr Truman expresses his opinion perfectly; he does it with a nod   This may be related to the line of thunderstorms coming from the west and everyone wanting to get out of here   Thank you, Mr Chairman The broad economic indicators suggest that the economy in the Second District grew at a moderate pace in recent weeks, which is an improvement In March, payroll employment advanced at an annual rate of 22 percent in New York and 33 percent in our part of New Jersey Vacancy rates for prime commercial office space continued to inch down in Manhattan and northern New Jersey, reflecting the improvement in office leasings Contract awards for nonresidential construction, primarily additions to and alterations of commercial space, rose sharply in New York compared to year-ago levels The gain in New York was offset slightly by a 1 percent decline in New Jersey In April, retail sales tax collections rose robustly in New York and moderately in New Jersey on a 12-month basis, implying moderate to strong gains in retail sales Similar 12-month gains were reported in April personal income tax collections Inflation moderated The April consumer price index for the New York/northeastern New Jersey region rose just 29 percent on a 12-month basis, following gains of 3 to 3-1/2 percent during the previous 4 months  On the national level, our forecast is rather close to the Greenbook's The differences are that we show less growth in 1997, and we are below the Board staff in our estimate of the CPI increase for 1996 On a Q4/Q4 basis, we have the CPI at 3 percent this year compared with the Greenbook's 34 percent However, we agree on 32 percent in 1997  Our Bank's forecasting record over recent years has been quite good, except that we were slow to recognize the wage restraint that is the main reason for continuing good inflation numbers We, like all of you, are not certain how long that can or will continue But I could have said that a year ago, and the restraint has in fact continued People running businesses still seem to be reluctant to raise prices When we talk to business people, they sound very alarmist about their industry or about the country or the world in general, but I find that they know very little about those subjects All I am really interested in is what they are planning to do with their own businesses When we ask them that question, we are told about very severe price restraint--the inability to pass on rising costs--and the need to rationalize their businesses So, I do not see great risks of the real economy growing above trend In fact, we have strong growth in the first half of this year, especially in the current quarter, and then growth drops slightly below trend in the second half of the year and in 1997 So, I see the risks as balanced by-and-large Despite all that, my anxiety level regarding price trends has begun to gnaw However, I consider the present stance of  -24-    5/21/96  monetary policy to be just about right or so close to it that, to borrow a phrase from Ed Boehne, "watchful waiting" is appropriate In fact, when he mentioned that, I remembered back about four decades to my days as an officer of the deck on a Navy ship where the possibility of a storm encouraged one to increase the state of alert On the other hand, increasing the state of alert did not in turn increase the probability of the storm [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I would like to concentrate on the part of your presentation relating to what we don't know It is clear that we don't fully understand what appear to be some new relationships in the economy affecting the connection between the real economy and the inflation rate And because I think that the present stance of monetary policy is close to being correct, if not absolutely so, I feel that we have the luxury of waiting until our next meeting in early July and I believe we should wait However, we should be careful not to assume--and your remarks did not assume, indeed quite to the contrary--that today's decision to wait until the next meeting has any implication that we will reach the same conclusion at that meeting The next meeting will be a new ballgame In my view, all we are discussing is whether to do something today or wait until the July meeting to consider what we should do I very much believe that we should wait  As regards symmetry and asymmetry, if the incoming data suggest that it would be appropriate for us to move before the next meeting, those data will be sufficiently dramatic that I am sure you would wish to have a conference call But I don't see the need for an asymmetric directive because I think the probability that you would be highly likely or even fairly likely to take action between now and the next meeting is quite low If we were to adopt an asymmetric directive at this meeting, then not move to implement it over the next 6 or 7 weeks and decide for good and sufficient reasons at the July meeting that a change in policy was not appropriate, I think that the minutes of this meeting to be released on the Friday following the July meeting would give a very strange and difficult to interpret message I do not believe such a message would be in our best interest So, I very much believe that we should take alternative "B," and I feel perhaps considerably more strongly than you do, Mr Chairman, that symmetry is appropriate   Mr Chairman, I share Don's ultimate goal, but I do not think that his recommendation is a helpful way to get there I believe that the appropriate goal of monetary policy is price stability and price stability only I further believe that at some stage we have to define price stability and that the best way for people to understand it would be for us to connect it with a number In order to have any notion that that number is something other than what we think we are likely to achieve, given what is going on in the economy at the moment, we have to push it out at least three years And therefore our number for the second year out is an uneasy compromise between what we think is really going to happen in relation to today and what we are seeking to achieve So, two years is too short a period to be useful in achieving an objective, and therefore I think it would be counterproductive to establish such an objective I would much prefer that we have an unfettered debate in July I am  -43-    5/21/96  very much in favor of a debate on the issue of where we think we ought to be going, but I would not complicate that debate with a big row over who has 1998 right or wrong I think that would obfuscate the real issue, which is whether we should agree on price stability as the goal and how we should define price stability So, I am in agreement with where I think you want to go eventually, Don, but I think your specific recommendation is counterproductive   No, I would say that, if we wanted to do this and we had had the debate beforehand, we would say the rest of 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999   Yes, correct   That's right, exactly   You made what I was thinking infinitely more clear Thank you   I would like to state a hypothesis and then ask Peter how he would evaluate it, since he is closer to the foreign exchange market these days than I am It seems to me that one of the reasons that people are writing a lot of options--because that is where profitability is available--is driven by developments in the foreign exchange market The major players now have such an investment in people and systems that they have very heavy fixed costs For example, part of the remuneration that they had deemed to be variable in the past, namely the bonuses, are now becoming more and more sticky We have major foreign banks, mainly in the New York market, who are hiring reasonably pedestrian dealers in all kinds of market instruments but especially foreign exchange and giving them fixed-period contracts with assured bonuses So, the bonus becomes a fixed cost for two or three years When they are in that kind of situation, unless they are willing to absorb operating losses, they have to scramble and look for whatever profit opportunities seem to be available That means that they would have a tendency to develop very large positions, whether it is in derivatives or the cash market So if there is an unexpected move in the market, the likelihood of people scrambling to cover their positions can lead to greater volatility Does that make sense to you, Peter?   I think the hypothesis checks out, but we can go back and do some work on that   I move approval  SPEAKER(?) Second   I would like to refer to Chart 14 relating to the labor markets On labor productivity, which obviously is a key consideration for the forecast, I think the most recent economic data have productivity trailing off even more than this trend line would indicate Indeed, you have productivity improvement in 1997 at 1 percent in the forecast   Is that something that you are concerned about in terms of the possibility that it might be on the high side or is that something that, within the confidence factors for estimating productivity, you are feeling rather confident about?   Mr Chairman, for the last three years I have been reporting on the economy of the Second District in rather dismal terms, and I am now changing from a minor to a major key The Second District economy has been accelerating in recent weeks and the reason is that the District is amazingly dependent both economically and, perhaps more important, psychologically on what is happening in the New York metropolitan area Economic conditions there seem to be very much on an upbeat Payroll employment rose at a rapid clip in May in the District following a pause in April New York State added 16,700 jobs; that is an annualized gain of 26 percent The unemployment rate held steady at 64 percent In New Jersey, employment expanded 23 percent with 6,800 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 61 percent, which is a five-year low The job growth was, not surprisingly, dominated by gains in business and consumer services Manufacturing continues to decline in the District The real estate industry is beginning to pick up But as I said earlier, I think the biggest change is happening in the "feel" of New York City Some changes are in the purely economic area and some are not The City is absolutely booming with tourists That is helped a great deal by the fact that it feels a lot safer, and that feeling is not unrelated to a different approach to policing The police also have been perhaps brilliant, perhaps lucky, perhaps some of each, in solving some very difficult and problematic serial crimes The teachers of the City of New York, about 110,000 in number, who had turned down their labor contract late last year, have now approved it, even though there are no pay increases in the first two years The New York City partnership, which has had a spectacular success in promoting lower-level and middle-level housing in the city over recent years, has announced the creation of what is essentially a start-up venture capital fund of $50 million, and the rather brilliant lady executive who was head of the housing partnership is going to move over to run that Perhaps equally important, the Yankees are having a  -27-    7/2-3/96  great season and last night they scored their second run on a squeeze bunt, which is the baseball equivalent of "chutzpah" The good feeling from New York City seems to be moving out into northern New Jersey and the rest of New York State, and the District as a whole is doing very well  On the national level, our forecast for the rest of this year is virtually equivalent to that of the Greenbook For 1997, we have some difference of opinion It is largely related to my question to Mike Prell concerning what is going to happen to productivity since it has not been showing all the improvement that we have been waiting for My colleagues in New York are inclined to think that it could go in the opposite direction, which would give us weaker growth next year We also have inflation ticking up as the Greenbook does to 30 percent next year Our views are based on models that all of us have to use and that have the quality of thinking that past events are likely to be repeated in the future Intellectually, I think that is probably very sound However, I am having great difficulty trying to reconcile my intuition and my mind  That may be because of my strong reaction to what I think is a very unfortunate debate going on in the country with those who consider price stability as somehow antagonistic to growth The higher the growth, the more we have to worry about price stability in that view Some of us unfortunately have contributed to that debate At the same time, what my intuition is telling me is that, rather like the comments the Chairman made in response to a question by President Minehan, there may in fact be developments on the cost side, on the wage side, and therefore in the future on the price side that we do not fully understand I think it probably would not be a very good idea for us to move policy at a time when the outlook for what we are uniquely responsible for, which is price stability, is questionable both intellectually and practically So, I think we must busy ourselves between now and the next meeting with trying to understand as best we can what if anything new is happening, as you suggested in your remarks, Mr Chairman I know that you are planning to go into that more fully tomorrow, and I look forward to hearing your comments Thank you   Or deliberate moderation   Mr Chairman, I think price stability is a means to an end, and the end is sustained economic growth, which is how I resolve what appears to be the conflict in the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation and the Federal Reserve Act I define price stability exactly the way you do First of all, it is a very good working definition, and secondly, since you are the head of the Federal Reserve, using your definition makes a great deal of sense for all of us If we each have a different definition of price stability, it certainly confuses the body politic Since most of the speeches that I give are on price stability, because I think that is what we ought to be talking about, I would also argue that it has major sociological and therefore political benefits Since most people can understand that more readily than the economic definition of price stability, I think it gets the point across better  As long as you are willing not to put a number on this purely verbal definition of price stability, we in fact have a national consensus on it Therefore, the question is whether it is to anybody's benefit to define it more exactly I am reminded of my days at Holy Cross College studying scholastic philosophy, which had been debating more or less the same major points for seven centuries by the time I came along Some of those points on which absolute truth had not been defined are probably easier to resolve than an exact numerical definition of price stability I am not sure that we are ever going to find the absolute truth here or that the search for this absolute truth is anything other than something that would give the FOMC something to do for the next seven centuries [Laughter] Therefore, why would we want to have anything other than the informal consensus that we have? I think the reason is that an informal consensus is more easily breached than if somehow we could bring about a more formalized national agreement that price stability is the appropriate goal of monetary policy Previously in our history, we had something closer to price stability for a period of 10 or, arguably, 15 years, as noted in the Stockton paper, and that did not keep us from the guns-and-butter decisions of the 1960s and 1970s that ended that period of relatively stable prices It had to be reachieved, assuming we think that we are somewhere close to it now, at enormous expense to the American people  I think the people who should decide that price stability, hopefully as a means to an end, is the appropriate goal of monetary policy are not the people sitting around this table Rather, it should be the American people through their representatives in the Congress We are dealing with pieces of existing legislation that we are defining in a way that makes it possible for us to do our jobs But those pieces of legislation are on the statute books, and it would seem to me that in due course, ie, not in a year divisible by four, it would be a reasonable and appropriate thing for the American people to debate through their elected representatives We could certainly make an active contribution to that debate My guess is that it would  -53-    7/2-3/96  probably be better for the Federal Open Market Committee not to take a position on this issue as an institution I say that because if we said price stability is 2 percent--if we were ever able to agree on that--we might set the Federal Reserve against the people I think that would be a very likely outcome, and in my view it would not be in the interest of the people or this institution  If the people wanted to formalize the idea of price stability as the goal for monetary policy, we are certainly unlikely in the legislative process to get that defined in numerical terms, and probably not even as unspecifically as a range In a public speech, I suggested a range of 1/2 percent to 2 percent largely because of the lack of precision in such a range and also because I believe very strongly that although inflation is bad, deflation is truly terrible Therefore, if in the implementation of price stability we make modest mistakes on the up side, I justify those as an insurance premium against the much greater evils of deflation That's why I wind up pretty much where Janet Yellen did--in the 2 percent area In any event, I believe that the search for absolute truth is not going to get us there I also believe that the true decision on anything more than the working definition, which I think is the working consensus that we have now, is really something of such great importance to our society that it should be the American people who decide that through the normal legislative processes I do not think it is up to us to make what I think would be a rather dramatic and far-reaching interpretation of what the statutes on the books actually mean   I think we need to be at the hotel by 700 pm just to check in and put our bags away  SEVERAL 630 to 645 pm   My view is that we could make a contribution to the societal debate by figuring out what the best inflation measurement is If it is not the CPI, we should decide what we think it is It will not be perfect, but if we can determine what is the best one, then we ought to sell that as the inflation rate people ought to be looking at   Could I follow up on that? If we come to a conclusion as to what we think is the right inflation rate and, going back to Governor Yellen's presentation, it turns out to be a rate where 33 percent of the firms in the country have to force nominal wage reductions, it will not fly The American people will not find it acceptable It will not be something that the central bank can live with over an extended period of time because it is likely that either other people with different views would be taking our seats or our responsibility would be transferred to an institution that the people found more sympathetic So, I think the inflation number that we will find acceptable will never be zero It will be some number above zero, hopefully better measured than it is now I think we also should rely less on our instinctive reactions and seek to quantify better that deflation is truly a bad thing, not just because it sounds bad but because of the very real costs that it imposes on the economy   Sure   Mr Chairman, if we were starting out from scratch I would be in favor of Governor Lindsey's position But we are not starting out from scratch, and as you suggested the message likely to be given by a change in the ranges would be an unfortunate one We also have to live with the other issue that Governor Lindsey very correctly mentioned, which is that we have a statute that we are supposed to be observing Therefore, I think one would assume and hope that, in presenting the ranges, you would repeat something along the lines of your statement in February to make it clear that the aggregates are likely to grow at rates around the upper ends of their ranges Another reason why I would like to retain the current ranges is that a change would be likely to take on an importance far beyond its merit and divert attention from what I hope will be the main message of your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony That message is that price stability is not an enemy of growth The contrary notion is far too much alive in the land, and so it is very important for us to confront that issue head on I would not want anything, including specifically a change in the ranges, to create a diversion and have people focusing on that rather than on the really important issue, which is that price stability is the way that we achieve sustained economic growth and is in no way the enemy of such growth  -73-    7/2-3/96   So move   Mr Chairman, perhaps one of the chores that goes with being Vice Chairman is that after such a very interesting and demanding presentation, one fills the vacuum, giving other people some more time to think [Laughter] Agreeing with Governor Kelley's remark yesterday that we are at a watershed, I found myself sitting up straight at 400 this morning thinking about the responsibility that places on us as a Committee It is very clear that the Federal Open Market Committee cannot carry out its responsibility without the support of the American people whom we serve We deserve that support, which we have, and we will retain it only if we are deemed to be responsible and sensible That is something about which I perhaps feel particularly strongly because I am the only permanent voting member of the Committee who is neither nominated by the President nor approved by the Senate Therefore, I think one has to be very aware that we do serve the people and that we are not members of a university faculty or a discussion group Rather, our purpose is public policy, which is a lot tougher than being on a faculty or a member of a discussion group  We are in a period of very considerable uncertainty as to exactly where the economy is or where we are vis-a-vis price stability My own guess is that we are either at or very close to  -84-    7/2-3/96  what might be the upper end of a price stability range In light of Governor Yellen's presentation yesterday, which explained that there are very real and continuing costs to a reduction of inflation at these very low levels, I believe very strongly that before we do something we should be certain that what we are doing is right Therefore, it should encourage us to be courageous when we need to be courageous but to have the courage to do nothing when that is the right thing to do, which is, I think, where we are now  At the same time, we are clearly in a situation in which the real economy could operate more strongly than the forecast says it will, and therefore I think it is equally important that we use the asymmetric directive For the new members of the Committee, there are three interpretations of what an asymmetric directive means for every member of the Committee, but in this case I think it is clear what it means It means, as the Chairman stated, that it is not at all impossible that we will see enough incoming data of a kind that will lead us to the conclusion that we have to tighten before the next meeting In any event, I think there is a reasonable likelihood that we will decide at the next meeting that we have enough information to warrant a tightening move at that time Therefore, those who share my view that price stability is what we do for a living because it is the road to sustained economic growth have to remember that we are not talking about whether the infidels are replacing the zealots or even whether we are a group of more or less tough-minded people All the Chairman is recommending, which I very firmly endorse, is that we recognize that we do not know enough to make a firm decision at this point, but we do know enough so that our watching has to be particularly attentive Therefore, an asymmetric directive toward firming is appropriate   So move   Mr Chairman, I do not have any prepared remarks, but let me make just a few comments if I may The approach that the Federal Reserve has to foreign central banks is very much a product of the rather unusual structure of the Federal Reserve, with the Board of Governors and the 12 Reserve Banks The Federal Reserve Bank of New York historically has played a particularly important role because we are in the nation's financial center and because we do the intervening in both the domestic and the foreign exchange markets The attitude that foreign central banks have toward the Federal Reserve is, thank heavens, one of great respect They take us immensely seriously, including not only central bankers from small countries that you might think would take us seriously because of our being a superpower, but also those from the other G-10 central banks as well I think one of our strengths is that we respond to people in a flexible and unbureaucratic way For example, some of the G-10 central bank officials deal very actively with staff at the New York Bank and the Board and certainly with you personally, Mr Chairman, and we never get into a mode of telling them that they really ought to be talking with Joe instead of me This approach works very well because we are rather good at keeping everybody else informed The other Reserve Banks, depending on the part of the world involved and to a degree the personality of the staff or the President at any given time, play very important roles as well So, I think that this customer-oriented view of dealing with foreign central banks has great merit and should be continued We should not try to force a method of dealing with the Federal Reserve System on people, but we should just let them deal with us as they have in the past in the context of continued very amicable relationships among the various parts of the Federal Reserve System and especially among the key staff members involved as well as the Board members and Bank presidents  We also, I think, have to be very aware of how the world is changing Historically, our very important relationships have been with the G-10 central banks, basically Europe, Canada, and Japan In addition, we have developed very important relationships with the central banks of our hemisphere, an area in which I particularly get involved because of the historical accident of speaking Spanish very fluently The new area where central bankers are very much interested in us is Asia People from that part of the world have very active relationships with the San Francisco Reserve Bank, especially in the bank supervision area, very active relationships with Board staff, and very active relationships with us in New York  One of the areas that I hope we will concentrate on and eventually resolve, but not today, relates to developments in the repo market When the Committee set up the RP authorization to the Desk, and really the last time it was looked at in great depth was in the 1970s, the government securities market was very different The Committee did not envision in the 1970s that we had to do anything for the central banks around the world in the way of providing liquidity  -97-    7/2-3/96  other than allowing them to take part in the repo pool at the New York Bank For example, at the present time we are somewhat inconvenienced by having $3 billion of while they hold $3 billion of our collateral The funds are sitting in New York as a pool in case  wants to use them to meet the liquidity needs of in our time zone  We cannot deal with them in reverse repos, which would allow us to take their holdings of US government securities and give them money for a day or two, because nobody thought such a financing arrangement was necessary 20 years ago So, the Desk does not have the authority to make reverse repos [with another central bank] Leaving aside for the moment whether it is important in our dealings with foreign central banks to have that capability, I think it is very important from the standpoint of our management of bank reserves and to meet our responsibilities to the US securities market That's because we are in the awkward position that, if at a given point in time we wanted to provide liquidity--not to accommodate their interests but to serve our own--and we wanted to do so on a temporary basis instead of purchasing the securities outright to meet a liquidity need that might last for a couple of days, we would not have the authority to do that I do not think that is in our interest in as complex a government securities market as exists now It is essentially an anachronism  When we look at the foreign central bank aspect to it, the debate on how many angels can fit on the head of a pin is kids' stuff compared with the debate among lawyers, accountants, and economists on whether a reverse repo is a securities transaction or an extension of credit Since good and decent people can argue it is an extension of credit, I think we would have to be very careful in how we use that capability My own view would be that at some point, when we actually make a recommendation, it should include the condition that it would be done only with the previous approval of the Chairman If the Chairman were not available, then it would be done with the previous approval of the Vice Chairman, wearing my hat as Vice Chairman of this Committee but looking at the convenience that I happen to be in New York where the Desk is That, I think, would give us adequate protection against the Desk ever thinking that this was a tool that they would use in the normal course of business Having run the Desk myself, I know that a Manager takes very seriously ringing up the Chairman even via the ever loyal Don Kohn and saying, by the way, I would like to do something that I am supposed to do very infrequently, but now is the time A Manager thinks that through a few times before making that phone call, and I believe that would be appropriate Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I think that has great merit The question is the form Would you want a list or would you want a sense of the Committee concerning what sorts of countries might be on the list?   Yes, and we do not want a leaked list or somebody trying to obtain it through a FOIA request A list cannot be leaked or released if it does not exist My preference would be for us to have a discussion to arrive at a sense of the Committee concerning standards The latter might include the requirements that a country should be highly creditworthy and not be in conflict with the United States of America in some manner I think the Committee could give certain guidelines for the Desk and the Chairman to follow This is not a firm opinion, but my own working hypothesis is that we would be better off to have guidelines rather than a list   Yes, right   If we were to assume a world in which the swap network no longer existed, would any formal mechanism have to be created to replace it? My own working hypothesis on that would be "no" In my view, what would replace it is what in a way already replaces it A good many of us spend a fair amount of our time--I spend essentially 10 percent of my time--attending BIS meetings I don't do that because I like the Basle Hilton, I can assure you, but rather because of the close personal relationships that come from that activity What that means is that if we have a    7/2-3/96  problem with any of the people that the Chairman sees, say, at four meetings a year and I see at ten meetings a year, we are talking with someone we know very well So what replaces the swap network is that personal relationship It does not mean that we do them a favor or they do us a favor What it does is to make it possible for two individuals representing their central banks to agree on what is in the mutual interest of their central banks and more importantly their countries  If we ever got into a situation in which it was necessary to do something, including a reverse repo with, say, Germany, I think none of us would worry about whether there was a political consideration or a creditworthiness consideration Germany is, of course, a very easy example We would do the financial transaction only if it were very clear that it was in the interest of Germany and in the interest of the United States As long as we keep a very close control on it, as has been suggested, then the risk factor is very, very low Now, what that kind of approach to the world requires is a great deal of effort in figuring out which of the central banks of the world are important enough for us to spend the amount of time needed to get to know the people who run them as well as we know some of our best friends in Europe That is a lot of work I think one of the reasons that you, Mr Chairman, wanted to concentrate on the overall aspects of this issue is that the people who work on this a lot like Ted, Peter, and Terry Checki from the New York Bank could perhaps be thinking of taking a look at whether, because of our rather disparate organization, we have missed some obvious candidates I think we were a bit slow in taking the Southeast Asia central banks seriously San Francisco was doing a good job on it; we were a little slow in New York, no question I think Board staff was taking an interest in them But we certainly have stepped up the degree of time and attention that we are spending on those people, I think very appropriately   I would be astounded, since you addressed the question to me, if the duration were more than a few days My main motivation for getting the reverse repo capability for the Desk is that I do not want to deprive us, the FOMC, of a useful tool for our own purposes I am not really motivated by the objective of helping other central banks around the world A problem that sometime arises in our dealings with some of the Southeast Asian banks when they ask if we can do a reverse repo They understand fully the nature of that financial instrument When we say, "No, we can't do those," they think it implies, because a country competitive with us is encouraging them to have that view, that we are not a cooperative central bank It is not that they are saying they want us to do it They are not asking for any kind of an arrangement It is that they are thinking Why in the world would a central bank not be able to do  -110-    7/2-3/96  what would appear to be a completely normal transaction in its own Treasury securities in its own currency when it can do those any day of the week with Salomon Brothers? I have constructed answers to such questions, but in fact it is not very comfortable to have to answer them So, I would like to be able to say that we have that technical capability, but they should not in any way have the view that we intend to use it They have access to all those Street firms that Mike Kelley referred to and they should go and do their business with them All kinds of people are eager to do business with those central banks, and that is where it ought to be done On the other hand, our not having that tool available to us is a product of the fact that in the 1970s, whenever it was, nobody thought we would need it, so we did not get it No one can recall a policy decision on this matter, but rather it appears to have been a case where nobody thought of it as something that might be needed   If I could just add a remark that is probably gratuitous and unnecessary, but I will make it anyway There were many references to the tremendous importance of the upcoming Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, and that testimony is going to be infinitely more meaningful if all of us maintain a very studied silence in the meantime   Move approval   So move    8/20/96   Mr Chairman, I share the view that, since the swap lines are essentially anachronistic, it would have been better if we had had a more receptive response  But certainly your report on our meetings with them is absolutely accurate both in content and tone Since those conversations took place in July, the atmosphere of the European foreign exchange markets and the future of EMU have become a little more troubled and troubling I think that if we were seen to be trying to dismantle the swap network at this rather delicate time, if that house of stone or house of cards should fall, we could be deemed responsible, which would not be in our best interest So, I believe that maintaining silence and assuming that the swap lines are harmless even in the worst of cases is very much in our interest Whereas I was rather hopeful at our last meeting that we could get rid of the swap lines, what has happened in the meantime in addition to our conversations indicates that this is not the right time to dismantle them   I very much agree with that I would hope that the staff could do their work so that we would be in a position to discuss the reverse repos in September As I mentioned at the last meeting, I think the likelihood of our using a reverse repo capability would be very, very low, and we would make sure that there were all kinds of protections against ill-advised use of it But the fact that the Desk is not authorized to use that financing instrument with foreign central banks has taken on a life of its own that I think is a bit of a problem for our relations with some countries, especially in Asia Therefore, our having the power even if we did    8/20/96  not plan to use it, I think, would serve our interests better than our swap lines which are an anachronism The fact is that 20 years ago when the Committee considered the use of RPs with foreign official accounts, nobody thought we would need reverse repos, and that is why the Desk does not have the authority to use them It is not because anybody went through a thoughtful exercise and said, "this is an inappropriate power for the Desk to have"   Exactly, yes   Thank you, Mr Chairman At the last meeting I reported that the Second District economy had been expanding rather rapidly It has continued to expand but at a somewhat slower pace in recent weeks From May to June, the growth of payroll employment decelerated from 21 to 14 percent in New Jersey and from 21 to 01 percent in New York State June unemployment rates were essentially unchanged at 63 percent in New York and 61 percent in New Jersey Our retail trade contacts reported disappointing sales in June and July after a very strong spurt in May  -23-    8/20/96  Growth in permits for the construction of new homes slowed in June, and realtors reported similar softness in existing home sales for the July and early August period after a robust second quarter In contrast, the commercial office market continued to improve Growing demand for office space in the absence of new construction pushed June vacancy rates lower throughout the greater New York metropolitan area  Regional price pressures have remained subdued The 12-month gain in the New York-northeastern New Jersey CPI was just 27 percent in July compared with a 3 percent rise in the national index That continued a 3-year trend of relatively lower regional price inflation  Going forward, we believe that expansion will continue in the District The government restructuring in our District states is slowing this year The drag on job growth from manufacturing continues, but it is less than it was in the past Modest overall job growth continues, and as we look ahead to next year, we think that the government restructuring will slow even further, manufacturing declines will moderate, and we will continue to have strength in business and consumer services So, the District economy looks as if it is beginning to behave better than it has since the 1990-91 recession  We have, however, what may wind up being a rather difficult problem for New York State coming from the welfare reform bill to be signed this week The New York constitution is unique among state constitutions in that it requires that the state provide and I quote, "aid, care, and support of the needy" So, it looks as if some of the effects of the welfare reform bill simply cannot take place in New York State The state is at least as litigious as any other part of the country, and therefore it is almost certain that because the state constitution says the needy have to be taken care of, lawsuits will seek to prevent the state and the cities from making any changes The level of welfare is already higher than that for the nation In New York State, 17 percent of all children receive AFDC That compares to about 14 percent at the national level The maximum benefit in New York City is $577 a month for a family of one adult and two children That compares to $367 as a national average So, we could have a situation in which the already fairly severe fiscal problems of New York State and New York City could be aggravated What one does not know is whether there will be migration caused by changes in welfare The scholarship on the subject says that people do not in fact migrate because of differentials in welfare payments, but we could get into a situation that does not involve a differential as such but rather migration from a state with no welfare payments for a family to New York State, which would be constitutionally required to provide welfare support We do not know exactly what this is going to do to the state's economy As of now, the political leaders of the state seem to be rather quiet on the subject  Turning to the national economy, our forecast is somewhat different from that of the Greenbook on both growth next year and not surprisingly, therefore, the effect on the CPI We have fourth- quarter-to-fourth-quarter real growth slowing to 17 percent in 1997 as compared to the Greenbook's 21 percent We have the overall CPI at 31 percent; the Greenbook has it at 33 percent; and we have core CPI creeping up and touching, although not passing, the 3 percent level in the fourth quarter of 1997 Our forecast is based on an  -24-    8/20/96  assumption that, looking at the employment cost index, there will be a gradual upcreep in wage inflation and that the sharp reduction in the growth of benefits that the economy has been enjoying will at least slow down We have the growth in benefits plateauing, and I think that any model used for a forecast should include such assumptions rather than ones that are more optimistic  The board of directors at the New York Fed, which is a particularly interesting board that includes a very good cross section of strong-minded, bright people, is of the very strongly held view that the forecasting models are missing what they think are two changes affecting the performance of the economy First, with regard to benefits, their very firmly held view is that the rise in benefit costs will continue to drop At most in their view, we will have a respite in which there may be a bit of a slowdown in the reduction of benefit cost increases But they hold very strongly to the view that the managements of firms will have to continue to reduce benefit costs They will do it by pushing those employees who are not yet under managed care onto that health care system and then forcing the providers to rationalize further The net result will be to keep benefit costs dropping Again, we have not assumed that in our forecast, but it is a very firmly held conviction by my board members and one that I have difficulty not sharing  The other thing that they think we are missing relates to the view that if there is some increase in wage costs, at this stage of the business cycle it would not be wise to assume that we would be rescued from its effect by high productivity growth They are very strongly convinced that business simply is not being run in a way that assumes business managers will pass on rising costs by increasing their prices Quite to the contrary, the people running businesses are aware that the only shock absorber is a reduction in profitability Since business executives are not hired by their stockholders to have their firms' profitability squeezed, they are going to work even harder, as in the benefits area, to make sure that their businesses continue to be rationalized Therefore, cost pressures will simply not occur and will not be passed on in inflation If you were to listen to these wise people, you would say that the trend in the inflation rate will in fact continue to be down I do not know if that is likely to be the case I don't think it is certain enough by any means that one should put it into any kind of official forecast But since in our view the present stance of monetary policy is not creating an inflation problem, one would not have to believe any portion of what my board members believe to conclude that rising inflation is not a problem Thank you, Mr Chairman   Yes, I support the proposal   Mr Chairman, I am persuaded by your explanation of what is going on and the situation we find ourselves in, but I am chastened by Don Kohn's presentation of the risk of an excessively slow reaction to a policy requirement I support your proposal I think that a 25 basis point increase in the face of a market expectation of no action would be extremely risky in that it would absolutely assure the market that it would be 25 plus 25 plus God knows when that would end, and this would tank every market that I can think of When we move, it would seem to me that the move should be 50 basis points and that we would try to explain it as a recalibration of monetary policy That is fairly risky in that I am not sure that there would be three people outside this room who would believe it But at least to me it makes more sense than to do 25 and to start what would definitely be interpreted as the installment plan  I think the economy is at that balance point at which--as you suggested, Mr Chairman--a move of policy now with the assumption that we know all kinds of things we really do not know, would be very likely to produce an excessive market reaction, which could very well tilt the economy into much slower growth than is either desirable or appropriate So, recognizing that the risks are on the high side and therefore the directive should be asymmetric, the better judgment now is to maintain the fed funds rate at its present level Therefore, I support your recommendation   Can I make one correction? Earlier in our discussion, I asked Don Kohn and Peter Fisher to come forward with the reverse repo recommendation in September Actually, it makes more sense to do it in November   I believe also that there are a couple of recent events that make one rather more inclined to think that the politicians are taking a fairly sensible line The last time we were together, there was a real question by most observers as to whether the leading countries would allow the Maastrict criteria to be fiddled You may say that this interesting and creative budgetary fix by the French is a bit of a fiddle, but I would note that Chancellor Kohl on the occasion of President Tietmeyer's 65th birthday made a very strong speech in favor of Maastrict and the need to observe its criteria very carefully He was followed by President Chirac who supported him In addition, there was a very significant event last weekend when the Germans took a position that I think is very rational The big risk is not that EMU may not take place; it would appear now that it will The question is what happens after it does The key to that is what Finance Minister Waigel has brought forth It is called a stability pact, and last weekend in Dublin the finance ministers and central bankers met and endorsed this stability pact That is a very significant development They still have to decide whether the punishment for violating the fiscal rules after EMU will be automatic and just how it will work, but the agreement in principle is quite significant   Yes, it raises questions However, before these recent developments, the overwhelming expectation was that if EMU happened, it would be followed by something that simply would not work The whole notion of trying to use monetary unity to create political unity has never succeeded anywhere Now, it looks as if they are doing some things that at least make disaster not as predictable as it seemed to be until recently   That is a very good point   It is an asset sale a la francaise! [Laughter]   I move their approval   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Second District continues to pick up, so the positive developments that I began to record two meetings ago for the District continue Payroll employment in the private sector accelerated in July to annual growth rates of 12 to 15 percent in New York State, New Jersey, and New York City, In August, New Jersey increased its rate of gain to 21 percent The real estate markets also reported renewed vigor Permits for new home construction and contract awards for nonresidential construction rose sharply in July and continued a trend of favorable year-over-year comparisons More recently, New York City and northern New Jersey realtors reported that sales of existing homes rose 8 to 10 percent in August and early September compared to the same period in 1995, and floor traffic, we are told, has remained heavy recently Consumer spending has firmed New York and New Jersey officials reported 5 percent gains in August retail sales tax collections, while New York City reported an 8 percent gain on a year- over-year basis That rate of increase has risen steadily since  -16-    9/24/96  April, with no signs of softness, implying no pause in underlying consumer expenditures over the summer months The securities industry is very healthy; one of the major firms reported a 39 percent gain in pre-tax profits for the third quarter, and we are hearing from the others that they will be reporting very good gains as well In the inflation area, the news is very good, indeed Consumer price inflation in the New York-northeastern New Jersey area was unchanged in August at 27 percent on a 12-month basis That compares to a national gain of 29 percent August is the fifth consecutive month in which the region's rate of inflation has been less than 3 percent  At the national level, we agree with everyone that growth is clearly moderating from the 33 percent first-half pace We share the sense of confusion caused by the divergence between the demand side and the supply side in the incoming data, but taking account of an inventory boost, we think that growth will be around 2 percent for this quarter In comparing our forecast to that in the Greenbook and assuming the present monetary policy, we have real GDP growth slowing next year to 17 percent The Greenbook has it slowing to 21 percent We are slightly more optimistic on inflation We have the core CPI creeping up and just touching 3 percent in the fourth quarter of next year There is no question about the risk of more inflation if the rate of wage inflation continues to move up and the price discipline that we have seen does not persist We have to be concerned about that risk On the other hand, I think we have equal reason to believe that the inability of businesses to increase prices will continue, that the cost of benefits will remain a positive factor in holding down the rise in overall compensation costs, and that wage earners, including those with high-level jobs, will continue to prefer job security rather than wage increases I believe that the conduct of the United Automobile Workers provides very important evidence in that direction For quite a number of months, we have been accepting the risk that these phenomena will persist, that prices will continue to be well behaved because businesses can't raise them, and that wage earners will continue the behavior that they have shown for several years As a result of our accepting that risk, and that is what it is, we have had the wonderful phenomenon of high growth and low inflation That is a combination richly to be desired Thank you   Governor Lindsey has a question   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for a "B" asymmetric directive I believe that was the proper judgment to be made in July; it was the proper judgment in August; and it is the proper judgment now In fact, developments since the last meeting make me even more convinced that this is the correct conclusion So, I support your recommendation because I support the substance  A series of developments not directly in the economic and monetary policy area has transpired since our last meeting Without going into the details, because we are painfully familiar with those developments, I think this is an appropriate time for the leadership of the Federal Reserve, the 7 governors and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents, to support a common judgment as recommended by the Chairman The debate in the earlier part of the meeting was very complete and it certainly gave everybody an opportunity to express his or her views So, at this stage we are able to say that we have heard one another and the Chairman, whose views, I believe, clearly reflect a majority opinion So, this might be a very good time to indicate that the leadership of the Federal Reserve is capable of pulling together In my view, that would be of great immediate benefit to the people who work for us, whose morale certainly has been adversely affected to a serious extent recently I think that it would have considerable merit in the eyes of the American public, whom we ultimately serve, when the minutes of this meeting come out on Friday, November 15 So, for reasons that are easy for me because I agree with the substance, but also for reasons that have to do with a collective responsibility of leadership, I support your position   Can I ask a follow-up question? I assume that whether our deutsche mark portfolio becomes a euro portfolio has to do with what we decide is the key intervention currency   The reason we are in deutsche marks is not because we love deutsche marks It is because it is the right  -43-    9/24/96  intervention currency and therefore we sold our relatively small holdings of French francs, Swiss francs, pound sterling, and so on and put it all in deutsche marks If we came to the conclusion over time that we would do all our intervention in euros, we should be completely in euros Peter brought to the Committee the view that we will need euros but that we may also need some other currencies because parts of Europe may decide not to join the common currency That would be a different matter, and we do not know how that will work out   I was going to move approval   I move approval, Mr Chairman   Raising the issue of being able to do swaps with Treasury would add another item to the list of possible liquidity resources in Peter's paper Rather than working out a deal that would involve 2-day paper, or perhaps 20-day paper, we probably should instruct our Manager, in dealing with Darcy Bradbury's successor, to see if an agreement could be worked out that would be in the best interest of our customer, the Treasury, and in our best interest That would be one of the things that we could do as part of developing a panoply of liquidity resources   So move, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, the economy of the Second District advanced at a slow but steady pace in recent weeks Private payrolls rose at an annual rate of 12 percent in New York and 1 percent in New Jersey in September Job growth kept pace with labor force growth, and unemployment rates therefore were essentially unchanged Consumer spending was moderately strong Retail sales growth remained in its recent range of 4 to 5 percent Sales in the existing home market softened a bit but from near-record highs that characterized recent months Housing demand remained strong and price increases were reportedly in the range of 5 to 6 percent Builders tell us that construction of single-family units declined sharply but that construction of 2- to 4-family condominiums was robust The vacancy rates for prime commercial office space declined in most metropolitan areas throughout the Second District, while rental rates continued to firm throughout the dominant Manhattan market The consumer price index for the New York/northeastern New Jersey region ticked up to 31 percent on a year-over-year basis Leaving aside monthly gyrations, the CPI in our area has averaged 28 percent over  -16-    11/13/96  the last two quarters That is about on a par with the national gain of 29 percent  On the national level, our forecast is rather consistent with the views that have been expressed here, at least those of the Greenbook and of the members who are generally sympathetic with that forecast The concern we have been spending a good deal of our time looking into is whether the tightness that all of us perceive in labor markets is something that is likely to plague us soon and, if so, how Most economic theory says that if compensation growth does accelerate, it will be passed on to higher prices if labor's share of costs, labor productivity, and the profit margin are all constant But according to the research that has been done throughout the country, the linkage between the cost of labor and the price level varies from very weak to reasonably strong In fact, the research that was conducted recently at the New York Fed suggests the strongest link But generally speaking, the research indicates that the link is not particularly strong, and we have been looking for the reason why that might be so One possible explanation we have come up with in work that is still very much in progress is that expenditure categories accounting for about half the CPI do not indicate that changes in labor costs have a significant direct effect on prices That is because either the labor costs represent a negligible fraction of total costs--for example, in existing housing, food that is consumed at home, or in energy--or because of the government's role in price setting as in medical care, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, utilities, and public transportation That seems to us to leave the remaining half of the CPI as the place to look for a stronger link between compensation and finished prices  We find that labor costs matter in two areas, but a good deal more in one of the two We find the linkage quite weak in the area involving the production of goods and the prices of the goods I think that is the area about which we hear so many anecdotes saying that the labor market is very tight, but even if labor costs go up businesses say they cannot pass them on to prices The competitive marketplace makes that very difficult But there is another area, namely, labor-intensive services that account for about 23 percent of the CPI, where there is not so much discipline on pricing, at least not any that is close to being comparable to that of the goods producing area So we have been looking at the linkage between that portion of the ECI attributable to people who produce services and the cost of services There the linkage is quite clear That is, if we look back over almost any period of time we see that as costs go up in that area, prices follow rather quickly That is the area that we think we have to concentrate on most But even in that area, the related portion of the ECI has not been moving up Therefore, that particular alarm bell, which we think is the first one that really indicates approaching problems, is not yet ringing We have not been able to find any convincing reason to think that productivity improvements have been absorbing increases in labor costs We are all aware, of course, that the productivity numbers are not very good, but we do not think that that is an area where we can place a lot of confidence, at least not yet  The other area that we in New York and most of us around the table have been talking about relates to whether the share of corporate profits in national income has been producing something of a buffer One would think that is true for the first two quarters of  -17-    11/13/96  this year As the data keep coming in on the third quarter and we start getting into the fourth quarter, we are rather inclined to believe that that may be behind us Corporate profitability is in fact beginning to turn down a bit and, therefore, the notion that increases in compensation will be absorbed by lowering the profitability level is probably not a very good bet to make  Our conclusion from all of this is that we understand better why there has been better price performance than a lot of people thought there would be but that the labor market still is tight That portion of it in the service area seems to be tight Therefore, there is still reason to be cautious Thank you   I favor "B" asymmetric, Mr Chairman   So moved   I move to ratify the operations of the Domestic Desk   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Second District have been mixed, but on balance they have been positive since our last meeting Private-sector job growth, which had been above trend earlier this year, has slowed, but unemployment rates are still rather good The 59 percent rate in New York State is holding at a 6-year low, and the 62 percent rate in New Jersey is still relatively good for that state as well Retail sales generally have been running on or above plan throughout November according to  -21-    12/17/96  our sources, and the traditional holiday shopping season seems to be off to a good start Rising consumer confidence and record bonuses, including virtually astronomical bonuses on Wall Street, also bode well for consumer spending In New York, we are getting an incredible wave of tourism, in fact to a point where hotel rates are up about 15 percent and hotel occupancy is very high New York State's residential real estate markets picked up in October, and Manhattan's commercial real estate markets remain strong The regional surveys of purchasing managers indicate persistent strength in the manufacturing sector and some easing of price pressures in that sector as well Consumer price inflation in the New York and northeastern New Jersey area held steady at 28 percent in November, so we are looking good compared to the rest of the country  On the national level, we are basically in line with the Greenbook forecast Our forecast for real growth is just a bit lower, so it is a little more comfortable in relation to growth within capacity But we share the concern that others have expressed that the risks are slightly on the high side as regards price pressures However, I believe that the risk the Committee has taken in the course of this year by assuming that the economy was in fact behaving somewhat differently has turned out to be a risk extremely well taken and that the present stance of monetary policy is correct   I was wondering if applause is in order   Mr Chairman, for all the reasons you suggested, I believe that maintaining official interest rates at their present levels is appropriate and therefore "B" is appropriate I agree that it is very likely that our next move will be up and that asymmetry should be used to indicate that there is a strong consensus among Committee members that the risks to the forecast are on the up side That is how I would interpret asymmetry rather than as reflecting a high likelihood that we would move to change rates between now and into the new year So, I believe "B" asymmetric is clearly the right conclusion for today   Surprise, surprise!   I second the motion [Laughter]   So move   I move the warehousing agreement, Mr  Chairman   Move approval   So move   Move approval   Thank you, Mr Chairman We now follow the  practice of releasing the minutes of our meetings on the Friday afternoon following the next  meeting So, the minutes for the December meeting are scheduled to be released this coming  Friday The effect of that is that the press report on the minutes disappears into a squib in The  New York Times on Saturday That is not a very widely read edition of The New York Times;    2/4-5/97  in fact, it is the least widely read of the week By the time newspapers like The Wall Street  Journal arrive on Monday, the minutes are old news Frequently, they are not picked up at all or  in a very rudimentary way That is unfortunate because in the course of the last several years,  the minutes have become a quite accurate and revealing indication of what actually happened at  the meeting They are, I think, a very important part of the increased transparency that the  Committee is seeking to establish Therefore, I think it is unfortunate that we continue to adhere  to this release schedule because of past practice, though nobody can quite remember exactly why  we started releasing the minutes on Friday afternoon So long as we continue this practice, we  will have a very important contribution to our transparency effort disappear into the weekend  We actually have ten releases a year--the Chairman's two Humphrey-Hawkins testimonies and  the eight releases of minutes--in which the Federal Open Market Committee is telling the  American people what we are trying to do I believe that greater exposure to the minutes is  desirable, and that could be achieved by moving up the time of the release Apparently, the view  held by Joe Coyne and others is that Thursday would be a day that we could use That would get  the Friday press, which is better than having less visibility than I believe is desirable   That is right My letter suggested a Wednesday  release or a Thursday release after a two-day meeting If we make it consistently Thursday, that  is actually an improvement on my proposal   My feeling is that any news media that cant  make that distinction will find the minutes so uninteresting that they probably will not carry a  report on them Those that do understand the difference are the ones that are interested enough  to publish a report   Yes    2/4-5/97   Thank you   If I could ask, Mr Chairman--Joe, we could  certainly move the release time to 400 pm when the stock market closes   Nor would I   So move    2/4-5/97   Move approval of $12 billion   Yes   At some of the major firms the level was  approximately 50 percent higher in 1996 than in 1995 The tax receipts of New York City and  New York State reflect this boom as well   The earliest is December and most of them are  paid out by the end of January   Thank you, Mr Chairman The reports on the  Second District's economy have been steady to slightly stronger in recent weeks The region's  job market, which had shown some signs of slowing in September and October, picked up a bit  in the final two months of 1996 In New York State, private nonfarm payrolls grew at an annual  rate of 11 percent in November and December versus 1 percent in the prior two months Total  payroll employment grew at a modest 05 percent annual rate in both of the last two months of  the year, held back by ongoing downsizing in government The unemployment rate drifted up  from a 6-year low of 59 percent to 61 percent, but the entire increase was due to faster labor  force growth In New Jersey, private nonfarm payrolls grew at a 26 percent annual rate in the  final couple of months of 1996, up sharply from earlier in the year As in New York State,  however, sharp declines in government employment restrained overall job growth to a still quite  brisk 16 percent The state's unemployment rate is 62 percent  Consumer spending seemed to be rather good Major retailers reported that holiday  sales in the region were on or above plan, with November-December same store sales running  58 percent above 1995 Post-holiday sales seemed to be quite strong A separate survey of  small retailers across New York State showed same store sales up 4 to 6 percent from the  comparable period in 1995, with even stronger reports coming from Manhattan Sales there were  perhaps not unrelated to the earnings in the securities industry; apparel and jewelry sales were  particularly strong New York State decided to take a 1-week vacation in its 8-1/2 percent sales  tax and that helped to clear out the stores in the third week of January Big-ticket durables,    2/4-5/97  however, were somewhat slower sellers, especially furniture and electronics Discounting by  the retailers was lower than was required in the previous year, and so their earnings seemed  pretty good  Residential real estate markets are gaining momentum, led mainly by the multifamily  sector The apartment market in New York City is getting quite strong and the prices of New  York apartments are going up Another indication of the same sort of phenomenon is the old  masters' sale at Sotheby's last week, which brought prices that were far above the expectations  going into the sale The office market in Manhattan continues to improve The New York  District therefore is looking rather good The inflation rate for the greater New York area--29  percent for Q4 to Q4 in 1996--is a little better than that for the country as a whole  On the national picture, we think GDP growth will moderate substantially from the  unsustainable 47 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1996 Consumer spending started the year  with little forward momentum; housing is edging down; and we think fourth-quarter activity in  nonresidential construction and foreign trade borrowed from the future So, the central tendency  of growth still looks to us to be near 2 percent, with a gradual drifting down as time passes and  the expansion ages further Under that scenario, the unemployment rate in our forecast remains  in the vicinity of 5-1/2 percent We think GDP is likely to grow at a very slow rate of about  1-1/2 percent this quarter We do not think that there are any fundamental forces at work that are  likely to cause a significant deviation from potential growth, which we put at 2 percent Inflation  both for prices and overall labor costs remains somnolent We still see significant risks of some  acceleration in inflation largely because average hourly earnings growth has picked up  noticeably, and we do not have the data yet to see whether that is being financed by  improvements in productivity The more comprehensive wage components of the ECI exhibit    2/4-5/97  less acceleration The increase in the fourth quarter of last year matches a seasonal pattern, and  therefore I am not sure that one should multiply it by four  We continue to be very concerned, as we have been all year and as I think is  appropriate, that the risks of inflation are on the high side But in the context of the comments  that some others have made about their Districts so far, I think one has to be very careful to  distinguish between the risk of inflation and seeing it as a reality We do not see it yet as a  reality Nor do we see the raw ingredients in labor markets, commodity markets, or other  markets providing the warning signals that would tell us that inflation is close enough on the  horizon to indicate that preemptive action is required at this time Thank you   I cant offer a counterargument, Mr Chairman,  because I think it would be extraordinarily unwise to shift from the present ranges to the higher  ones First of all, it would give the wrong signal about monetary policy Secondly, even on  Brian's tree without your bush, we probably will need to tighten in 1997 And this would get us  into a debate in which we would be talking about M's and Y's and foolishness rather than  concentrating on price stability and the need to say more about the American economy That is  what I think we ought to spend our energy talking about   Can I make a comment? As I think all of you  know, I have been traveling along my own road to Damascus on this issue I believe that  virtually every time I speak about anything, I refer to the theme of price stability, the wonders of  price stability, and its merits for society At a certain stage of my trip to Damascus, I thought  that it would be helpful for us to establish publicly a price range objective I have backed off  from that view over time largely because, as the Chairman has been suggesting, I think that it    2/4-5/97  would lock us into a horrendous political debate that would not greatly benefit the country and it  would provide opportunities for those who really want to debauch the currency to come forward  and have a forum in which to make their recommendations They probably would be of more  concern, or so it seems to me, than the people I sometimes describe as hairshirts who want to  grind inflation down for fear of greater inflation I think the Greenspan definition--that price  stability is reached when people are not concerned about future inflation as they make their  decisions--probably serves us a lot better in terms of forcing the debate in the right direction, not  getting into a sterile numbers debate, and really getting to the goal we want to achieve That  certainly is pragmatism rather than anything disguised as economic theory But having started  with the notion that we would benefit from setting a number, not a specific number but a range, I  now think that as a practical matter doing so could hurt our effort to achieve price stability   I think that we could make our meetings more  of a discussion rather than a series of individual presentations On occasion we discuss  something that a member said That has happened more this morning than in quite some time  You said something; I along with other members commented on it We had a more useful  exchange of minds and views this morning than we have had in a while, and I think that is very  good I believe it would be desirable to have a meeting structure that encourages more  discussion Part of it I think also is that the longer people are here--I have been here about five  years now--the more they use shorthand Somebody says something in about three words, and  that is actually equivalent to about six paragraphs when we know, as you said, what everybody's  views are   Exactly   Don, you mentioned in your very good as  always presentation that there may be some questioning as to whether we are still in the  preemptive monetary policy business or at least we are beginning to get those questions My  own feeling from looking at the behavior of the markets and being in New York and therefore  having a nonstop opportunity to talk to the people in the markets is that such questioning is still  very tentative, if it has in fact begun The people who think monetary policy can never be tight  enough have always been worried about us Those who never find monetary policy loose  enough would, of course, be delighted if we got out of the preemptive business But I think that  the vast range of more serious people in the middle is still giving us the benefit of the doubt I  am not sure how much That is a wasting asset, I suspect My interpretation is that it is an asset  that we still have in rather large supply Do you have a different view?   It sounds as if you would agree that there is a  wasting asset quality   I agree with that   We can certainly assume that it is very  substantial   Mr Chairman, I fully endorse the  recommendation you have made, and I will try to fill in the gap while others prepare for the pop  quiz on your evaluation of the equity market I also think the asymmetry really is quite different  because I now read it as meaning that we will tighten soon and probably at the March meeting I  believe we would wish to do so later than that only if the incoming information suggested greater  weakness than we are likely to have, which will be the payback in the first quarter for a very  strong fourth quarter I think we would have to convince ourselves that the slowdown is more  meaningful than one that just reflects that payback  In the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, I think it is very important that you prepare the  way and explain to the world, both the market and the public more generally, what is likely to be  coming I think that market participants are more likely to get the message this time, largely  because they did not get it the last time They do tend to learn from that kind of experience In  what I think is the remote possibility of their not getting it, we might have to decide how we  should make the message a little clearer Since I make it an art form of not saying things that  move markets, perhaps I could be of use in that regard by enhancing what you said or even just  quoting it to help bring more attention to it  Going to the message in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, I think we should hit  some themes rather strongly, and you suggested all of them Another theme is that our goal is  price stability and that is how we achieve sustained economic growth That at the very high  capacity usage the economy is experiencing, potential noninflationary growth is really limited, as  we all know, to the sum of the growth of the labor force and the growth of productivity We  could remind them that monetary policy in that environment can hurt sustained economic growth  if it stays too accommodative too long and that we simply do not have the capability to produce    2/4-5/97  higher real growth through an overly accommodative policy That sort of approach would give  you the opportunity to remind people that the Federal Reserve is very much pro-growth and  pro-employment and if they want a higher growth rate the way it will be achieved is not by  debauching the currency but by increasing the saving rate and therefore improving the economy's  ability to increase investment  Especially since we would be moving preemptively again, which I believe very much  we should, we have to be very careful in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony I would hope that  whatever the rest of us are saying between now and the next meeting that we not fall into the  anti-growth trap One particular tool that I think is very useful for us analytically but one that  feeds the we-are-against-growth image, of which we are highly suspected in any case, is the use  of the NAIRU We at the New York Fed, you may remember, were extraordinarily accurate in  1994 in forecasting the real economy and extraordinarily inaccurate in predicting inflation,  which we overestimated The need for humility being a great teacher, this pushed us very hard  in the direction of trying to figure out why we made that mistake One of the things that we have  become rather convinced of is that the NAIRU is a very interesting analytical tool, but it is a very  poor forecasting tool The more we talk about it as if it were going to tell us what we should do  next month, however eloquently we express ourselves, the more I think we come across as anti  growth I see that as unwise because it leads the American people to believe that what we think  we are doing to help them is in fact harmful to them This does not help the public policy debate  nor does it help the posture of the Federal Reserve  I am sorry for being a bit long-winded, but I do think that "B" asymmetric, seriously  asymmetric, is the right choice and that we ought to be girding our loins for a probable tightening  at the next meeting    2/4-5/97   Move approval, Mr Chairman   Move approval of the additional leeway to  $12 billion    3/25/97   Mr Chairman, the Second District  economy has shown continued signs of strength in the first quarter Payroll job creation  remains sturdy, and job growth was revised up a bit for 1996 and early 1997 New York  State's unemployment rate was stable, while New Jersey's fell to a six-year low Benchmark  revisions to 1996 unemployment rates were minimal, though both civilian employment and  labor force participation were revised up substantially Retail sales generally were above  plan, boosted in part by New York State's one-week tax abatement on clothing in January  and by unseasonably mild weather in February Consumer confidence in the Middle Atlantic  region surged to a new cyclical high in the first quarter, but it remains below the national  average Residential and commercial real estate markets continued to gain momentum early  this year; single-family home sales improved, and permits to build apartments remained on  an uptrend In some of the region's tighter office markets, falling vacancy rates have begun  to push up asking rents Regional surveys of purchasing managers were mixed in February,  but they generally signaled improvement in the manufacturing sector In New York and  northeastern New Jersey, consumer price inflation averaged 27 percent in the twelve months  ending in February, down from 29 percent in 1996 and just below the national rate of 3  percent Local banks have reported little change in loan demand and only a slight rise in  consumer delinquency rates  On the national level, since our last forecast in late January, indicators of domestic  demand, labor markets, and production have come in surprisingly strong However, the    3/25/97  international trade data for January were much weaker than we expected On balance, we  have boosted our growth forecast for this quarter to 2-1/2 percent and for 1997 as a whole to  near 2-1/4 percent We do not have quite the robust growth that the Greenbook does for  1998; we have it at 2 percent, but we do believe that the upside risks are substantial Under  our scenario, the unemployment rate declines to between 5 and 5-1/4 percent by the end of  this year and stays around that range for 1998 Despite the continued strength of real  economic activity, core consumer price inflation has decelerated further in the current  quarter, and the rate of increase in aggregate labor compensation is running well below that  predicted by traditional Phillips curve models Nonetheless, given the current and expected  levels of resource utilization, we believe that acceleration of core inflation over the forecast  horizon is the most likely outcome Indeed, while we have pushed the starting point of that  acceleration further out in the future, we have raised the rate of core inflation expected to be  reached in 1998 to 33 percent on a Q4 to Q4 basis  There are three developments since our last meeting that have raised my staffs  and my own concern about inflation considerably above the already increasing level of  anxiety that I expressed at our last meeting First, the levels of consumer spending, consumer  confidence, and residential construction are so high that I believe the always hard to predict  wealth effect is kicking in and is likely to remain engaged even if there should be a modest  stock market correction Second, business fixed investment seems unusually robust for this  late stage of the business cycle, and it shows up in areas such as heavy truck orders and  investment in structures that make me believe that the business executive will be joining the  consumer in increasing demand Third, we have benefited for several years from a positive  supply shock in the form of slower increases in health benefit costs than in wages that has    3/25/97  produced an acceptable slope to the rise in the ECI Our sources of expertise--on both the  supply and demand sides of health care and for both goods and services--believe that positive  period is behind us and that increases in health care costs will track the rise in the CPI in the  future They, and we, are not predicting a negative supply shock but the end of the positive  shock That combination of developments makes me believe that the risk of rising inflation  next year and in 1999 has become significantly higher since our last meeting   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think that the  best thing to concentrate on at the moment, or at least what I find myself concentrating on, is  what we do not know Even though we have had a lot of rather good albeit partial  explanations, I think we are not, and certainly I am not, altogether sure why inflation and the  cost-push causes of inflation have been so benevolent We are tightening now largely  because we as a group have decided--and certainly I believe--that the risks of waiting further  have become excessive and therefore unacceptable Then the question arises as to how much  we should tighten I think 25 basis points does two things It indicates our concern,  especially given the fact that a shift in policy direction is involved, but it does not pretend  that we know more than we know I, at least, am not so sure that the benign performance of  growth and inflation, which we have found acceptable since last July, is going to end soon  Therefore, I think it is appropriate that our response be moderate and in that sense a 25 basis  point increase is enough I believe a 50 basis point move would indicate a far greater  assurance regarding the end of the benign period--that it is more highly predictable and will  occur sooner--than I feel intellectually or in any other way  The asymmetric directive--I think I have become almost the resident theologian on  what asymmetry means--is inappropriate now I believe that the combination of a move  with asymmetry would cause us to fall into the same trap of assuming something that we do    3/25/97  not know If, as is possible and not absolutely a no-brainer, we decide that we have to  increase the fed funds rate again either before the next meeting or at the next meeting, the  lack of asymmetry when we announce it in releasing the minutes the Thursday after the May  meeting will not be very important to anybody Consequently, I think the 25 basis point  increase and a symmetric directive are most consistent with what we know and maybe more  importantly with what we do not know   Move approval   Move approval of the domestic operations   Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic  growth in the Second District has slowed somewhat on balance from the brisk pace reported  for the first quarter Payroll job growth remains fairly strong, with employment levels  running more than 1 percent ahead of a year ago New York State's unemployment rate held  steady at 63 percent in March, and New Jersey's went down to a cyclical low of 52 percent  in April--the data for New Jersey come in earlier Retail sales were generally below plan in  March and especially in April, though much of the weakness was concentrated in seasonal  merchandise and was attributed to unseasonably cold weather Consumer confidence  retreated in March and April and remains the lowest in the nation This may seem rather    5/20/97  surprising given the fine economic performance of New York City, but that performance is  attributable mainly to Wall Street and tourism The northern tier of New York State from  Buffalo to Albany and most of the way down the Hudson Valley is an area of psychological  depression, where some breakdown in the leadership of the private sector is looking more  and more apparent We go to various places, even large cities like Syracuse, and are  beckoned to take over the private-sector leadership of the community, which is a somewhat  depressing experience Commercial and residential real estate markets, especially around  New York City, are continuing to gain momentum In the early part of this year, permits to  build new homes were up about 20 percent, led by the multifamily sector Office vacancy  rates have continued to fall in Manhattan, and we hear more and more discussion of new  office construction, even of "spec" buildings  On the national level, we too were surprised by the very strong first quarter, but we  see the economy slowing to a growth rate of about 1-3/4 percent this quarter followed by  growth at a rate of about 2 percent for the rest of this year and the two following years We  believe that the unemployment rate will stay near its present level of close to 5 percent during  that period As others also have noted, the strong dollar has helped price performance this  year, both because of its drag on the economy and its direct immediate effect on prices In  addition, some recent research we have done at the New York Bank has convinced us that the  microeconomic effect of the dollar's recovery since 1995 on the relatively open US  manufacturing economy has restrained both wage increases and investment growth in 1996  and thus far in 1997 This, we believe, has been a more important contributor to the excellent  price performance in the manufactured goods area than generally has been realized The    5/20/97  other side of that coin, of course, is the additional inflationary effect of a weaker dollar  through that channel in the future  We use the gap between actual and potential GDP as the best tool of inflation  forecasting That tool helps us understand why the good performance of inflation is less  mysterious than it has seemed The recent large discrepancy between the income and the  product sides of the national income accounts and the unexpectedly large tax receipts suggest  that GDP has been underestimated, meaning that productivity was underestimated We think  that is very important because it is a sustainable phenomenon that does not require a train of  happy events that seem to have come together mysteriously to give us good results So, we  think that what appeared to be a sizable gap between actual and potential GDP really was not  very substantial at all before the burst in growth in the last two quarters If we take account  of that burst of growth and then assume a trend rate of economic expansion, we conclude that  real GDP is now somewhat above potential and likely to stay that way Consequently, we,  like the Greenbook, are forecasting accelerating core inflation However, we keep on being  surprised by an excellent inflation performance What, therefore, should we conclude?  In more than two decades of trying to make a living in the private sector, it always  seemed to me that if we have less confidence in a forecast, we should be less activist and  more cautious in our decisionmaking I asked Rick Mishkin to see if there was some  economic research about policymaking in times of uncertainty The principal author of such  research is Bill Brainard, who is Chairman of the Board of the Boston Fed at the moment  The conclusion of that research is that the greater the uncertainty about the economic model  and its forecast, the more cautious we should be in changing policy instruments I was very  happy to hear that economic research and two decades of private-sector experience seemed to    5/20/97  be in "sync" That suggests to me that, although our point forecast for inflation is for a fairly  substantial acceleration, there is a great deal of uncertainty around that point forecast and  therefore less information in output gaps about the path of future inflation Accordingly, we  need to look elsewhere for hints of inflationary pressures The recent core CPI inflation  number does have some troubling elements, particularly the rise in core services inflation  which we think is the sector most susceptible to wage pressures being passed through to  prices But we have just one month's data, and we probably should not leap to a conclusion  based on such limited data Apart from that evidence, we see no hints of increasing  inflation We conclude that caution is the appropriate lesson to be learned Thank you, Mr  Chairman   Mr Chairman, during the go-around I gave  a shortened version, not intentionally, of the very interesting analysis you made of  productivity developments As I said then, an advantage of attributing the unusually  favorable performance of unit costs to higher productivity growth was that it removed some  of the mystery surrounding that performance Our previous analysis that attributed much of  the relatively subdued inflation to the dollar and to uncertainty among white collar workers  might be compared in terms of its plausibility to a relay race in which people who never saw    5/20/97  each other before run on the same team and pass the baton perfectly It was always very hard  for me to believe So, I think this analysis actually makes a good deal more sense  I would add as you indicated, Mr Chairman, that we are dealing with a working  hypothesis, not a proved theory Therefore, it does leave us with a rather high degree of  uncertainty about what is going on in the economy even though we may be less uncertain In  the circumstances, caution is the appropriate response  I agree with the idea that keeping participants in financial markets and the real  economy somewhat uncertain about the exact timing of our moves has considerable merit  since we still have rather frothy asset markets As I mentioned, we are now heading toward  speculative real estate development in New York I can support very comfortably your  recommendation of "B" asymmetric   Move approval   So moved   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Second  District has slowed slightly over the past six weeks, and the growth that is taking place is mainly  in New York City Economic activity is rather stagnant in the rest of New York State, and  growth has slowed slightly in the northern part of New Jersey  We do not have great differences with the forecasts of the other members so let me  talk a little about where I think we are Because monetary policy works with long and variable  lags, as we all know, we must consider what will happen 18 to 36 months from now, not what is  happening today That puts us in the forecasting business All of us believe in price stability,  even though we have not agreed around the table on precisely what that means beyond your  working definition of it, Mr Chairman I find increasingly that the degree of anxiety of  Committee members varies with their belief in traditional forecasting methods All are  forecasting some increase in core inflation later this year and in 1998, but all have been  forecasting higher inflation for the last two years and it has not happened  Those of us who are perhaps least uncomfortable with watching and waiting are those  who, in my words, concentrate on knowing what we do not know We know that for the last two  years or so the forecasting models have not been working well, witness how bad our forecasts  have been What we do not know is why they have not been working My feel, as was discussed  at length at the last meeting, is that we have been underestimating and we continue to    7/1-2/97  underestimate productivity, but we aren't sure of that In fact, in meeting after meeting with the  exception of March, the Committee has been fretting but waiting I think that many of us have  felt that the risk of waiting has been quite low because, as measured by the real fed funds rate  and in other ways, our policy is in fact rather tight; it certainly is not loose Therefore, I believe  that we can afford and should continue to wait until we have greater certainty about what really  is happening in the economy Some members of the Committee are very concerned about our  credibility if we wait, and certainly they should be concerned if we wait too long But I think  credibility is not the result of raising rates whether needed or not; credibility is doing the right  thing In my view, we have been doing the right thing Thank you, Mr Chairman   But if you are a true believer, there is nothing  stronger than belief!   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that what we are  talking about, directly or indirectly, is whether there should be a publicly stated, publicly agreed  upon goal of monetary policy By that I mean a goal that is a little more clear to the citizens of  our country than what I would describe as the goal of sustained economic growth to be achieved  through price stability, which in turn is not defined with a number In fact, I use your working  definition In my view, there would be a benefit if we had a more clearly stated goal of price  stability today because it would give us better signals We could stop this debate and we would  be more accountable to the American people in that they would have a better idea of what we are    7/1-2/97  supposed to be doing and whether we are doing it But in a democracy, one has to be extremely  pragmatic Given the absence of absolute certainty about what we are supposed to be doing, we  have in fact been very successful in bringing down the level of inflation Despite having done  that, however, the political criticism of the central bank has been increasing We are not being  particularly rewarded for our achievement; instead, there has been increasing questioning  Going back to the Humphrey-Hawkins report and testimony, I think we should be very  clear about what we think ought to be the goal of monetary policy before we go out and start  selling it We do not quite know what to sell because we have not agreed on it, and we have to  be very certain that what we attempt to sell will make it more likely that we will be able to carry  out policy more effectively rather than less   Mr Chairman, I agree that we should adopt  alternative I I think it is far too early to conclude that the recent fit in V2, and therefore the use  of M2, is anything like a sure thing One of the things I believe we have to be aware of is the  effect of a change in market focus on a monetary measure We may have a monetary aggregate  that tracks reasonably well when we are not using it as a policy tool Therefore, it is a matter of  passing interest but essentially of indifference to the marketplace On the other hand, if we start  using it as a tool, the markets are going to concentrate on it a lot more, and it may pick up a  degree of volatility related only to its being used as a policy tool  On the broader issue of explaining what we are doing, it seems to me that a  concentration on economic growth and the creation of jobs is where the high ground is located  and is what we appropriately are dedicated to That is why I use price stability as a means to an  end, not as an end in itself I also like the clarity involved in talking about an interest rate  because people in the real world understand interest rates They do not understand reserve levels    7/1-2/97  or all this other arcane stuff that we like to discuss Our use of the latter appears to them as an  effort to obfuscate It will be more understandable to them if we say that we believe in long-term  economic growth, we believe that monetary policy is a very effective tool to bring that about,  and the tool that we have is the overnight interest rate When we decide that we have to shift the  overnight interest rate as a means of working toward that long-term goal, people may not like it,  but at least they will understand it   I would be very comfortable with that   To change the wording?   I am super more than willing to support it   I think the proposed first sentence merely says  in the directive what we already say in the press release, so I cannot see any reason why one  would not wish to adopt that rewording In the current second sentence, I find the "woulds" and  "mights" to be embarrassing nonsense I think that wording is the ultimate in obfuscation and    7/1-2/97  truly silly Therefore, anything that is understandable English has to be an improvement, and I  find the proposed language to be just that So, I am happy with the proposal   Mr Chairman, I agree that there is a great deal  of uncertainty and that the risks are on the high side, which certainly argues for asymmetry no  matter how confusing the existing wording of the directive may be The right decision now is to  watch and wait but to watch quite carefully So, I believe "B" asymmetric is the right decision   Move approval  SPEAKER(?) Second   Mr Chairman, I would like to move the election  of Steve Cechetti as Associate Economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to serve until  the election of his successor at the first meeting of the Committee after December 31, 1997 I very  much hope that his successor will be himself   Peter, may I interrupt you for a moment? Would  you remind everybody what a 3-by-6, a 6-by-9, and a 9-by-12 are?   Move approval    8/19/97  SPEAKER(?) Second   Mr Chairman, a directly related development, at  least in the New York area, has been the reaction of UPS competitors When some shippers asked  those competitors to provide a delivery capability, rather than increasing prices the competing firms  asked for a two- or three-year agreement to assure the continuation of the new business So, they  were going for market share rather than short-term price increases   Mr Chairman, the Second District economy  continues to underperform the nation's to some extent, but it has been doing somewhat better The  region's labor markets remained steady in the second quarter New Jersey's unemployment rate  edged down to 54 percent in July, reversing its little uptick in June, but it is down 07 point from a    8/19/97  year ago New York State's unemployment rate remained fixed at 63 percent for the first six  months of this year New York City's rate climbed to 10 percent in June, up from 96 percent in  May That is the highest level since early 1994 It does appear, however, to be the result of an  upward trend in labor force participation  Most major retailers in the region report that sales were above plan in July Compared to  a year ago, same store sales gains for July ranged from 2 to 6 percent Virtually all the retailers  surveyed report satisfactory inventory levels, helped in part by successful summer clearance sales  Our retail contacts report little or no change in merchandise costs and some deflation in selling  prices Retail wage pressures generally remain subdued  Residential construction activity retreated modestly in the second quarter, but the  regional variations persisted, with upstate New York weak and the New York metropolitan area  relatively strong The commercial real estate markets in and around New York City continued to  tighten in the second quarter, as reflected in brisk leasing activity and declining office availability  rates The reports from our regional purchasing managers indicate some slowing in manufacturing  activity in July, especially in the upstate area of New York, again the problem part of our District  Consumer price inflation in the New York metropolitan area averaged 2-1/2 percent during the 12  months ending in July, up a little from the year ending in June and just a tad above the national rate  New York State legislators finally approved the fiscal year 1998 budget The approval came four  months later than the deadline under New York State law, a new and not particularly enviable  record  On the national level, we see the economy rebounding in the third quarter and we draw  some confidence in that forecast from the strength in retail sales and in the sales of light vehicles in  July We see the economy subsequently slowing to its potential growth of about 2 percent We see    8/19/97  reasonably balanced risks to our forecast of real economic activity, but there is some downside risk  in the next few months if the ratio of sales to inventories, especially in manufactured goods, should  encourage manufacturers to cut production back somewhat That ratio is low by historical  standards, but it's a bit higher than it has been in the recent past  We share the disappointment of many that the recent NIPA revisions did not demonstrate  a greater growth potential for the economy The revisions helped explain the good performance of  inflation because of the downward revision to unit labor costs, but it leaves us with the large  question of how long the low growth rates of wages and benefits will continue There is also a  question of how long the favorable effect of a strong dollar can continue to be helpful to our  inflation performance because of both its direct effect on import prices and the discipline it  provides to domestic manufacturers So, as regards our inflation forecast, we believe that the rate  of increase in the prices of core goods will remain subdued, but we are somewhat more concerned  about increases in the prices of services where competition is less severe and more local We think  it is possible that such prices will creep up The reason for that is above all because we think the  economy is at present operating about 2 percentage points above what would appear to be potential  GDP Therefore, we have some concern about the possibility of rising inflation even though our  forecast has the economy growing in line with the rate of increase in its capacity So, we are  forecasting a rise in inflation, but we are not terribly certain about the timing; the forecast has the  rise taking place in the latter half of 1998 and as we go into 1999   Thoughtful and practical   I second the Boehne motion   I would like to add Governor Rivlin for drawing  attention to the practical consideration that got this discussion over with   Don, I have a question for you that comes from  page 1 of the Bluebook In the fifth line down you state that "longer-term nominal yields were  down 15 to 25 basis points, but yields on indexed debt were about unchanged, suggesting that a  slight reduction" etc Is part of the reason you use the term "suggesting" that you believe that these  bonds are new enough and still not liquid enough that they will not tell us as much as they might  "X" years from now when they are not so new and have become more liquid?   I think you have it just right I believe it tells us  something, but we have to be very careful not to get overly caught up with it quite yet   It is a kind of economist's 9-by-12, I think  [Laughter]   So move   So move   I think Mike's oral presentation adds a good deal  of clarity to the ideas behind the Greenbook forecast There are a couple of things there, however,  that strike me as somewhat inconsistent, and perhaps you could clarify this for me or the rest of us  We have a rather high real interest rate now and that rate makes carrying inventory expensive This  may be one of the reasons why inventories have been kept rather low If we cranked up the federal  funds rate by 100 basis points as assumed in the Greenbook forecast, we would have a real interest  rate of about 4 percent and that would make carrying inventories hugely expensive I would like  your view of the likelihood that such an increase in the real rate would bring about a much greater  inventory correction than you have in the forecast  The other thing that strikes me as somewhat inconsistent is the relationship in the  forecast between the 20 percent correction in the stock market and the behavior of long-term  interest rates I think that if you assume any kind of wealth effect coming from an "I-am-scared-to-  death" 20 percent correction in stock prices, especially if the latter were to occur relatively quickly,  the flow of funds would be from the stock market into the bond market and instead of the long-term  interest rates going up as in the forecast, I think one might expect them to come down Those are  the two things in the forecast that appear to me to be somewhat inconsistent    9/30/97   Thank you, Mr Chairman The rate of economic  growth in the Second District has held fairly steady since the last meeting The latest figures on  payroll employment suggest a third-quarter acceleration in the pace of job creation, though the  figures were held down a bit by the UPS strike The job growth in New York and New Jersey  averaged an annual rate of 09 percent over the last three months, but if we remove the strike effect,  the rate of growth actually would be about 17 percent despite some drag from the public sector  Consumer spending in our area is reasonably good The retailers are happy and report that sales are    9/30/97  a little ahead of their plans In the real estate area, the main characteristic continues to be weakness  in upstate New York and some further tightening of the space markets in various parts of  Manhattan Manufacturing in the area continues to be fairly good, again with some drag from the  upstate New York area That was dramatized recently by Eastman Kodak's announcement that it  will cut at least 10,000 jobs; they did not specify where the cuts would occur, but a third of their  workforce is in upstate New York Within the District, consumer price inflation averaged 22  percent during the 12 months ended in August, about matching the national rate  On the national level, we do not have quite the drama in our forecast of a 20 percent  correction in the stock market or a 100 basis point tightening, but our forecast is a reasonably  attractive one in any event We look for GDP growth of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter,  but we then have growth slowing to about the trend rate both at the end of 1997 and into 1998 The  big variable, of course, is the consumer We anticipate that consumer spending will settle down to  a trend growth rate of about 2-1/2 percent, and for reasons related to the question I asked earlier, we  think that inventory investment will be a significant drag on GDP growth as will net exports We  have been happily surprised, as has everybody else, by the performance of inflation and actually  have reduced our trend inflation rate somewhat for the balance of 1997 But we have inflation  picking up gradually in 1998 and 1999, hitting about 32 percent in 1999 That is measured as it  would be today, though the reported numbers will presumably be lower as various technical  improvements are worked in We think the real threat to the inflation forecast would be a stronger  economy induced by higher-than-projected increases in consumer spending We do not particularly  expect that to happen, but it does make us believe that the risk to the forecast is that the economy  will be stronger than we anticipate, and therefore the inflation risk will be somewhat greater    9/30/97  Since some members are wandering into the policy area, I will refer to our view which is  that we do not need to tighten quite yet However, we think the time is coming somewhat closer  than we thought it was a meeting or two ago Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I very much believe that what you  have recommended is what we should do, and let me briefly give some reasons The factors  leading to a combination of good economic growth and ever better price performance--a firm  dollar, restrained wage demands, and the excellent performance of health benefit costs--clearly  have to be transitory and cannot be depended on to continue to give us the present combination of  favorable developments as we move forward I do not think we can bet on faster productivity gains  because such a bet would involve a leap in the dark We have a sufficient basis in the transitory  factors that I just mentioned to explain why we have had the good economic performance    9/30/97  Therefore, I think it would be bad policy to maintain the present stance in the expectation that  productivity gains might bail us out  If that is the case and policy needs to be changed, then the question obviously is, why  wait? We have been telling the American people, who are infinitely more important than the  market participants, that the purpose of the Federal Reserve is to create sustained economic growth  and that price stability is a means to that end With sustained economic growth clearly taking place  and with price performance even better than anyone had anticipated, including us, we need to do  some informing of the public before we move Since the likelihood is, as you have suggested, that  we will wish to firm policy at the next meeting, I encourage you to seize an opportunity in a speech  or Congressional testimony or some other avenue where you can lay out the line of thought that  you just gave, including the wonderful news that we have fewer discouraged workers, more people  coming into the workforce, and all the other favorable developments that, as you suggested, can be  and should be mentioned as evidence of the great success achieved in the functioning of the US  economy I think that type of presentation to the public would make people understand, though not  all would like it, why we would choose to firm policy in the near future, and I encourage you to  make that presentation In my view, that is the kind of thing that has to be done by the Chairman of  the Committee Others can say what they like to be supportive, but it really is only the Chairman  who speaks for the Committee Therefore, I think it is important that you do that before the next  meeting  I very much believe that at the present time "B" asymmetric is the right policy choice   Could I add a comment? Just a brief one?   We have been doing a good deal of work at our  Bank on where inflation stems from on the wage side, and it is not in the goods-producing  industries Therefore, the labor force that does exist in Bombay and Mexico does not help to  explain our wage behavior because inflation comes from the services part of the economy   But for most services there is no import  competition   The portion of the workforce that is most likely to  give us the inflationary pressure, at least on the basis of our analysis, is in the services areas where  there is no possibility of competition with imported services That pressure initially kicks off in the  wages of service workers, but with a not very long lag it seems to spill over into general wage  inflation and over into the price side   So move   I think that, as a practical matter, the dealers  who decided they did not want to behave according to Peter's desires would probably decide  they did not want to be primary dealers They would be very unlikely to bring attention to  themselves by suing us That would be saying, "I have been deemed unacceptable, and I want  the whole world to know about it"   Within the limits of not in effect becoming  their supervisors, which would be inappropriate, we pay as much attention as we can and gather  as much knowledge as possible about the activities of the securities firms and perhaps even more  so of the foreign banks in our market because we do supervise them   There is a general move at securities firms in  the direction of policing their activities better in order to run their businesses more soundly  Needless to say, we have encouraged that effort and applaud it Some of the time we can get a  point across in a speech that shows an interest in how well they are behaving themselves and  how well they are managing their businesses    11/12/97   On century date change, I meet one-on-one two  to three times a year with the heads of insurance companies and securities firms as well as major  banks At those meetings, we go through all the business concerns on their side and our side  For the last year, a piece of that agenda has always been century date change My impression of  the securities firms is that they are very much on top of it I think in the case of the foreign  banks, it varies considerably The Asian banks seem to be less on top of the problem than the  European banks, who are probably six to nine months behind the major US banks Their  attention was gotten a little bit late, but I think we have it now   You may know that during the annual meetings  in Hong Kong, the Institute of International Finance had a very well attended gathering I was  asked to give the primary speech and I dedicated all of it to the century date change issue   So move, Mr Chairman    11/12/97   Move approval to increase the leeway to $12  billion   It is also intended to include "and obedient"  Move approval of the swap line renewals, Mr Chairman    11/12/97   Thank you, Mr Chairman Reports on the  Second District economy have had a somewhat firmer tone in recent weeks employment growth  has accelerated; retail sales have picked up in mid-to-late October; retail inventories are in good    11/12/97 77  shape; wage pressures are reasonably moderate; housing markets have strengthened; the New  York City boom in tourism continues, and hotels are full and the rates are very high Local  banks report that demand for most types of loans is increasing at a steady pace, but I am happy to  say that bankers seem to be showing somewhat greater restraint in the credit area  Looking ahead at the national economy, I find myself mainly focused on what we  know now that is different from what we knew at the last meeting At that time, the likelihood of  the emergence of inflationary pressures seemed sufficiently great that a monetary policy  tightening seemed both likely and imminent Our forecast for the fourth quarter is a little weaker  than the Greenbook staff forecast but not very much Next year and the following year continue  to look quite positive in terms of growth, though a little less robust than 1997 Our staff forecast  is based on some return to dependency on traditional models, and it therefore says that inflation  will accelerate to a bit greater degree than does the Greenbook But it is the inflation forecast  that I find most problematic, both in the Greenbook and our own work Since price stability is  what we are trying to achieve, uncertainty about the inflation forecast is particularly challenging  The unusually good price performance of the last few years is capable of being fully explained  by the combination of a stronger dollar, wage restraint, and the slow growth of health benefit  costs We all have been worried about how long those trends can continue Obviously, wages  and benefit costs could rise more without increasing inflationary pressures if productivity  increases were to, in a sense, finance the faster rise in wages and benefit costs Lo and behold,  productivity does seem to be improving quite significantly; at least it was improving quite  significantly in the second and third quarters But again we do not know how long that will  continue    11/12/97  The changes in financial markets that already have occurred and the contagion effect  that definitely is still going around the world are developments that are likely to reduce growth,  and they may do so with a somewhat greater impact if they have a seriously adverse effect on  consumer confidence In my view, the result of all this is that the degree of uncertainty has  increased However, I believe that the urgency that I felt at the last meeting for an imminent  change in monetary policy has been very considerably reduced   He is from the sophisticated part of Texas   I stand exactly where you do, Mr Chairman,  "B" asymmetric   So move   Also, if and when confidence is restored or  when greed overcomes fear, people may suddenly find that they are much better off to keep a lot  of those positions that they now want to get out of    12/16/97   Move approval   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will not comment  to any degree on the economy of the Second District, which actually is a little better than it was  at the time of our last meeting, nor on the national economy because we agree essentially with  the viewpoint of the Greenbook Since I have spent a little more than four decades on the  international side of things, I thought I would devote some comments to my feel for the political  and economic situation in the world My views are not significantly dissimilar from those that  have just been shared    12/16/97  It seems to me that the world economy is walking along a rather narrow ridge To the  right, we have a pleasantly upward sloping meadow and to the left, a rather large precipice The  forecast essentially has the world economy continuing to walk successfully along that ridge It is  not very likely to begin to enter the meadow and experience better conditions nor is it likely to  fall into the precipice What are the dangers? If we look at the three economies in Asia that  already are in the hands of the International Monetary Fund--Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia--we  see that even though they are very different in many ways, they all have command economies in  which resources are allocated by politicians and bureaucrats and not by the marketplace The  tool that the politicians and bureaucrats have used to allocate resources has been the financial  system, and the financial systems in all these countries are extremely weak The process of  allocating resources by politicians and bureaucrats through the banking system means that a  country does not produce good bankers and it does not produce good bank supervisors  However, the leaders of these countries have had very long records of success Accordingly, it is  very difficult for them to believe that the leadership they have provided, which has taken  advantage of some very real virtues--such as very high saving rates and tremendous investment  in education that have created a dedicated, hardworking, and well-educated labor force--has  suddenly become wrong They really were not wrong during that long period of success What  they miss is that the world has changed, just as a number of years ago the leaders of the Soviet  Union missed that the world had changed  The command economy simply does not work today in a more integrated world with  very rapid technological developments That means that the leaders in those countries do not  understand, either emotionally or intellectually, how the new economy in which they must    12/16/97 20  operate now functions This is where there is a great deal of confusion that leads to equating  these Southeast Asian situations with that of Mexico in 1994 and 1995 The differences are that  Mexico has had political leadership that very deeply understands how a market economy  behaves; it has had the good luck of having a president who is an outstanding economist and  understands markets very well and, after a short adjustment period, it has had an outstanding  finance minister who also understands very well how markets work; it has a much better, more  market-oriented entrepreneurial sector and a population that sadly has had many centuries of  experience with hardship and thus has the ability to adjust to this new hardship with patience  Therefore, the Mexican economy, with some very creative help from the United States and the  International Monetary Fund, improved rather quickly It began to turn upward in March and  April of 1995, within months after the rescue package was put into effect I do not think that we  can have great confidence that the same favorable outcomes will prevail in Korea, Thailand, and  Indonesia  Among the other countries in Southeast Asia, Malaysia certainly has a very similar  economy, but I think it is involved in an advanced exercise in denial Even countries that have  managed themselves particularly well, Hong Kong and Singapore, are being battered, as the  Singapore dollar was today, by people who view them as command economies They have been  much better managed, certainly in the case of Singapore with a very high degree of integrity at  the official level, but they are still regarded as command economies that may have the same  problem in adjusting to the real world  The Chinese leadership, as Ted Truman suggested, has thus far behaved extremely  well Overnight, the spokesman for Jiang Zemin, the chairman and president, said that they    12/16/97 21  would not devalue their currency Their vice premier for economic management, Zhu Rongji,  who is generally deemed to be the premier-to-be, provides very effective leadership especially  considering that he has lived all of his life in a command economy that is still under Communist  Party leadership He understands rather well how the world economy works One can hope that  China will not add to the problems by making some unfortunate policy mistakes As President  Parry suggested in his questions, the temptations certainly are there  The major command economy in Asia is that of Japan It is after all the Japanese  model that Korea followed Japan basically has the same structural problem Resources are  allocated by bureaucrats and politicians  one has to hope that certain steps will be taken that recognize that the way they have been  managing their economy may have been grand for a while, but it no longer works  If we were to have a continuing contagion from Asia, I think it is very likely, again as  suggested by President Parry in his question and Ted Truman in his answer, that the next country  about which one would have to worry is Brazil The Brazilian real is overvalued in the exchange  markets; the banking sector is extremely weak; and the political system is not functioning well  except when there is a feeling among the politicians that they are about to be infected by Asia  After some improvement in facing reality a couple of weeks ago when the Asian flu seemed  particularly virulent, there appears to have been a return to politics as usual Fortunately, Brazil  has a very good government team at the levels of the president, the finance minister, and the  central bank governor Argentina continues to do well, but because of its Mercosur involvement,  it would not be able to withstand a shock from Brazil    12/16/97  If we look at Europe, there were dire warnings at the recent BIS meeting of the  dangers from Russia Every central bank governor took us aside--Alice Rivlin, Ted Truman,  Peter Fisher, and me--and said they hoped we were not concentrating so much on Asia and on  our own hemisphere that we were unaware of how precarious the Russian economic situation  was That situation is exacerbated somewhat by the most recent illness of President Yeltsen  The leadership that we normally share with Europe is adversely affected, though one should  not overstate this, by the fact that they are heading into the most crucial six-month period for the  creation of the euro The concentration of European political and economic leaders is very much  focused on their own affairs and that of the United Kingdom Even though the United Kingdom  is going to be an "out" initially, though an "in" later, it also is going to concentrate on European  economic affairs by the historical accident that its prime minister is the president of the European  Union for the first six months of next year  Therefore, it would appear that we have a world that is not likely to slide into the  precipice, but that risk is very considerable In my view, what would bring about such a slide  would be the implosion of the financial systems in some of the Asian countries, as happened in a  number of well-developed economies in the 1930s That is not likely to happen but it remains a  possibility  There is a positive side As we have been suggesting, markets probably have  overreacted in relation to fundamentals I think it is less likely but not at all impossible that, if  the Asian financial systems do not implode, the markets would decide that the risk is behind us  Markets participants might decide that there are some very good buying opportunities and that  there could be a recovery The latter probably would be accompanied by a certain amount of    12/16/97 23  euphoria, which could have us entering the meadow that I described There might be a very big  question, if that happened, about the degree of realism that would accompany the euphoria and  whether we would be preparing ourselves for an even more difficult situation a year or two down  the path  In the middle of all this, the United States should continue to do rather well, as Mike  Prell and Ted Truman have suggested and certainly the New York Bank agrees Therefore, I  think we, the central bank of the United States, are in the very fortunate position of being able to  pursue our primary long-term goals of sustained economic growth and price stability However,  I believe there is a tactical aspect relating to what I have described as the precipice on the left  Tactically, I think we should maintain an extremely flexible view of what we need to do, and that  approach should characterize at least our operating view of our responsibilities in the coming  months Thank you   He said, "God, make me pure, but not yet"   Mr Chairman, I think that "B" is the right call  and that it is a clearer choice than the intermeeting adjustment decision I agree with you that,  absent the international events, this might be a rather good opportunity for a 25 basis point  move that could do very little harm in present circumstances and probably some good toward  achieving our goal of price stability But given the international considerations, I believe such a  move would be very ill-advised at this time The financial markets are thin, both because the  markets in Asia are very thin and our normally much more liquid markets are becoming thinner  as we get closer to the end of the year So, this is not a good time for a policy move, which  clearly would be a great surprise in the financial markets  I believe I have become something of a resident theologian on the meaning of  symmetry and asymmetry We have been using asymmetry since the May meeting essentially to    12/16/97 75  indicate that the central bank of the United States remembers that its primary responsibility is to  foster sustained economic growth through price stability and that the balance of risks has been in  the direction of rising inflation even though there has been no evidence in the inflation numbers  to that effect However, I think the international situation currently demands that we be flexible  enough to respond as appropriate to unanticipated developments, so that signaling our general  anti-inflation intent with a bias in the intermeeting adjustment instruction is not desirable at this  point We may wish to return to asymmetry at some later date I certainly do not think we have  reached a point where we would want an asymmetric directive toward easing That would have  to be based on the assumption of an international crisis that we are not in fact assuming On the  other hand, I also think a tightening move would not be appropriate at this time In my view,  there is almost a zero possibility that we would tighten between now and the next meeting  Therefore, the best choice is to move to symmetry, largely to avoid an emotional or intellectual  bias that might make us feel that we could not respond appropriately to any critical development  With that interpretation of what symmetry means, I believe that "B" symmetric is the right  judgment   I will second that   I renominate Peter Fisher   Move approval of the Authorization with  the modifications proposed in Mr Fisher's memo  SPEAKER(?) Second   Move approval, Mr Chairman   Move approval   Mr Chairman, I move approval of the  domestic operations   I was looking around and didn't see any  [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman Recent reports  on the Second District economy point to steady growth That is an improvement over  recent years Both the payroll and household surveys indicate further tightening in the  District's labor markets in December and in the fourth quarter overall Payroll  employment for New York and New Jersey combined grew at an annual rate of 2-1/2  percent during the last three months of 1997 That is up from 2 percent in the prior  quarter Most of the job gains were concentrated in New Jersey and downstate New  York  On the whole, post-Christmas retail sales appear to be running roughly on plan,  with inventories generally at levels that are satisfactory to store owners Unseasonably  mild weather across most of the region has hurt sales of cold weather items and has  caused an inventory overhang of some seasonal merchandise The early January ice  storm that spilled over from the First District and hit part of upstate New York disrupted  business during the first half of the month It is not clear yet what lasting effect that  storm will have    2/3-4/98  The housing markets across the region appear to have gained steam during the  fourth quarter, possibly assisted by unseasonably mild weather Housing permits in New  York and New Jersey, which had slipped below year-ago levels during the spring and  summer months, rebounded in the fourth quarter, and there was unusually brisk activity in  December Single-family sales in New York State have picked up The office vacancy  and availability rates across the metropolitan New York area continue to decline In  midtown Manhattan the availability rate fell from 107 to 91 percent, and in our area  downtown the rate has tumbled from 189 to 155 percent Vacancy rates are similarly  low in suburban areas  I spoke at some length at the last meeting about the possible dangers coming from  the Asian situation and expressed the view that the hoped-for continuation of good  economic performance in the United States and in the world in general depended on the  Asian situation at least not getting seriously worse There has been some progress in Asia  in that conditions in both South Korea and Thailand seem to be improving I don't think  Indonesia can be described that way Japan, if anything, is perhaps even a greater  potential problem as their financial and political paralysis seems to continue  We agree at the New York Bank that the most likely forecast is one along the lines  of that in the Greenbook We see a slowing in growth during the first half of 1998 and  some subsequent strengthening to a growth path of about 2 to 2-1/4 percent However, we  are somewhat more concerned about inflation than the Greenbook That is largely  because, as we continued to disaggregate the ECI, we noted that the employment costs for  those portions of the service sector of the economy in which there is no import  competition are rising rather significantly That is the case not only in the fourth quarter    2/3-4/98  but for about three quarters in a row, and I think it is something we have to watch very  closely  On balance, with the Asian risk on one side and the view that most of us have that  the expansion will slow in the first half on the other, I think we are in a very good policy  position But I agree with a number of other speakers that the Asian situation could make  things worse On the other hand, the economy could be stronger and this rather troubling  increase in costs in the service sector, which basically is not subject to import  competition, could mean that we will have a policy challenge on the upside as well   I prefer alternative I, Mr Chairman    2/3-4/98   I think we have been doing that for some  time   If we cannot explain to the American  people in understandable words, and not very many of them, what it is that we are trying  to achieve, then we are not carrying out our function to create public policy as servants of  the people   You would rather be an employee than a  public servant?   Four or five years ago, I began to think that  a target range for some version of the CPI had the merit that it could be explained and it  would be understandable But as time has gone on, I have come to believe that that does  not work That does not meet the very understandable verbal definition of price stability  that you invented some years ago, namely that we have price stability when people are not  taking inflation into consideration when they make either their investment or household  decisions   I agree But I wouldn't worry about  figuring out some new, very erudite way to express price stability because we already  have the way to express it and it works beautifully I think it is something we ought to  stick to   People will not see it in the transcript for  five years!   I support your "B" recommendation as  well, Mr Chairman In my view, the right thing to do clearly is to remain very much on  alert and not tie our hands in either direction So, I think the correct policy is no change  and symmetry   So moved   Move acceptance   If I could make a comment The people in the  market think that the single least wise thing the Japanese could have done was to reconstitute the  convoy system But that is exactly what they have done As a result, the view is that the 19  largest banks have become a sovereign credit, and therefore the premium was created and there  is still a premium   Precisely, and even though there is a perception  that the bank that failed, Hokkaido Takushoku, was managed reasonably well when it collapsed,    3/31/98  the Japanese are convinced that they did a terrible job because they did not anticipate the  collapse I think the market is saying that, yes, there is a convoy and there is sovereign credit,  but if there is an accident, the winding down of the institution will be managed very badly  Therefore, there is concern that that could have a contagion effect With reference to the Basel  ratios, I think there is a general feeling that the stated ratios are meaningless in assessing the  condition of Japanese banks The rest of us play a game where the ratios mean something, but  for the Japanese banks they really do not We have a sovereign credit with a question associated  with it, as you suggested   Exactly   So moved   Mr Chairman, the Second District is doing so  well that I will not spend any time commenting on it We have reached a point of prosperity in  New York City that has led the Mayor to decide that we should now spend most of our time  being nice to one another  On the national level, what do we know now that we did not know at the last meeting?  There have been some changes From everything we have heard this morning, the Asian effect  on the American economy is going to be less or at least later than we thought it might be at the  last meeting I was particularly impressed by the fact that California, the place that one would  think is most vulnerable to a negative Asian shock, seems to be doing extremely well Consumer  demand is even stronger than we anticipated We have had yet another positive supply shock  coming from lower oil prices The labor markets are tight and may be even tighter than they    3/31/98  were at the time of the last meeting, and there is much anecdotal discussion of some upcreep in  compensation The equity markets are overpriced in my view, but the strong flow into equity  mutual funds, which was very substantial in February and appears to have been very strong in  March, could well push equity prices even higher  One very positive effect of tight labor markets, and one about which we should  rejoice, is that people who normally do not get hired are getting jobs in these markets even  though they may have to be trained before they are able to do these jobs That experience  prepares them better for the labor markets of the future and not just for their current jobs  However, the duration of these jobs is particularly vulnerable to the policy actions that may be  needed to correct an overheated economy So, if we are interested in sustaining that very  positive aspect of our job markets, we have to be especially vigilant and not allow the economy  to overheat  On the other side, I think the problems in Asia are in no way solved Yes, the  economies of Thailand and South Korea probably have bottomed out, are bouncing along the  bottom, and the policy mix in those countries is much better Indonesia's problems certainly are  in no way resolved Japan  A continuing weak Japanese economy  has an adverse effect on the world economy Also, the persistence of such an economy would be  very likely to bring to an end the relatively calm world trade environment We in the United  States are very good at grumbling and complaining and screaming, but we don't do a whole lot  about it Europeans are much better at reacting and, for better or for worse, they definitely react  It is highly likely in my view that if Japan continues to follow its present policy of allowing no  growth or a recession, thereby providing a very weak market for other nations' exports and    3/31/98  fostering a very great desire to export themselves, we are likely to have a serious trade conflict  between Japan and Europe That would not affect the world economy in any positive way!  Since the last meeting, I think we have had a modest shift in the risks to the economy  from balanced to somewhat on the high side In my view, the positive supply shocks that we  have enjoyed are sufficiently likely to continue that, for the present, we can afford the luxury of  some additional waiting But this is not a situation in which the guardian waiting in the night can  allow himself to be lulled into sleep Rather, the guardian should be even more alert It seems to  me that there has been enough of a shift in the risks toward the upside that we have to be very  careful of becoming overconfident about our ability to analyze current problems and relying too  much on the continuation of positive supply shocks and in fact waiting too long   Mr Chairman, I support your proposal I  think it would be unwise to change our policy today, but what you have said and the general  tenor of the comments around the table convince me that we will not hesitate to move when the  evidence is somewhat more clear that that is the appropriate thing to do For now, I believe that  "B" asymmetric toward tightening is the right policy   If the economy continues to move in this  direction between now and the next meeting, I think that we would have to begin preparing the  way I do not object to what Bob Parry is suggesting Marginally, I would prefer that you do it  in a policy speech   So move   Peter, could we go back to your discussion of  what the Bank of Japan has been doing? I think we all agree that they are dealing with a troubled  banking system The Bank of Japan now has a significant amount of bank paper on the asset side  of its balance sheet So, if we had a bank failure in Japan, one of the interesting things that would  happen is that a fair bit of paper from the bank that collapsed would be in the asset structure of the  Bank of Japan   My policy problem is that, since they seem to  have fully refloated the convoy system with 19 banks now limping along in the convoy, part of the  fuel in each of the ships currently is supplied by the Bank of Japan Even though the Bank could  absorb the shock financially, this is another reason why they would be inclined to say, if the  condition of one of those banks did not look so good, that they did not want the additional public  disgrace of acknowledging a write-off on their balance sheet They would therefore want to keep  the bank afloat, which is a further step in the direction of not resolving the problems in their  banking system   Move approval of the domestic operations   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second  District's economy continued to expand at a sturdy pace in the first quarter, but there have been  some signs of slowing in the manufacturing sector in recent weeks Job growth in New York and  New Jersey slowed a bit from a very brisk fourth quarter, with job losses in manufacturing and  government more or less compensating for strong gains in most other sectors As a result, the  unemployment rates were little changed in the two states Retailers are happily reporting that sales    5/19/98  continued to run ahead of their plans in both March and April, and they are satisfied with their  inventory levels Residential and commercial real estate markets both retain a firm tone On the  residential side, our data indicate that new home construction, existing home sales, and home prices  strengthened in the first quarter Office rents in New York City, especially in Manhattan, rose  sharply in the first quarter, and vacancy rates continued to fall Local banks report some slowing in  the growth of loan demand, but they also report further declines in delinquency rates, especially in  consumer loans, so the banking sector looks rather good  At the national level, we do not quite find ourselves ready to buy the productivity  improvement argument in the Greenbook Therefore, although we have about the same picture as  the Greenbook for 1998, we have inflation rising substantially more and heading up toward the 3  percent level in 1999 If that should be the case, namely that productivity does not increase as the  Greenbook says it will and that I personally hope it will, then I think we would be looking for a  monetary policy correction toward the latter part of this year But I believe we are now in a  position in which we can look at the domestic economy and decide that patience has been very  rewarding for the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee over the last couple of years We are at  a position that if we continue to get the productivity shock or if it becomes no longer a shock but a  real improvement in productivity, then policy at its present level would be quite acceptable Even  if productivity growth does not continue to benefit us or other pleasant supply shocks do not come  along, it impresses me that we do have some time to wait  When the Federal Reserve is in a position of being able to wait because that is, I  think, the best policy for domestic purposes, it gives us the opportunity to give the international  effects of our actions a rather high priority From that perspective, I believe that most times the  best thing the United States and the Federal Reserve can do is to manage our own economy well    5/19/98  because of its huge importance in the world economy At present, I sense that the world economic  situation continues to deteriorate The Indonesian situation is still very touch-and-go, with nobody  sure of what the political developments are likely to be and the economy getting more desperately  bad every day Thailand and Korea are improving, but in both countries the improvement is in the  external sector, and there is a very long and a very difficult domestic workout ahead for both  countries It seems to me for reasons that we discussed in conjunction with Peter Fisher's report  earlier that the situation in Japan is, if anything, getting more risky, not less, and it continues to be  the single, greatest threat to a stable world economy  Elsewhere in Asia, India's decision to test thermonuclear weapons caused the United  States to react with financial measures against India, which the Indian economy may or may not be  able to tolerate well However, if Pakistan responds as it may very well do and we have to impose  similar measures against Pakistan, its very weak economy could implode rather quickly The  measures that were taken against Mexican banks yesterday, however justified, are very likely to  create considerable backlash politically in Mexico in a situation in which the leadership is already  having difficulties, and they almost certainly are going to have some serious spillover effects on the  Mexican economy So, the rather optimistic view that one could have about Mexico certainly has  to be tempered  Russia is getting ever more highly volatile The history of Russia has been a long  conflict between the westernizers and the nationalists The nationalists now have a very popular  hero available to them after General Lebed's election victory in Siberia on Sunday The situation  around them with NATO's expansion, however much everybody may think that is a fine idea, gives  additional strength to the nationalists, and if they come to power, we are going to have a very  destabilizing regime--destabilizing not only for Russia itself but for its neighbors    5/19/98  It seems to me that as we look around the world, we see a good American economy  The British are doing reasonably well, but unlike us, their economy does not appear to be  benefiting from rising productivity Therefore, a correction is likely for the British economy  Actually, the two good lights are continental Europe and ourselves On balance, it seems to me that  international considerations would say that an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which  could conceivably be justified domestically for preemptive reasons, would carry such a degree of  risk internationally that I think it would be extremely ill advised Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree completely  with both the recommendation that you have made and the arguments that you have advanced in  favor of it   I second the nomination     The Russians are aggravating the problem  further in their handling of their short-term workout, if there is one, by doing some borrowing in  dollars and other hard currencies and pledging export earnings as collateral   Move approval, Mr Chairman   I also move ratification of the domestic  operations   Even better, the Big Mac index comes to the  same conclusion [Laughter]   They have a very rich economy, with income  and wealth rather well distributed That gives them a capacity to continue an inappropriate  policy for a fairly extended period of time They also have a relatively content electorate so that  there is not the pressure on the elected officials that would normally come in some countries such  as our own    6/30-7/1/98  I think another aspect of President Jordan's question relates to an assumption that the  Japanese economy is more of a market economy than it really is It is a command economy that  worked rather well for an extended period of time because the people commanding it did a  reasonably good job That command structure has broken down to a large extent, but there is not  enough pressure, except that brought by foreigners including recent visitors, to say to the people  running the country that they simply are not going to be allowed to let their currency devalue and  export their way out of the current economic difficulties because the rest of the world will not  permit it We, the rest of the world, will bring enough pressure to bear on you to make it clear  that rising exports are not a solution you will have the luxury to use That may be good policy or  bad policy, but if we look at the effect on the United States and on Europe of having to absorb  the cost of the Asian crisis, we can easily see where the pressure on Japan is going to come from  to manage its economy in a way that is more hospitable for its neighbors in Asia and less  demanding on the rest of the world Japan will have to fill the role that I think we can properly  ascribe to them   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second  District economy has been quite strong in the second quarter Our manufacturing sector, which  is concentrated in the northern half of New Jersey and upstate New York, actually began to look  up a bit until the General Motors strike came along GM has laid off about 5,400 workers of the  10,000 located in Buffalo, some more at a parts plant in Rochester, and about 2,300 in northern  New Jersey That has set manufacturing back a bit Although New York City still has an  unemployment rate of over 7 percent, that rate is down from over 10 percent 8 or 9 months ago,  and the city seems to be on the way to adding more new jobs this calendar year than in any year  since the 1960s So, the city continues to do rather well  As I look at the national and international economies, the word that comes to my mind  is "uncertainty" I think that the forecast, as presented in the excellent staff Chart Show, is a  perfectly reasonable one and one that I sincerely hope will materialize, especially the  international aspect of it However, the downside risk on the international side is very  considerable in my view The situation in Japan impresses me as one in which the economic  data do not tell us the nature of the crisis What we are dealing with in the second largest  economy of the world is a very deep cultural crisis in which the decisionmaking process of the  society, which had served Japan very well since the Meiji Restoration and especially since the    6/30-7/1/98  Second World War, has broken down The decision recommenders and to a large degree the  policymakers have been in the bureaucracy, which is now completely discredited and even more  completely dispirited  During our recent trip to Japan Deputy Treasury Secretary Summers and I found that  leadership for the Japanese nation would now have to come from the largest political party, the  LDP This is a rather significant shift in the way that society is run, and one has to hope that the  shift will work well In my view, the emerging decisionmakers in the LDP probably have a  window of opportunity of about two to three months in which to convince the party members and  other political decisionmakers to take some very difficult steps as regards the restructuring of the  Japanese economy, especially the financial sector There is a real question concerning whether  they will be able to do that  If they do not--that is, if the Japanese people continue to have very low confidence at  both the consumer and business levels and if that doesn't turn around in the next two to three  months--I think that Japan will sink into a deeper recession That inevitably will cause a much  more serious crisis elsewhere in Asia, largely because the situation in Japan would add to the  crisis of confidence in an area where confidence is already abysmally low It is very difficult to  imagine that the effects would not spread to the key countries in Latin America We have seen  that even Chile has become vulnerable and has had to change policies of very long standing,  which they thought had served them very well We have a crisis that is at an advanced stage in  Russia, and it could readily spread to Russia's neighbors Turkey is always an accident that  could easily happen In my view that sort of international financial crisis would not be limited  to an Asian trade effect of, say, 1/2 or 3/4 or 1 percent on U S economic growth, because it is very    6/30-7/1/98  difficult to imagine that that would not spill over into our financial markets and create a rather  large correction  Looking at the purely domestic economy, if the crisis that I believe could emanate  from Japan does occur, the downside risk to our real economy will be very considerable If on  the other hand a crisis in Japan does not happen, the other great uncertainty is whether we will  continue to have the kind of productivity growth that is projected in the Greenbook Lower  productivity growth could reduce the rise in real output to below the Greenbook forecast and  raise inflation to a rate above that in the Greenbook and certainly as high as that in my own  Bank's inflation forecast Our forecast, which appears to be rather similar to a number of  forecasts reported around the table, has inflation rising to about 3 percent next year We simply  don't know whether productivity will continue to "finance" more rapid economic growth with  very low inflation We have been experiencing very nice productivity improvement since the  last quarter of 1995, and even a nonbeliever in the new paradigm like me eventually has to  become convinced, if it goes on long enough, that there really is something new here  Now, it seems to me that if we have this massive uncertainty on the international side  and very considerable uncertainty on the domestic side and we have monetary policy close to  where we want it to be in any event, there is a very, very strong case that the watchful waiting  that has served this Committee so extraordinarily well over the last several years is the right  policy to continue   I want to support the point that has just been  made I think we have enough intellectual resources within the System that have not been  brought to bear on this paper because of the shortage of time It was very difficult for any of us  to spend enough time on it, let alone to have an in-depth discussion with our staffs on it I think  that a robust discussion within the Federal Reserve System, which certainly does not create the  security problem that I believe is a very real one, would be much to be desired   I agree That is the magic of the verbal rather  than the numerical definition of price stability   I am somewhat sympathetic to President  Parry's view, but I think this is a dog that is better left not barking in the night and bringing  attention to the ranges at this time We would have a lot of explaining to do if we said that we  were reducing the debt range to move even more in the direction of price stability I'm not sure  that opening up that argument would be very convincing or worth the trouble The move would  occur at a time when most of us are concerned that, if we look purely at the domestic economy,  the likelihood is that monetary policy might have to be tightened I think giving a signal that  clearly would be interpreted as a weakening of monetary policy would be a terrible idea  Although I sympathize with President Parry's view, I believe we are better off if we retain the  present ranges for all the aggregates   In other words, I would not change the debt  range even though I think you probably are correct intellectually   I think we should not make any changes that  would increase the monetary ranges, and therefore the fine-tuning of the debt range--which is  really all you are suggesting, is it not?   I think that would bring attention to the subject that  we do not need   Thank you, Mr Chairman I am essentially in  agreement with your analysis and with the conclusion I do have modest differences I believe  that the risk on the external side is somewhat greater than you indicated, and it could materialize  even sooner than we have anticipated On the basis of what we now know, what the Liberal  Democratic Party is going to announce in Japan on July 2, which is coming on us rather quickly,  will be very disappointing to the financial markets The big rally that we have had in the yen and  the Nikkei was mainly an end-of-quarter rally as of June 30 Today, when the Nikkei rally  resumed, I think the markets indicated that they are expecting far more out of the announcement  on July 2 than is likely to be there Therefore, the notion, which I think is the single biggest  problem, that the Japanese government and its leading party cannot get their act together could  be on us rather quickly indeed  I agree that the Russian situation is extremely hazardous Since one of the areas of  strength in the world economy is continental Europe, a serious financial crisis in Russia, which  could very quickly turn into a political crisis in a nation with lots of weapons, could easily undo  some of the confidence that has been restored to continental Europe in the last year I think a    6/30-7/1/98  severe worsening of the international situation is certainly not within the range of the probable,  but I would describe it as a risk that is distinctly possible  On the domestic side of the economy, I agree very much with your view, Mr  Chairman, that we do not know whether the wonderful productivity improvement we are  experiencing is going to last You laid out the basis for that uncertainty very well in your  remarks I think the likelihood that wage pressures are going to burst out is not terribly great  What would happen in my view is that in various pockets of the economy people would start to  realize that they could push their employers to pay higher wages, but I think that realization  probably would spread somewhat more slowly than your remarks suggested Therefore, the  price reaction might be somewhat slower as well However, clearly if the domestic economy is  to be looked at in isolation and one assumes that the international crisis will not happen, and we  certainly all hope it will not, then I think we will be in a situation in which the risks to inflation  are sufficiently great that, although I agree we should not change our policy today, an  asymmetric directive toward tightening is certainly in order   Mr Chairman, could I remind us all why we  decided to do it that way? If we change the tilt but not the federal funds rate and we say there is    6/30-7/1/98  "no change" in policy, we are in some sense lying because there has been a change in policy  There has been a change in the tilt   That is why we invented the notion of saying  "the meeting has ended, there is no further announcement"   Had we said that the first time, I suppose we  could continue to say that   The reason that we want to be very clear is  precisely not to deceive the public   I think our current practice has the benefit that  people are used to the way we do it now   If you succeed, you could be a candidate for  one of three Nobel prizes literature, economics, or peace [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I wind up agreeing with the very  fine explanations by President Boehne and Governor Kelley that have been supported by a  number of people, but let me say why First of all, a bit of history The reason that we decided  in February 1994 to announce changes in the funds rate was partly transparency and partly  ethics The Committee's previous policy of making a decision and then having the Desk at the  New York Bank in effect apprise the cognoscenti through its operations in the market seemed, in  my view as someone who had been in the business 22 years, to verge on the unethical The  reason is that it clearly had the effect of letting the insiders know before the unwashed knew So,  one of the main reasons we changed that practice in my view was because it was the right thing  to do, the moral thing to do At the time, we also decided that if there was a change in the tilt, it  would not be announced, and that is how we got into the announcement mode that I mentioned  earlier  It seems to me that we can go one of two ways at the present time We can either stay  where we are, which is what I think we should do, or we can move to announcing as soon as  possible what the policy decision has been I think a number of people who are of the latter  persuasion have concluded that we would probably issue a cleaned-up operational paragraph that  is understandable to the average person I see that as a big problem because such a paragraph  would inevitably state very baldly what is in fact a very sophisticated message Monetary policy  is not an "on and off" switch nor is it a partially on, partially off switch, which is the tilt It is    6/30-7/1/98  rather something that one is trying to do in order to have a better economy at the end of the day  for the good of the American people and people around the world  I think our present policy, which is to make an announcement when there is a change  in the federal funds rate, is very clear and very specific It is easily understandable If we need  some additional explanation of what we are doing, ideally we have the Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony or, if not, the Chairman can either create or take advantage of a speech opportunity  We have the great advantage of having an unusually capable spokesman, who is able to provide  all those measures of subtlety and nuances that I believe are a very important part of the policy  message We simply cannot do that in an announcement that we have to release on the day of  the meeting If we did, we would have exactly the problem that Ed Boehne described so well  We would spend the whole meeting shadowboxing about what we were going say at the end of  the meeting That would take any spontaneity out of the meeting, which is already  unspontaneous enough because of the knowledge that the whole transcript is eventually going to  be released So, people come into the meeting with prepared remarks It is always hard for me  to believe that if we have prepared remarks, we will spend a lot of time listening to the other  people who have been trying to share some information with us  I think that releasing anything on the day of the meeting would make the meeting a  completely unspontaneous set piece, and as a result we would have poor monetary policy It is  wonderful to have transparent monetary policy If we could have the best possible monetary  policy and the most transparent monetary policy, I think that would be the ideal I don't think we  can have both In my view we are better off having the best possible monetary policy explained  to the American people in a way that in fact works quite well, which is what we have now So, I  am very much in favor of retaining our present formula    6/30-7/1/98   This directive is clear by comparison!  [Laughter]   Move approval   If their position does not appear altogether  logical, it is not   Move approval of the domestic operations, Mr  Chairman    8/18/98   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second  District's economy has continued to expand at a strong pace since our last report, led by real estate  and construction Job growth moderated a little in June, but it was brisk in the second quarter  overall Retailers report continued very good sales in July, notably of home durables Retail  prices were steady last month and inventories remained at satisfactory levels Tight real estate  markets persisted in the second quarter Office rents surged at a 27 percent annual rate in  Manhattan but leveled off in the suburbs, and vacancy rates generally were steady  On the national economy, our forecast is somewhat more optimistic on growth and, not  surprisingly, we have the CPI rising a bit more between now and the end of 1999 than does the  Greenbook But by and large, we are in sympathy with the Greenbook forecast What I think has  changed since our last meeting is the balance of risks The risks have moved from a higher    8/18/98  likelihood of rising inflation to a situation in which that possibility still exists but is at least  counterbalanced by the possibility that both the American consumer and the American business  executive will become more cautious, with the result that growth could be reduced to below our  New York forecast or that of the Greenbook I am not suggesting that we fear a recession but  rather quite weak growth  The international situation appears to me to be worse Japan's new government is  doing virtually nothing, and the political opposition has announced its unwillingness to support  the already inadequate banking reform legislation that the government has proposed The  recession in Japan, in my view, is at least as likely to persist--with continuing chilling effects on  the rest of Asia and the rest of the world--as to bottom out and improve A weak Asia, a seriously  troubled Russia, and weakness showing up in Latin America all raise the likelihood that the flow  of capital to the safe havens of the United States and core Europe will not slow down but rather  will continue, making those currencies stronger than they otherwise should be I believe that will  lead to a political furor both in continental Europe and in the United States, especially as people  become, probably appropriately, unhappy with helping Japan solve its problems, to the degree it is  solving them, by drawing in exports from that country  I do not recall a time when there has been more uncertainty in financial markets  Although there has been heavy trading volume in the US equity markets in recent days, that  seems to be concentrated among speculative investors In many other markets, there is  considerably less liquidity as large financial institutions, both observably and from what they tell  us, react to the uncertainty by reducing their trading positions That strategy makes an immense  amount of sense at the level of the firm, but it increases market volatility because of a lack of  liquidity    8/18/98  I have felt for many months that watchful waiting is appropriate for this Committee but  with a view that the risks were in the direction of rising inflation Now I think that the risks are  greater still but much more fully balanced, given the perceptible shift in the direction of the risks  toward inadequate growth Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think your analysis  was exactly right in regard to where we should be with the federal funds rate, that is, alternative B  I very strongly prefer that we move to a symmetric directive for reasons that I stated earlier and  that were expressed by most of the people in the go-around Risks have increased on both sides,  but they are very well balanced in my view As of today, I see no likelihood whatsoever that we  would decide to move the rate between now and the next meeting, and I think our next rate move  is equally likely to be up or down Whatever one's theological view of how the Committee  reaches its decisions on symmetry or asymmetry, one would conclude that a symmetric directive  most clearly reflects the current thinking of the members   We lost you just after you mentioned the  widening of spreads and the stock market   Mr Chairman, there is no question in my mind  that if this were September 29 I would be in favor of lowering the federal funds rate I believe that  the deterioration in markets, especially in credit markets last Thursday and Friday, and the  continuation of that turmoil today all tell me that your accepting the invitation to appear on  Wednesday and in your inimitable fashion guiding the listeners there and in the markets to  anticipate that we are likely to be moving on the 29th is something that is highly desirable I agree  with you that the likelihood of significant further market deterioration in the near term is not high,  but I think it is important enough for the members of the FOMC to endorse your giving that signal  on Wednesday   Tom, the reference I was making to the concern  about markets relates mainly to domestic markets, especially the fixed income markets We have  seen a tremendous widening of spreads even in the Treasury market between the on-the-run  Treasury securities and the other Treasury securities where there might be a difference in maturity  of three months, and we have started to see evidence that people are reducing their involvement in  financial markets We see people cutting back on counterparty exposure lines The market is in  one of those periods where it is starting to feed on itself in a rather dangerous way This  development is evident in fixed income markets more generally and in other G-7 countries, let    9  alone in markets for some of the more exotic financial instruments such as debt and equity  derivatives It is my strong feeling that markets are no longer functioning very well that leads me  to believe that we should not only take action next week but that it is quite important for a signal to  be given this week to prepare the way for that action We should not let the week go by without the  Fed through the Chairman's testimony promoting a little smoothing   Move approval   Mr Chairman, I think it might be worth  thinking about why we do what we do before we change it One of the realities is that by  releasing the minutes of a meeting two days after the following meeting, the decision on the tilt  at the earlier meeting may be interesting but it is no longer very important We already have  decided either to ease or not to ease or to tighten or not to tighten at the meeting that took place  two days before Why have we thought that use of the tilt has served our cause well? In my  view it has helped us to focus on what we want to do in terms of guiding our policy between one  meeting and the next or at least in terms of a longer-term view of where we are headed I think  that has served us very well    9/29/98  If we decide to release the minutes earlier, which in and of itself is probably a good  idea, my analysis of the collective psychology of this group is that in fact, as Alice Rivlin  suggested, we will not do a whole lot of "tilting" The reason is that if we are going to announce  the tilt either right away or shortly before the next meeting by releasing the minutes early, we  will create a difficult conundrum for this central bank Central bankers are supposed to be  believers in price stability Even if we are symmetric in our approach to inflation, as I think  many of us are, in the sense that we are opposed to both inflation and deflation, the public  believes that central bankers are supposed to be inflation fighters We have to remind them  every now and then that we are against deflation also I can envision us sitting around this table  saying that we ought to have a directive that is biased toward tightening, and some of us would  then say that we ought to go ahead and tighten But if we do not want to tighten at a meeting,  then it would be better not to announce after the meeting that we are thinking about doing it later  Doing the latter would in my view make us look a little questionable in our judgment or at least  in our strength of character On the other hand, if we are thinking of easing but are not sure we  want to ease at a given meeting, people would conclude that that is a rather reasonable thing for  central bankers to be doing So, with an early announcement we would wind up in my view of  the real world more likely to tilt toward easing and less likely to tilt toward firming  Even though I believe that it would be a good idea in principle to release the minutes  early, and therefore I don't feel very strongly about whether we announce the tilt or the absence  of a tilt shortly after a meeting, I think it is likely that with such an announcement the use of a tilt  would become a fairly rare phenomenon Most of the time when we think that economic  conditions, the financial markets, and monetary conditions are such that it might be appropriate  to ease monetary policy at some point, we as good central bankers might not be entirely sure of    9/29/98  the need for easing quite yet, so we would not do it Therefore, I'm not sure what we would  accomplish by changing our procedures  To summarize, prompt announcements make us look like believers in transparency;  that is good They make us look like we are sharing information with the American people; that  is good But in terms of actually serving the interests of the American people well--and I think  we have been doing a phenomenally good job in that regard, leaving collective modesty aside--I  am not sure that a change in our announcement procedures would improve our performance   May I hazard an observation? I think one  lesson the market learned from Russia is that if there was any country the G-7 wanted to keep  from going into free fall, it was Russia because of the potential geo-political consequences I  believe there is a general view that Russian behavior at the official level was so awful that it was  impossible for the G-7 to keep supporting such a country That reminded people that even if the  G-7 is trying to do something, the host country has to be reasonably responsible in order to allow  the effort to go forward, much less to assure success On top of the other things that you  suggested, Mr Chairman, and that Peter has been discussing, I think this experience was a  reminder that even if the G-7 has its act together perfectly, it is limited by the host country's  willingness and ability to cooperate    9/29/98   Yes   Move approval, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second  District economy has slowed somewhat during the third quarter, with continuing job losses in the  manufacturing and government sectors Not surprisingly, the anecdotal evidence is considerably  weaker than the data There is real concern throughout the District about the growth prospects  both for the Second District economy and that of the nation This lesser degree of optimism or  beginning of pessimism is not reflected only in the financial sector, where it is quite  understandable, but around the District as a whole Needless to say, some major firms in the  financial sector have announced rather significant losses that have important implications for the    9/29/98  tax revenues of state and local governments in our District The firms in the securities industry  and the banks that compete with them are very concerned about their profit prospects in the  fourth quarter because of their sharply reduced deal flows  Our national forecast is somewhat more optimistic than that of the Greenbook, in part  because we do not have quite as strong a wealth effect But our sensitivity analysis to our own  forecast has a downside alternative that produces an outcome that is quite close to the  comparable alternative in the Greenbook Like everybody else, we see the main source of the  weakness as stemming from the effects of international weakness on the performance of the  American economy  Let me speak briefly on how I interpret the very wide credit spreads that have  emerged I don't spend a whole lot of time worrying about the level of prices in the equity  markets because I think the credit markets are really more important for the economy as a whole  The spreads in the credit markets were certainly unnaturally tight earlier this year, but the  correction has carried these spreads well beyond a return to normalcy The current spreads are  very wide indeed, and they indicate in my view that we have to be concerned on the downside  that risk aversion will become unduly great The result could be that not only would the credit  markets be essentially unavailable to firms that normally deal with banks, but the banks  themselves might in this environment become sufficiently risk averse that we could get a credit  crunch I am not forecasting that, but I see it as a serious downside risk that we have to be  concerned about I think we have to be extremely attentive, especially in the Reserve Banks with  our proximity to the banks in our Districts, to whether that is happening or not There is no  question that in the securities firms and banks with which I am familiar, the executive vice  president in charge of marketing has been put in the closet and the executive vice president in    9/29/98  charge of credit is now in front taking charge That is a good development as long as it does not  get into the risk aversion area to a point where a credit crunch could follow   Mr Chairman, I agree with your proposal to  cut the fed funds rate by 25 basis points Being the resident theologian on the meaning of "tilt," I  would say that a tilt in the direction of further ease is more reflective of what the Committee  thinks is likely to happen and where the risks are located So, I, rather more strongly than you,  prefer an asymmetric directive   Yes, Mr Chairman I want to give the  Committee members some background about the involvement of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York in helping a number of private sector financial institutions arrive at a decision to inject  capital into Long-Term Capital Portfolio (LTCP) Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a  hedge fund management company established in 1994, created a set of funds that collectively are  called Long-Term Capital Portfolio The founder was John Meriwether His senior colleagues  are David Mullins, formerly of this Board, and two Nobel Prize winning economists/  mathematicians, Bob Merton and Myron Scholes, plus some others, most of whom were  recruited from Salomon Brothers where Meriwether had worked before  They were quite successful in 1994 and very successful in 1995 and 1996 In each of  those two years they returned to their investors over 40 percent of their initial investments after  the deduction of very considerable fees by the management company All their investors were  either firms or high net worth individuals who invested a minimum of $10 million During this    9/29/98  period, the fund's performance exhibited a very low level of volatility They were consistently  successful, and, not surprisingly, they apparently began to believe very firmly in their ability to  continue to be successful They did not take essentially one-sided bets on transactions Rather,  they were speculating on spreads of the kind that Peter Fisher described earlier, and over time  they also went into spreads on equities as well as fixed-income instruments In 1997, they were  somewhat less successful If I remember correctly, they had a return of about 17 percent At the  end of the year, they decided that market opportunities were not as great as in previous years and  that they could not profitably use as much capital as they had previously, so they returned about  $28 billion to their investors The year 1998 has been considerably less successful; by the end  of August, they had lost 52 percent of the capital that they had at the start of the year During  August, LTCM officials approached some very prestigious financial firms in New York to see if  additional investors could be brought in On Wednesday, September 2, Meriwether sent a letter  to the investors of LTCP Knowledge of that letter became quite widely spread Meriwether  reported the losses, but he also expressed a great deal of confidence He said in his letter that he  thought there were investment opportunities and he encouraged his existing investors to invest  more At the same time, as I mentioned, he was seeking new investors, both directly and  through some securities firms  Meriwether and Mullins informed me on September 15 that they had to raise a  significant amount of additional capital--about $1 to $1-1/2 billion--in order to support the risk  positions of LTCP and have the staying power that they needed Two days later, they informed  our Bank that they had been unsuccessful in that regard That is, they were not able to raise the  money directly or through the securities firms they were using  You may remember that the markets were very turbulent on September 18 In such  situations I make an effort, as did all my predecessors in this job, to talk to the heads of the major    9/29/98  banks and securities firms in New York My purpose is to get a feel for two things--what they  think is going on in the markets and how their own firm is doing Early in the day I had heard  from Messrs Meriwether and Mullins who told me that their losses were continuing I thanked  them for the information It was fascinating to me that every head of the 8 to 10 firms that I  talked to subsequently during the day brought up the problems of LTCM/P independently of  anything that I said They gave particular emphasis to what in their view would be the very  serious problems that a failure of that firm would create in financial markets They were not  talking particularly about the problems that such a failure would cause for their own firms but  rather about the problems that it would cause for the financial markets in general  The reason those problems could arise is that LTCM, because of its previous success,  was able to take positions with its counterparties in the market that essentially involved creditors  lending to them with no initial margin That is, if LTCP were financing a position of 100, their  creditors would lend them 100 So, LTCP did not have any limitation on the size of its positions  based on the need for an initial margin The result was that the firm's positions in a variety of  instruments around the world were very large What my contacts were talking about was the  effect that the failure of the firm would have on world markets if all these positions had to be  dumped on the markets People who thought they had an offsetting position with LTCP would  suddenly find that they did not have one They would find themselves with big open positions  that they had to worry about  Late in the day on September 18, a major securities firm that had been very involved  in trying to find equity investors for LTCP informed me that they had asked LTCM if they, the  securities firm, could share with the Federal Reserve their knowledge of the positions and  condition of Long-Term Capital Portfolio Long-Term Capital Management said that they would  rather explain their situation to us directly I agreed on Saturday, September 19, that Peter Fisher    9/29/98  would lead a group of people to visit the firm in Greenwich on Sunday To make a long story  somewhat shorter, he and his group, which included Dino Kos and some others, were joined by  Mr Gensler of the US Treasury At that point I was in an awkward position because, wearing  my supervisor hat, I had to go to London to give a speech and hold a press conference The  nature of my position is such that if I did not make my scheduled speech at a time when rumors  were circulating in New York about a number of securities firms--not just LTCP--market  participants might conclude that a firm was about to fail That was not a signal that I wanted to  give  Fortunately, my distinguished colleague, Mr Fisher, could remain in New York and  set up a team He did a lot of the dealing with LTCM He and I engaged in lengthy discussions,  and we shared the view that the collapse of Long-Term Capital Portfolio would create chaotic  financial markets around the world and that nobody could make a good estimate of what the  likely damage would be By this time we knew that view was shared by Goldman Sachs, Merrill  Lynch, JP Morgan, and shortly after, UBS To go back to some conversations that we had earlier  today, it was our view that the effect of the firm's failure would be to depress equity markets and  to create widening spreads in fixed-income markets What the downside effect of that would be  on many economies, including that of the United States, could not be easily ascertained It also  became clear that even though LTCM had been working with at least the four firms that I  mentioned, they had not been able to establish enough of an identity of interests to make it  possible for the private investors to get the interested parties together These were deemed by  this time to be approximately 17 financial institutions around the world that had very large  counterparty positions with LTCP  We essentially saw only two likely scenarios since we were convinced that the private  sector group could not get itself in a room to work out a possible solution Either there would be    9/29/98  a failure of LTCP or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would play its traditional role in  this type of situation We knew that our intervention would put the prestige of the Bank on the  line; put the Federal Reserve, of which it is a part, in the morning newspaper; and put the  personal reputation and prestige of the President of the Bank who made the decision on the line  As I saw it, our intervention was preferable to letting the firm collapse in the belief that we were  good at damage control So, I made the decision that we had to play that role, working through  Peter Fisher for a good portion of its implementation  Peter held a series of meetings, but the climactic meeting occurred last Wednesday at  which 15 firms were represented I began the meeting by explaining that if it was possible for  the private sector firms to reach a decision in their interest--one that was freely arrived at by  them because there would be no public money involved--that would be in the best interests of  markets in general and of the people who depend on markets At the end of the day, the private  sector firms reached a conclusion after a very long struggle We stayed out of the fray, but it  was perfectly clear in light of the fact that we were present--I was in the room; Peter was in the  room; the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange was in the room--that we had an interest in  their coming to a conclusion The conclusion reached, including all the terms and the conditions,  was theirs, not ours It was not suggested by us; it was not guided by us  In a subsequent series of meetings, the details were finally worked out with some  difficulty Late in the afternoon on Friday, I was asked by the person presiding over the private  sector group if the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would "authorize a meeting of the  seniors," that is, the people who had been in our board room on Wednesday, or invite them to the  meeting, or attend the meeting, or ask Peter Fisher to attend the meeting I said "None of the  above We got you folks to a point where you could all be in the room and where you could find  it possible to arrive at a decision But if there still are difficulties in your closing the deal, you    9/29/98  have to resolve them" The problem with our convening the meeting and sitting there glowering  at people to induce them to reach an agreement is that if they were not able to solve the problem,  then it would be our deal The Federal Reserve would be excessively, inappropriately, and  unwisely involved  So, the involvement of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was essentially to  bring the parties together because we agreed with the heads of four of the major securities firms  in the world that a failure of LTCP would bring chaotic market conditions, with immeasurable  and essentially inestimable damage to economies around the world That was a sufficiently great  danger that we believed we should use the premises and the good offices of the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York to bring people together so they would have an opportunity to reach a  conclusion  Peter Fisher can answer any number of questions you might have on the details, but  my summary is essentially the story regarding the Federal Reserve's involvement We put the  name of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the line, and of course it is part of the  Federal Reserve System I put on the line my personal prestige of being in that business most of  my life and therefore being considered by the other participants in the room as having a  knowledge of these things I believe we did the right thing, but I certainly understand why others  could say we went a little too close to the edge or we went over the edge Thank you, Mr  Chairman   They were looking at both in my view There  was a good deal of concern about the macroeconomic effects There also was a belief or    9/29/98  assumption that if the LTCP collapsed, spreads would widen put, it would be very difficult to  mark positions to market, and there could be some chaos for a week or two where it would be  very difficult for markets to function During that period, certainly, the mark-to-market losses  for the firms would be moving in all directions Therefore, there is no question in my view that  they thought they would be better off if there were a solution They get paid for making that  kind of judgment in the interest of their shareholders There also was quite a lot of discussion,  which sounded rather sincere, that they as the "seniors" of the financial services business in New  York had a responsibility to the financial system But were they also strongly motivated by the  best interests of their firm? Without question   Richard Spillenkothen might be able to pick  this up better A staff group from the Board of Governors and the New York Reserve Bank  made a number of visits last December to the major banks, both national banks and state member  banks, and put out a memorandum on the subject in April   Rich, it could well be that, with the rapid  growth of LTCP and the increasing involvement of banks in dealing with hedge funds, the banks  may not even have been dealing with LTCP at the time of the previous exam   I think there was in place a credit management  system that appeared to make a great deal of sense   No, the lenders, including the institution with  which you were once associated One may question the notion that at least for some lenders  there was no initial margin requirement Beyond that issue, it should be emphasized that the  lenders had very good collateral management systems so that if the LTCP began to lose on a  position, it would need to put added collateral in place What we have to get our hands around  conceptually is whether there was something that we missed that could have provided us with  some notion of just how big the overall position of LTCP had become I don't know how we  could have done that We do not regulate that firm But given the number of institutions they  dealt with around the world, was there a way that should have enabled us to be more aware of  their overall position? One is inclined to say, "you bet" But exactly how we could have done  that I am not so sure   Yes, but the balance sheet is a relatively small  piece of the whole action because so much of the latter is off-balance-sheet   They may have one now   This tells us that there was something in the  way that the financial services institutions as a group were dealing with at least this firm that  allowed a position to be built up that was very dangerous   The biblical justice in this situation is that the  principals of LTCM apparently believed so firmly that this system would continue to work that  they appear to have borrowed rather heavily to increase their own risk positions in their firm  So, there is a general and spreading belief that we may have some extraordinarily elegant people  in private bankruptcy court in the fairly near future   We do not know of any other hedge fund that  would be remotely of the size of LTCM/P If John Meriwether can do it, there certainly would    9/29/98  have to be other smart individuals with computers who could engage in the same sort of activity  So, there have to be little versions of LTCM/P Most of the other very well known hedge funds  operate much more in the direction of one-way bets They can lose $2 billion in Russia, and one  can say that is a shame Well, it is a shame for them but not of much concern for anybody else   The lenders continue to be collateralized as the  firm starts to lose money but only so long as the firm has capital to continue to provide added  collateral to make up for the losses As the losses continue to mount, the firm at some point--   Remember, on day one there was no initial  margin   You made the loan but since there was no  initial margin, there was no collateral   That's right   I suggest that what would be valuable for the  Committee, for all of us, would be to make certain assumptions about market developments and  then see what the bookkeeping effects would be How does firm X suffer a loss because of its  relationship with LTCP? This gets us into very sophisticated accounting and complex analyses    9/29/98  of losses I think we are all trying to make estimates on the fly, but that is not going to give a  very accurate description of how it really works   I agree that we are going to need that  information for our testimony, which is being prepared by some of the people who are sitting at  the end of this table   I assume that one of the things we will want to  talk about is the fact that we had staff, other than those who were conducting examinations, who  were meeting with the management people to examine the nature of their dealing with hedge  funds In their report, the staff mentioned LTCM/P as one of the customers of some of the  institutions What did we learn there? What might we have learned in addition? It is not as if  we were asleep I think that as we write the testimony, which already is in process, we will have    9/29/98  a story The only fully convincing story is that the problem did not happen, and we know that is  not the case [Laughter]   One of the things that we have to be able to  say to Congress is whether the state-chartered banks that we supervise participated in the equity  piece or not I do not know the answer at this point   We will say what we know, and then we will  say what we do not know and are trying to find out   There was a foreign bank, UBS, that was a  large investor and its investment accounted for a good chunk of the loss that the bank announced  last Thursday   We think it was Switzerland, but that is again a  fact that we have to establish It also has now been reported in the press that some senior officers  of the securities firms, we think not of the banks, were involved as individuals either through a  retained earnings fund for senior executives at their institutions or directly as investors in  Long-Term Capital Management   This tells you that the move toward risk-based  supervision is the right way to be going   We should try to get enough facts to make sure  that they are doing what they say they are doing That is what is needed to give an intelligent    9/29/98  answer to the question If I sound a little anxious, it is because the people who should be writing  the testimony are here involved in this discussion, including me Much as I want to share all of  this with you, we have to be sitting down before Mr Leach at 1000 am on Thursday morning  There's a lot of work to be done before then   How do we know? We do not know   We have our usual antennae out That is how  we learned from a variety of sources that LTCM/P was getting into trouble We can surmise on  the basis of what has happened to spreads that, although they may get worse, anybody who had  an opportunity to get into trouble certainly had a tremendous opportunity If nothing else, one  would think that the rumor mill would have brought to our attention that firm X was having  difficulties We hear all kinds of rumors in the financial markets, but we have not heard of a  hedge fund that would appear to be remotely of the size and macroeconomic risk potential of a  LTCM/P   I think there were two major credit lines, one of  which was drawn down It was a $900 million line of which slightly under $500 million was  drawn down and participated out I think, however, that most of the transactions we have been  talking about here involve counterparties rather than syndications   Yes, one to the management company and one  to the partnership    9/29/98   We have to be very careful because as  horrendous as this experience was, if we assume that the normal market is that the Russians are  going to default once a week, the cost of capital would go so high that nobody would ever invest  in anything   That is why this central banker was happy to  call a meeting but wanted to make it absolutely clear that our money was not going to be made  available   In one respect the Fed is a bank supervisor; in  another the Fed as the central bank has some degree of responsibility for financial stability I  think that implies a broader discussion   It sounds as if we have exhausted this  interesting subject for now or at least it has exhausted me   Thank you, Mr Chairman What we are seeing  here in the financial markets in the United States, which certainly reflect financial conditions  elsewhere, is a very dramatic increase in risk spreads Let me give you some examples  The spread between the on-the-run 30-year Treasury bond and the most recently issued  Treasury bond before it, which normally runs at about 4 or 5 basis points, moved up after the    10/15/98  Russian debacle to about 12 basis points Then, in the middle of September it moved up some  more and it is now at about 27 basis points Again, that compares with the usual 4 to 5 basis  points The interest rate volatility measures remain unusually high The actual volatility on the  long bond has moved up to about 23 basis points It usually runs at about 5 The implied  volatility has moved up from its usual level of about 8 to 14  The quality spread that we tend to look at the most is that between US Treasuries and  the fixed-interest part of a swap So it involves looking at prime bank rates, if you will,  compared to US Treasuries The two-year, which normally runs at about 35 basis points, is now  over 70 The 10-year, which is I think the most significant, normally runs at about 50 basis  points and is now approximately 95 The spread between Treasuries and 10-year investment  grade securities--Ford Motor Company would be a typical example--usually runs at about 75  basis points; it is now 124 If we look at the Merrill Lynch bond index for BBB securities, which  is an indication of the rate for medium-sized companies in the capital markets, the normal spread  between those BBBs and Treasuries is usually about 32 percentage points and it is now at about  63 percentage points This is an indication, I believe, not only that the spread is very broad, but  that no financial officer who is not smoking pot would actually try to issue in this kind of market  We have the very unusual situation of Treasuries yielding more than municipal bonds So, we  are observing a concern for quality in the municipal market as well  For the mortgage-backed security spread, which of course has a close relationship to the  construction industry, especially the home construction sector, the normal relationship with  Treasuries is about 110 basis points A week ago it was up to about 195, and it has now backed  off to about 170    10/15/98  An indication that financial market participants are particularly concerned about the  quality of financial securities firms shows up in the relationship between the S&P 500 and the  stock indexes for money center banks and investment banks If we go back to the end of October  1997, the S&P 500 is up a little, not a whole lot, from its level at that time It is now about 102  percent of its level then The money center bank index has declined to just under 80 percent of its  year-ago level, and the number for investment banks is down to about 75 percent We are not, of  course, in the business of having to worry about those institutions and their shareholders in the  management of our affairs, but this is an additional indication of the run into quality and the  tremendous risk aversion we are seeing  Just a word about the clearing systems We have had to keep fed wire open late for the  last several days because of requests from the securities firms and the banks--Chase and BONY--  that clear for them, largely as hedge fund positions are unwound That is something that is a  normal part of our business, but I think it is another indication of some hiccups in financial  markets Depository Trust Corporation has been concerned about the availability of liquidity to  some of their participants, especially the smaller ones At the clearing corporations, the clearings  seem to have been going reasonably well, and CHIPS has been functioning quite well  Generally speaking, Mr Chairman, what we are seeing in the financial markets here is a  very significant run into high quality instruments of the kind that has not been seen for a very  long time even by people like me who have been around for a long while Even in the most liquid  market of the world, the US Treasury market, there is an incredible broadening of spreads  between on-the-run securities and the most recent off-the-run securities, and between mortgage-  backed obligations and Treasuries In general, we are seeing a run to quality and a rather serious  drying up of liquidity Not to be an alarmist, the important thing I think is that with the exception    10/15/98  of having to keep fed wire open, the payments and clearing systems seem to be functioning okay  Thank you, Mr Chairman   The Ellington Capital Management firm was late  on margin calls and that is one of the reasons that its positions have had to be unwound   The other firm that Solomon Brothers cleared out,  MKP Capital, had also been late on some margin calls We have not been hearing anything on  LTCM There was a short period, a few days of teething problems, when the five firms  comprising the oversight committee sent their people to LTCM to begin the process of managing  the firm rather differently But there does seem to have been a greater relaxation in the market  about LTCM and a feeling that the firms that recapitalized it have the staying power and the  willingness to unwind its positions on an orderly basis so they do not just move the market  against themselves    10/15/98   I believe there probably are some skeletons still  rattling around closets that have not been revealed yet We do not know Even the darkest  rumors do not suggest anything of the size or shape or potential magnitude of LTCM I think it is  a reasonable assumption that we would hear about it if it were there But that is an assumption; it  is not a certainty I think we can safely assume that there will be some other banks that will have  to report some losses based on dealing with people who with hindsight they wish they had not  been dealing with   In a run to quality, Tom, I think we always have a  certain irrational quotient involved So, if you were to ask the people racing into Treasuries, and  especially into on-the-run Treasuries, whether they are more worried about the Ford Motor  Company than they were two months ago, they would say "of course not" On the other hand,  their behavior suggests that they have that concern The other aspect to it, by the way, is that we    10/15/98  think the spreads would probably be wider were it not for a general view in the market that the  high quality credits will not be issuing new obligations So, if we look at the AAs, their nominal  rates have actually come down some It is the spread that has increased substantially But the  view in the Street here is that the reason the nominal rates have come down is the expectation  that there will be a reduction in supply, if only in the absence of new issues reaching the market  Firms simply will not be issuing new obligations and securities that mature will not be replaced   Mr Chairman, this is Bill again, if I could  comment The rating agencies have, from what we are hearing around town, an extremely high  anxiety level about the financial services firms I would not be surprised if we got some  additional downgrades or putting on watch of securities firms and perhaps banks, more likely  securities firms Obviously, the rating agencies have to do what they have to do, but in an  already very illiquid market that would not be helpful   Sandy Krieger and Dino Kos are shaking their  heads with enormous negative vigor I have not seen that nor have they and, of course, they are  right on the Desk all day long    10/15/98   Mr Chairman, Bill McDonough here   I noticed that you really asked only if people  strongly disagreed with what you plan to do I do not strongly disagree at all I think it would be    10/15/98  a great idea if we just told you that we think that, as usual, you are doing a fabulous job and  allow you and the other Board members to meet promptly to approve a reduction in the discount  rate   Mr Chairman, Bill McDonough I fully agree  with Alice   Mr Chairman, could I take the liberty as Vice  Chairman of the Committee to thank you for the courtesy that you have shown your fellow  members of the FOMC and the other Reserve Bank presidents by having this meeting   So move   Mr Chairman, I understand the logic of Option  3, but when we talk about risks to the forecast, we are engaging in internal Fedspeak Jerry  Jordan has picked up on the concern I would have about mentioning risks in this context, namely  that the average American would conclude that we thought economic growth was a risky thing  In popular use, it is a word that could get us into some trouble So, I end up being very  comfortable with the alternative language of Option 2 With some amendments from Tom  Hoenig to the earlier version, that option captures what we found reasonable at the last meeting I  believe that even when we have no tilt, we need the disputed sentence, "any potential changes in  the federal funds rate operating objective during the intermeeting period should be considered in    11/17/98  that context" That sentence makes it clearer that the Chairman has the power--in fact there is no  question about that in my view--and the good will of his colleagues on the Committee so that if  circumstances in the intermeeting period should indicate the desirability of a change in policy, he  can implement the change The courtesy that you have shown us, Mr Chairman, at least in the  5-1/2 years that I've been sitting here, has been such that I don't think there's the slightest worry  that that power would not be used wisely and well So, I think it's very important that the  sentence in question be retained   Mr Chairman, could I explain why, unlike  some others, I feel as I do on the Option 2 sentence in question?   I just wanted to clarify my view on the "any  potential changes" sentence and why it should be included in the directive Those who say that it  should not be there are saying that it is redundant, and for us around this table it is redundant  But we are not the only audience There is a whole world out there filled with Fed watchers and    11/17/98  journalists I am firmly persuaded that, however abnormal it may appear, these outside observers  would read the absence of that sentence right after an intermeeting easing of the funds rate as an  indication that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to take a power away from the  Chairman, which he traditionally has had I can assure you that that's how it would be  interpreted That is not our intent, but our intent is not very relevant That would be the way it  would be interpreted It would involve us in a big brouhaha about nothing If those who object  to the sentence think it is redundant, that's a very small price to pay to avert a highly political  event that would dismay all of us I really encourage us not to do that   I think such clarifications tend to get lost, and  this problem would be perpetuated meeting after meeting In the effort to eliminate redundancy,  we really would be inviting a problem that we don't need to have   That, I think, is the magic of the original  drafting It picked up the "in coming months," which is longer than the intermeeting period, but  it gave the Chairman the power to adjust policy in the intermeeting period It explained with the  greatest clarity how we, in fact, behave   Agreed Correctly stated   It becomes clear only if you put in  "intermeeting period"   I would like to applaud what Tom Hoenig just  said about finding ways to make the use of the discount window a more normal step in American  banking circles  On the TIPS issue, it seems to me that by our inactivity in the TIPS market we have  been saying that indexed securities somehow are different from other Treasury securities And  our failure to treat them like other government securities says either that we do not approve of  them or that we are refraining from buying them in order to help them to become a more reliable  predictor of inflation However, it seems to me that by treating indexed securities differently and  by not having our normal relationship with the dealers in regard to these securities we adversely  affect the supply and demand for indexed securities relative to other securities It would be  better, as a marginal enhancement to the liquidity of the SOMA and to have a balanced view of  US Treasury securities in general, to buy indexed securities along the lines of the very modest  program that Peter Fisher has suggested than not to buy them   Second   Mr Chairman, if I could make a comment  The Mexicans are not so much interested in the swap lines per se They would like to have the  world begin to think of Mexico as part of North America, not Latin America, and anything that  appears to foster that view is very important to them   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Move approval   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second  District economy is slowing The manufacturing sector in northern New Jersey and western  New York is participating in the general slowing of manufacturing nationally and the growth in  the service sector is not sufficient to make up for it The housing area is also somewhat weaker  Commercial construction is slowing, largely because of restricted availability of credit Retail  sales were weak in September and bounced back some in October and early November  Nationally, I believe that the Greenbook has it about right Like the Greenbook, we  see economic growth well below trend in 1999, with recovery to something more like trend    11/17/98  growth in 2000 Inflation is clearly well controlled We think that the weakness in fixed income  markets, although somewhat reduced, is still a potentially serious risk to the real economy  When we look at the likely pressure on the banking sector, it is worth remembering that about 25  percent of C&I loans come from the money center banks and about another 25 percent come  from foreign banks operating in the United States Both the money center banks and the foreign  banks are dependent, just as their commercial customers are, on purchased money We believe  that year-end pressure on the money center banks, which they are very concerned about and  already are seeing, could well exacerbate the problem in fixed income markets Certainly, the  pressure that the money center banks will face will be more than that experienced by the foreign  banks  Consequently, I think there is a possibility, not a probability but a distinct possibility,  that the month of December could be a particularly difficult one and that the problems in the  financial sector could mean that Main Street, which has been holding up very resiliently as many  have pointed out, will be adversely affected Therefore, I believe that the risk coming from the  domestic economy and the considerable risk coming from the foreign sector indicate that the  Greenbook forecast, whose growth in 1999 I would not find adequate, is more likely than not the  better of the cases that we can expect Thus, the downside risk is still very considerable and  points to the need for some additional action on our part Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree fully and  rather enthusiastically with your recommendation One might wonder why those of us who have  talked about year-end pressures would find symmetry appropriate The reason I do is that if we  have severe year-end pressures and have to react, the need would be so obvious that there would  not be a whole lot of debate I am hopeful that that will not be necessary Therefore, I think  symmetry is the right answer   So move   I think there may be a distinction The  accounting probably is bond-by-bond But if you are managing the portfolio, you are going to  say "It is approaching breakeven so I better get rid of it" I think the accounting would be the  way you described, but the managerial approach would be to bunch these securities   Move approval of the Desk's actions and  adding the euro to the current list of designated currencies    12/22/98   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second  District's economy has generally shown increasing signs of strength in the past month Private  sector job growth in both New York and New Jersey accelerated modestly in November The  unemployment rate held steady at 51 percent Purchasing managers when surveyed say that  they see some strengthening in manufacturing The purchasing managers also saw continued    12/22/98 42  brisk growth in the nonmanufacturing sectors in the month of November Our part of the  country is really not very dependent on trade with Asia; the trade flows are in other directions  The retailers, as in most parts of the country, report that sales are below plan, especially in winter  outerwear Manhattan's office market, which has been very strong, is showing some signs of  softening in the fourth quarter Office vacancy rates picked up a little in October and November  and price increases slowed The purchase prices for other commercial properties turned down  That is probably very closely related to the weakness in the financial services sector in the third  quarter  We think the domestic economy is well balanced and should grow at about trend or  slightly below in 1999 and 2000 This expected slowdown is likely to keep inflationary  pressures under control on the assumption that we will maintain the present policy stance  Foreign influences are likely to continue negative, with Brazil clearly the major danger and one  that is growing, unfortunately Our policy actions this fall--our three reductions in official rates  and the related though not coordinated reduction in interest rates in Euroland--have helped  reduce the considerable danger in fixed income markets The likelihood that both the Federal  Reserve and the European Central Bank will maintain official interest rates for the early months  if not a bit longer next year is a very good background for a successful introduction of the euro  And I think that will have a somewhat stabilizing influence It is much to be hoped that the  transition will go smoothly If it does not, since it is so much easier than the year 2000  transition, I think it would increase the anxiety level considerably for the Y2K change  The New York Reserve Bank's board, which had been very much in favor of our policy easing  actions as indicated by voting twice for a reduction in the discount rate, has shifted its position,  as I believe it should have Their thinking now is that it is very important for the Federal    12/22/98 43  Reserve to show that it accomplished what it sought to accomplish and that further easing actions  should take place only if there is clear and new evidence of weakness  I think the risks are very well balanced now The fixed income markets have not  completely returned to normal but I think we could expect, Brazil permitting, that they will  probably return to somewhat greater normalcy as we get past the year-end and into 1999 The  domestic economy probably has a little more threat--in a nice sense--of being stronger if left to  its own devices, but the dangers from the emerging markets are still sufficient for me to view the  overall risks as very well balanced To me that does encourage us to maintain the position of  watchful waiting as the appropriate policy stance   Mr Chairman, I interpret that, as I'm sure you  intended, as a recommendation for "B" symmetric, which I heartily endorse As far as luck goes,  I am reminded of the immortal words of Lefty Grove "It is better to be lucky than good" In  that year, he won 31 and lost 6   Mr Chairman, atypically for me, I am fairly  relaxed about the whole thing [Laughter] I have a marginal preference for taking out the words  "in coming months" Perhaps inconsistent with that, I would leave the money sentence in on the  theory that to spend the next year of our lives having knock-down, drag-out battles with the  monetarists of the world is not worth the struggle   You are going to have to write the minutes  summarizing this discussion   Wow!   Mr Chairman, I believe this is a step in a good  direction also and I have confidence in the Committee Actually, maybe I have even more  confidence in the Committee's counselor In my misspent youth I was a student of the Old  Testament The wisest man in the Old Testament was not Solomon but an advisor of David  called Ahithophel The passage is "and the counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days was as if  a man were to speak with God!" [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) It will just go to his head   He can help us by proving that Governor  Kelley is wrong   Thank you all    So move     It is indeed    I move the authority that is requested,   Mr Chairman    Move approval    Move approval    Mr Chairman, I move approval of the   domestic operations    Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second   District’s economy retained strong momentum going into 1999, with price pressures   largely in check Private sector job growth in New York and New Jersey accelerated to a   31 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter New York City registered its strongest   annual job growth on record, 27 percent; the previous high had been 22 percent in 1969   Retailers report brisk post-holiday sales in January, buoyed by a later-than-usual cold   snap, a relaxation for eight shopping days of the sales tax in New York City, and I   suppose the view that since it got cold people needed winter coats after all     2/2-3/99 67   Availability of office space in the New York City area was tight but stable in the   fourth quarter Vacancy rates stopped falling and rents rose at a less frenzied pace Our   District’s housing market showed more signs of strength in December as indicated by   rising home construction, brisk home sales, and sturdy price appreciation A   benevolently warm, delightful December might have had something to do with that   Surveys of Purchasing Managers indicate continued weakness in the region’s   manufacturing sector Hotel occupancy rates in Manhattan remained exceptionally high   in December, with room rates continuing to run about 10 percent ahead of a year ago In   spite of all that, the CPI in the metropolitan New York City area rose only 16 percent in   1998 That is the lowest since 1964, and I assume that the mayor is extraordinarily   unhappy that he cannot run for reelection   At the national level, our forecast for growth is very much like that of the   Greenbook The Greenbook suggests 26 percent in 1999 and we have it at 25 percent;   we have growth at 23 percent in 2000 as compared with 24 percent in the Greenbook   We are a little more concerned about--or at least our forecast shows a higher increase in-­  inflation We have the CPI at 28 percent in 2000 compared with the Greenbook’s 24   percent   The question of the balance of risks is an interesting one at the moment If one   were looking only at the domestic economy in the United States, there is no question in   my mind that the balance of risks would be on the upside That is, the economy is likely   to grow faster than we anticipate On the other hand, the risks on the international side   would have a negative effect But I think they are likely to be understandable more   quickly than has been the case in the past Japan is weak and could get weaker because   of the combination of and terribly low consumer and business confidence   Continental Europe and the United Kingdom are slowing down a bit, but probably not to   a point where some policy action couldn’t turn those economies around   The interesting case, obviously, is Brazil Brazil is a country that I think is very,   very different from just about every place else It has immense natural resources and a   very diversified high quality population They are given to considerable swings of   confidence and to periods of believing that the national leader is capable of great and   wonderful things For a quite understandable reason, they thought that President Cardozo     2/2-3/99 68   would be able to continue to lead the economy and to make good his commitment to the   exchange rate design, which was both the economic and perhaps more importantly the   psychological base of the real plan The law of gravity prevailed, or markets prevailed,   and that was no longer possible The leadership in the country had been so committed to   what they were doing that they did not have contingency plans ready That is not   surprising; most people don’t have contingency plans ready Therefore, the Brazilians   are still going through a period of trying to figure out what to do However, just in the   last couple of days, it looks as if people are beginning to find a more positive view of the   situation Now, that could reverse because as one bumps along a psychological trough it   is difficult to know whether the next bounce will be down or up   The important thing is that between now and our next meeting, the Brazilians   either are going to restore their sense of confidence in their leadership and their country   or they will not If they do, the Brazilian shock probably will be less great than we now   think it is likely to be On the other hand, if they don’t regain their confidence, the shock   will be a bit greater and the contagion effect on Argentina and Mexico a bit more severe   Therefore, at the present time watching and waiting clearly makes a great deal of   sense for us We do have to be careful not to fall into the trap of thinking that we are the   central bank of the world because we are not With any luck, we will have a much better   opportunity at our next meeting to calculate more accurately what Brazil is likely to do   Then we will be in a position to make a more accurate judgment about what policy path   we should follow and how quickly we might need to adjust our current policy    Mr Chairman, it seems to me that   everybody here is in agreement that the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony is a great   opportunity and should be continued I have a little difficulty, just procedurally, hearing   people say they like this, that, or the other thing because that results in a disorderly   debate People make suggestions, some of which I think are grand and some of which I   think are quite bad If people gave their ideas to Don Kohn, as you suggested, then at the   next meeting we could have an orderly discussion of the ideas that have been offered   rather than have somebody announce an idea and others by their silence give the   impression that they agree with it In some cases I agree and in some cases I don’t But   we could spend the rest of the week here if we debated every idea brought forward    I was of the impression that at the   testimony on February 23 you would be asked what you thought and you would give a   generic answer that the testimony is appropriate and that we will be thinking of   suggestions on the content of the reauthorizing legislation    Mr Chairman, during my years in   Chicago, I know I chatted with Milton Friedman about the natural rate of unemployment,   but I have managed to spend about 58 years of my life without ever hearing that the   NAIRU was confusing economists by its existence So, taking advantage of not being a   PhD economist, let me tell you what I see in comparing Charts 3 and 4, or at least give a   possible interpretation   Chart 3 says that this is the world that used to exist and, based on the last couple   of years of experience, probably does not exist any more But central bankers are   supposed to be hardboiled fighters against inflation, so let’s make believe that the world   is the way it used to be and launch ourselves into a fight against inflation   Chart 4 says that this is the world that we in fact have been living in rather   successfully for the last couple of years It doesn’t appear to me that we have to make an   act of faith that it will continue forever in order to think that this world, which produces a   much better climate for our citizens, could be allowed to continue We may get some     2/2-3/99 94   evidence that in fact this is not the real world--that it has involved a series of lucky breaks   and that the real world is going back to something more like what is depicted in Chart 3   If we do get such evidence, we would not want to be in a position of believing that Chart   4 will last forever because that would lead us to make mistakes that would be quite   dangerous if in fact the world of Chart 3 were the real world But based on what we have   been seeing, even though we do not fully understand it, the world of Chart 4 seems to me   closer to the world we now appear to be living in And I’m not sure why we shouldn’t   give that world a chance to endure Am I missing something?    I had to put in a question mark at the end   because this is the time for questions  My question is Would the gentleman not agree?   [Laughter]    If I could make a comment I think an   appropriate degree of skepticism is no doubt appropriate [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I fully support your   recommendation Clearly, it seems inappropriate to change policy And with inflation   dead in the water, I also believe this is not the moment to go asymmetric toward   tightening I agree that the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony gives you, representing the   Committee, an opportunity to discuss that With the additional data becoming available   between now and that time, I think that’s the right thing to do    So move    I move approval of the domestic   operations    Mr Chairman, the Second District’s   economy showed more signs of brisk growth in the first quarter, with little increase in   overall price pressures In fact, the 12-month CPI increase in New York City at the end   of February was 14 percent, so it was even lower than the national average   Unemployment in New York and New Jersey fell to a cyclical low of 49 percent in   February, while private sector employment grew at a 24 percent annual rate   Anecdotally, to go back to the discussion earlier about where manufacturing   workers go, we have a rather interesting microcosm in the area between Albany and   Buffalo--or probably an even smaller area between Syracuse and Buffalo--where   manufacturing jobs continue to be lost The people find other jobs rather quickly or they   migrate The unemployment rate in that area is quite low, in the 3 to 4 percent range   We have phenomena like firms from Cleveland, Ohio holding a job auction in Buffalo, an   indication of the benefit to our society of its ability to be flexible   I would like to talk first about the international side and then go back to the   domestic side I continue to be concerned about the possible negative effects, even   greater than those reflected in the Greenbook, on our economy from events abroad Let   me start with Japan, which we all know is in a serious recession I am not at all   optimistic that their recapitalization of the banking sector, although a good thing in and   of itself, is going to have any positive effect on the economy in terms of ending the credit   crunch This seems to be a time of year when we have virtually nonstop visits by CEOs   of Japanese banks And I have yet to find one who is planning to have his newly   recapitalized bank become more aggressive in lending Their posture is very much a   defensive one They have no additional ability to actually get rid of the underlying   assets, which I think is essential to end the credit crunch in time But probably more   importantly, the Japanese visitors I’ve met with, from both the official and the private   sectors, are talking more and more about their country being in the greatest cultural crisis     3/30/99 32   in their history--even greater than that of the period of the Meiji restoration or the period   after the Second World War What they are seeing is a breakdown in the traditional   ability to make decisions and to arrive at policy It is not likely in that kind of   environment that the economy will pull itself out of its recession faster than we think In   fact, it seems to me more likely that the economy will continue to weaken simply because   of an ever deteriorating level of confidence, both at the consumer and at the business   levels   The recovery in the rest of Asia is spotty One can see it in Thailand and   Korea, especially in Korea In Thailand one can see some recovery by looking pretty   hard, but it certainly is slow In China, I think a leading indicator of what is going on is   the The reason for that, I believe, is that the   government is getting more and more concerned that the Achilles heel of their   restructuring--that is, the level of unemployment as they restructure the state-owned   enterprises--could be reaching the point of getting out of hand They are doing some   in order to try to keep the lid on, but that is a very finely balanced   approach It always has been I view that indicator as rather worrisome   In Europe, economic growth is slow There is very little going on at the   governmental level, except in the United Kingdom, to bring about the structural reforms   that are required Even though one does see bits of light at certain well managed   companies in continental Europe, those economies are still a long way from the kind of   structural reform needed I agree with earlier speakers that the Brazilian situation is   better but also risky It is a confidence-building effort in which the Brazilians may have   overcompensated by making the program appear to be too successful too soon As a   technical matter, their lowering of interest rates by 3 percentage points probably made   sense But it does have the significant risk of making everybody think that things are   wonderful again The Brazilians are wont to believe that If there is a slowdown this   summer, we could see a reversal in confidence that would be quite damaging   The conclusion I draw from all that is this Although one need not be   unnecessarily pessimistic about what is going on in the rest of the world, it is very     3/30/99 33   difficult to be optimistic about it or to think that there will be a positive effect on the   United States that we don’t anticipate Rather, it seems to me that the risks are on the   downside   As for our domestic economy, it seems to be behaving exactly in the way that   the Federal Reserve should wish it to behave We have sustained economic growth and   we have price stability, which to the best of my knowledge is what the Congress of the   United States has told us is our mission Our Bank believes that we will continue to have   a healthily growing economy And though our models forecast some increased inflation   in 2000, our models have been consistently wrong in forecasting inflation, as have   everybody else’s models around this table Therefore, I think we should be somewhat   modest about basing any policy change on that forecast It seems to me that the present   stance of policy is extremely well balanced Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I not only support but   applaud your recommendation I think an announcement of a tightening in policy at the   present time would make us seem oblivious of what is going on in the world But   perhaps even more seriously, with a complete absence of inflation, it would put the   Committee on record as being opposed to economic growth Inevitably that is how a   tightening move would be perceived, and I don’t think that would be an appropriate   message for us to send    So move    The Home Loan Banks put out a   statement, over the weekend I believe, which I read as saying We will take care of all   the banks we deal with but maybe we won’t, so then you will have to go to the Fed That   puts us in an untenable position We have to increase the pressure as we get into the   summer because we really cannot wait until the last days of December and have some   banks that have been asleep all year wake up and decide they have a problem  I think we   have to be banging on their doors or banging on their heads, if necessary, to bring this to   their attention   We also have an issue regarding the large banks that will be the recipients of   large flows of funds Some of them are getting very concerned about the flows getting so   large that they could become less than well capitalized    I think we have to find a way consistent   with our regulations that allows the banks to do exactly what we want them do to--that is,   to bring in the funds and recycle them even though they will blow up their balance sheets   as a result Work is going on in the System now on how to handle that problem    So move    Move approval, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second   District’s economy continues to grow at a sturdy pace, with few signs of increased price   pressures Private sector employment grew at a 18 percent annual rate in the first   quarter; that’s down from 22 percent in the fourth quarter of last year Retailers report   that sales were at or above plan in March and April, but a bit less robust than in January   and February They also note modest declines in selling prices Residential and   commercial real estate continue to flourish in the New York City area Home prices have   risen sharply and both new construction and remodeling activities gained momentum in   the first quarter While Manhattan’s office market remained tight in April, rent inflation   has slowed markedly from a rate of more than 20 percent in 1998 Purchasing managers   indicate that manufacturing activity continued to expand in April, though at a slower pace   than in March Those in the New York City area report an uptick in commodity prices   and persistent increases in the cost of service inputs The latest Banker’s Survey shows a   pickup in loan demand, tightening lending standards on commercial and industrial loans,   and further declines in delinquency rates     5/18/99 43   Looking outside the Second District, let me speak first of the growing view   that the international crisis, which began in July 1997, is substantially over There is no   doubt that the crisis is less severe by a reasonably large degree than it was last fall, but it   surely isn’t over I believe Japan has made virtually no progress in restoring growth and   has increased its public sector debt to a level that is dangerously high, especially   considering the strains on the Japanese public sector that their aging population will bring   in the very near future   At our last meeting I raised a concern about what I called   in China as a sign that the massive economic restructuring of the state-owned   enterprises is not going as well as Premier Zhu Rongji had hoped The orchestration by   the government of the very strong response to the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in   Belgrade heightens my concern I believe that the leadership felt--for some reason not   connected with the restructuring but rather to the happenstance of a memorial date in   Chinese history of a student uprising in the last century on the fourth of May--that they   had no choice but to allow the young people to demonstrate But the size of the   demonstration I believe also indicates that the leadership felt they had to use it to let off   pressure from the domestic situation And that makes me even more concerned   Korea is growing, but unfortunately one of the results of the growth has been   that the restructuring of the Chaebols, which is absolutely necessary for the long-term   health of the economy, is very much less certain And in the best of cases it will not be as   complete as one might have hoped it would be   Thailand’s recovery is spotty even though it is slightly positive But the   principal author of the recovery, the finance minister, seems to be in increasing political   jeopardy   Europe’s growth is sluggish at best, with Germany very weak As for Russia,   even with a bit of luck, I think the most we can hope is that it will hold itself together   financially and politically until the very uncertain outcome of the Presidential and   Congressional elections next year   The performance of the domestic economy I think gives us a difficult, if   delightful, challenge, perhaps especially in how to describe it Until last Friday’s CPI the   performance of the economy had been characterized by good, solid growth fueled by     5/18/99 44   productivity Now outside economists talk of growth as being somehow dangerous But   it seems to me that our job as central bankers is in fact to seek sustained, noninflationary   growth In this regard, I think we have to be rather careful in our public speeches and   statements to remember that we know a lot more than our audiences do We have to be   very careful to note that the enemy is inflation It is not solid economic growth and it   certainly isn’t people finding jobs   Now, what does last Friday’s report of an increase in the core CPI tell us?   Clearly there is a lot of noise in the data, and one could decide to dismiss them and just   wait for another month to see what happens However, we’ve tried to take apart the data   statistically to see if there is any considerable likelihood that an increase of that amount   could be giving some sort of signal that we ought to be concerned about And we’ve   come to the conclusion that the statistical probability is sufficiently high that the increase   actually is telling us something important that I believe we definitely have to take it into   consideration in our discussion of policy Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I fully support your   conclusions and the associated reasoning I believe it would be very ill advised to raise   rates today Such a move would be taken as a knee-jerk reaction to the CPI number   regarding which all of us have some questions But to fail to adopt an asymmetric   directive toward firming also would be ill advised, and it would be very ill advised not to     5/18/99 59   publish such a decision Oddly enough, by publishing a tilt toward tightening, I think we   actually will have more flexibility It is not necessarily the case that we will in fact have   to tighten, though I am a little more inclined to think we will have to do so than you just   suggested, Mr Chairman But I believe adopting a tilt and shocking the market without   preparing it would create some very serious problems for the economy, which we can   easily avoid by announcing the tilt    So move    Peter, considering that the earlier version   of the yen carry trade contributed so dangerously to the Thai baht explosion in July 1997,   are you and your colleagues at other central banks able to track reasonably well the   buildup of that so we can take any supervisory action that is appropriate?     6/29-30/99 9    So some supervisory sniffing around might   be appropriate?    Move approval of the domestic open   market operations    Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second   District’s economy remains strong, though growth has clearly slowed from its brisk first-  quarter pace There are no indications of broad-based price pressures Employment in   the District grew at a 1½ percent annual rate in April and May, matching the first- quarter   pace but down from 2 percent in 1998 Retailers report that sales were strong in May and   early June, with less downward pressures on selling prices than earlier in the year The     6/29-30/99 47   housing market remains generally strong, though new construction has cooled from its   vigorous first-quarter pace Manhattan’s office market has been stable in the second   quarter, with vacancy rates little changed and rents rising at a more subdued pace than in   1998 Purchasing managers indicate that manufacturing activity was mixed in May,   while there were reports of an upturn in commodity prices Local banks report a dip in   loan demand, some tightening in lending standards, and ongoing declines in delinquency   rates   The national economy, based on the most recent data, is continuing to grow   rapidly and without increased inflation, because productivity growth is not only   maintaining the approximately 3 percent level we have seen since late 1998 but if   anything is improving Our read on the second quarter is that productivity may have   grown at an annual rate of 4 percent or even more   As one of the later converts to the view that the economy is behaving remarkably   differently from the past, I think it is important to remind ourselves what we should   believe in and what we do not have to make any leap of faith to believe To deny that the   economy has been showing much better productivity since 1995 is simply to deny the   facts How long will this improved productivity last?  At what level of improved   productivity will the economy settle? We do not know the answers to those questions   Should this lack of certainty about the future confuse us in the present? I do not think it   should We don’t have to know how long the productivity improvement will last nor at   what rate productivity will settle Those answers will be known only in the future We   don’t even know when More importantly, we do not need to know   Most of us believe that the lag in the effect of monetary policy is one to two years   That is as far into the future as we need to peer To try to look farther merely confuses us   and perhaps makes us unwilling to believe the reality that is staring us in the face I can   see nothing that would alter my belief that productivity will rise at least 2½ percent   during the next one to two years That means that the economy can enjoy noninflationary   growth well within the forecasts of the Greenbook or of the New York Reserve Bank   We all say that labor markets are tight, but they have been tight for several years   and workers have been found--many of them in pockets of poverty where finding a good   job, or any job, was a forlorn hope Should we be fighting that highly positive     6/29-30/99 48   development for the good of the American people?  I think not And yet the American   public and markets everywhere are waiting for us to pounce on growth and job creation   and stifle them Since I do not believe we should do that, I believe that our challenge is   to clarify our strategy--first to ourselves, then to the public and the markets   The markets are spending their time psychoanalyzing this Committee rather than   analyzing the real world That is highly counterproductive because it deprives our   nation’s economy of the balancing effects of the normal pulls of supply and demand in   financial markets Never-ending heavy breathing by market watchers is convincing the   American people that we want to deprive them of inflation-free growth   Clearly, the general posture of the Federal Reserve should always be to remain   highly alert to imbalances, to forces which could end sustainable growth Our policy   regarding price stability on a continuing philosophical basis should be seen as symmetric,   as being against both deflation and inflation Our strategy, on the other hand, should vary   with conditions Deflation is sufficiently unlikely at this time that we should have a   strategic position of concern about inflation But we should not be in a tactical position   of being constantly poised to attack an enemy that does not appear visible to me We   need to find a way to tactical symmetry--to a position where we, the public, and the   markets think we are watchfully waiting but not looking for windmills to knock down   Because of the public perception of where we are, I do not think we can achieve   tactical symmetry by taking no action at this meeting However, when we discuss what   action to take in a later portion of the meeting, tomorrow morning, I am absolutely   convinced that it must take us to tactical symmetry, even against a strategic background   of concern about inflation Thank you    Mr Chairman, on this issue I feel strongly   only about one thing and that is that the fellow who has to go up and explain this should   have the option of deciding what he wishes to explain or not explain Therefore, I   support fully your recommendation    Don, even though in the 1994-1995 period   we didn’t announce a tilt until after the following meeting, do I remember correctly that   we did seven consecutive firming moves and that each and every one of them was from a   symmetric directive?     6/29-30/99 80    And the world didn’t think that we had   stopped being a responsible central bank just because we went to a symmetric directive?   That’s a question!    Mr Chairman, I agree fully with your   recommendation and let me explain why In my view there is no question that we should   raise the fed funds rate A failure to do so would create an extraordinarily strong reaction   in markets; I think the first trade would be up and I’m not quite sure where the second   trade would be because people would wonder where Federal Reserve policy was now   headed   The issue really becomes the question of the announcement and the tilt I agree   with you fully--and as I mentioned yesterday--that financial markets are simply not     6/29-30/99 90   functioning in a way that a market economy needs to have them function Markets have   to have bulls and bears and buyers and sellers to function effectively Instead, what we   have is people trading off a new breed of Fed watchers who are more involved in politics   and amateur psychoanalysis than the old Fed watchers who tended to look at all the   numbers and variables This phenomenon, I think, is extremely counterproductive and   something that we need to move against by shifting our approach   I tried to make the distinction yesterday between the philosophical role of the   central bank, which is clearly price stability on a symmetric basis, and the need in a   shorter time frame to distinguish between strategy and tactics I believe the intermeeting   tilt should be described as tactical Since it is not clear when we will have to make the   next tightening move, it seems to me that tactical symmetry is appropriate and that is   what I believe you recommended   The question is How do we go about establishing what I would describe as   strategic asymmetry, if the likely imbalances in the market develop in the direction of   requiring further tightening?  I think we have to do that through the new vehicle of the   statement regarding the policy objectives of the Federal Reserve that will accompany our   action this afternoon   I also agree that if we were absolutely certain that we had to increase the funds   rate by 50 basis points, we ought to do it today and go symmetric However, I think that   would be very, very difficult to manage We have had a poor record in this Committee in   trying to give a signal that we have done something and that’s it; and certainly the recent   experience of the European Central Bank would not lead one to believe in such an   approach The last time I remember our doing that was in August of 1994 and it was a   mistake then I think a lot of us were rather queasy about what we said then We should   have been because it was the wrong thing to say given that we did continue to tighten   after that, and rather soon after that   In addition to the fact that it would be very difficult to manage, there are two   other reasons why it isn’t altogether clear that we need to raise the funds rate another 25   basis points this year I have a feeling, in one of the older stomach linings in this room,   that the new once-in-a-century type of phenomenon is actually likely to be happening   But as central bankers, with monetary policy lags of one to two years, we don’t need to     6/29-30/99 91   sign up for that view now All we need to do is have a reasonable degree of confidence   that it is likely to continue for the next one to two years And I think there is every   reason to believe that   Lastly, on the issue of labor force tightness Without any question all of the   anecdotes that we hear that markets are very tight here and there--in fact, in most places-­  are clearly right But just as the economy is changing, I think the labor force and the   availability of people in it are changing too We have within our society fairly large   numbers of people who really thought jobs were not available for them We are changing   that The nature of the way the economy is behaving, the beneficial effects of what has   been-- either by good luck or good guidance or some of each--very effective monetary   policy is making it much more likely for many people to think that they can really have a   job The data on the labor force--data measuring those who might like to be in the labor   force-- don’t pick up such people very well If we can continue to find that difficult-to-  define pool and bring these fellow citizens into the labor force, I think that is a very good   thing We can’t base monetary policy on the hope that that will happen; it may happen, it   may not But it’s another reason to be observant of that change in the labor force and in   the availability of people to join the labor force--changes that flow from the changes in   the real economy That’s something else we have to be aware of Thank you    A Nobel prize for Don Kohn!    So move    Yes, I would like to nominate Christine   Cumming for that position She has a PhD in economics from the University of Minnesota   and is a very highly regarded career professional at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   Most recently, before we put her in charge of our research group, she was the brain trust for   the bank supervision function of the Bank She’s a very good economist and I’m very   happy to nominate her    Move approval     8/24/99 2    Shall I move approval of the domestic   operations?    So move, Mr Chairman    Move approval, Mr Chairman    Move approval, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I have more of a comment than   a question I think our approval of what Peter is recommending here is extremely important   and in fact vital The first three resolutions we’ve already agreed to really had to do with   being able to carry out our normal responsibilities at the end of the year plus having some   damage control capability Damage control is something I’ve lived with for a long time   because in my first job in the US Navy I was a damage control officer  One thing that you   figure out on a ship that is very capable of sinking is that the best way to control damage is   not to have any So you’re always better off to be in the risk-avoidance business And this   essentially is the situation we have here   Probably until about a month ago, I was of the view that the damage control   capabilities that we have already agreed to would be adequate--that we could get financial   intermediaries to respond essentially in the way that we got them to respond last fall And   that is that they pulled up their socks and decided to make markets, which is part of their   job But as President Minehan has suggested, it is also very clear to me that regardless of   how much we lean on the financial intermediaries to make markets at the end of the year-­  and I probably would do the leaning--it is likely that those efforts will not be successful It   is sufficiently likely that we are well advised to use this additional tool The conversations   I’ve been having with very responsible heads of major institutions are much like those   Cathy has had They feel their responsibility to their shareholders and their customers is   such that they have to protect themselves And if we were in their jobs, that’s essentially   what we would do They are not paid for being patriots; we are   Therefore, I’m absolutely convinced that we need this capability largely to avoid risk   or at least to reduce risk And as Peter has suggested, if we’re completely successful in the   message we give, we may never have a single one of these options exercised That would   be victory    That would be even better! I think the   likelihood is that the dealers will purchase them And Peter is absolutely right in that we   need to have the agreement of the Committee in order to go out and have meaningful   discussions with the dealers We can’t go out and say, “Well, we’re thinking of doing this;     8/24/99 22   maybe we will and maybe we won’t” If there is anything that will make us look ludicrous   as an institution and a Committee that would be it--even though, as you could see from   Peter’s memo, that’s where he started or where he started with my support But as time has   gone on, I’ve come to the view that we absolutely have to have the capability to say that the   Committee has approved our doing this and now we are figuring out the details    Bob, I think you can see from Peter’s and   Don’s comments that we’ve done an awful lot of thinking about the “what ifs” and   “maybes” and what could go wrong Even though it has been done at a level of Board staff   and the Chairman and the New York Reserve Bank staff and me, we haven’t been remiss in   putting this through every stretch exercise we could imagine    Let me make a comment that I hope will be   helpful to President Hoenig and others The way we envision introducing this to the   primary dealer community is at a meeting at which the heads of the firms would be invited   to the Reserve Bank and I would be their host, with Peter Fisher joining me We will make   it very clear to them that this is not the “Primary Dealer Benevolence Society Act,” but   rather that we expect them to behave in a responsible way, as we are, in carrying out their   function as a financial intermediary If they try picking us off, they might succeed But we   want them to know--and we will let them know--that the price of that will be very high and   will last very long So, I think we can make sure that they don’t get confused about that     8/24/99 30   They shouldn’t think that because this involves matters they are more experienced with and   more clever about than we are, which is true, that therefore they can lead the holy innocents   off to slaughter, so to speak We will make sure they understand that if they try to do that,   they’ll get caught and the price will be extremely high I personally would not be willing to   support this if we were not prepared to make that very clear to them Thank you    My guess is that as we have these discussions   the notion of how high the price should be will continue to go up We don’t want the   subsidy to be too low or too high Whatever it is, what we want is-­   We envision having the meeting with the heads   of the firms on the Wednesday after Labor Day The reason we don’t want to do it before   then is that we won’t be finished arranging for the tri-party agreements with the agent banks   and also because this is the time of year when too many people are away    Move approval, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, the Second District’s economy   has shown renewed signs of strength in recent weeks, after some slowing in the second   quarter Despite increasing price pressures, there is no evidence of any broad-based pickup   in inflation Private sector job growth accelerated to a 31 percent annual rate in July from   17 percent in the second quarter Retailers report that sales retreated in July and were close   to plan, following unusual strength in May and June Most attribute this downshift to lean   inventories, but it was so oppressively hot that a lot of people might just have decided to   stay home Prices paid by retailers remain steady, but selling prices have firmed up just a   little The housing market has gained momentum since the last report Residential building   permits rebounded sharply in June, led by a surge in the multifamily sector We’ve had   double-digit price appreciation in most of the downstate New York housing markets Office   markets in and around New York City remain tight, with vacancy rates hovering near record   lows and rents rising moderately Purchasing managers indicate that manufacturing activity   expanded moderately in both June and July, while price pressures increased Banks report a   seasonal dip in loan demand, tightening credit standards, and stable delinquency rates   Our view on the domestic economy is that we will continue to see positive real   growth, about 3½ percent in the second half of 1999 and about 2½ percent in 2000 My   colleagues in the research group are anticipating a growth recession in 2001, which is very   conveniently timed to help keep inflation under control But, unlike most of what we’ve   been hearing around the table, our view is that the inflation pressures, which we too have   been forecasting for the last few years, are in fact much better contained It may be that if   you leave your research staff alone--just as if you leave your kids alone they grow up okay-­  eventually they will decide that inflation really isn’t going to happen after all I rather share   that view I think what we have now should be called price stability; that is, it is not   something toward which we are working to achieve And, therefore, our view of the     8/24/99 56   inflation forecast is that we will continue to enjoy price stability, which is our statutory   assignment   The global situation is certainly better, as Karen Johnson described It is much better   than it was last fall when this Committee correctly exercised both responsibility and   leadership by easing monetary policy three times to respond to a world financial crisis But   the global situation is still highly problematic even though Karen’s forecast is, I think, a   very reasonable bet I believe that Japan is still having tremendous difficulty trying to figure   out what to do to solve its very basic economic problems Until and if it figures that out, it   will continue to be a source of systemic risk both to the rest of the world and certainly to its   own people In addition, I find the situation in China getting worse, in the direction of   pressure going forward, as a result of the developments on the political side And on the   economic side, there is little positive effect coming from a great deal of pump priming of a   Keynesian variety that is also blowing air into the domestic stock markets South Korea   took a highly positive and very courageous step in the dismantling of Daewoo, but that is a   very, very tough workout situation in a country with absolutely no experience in workouts   The situation in our hemisphere, I think, is getting more troubling Two of the   countries, Brazil and Argentina, are potentially serious problems Karen described very   well what’s going on there, but in my view the biggest problem is   I believe the dangers to that country’s economy are very real Argentina’s success   of recent years has been, in my view, mainly the result of excellent leadership from   President Menem  He is about to leave office  The candidate from his own party certainly   doesn’t sound like him  And the candidate from the other party, who is ahead in the polls,   represents a coalition that has agreed only that they would like to win the election They   have no agreement on policy matters and, therefore, the policy they would follow is a matter   of very considerable uncertainty So it is not surprising that market pressure is being felt   there Mexico, at least according to Moody’s, is improving And yet next year is the sixth   year of a presidential term, always a problem period, and one in which the political result is   so uncertain that a weakness of public confidence and a weakness in investor confidence   both within Mexico and outside are very real possibilities Ecuador is highly likely to   default on its Brady bonds; and even though it is a very small country, that would be the     8/24/99 57   first default on Brady bonds And it makes rather dramatic the point that there are now four   countries--Pakistan, Ukraine, Romania, and Ecuador--in which the International Monetary   Fund, correctly in my view, has not found enough private sector support to justify the use of   public funds Russia is not only a mess in and of itself, but is bringing very   severe pressure and criticism on the IMF, which will likely have the effect of making the   Fund less capable of carrying out its responsibilities Growth in the Euro area is slow and   spotty, and in some of the countries, particularly Germany, the government is having trouble   keeping a coalition together to follow the policies that they think--and I agree--are   necessary   Well, that is not a very pretty picture! It certainly is a much less pretty picture than the   one we all thought we were looking at in the spring of 1997 And even though it is a lot   better, or less bad, than the one that we were looking at last fall, it seems to me one that we   have to keep in mind Although we are not the central banker of the world, given the fact   that we are the unique world super power and the main economy with the main currency, we   have to do two things in this Committee The first is that we have to do the right thing on   monetary policy But, as Ed Boehne suggested, in our rhetoric we have to try to get out the   message and then stick to it in terms of what it is we are doing and what we intend to do   Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I fully support your   recommendation Let me just express a couple of thoughts Since I believe that we are   enjoying price stability and since I believe very firmly in the rather brilliant analysis that   you have just presented, one might ask Why are we tightening at all?  In my view, the   reason is that the domestic economy can certainly bear it The worst case scenario is that we   will have moved the funds rate up by 25 basis points that we didn’t absolutely need But the   strength of the domestic economy and the tightness of the labor market are such that a move   of 25 basis points is certainly a bit of insurance that is in the interest of the American   people   Another reason--which you just alluded to, as I did in my earlier remarks--is that the   international situation is tenuous enough that it is best for us to be in the position of having   domestic policy just where we want it or maybe a tiny bit on the snug side It will give us   much greater flexibility to respond to any unanticipated weakness in the domestic economy,   which is always possible, or to the more likely event of some shock coming from outside the   United States So I believe very firmly that “C” symmetric is the right solution    So move    Move approval of the domestic operations    Thank you, Mr Chairman The Second District’s   economy appears to be expanding at a rather steady pace despite intensifying price pressures in the   manufacturing and construction sectors Consumer price inflation apparently remains in check   Private sector employment grew at a 17 percent annual rate in August, down from July’s robust   32 percent pace but matching the second-quarter pace  Retailers report that sales picked up in   early September following a sluggish performance in August They also note that there was a good   deal less discounting in the third quarter than a year earlier Tropical storm Floyd caused some   flooding and utility disruptions in New Jersey and may have affected retail sales in mid-September   However, its overall effect on the regional economy appears to have been modest   The housing market remains strong, though new construction is being hampered by   widespread supply shortages and bottlenecks Single-family housing permits have picked up in the   most recent quarter and double-digit increases in home prices are reported in New Jersey and   Manhattan Office vacancy rates in Manhattan fell to cyclical lows in August but rents, though still   increasing, have risen at a less frenzied pace than last year Purchasing managers indicate that   manufacturing activity was mixed but generally strong in September following brisk growth in   August Price pressures intensified a bit in September Banks report steady loan demand,   increasingly tight credit standards, and few delinquencies     10/5/99 35   As for the national economy, while listening to my colleagues around the table, a sign   outside The Mayflower Doughnut Shop in my native city of Chicago kept passing through my   mind That sign was entitled the optimist’s creed and said, “As you wander on through life,   brother, whatever be your goal, keep your eye upon the doughnut and not upon the hole” It seems   to me that some people look at the current situation and say We are experiencing the soon-to-be   longest economic expansion ever, we have a 42 percent unemployment rate, we have the   unemployable being employed, and isn’t that terrible! I don’t think it’s terrible at all I think it’s   great and wonderful, especially if we remember that our goal in monetary policy is to promote   sustainable economic growth and that the tool we are supposed to use is price stability With a   year-over-year rate of 19 percent in the core CPI at the end of August, I think we surely have price   stability   The forecasting models of all the Reserve Banks and of the Board’s staff have been   consistently wrong in that they have forecast inflation increases The same models predict that   there will be inflation increases in the future I wonder if at some point we shouldn’t put in a   humility discount based on past performance Perhaps we should realize that these forecasts, since   they have been consistently wrong, are likely to stay wrong and that, therefore, the inflation we are   concerned about is rather like Don Quixote’s windmills--a fiction of our own minds   We’ve also been very worried about tight labor markets and yet the tight labor markets have   not in fact been resulting in inflation, even though we continue to worry about them What   concerns me a great deal is that all of us speak in shorthand and the American people don’t   understand our shorthand If we continue to talk about tight labor markets as if that is a truly evil   phenomenon, we are going to convince the American people that what we believe in is not price   stability, which is for the good of everybody, but a differentiation in income distribution that goes   against the working people That is not a good signal to be giving I’m sure it’s not a deliberate   signal but I think it’s one we are increasingly giving The most recent data on the distribution of   income show the top quintile getting 49 percent of the income distribution and the bottom quintile   getting just above 3 percent I don’t think that’s a time when the central bank should be giving a   signal that it is opposed to possible increases in remuneration, especially if those increases in   remuneration are financed by productivity   As I’ve said at previous meetings, we don’t have to have a firm belief that productivity   improvements are here to stay and that we are experiencing one of those once-in-a-century   phenomena, although I’m increasingly inclined to think that we probably are All we really have to     10/5/99 36   decide is whether that increase in productivity that has been financing the improvement in the   lifestyles of the less fortunate--with the low unemployment rate--is likely to continue for the period   to which our current monetary policy applies, which is one to two years I am very convinced that   that will be the case As we consider our responsibilities, we have to be very careful that the goal   we’re looking toward is price stability and not anything else That price stability is supposed to   bring about sustainable economic growth, and it is In my view we should declare victory on what   has been a very good piece of work and stop worrying ourselves into believing that we have to   stand in the way of something that I think is very positive Thank you    Mr Chairman, I very much support the “B” part of   your recommendation As for how we handle the verbiage, you and others may remember that I’ve   tried to make the distinction in previous meetings of asymmetry being either strategic or tactical If   we publish some verbiage that describes our assessment of the balance of risks but do not say that   we are asymmetric, I think we would in fact be making that distinction between strategic   asymmetry and tactical asymmetry I believe that is a good thing I share your view that at the   November meeting we will be fully free to do what we think is appropriate At the December   meeting, since it’s so close to the Y2K date, we might not have much freedom But as you are all   probably aware, I think our December meeting is always too late The markets are essentially   closed for the year and, therefore, it’s a very awkward meeting for us to take any action As we     10/5/99 55   plan meetings for the future, I’d be very much happier if we could move the December meeting   date forward so we’d still have some functioning markets when we might actually need them   As for the third possibility of announcing that we’re putting symmetry and asymmetry aside   until Roger Ferguson’s group reports, I rather like that But I think it would be very, very difficult   to explain in a way that would not come across as a bit ludicrous So I share your view that the   best thing to do is to have “B” with strategic asymmetry, which means that we would use verbiage   rather than the word “asymmetric”    So do I    For Larry Meyer’s peace of mind, we do discuss   above the decrease in the pool of available workers    Adjust it as the Chairman said and declare victory!    Yes, he took out “costs to increase”     So move    Move approval of the domestic operations, Mr   Chairman    The reaction is delayed?    Thank you, Mr Chairman The economic   growth in the Second District has moderated since our last report Overall consumer price   inflation has barely accelerated, though there are scattered reports of some rising prices--for   example, in manufacturing inputs, housing, and hotel rooms The unemployment rate continued   to hover close to 5 percent in September, but private sector job growth slowed to a 11 percent   annual rate, well below the 19 percent pace in the past 12 months Retailers note that sales have   been somewhat sluggish in recent weeks They remain fairly optimistic, however, about the   upcoming holiday season But a number of retailers think that the pricing environment is   shaping up to be more competitive than last year Housing activity has moderated somewhat   from a spring-summer boom, though markets remain quite tight In the New York City   metropolitan area a shortage of available homes has evidently crimped sales and spurred double-  digit increases in both selling prices and in rents  Multifamily construction activity in the   District remains brisk; single-family building has tapered off Purchasing managers report some   moderation in growth in October along with persistent price pressures Banks report a decline in     11/16/99 33   loan demand, a noticeable tightening in credit standards, and continued improvement in   delinquency rates There is much virtue in the banking sector, if you believe all they tell you   On the national outlook, we forecast growth at a 4 percent rate in the fourth quarter   We think growth will moderate further in 2000 and 2001 The primary cause of this slowing is   the rise of long-term interest rates thus far in 1999, which has caused housing construction and   sales to decline in recent months Higher interest rates have also brought mortgage refinancing   activity to a virtual halt; for many homeowners refinancing had lowered household debt service   burdens and had provided a convenient way to extract equity from their homes Finally, the rise   of interest rates has been associated with a leveling off of stock prices, which may be   contributing to the moderation in growth of consumer spending evident in the third quarter and   apparently continuing in the fourth quarter Net exports are expected to continue to exert a drag   on the economy, while the boost from inventory building fades somewhat We believe that the   potential growth rate of the economy is now about 3½ percent  Our growth forecast for 2000 is   32 percent and for 2001 it is 3 percent If we are wrong, however, we think growth will be   somewhat higher because of possibly stronger growth abroad and a possibly stronger wealth   effect if stock and bond markets return to their upward trend   Since our baseline forecast has core inflation creeping up from about 2 percent now to   2¾ percent in 2001 under an assumption of no policy change by this Committee, a modest   additional tightening would be appropriate insurance against aggregate demand exceeding the   supply side’s ability to produce goods and services I should note, however, that I absolutely and   vehemently disagree with any notion that this Committee is behind the curve   In addition to the likely help on price stability that a modest tightening would involve,   I think it would also help to reduce the current account deficit somewhat We have to be careful   about the current account deficit It’s easy to finance it because of the attractiveness of US   assets But it is clearly a longer-term problem And when we have an opportunity to do   something about it, we should take it    Mr Chairman, I agree fully with both the   reasoning behind your recommendation and with the recommendation itself I agree that we   should increase the funds rate by 25 basis points I think we must be symmetric or we will create   uncertainty in financial markets during the end-of-the-year period, when markets are always   somewhat illiquid Given the Y2K effect on year-end markets, it simply would not be good   public policy for us to be creating confusion in that kind of situation So “C” symmetric seems   to me exactly the right conclusion    Mr Chairman, I like the presentation as it   exists Let me say why I think the second paragraph has to be included because it does say that   at a certain point we just run out of resources and the likely resource that we’re going to run out   of is available workers I also share Bob McTeer’s view There was a fascinating article in last   Sunday’s New York Times about mentally challenged people having jobs; I think that’s   wonderful But in the real world at a certain point, if this drawing down of the available pool of   workers continues, we will run out of workers, and I think this paragraph states it in a very   sensible way In the third paragraph there are some good central banker words and the last   words of the second line are “appears likely”  We don’t make a theologically dogmatic   statement But what I like about it is that it says that we are in the growth business; we are in the   business of allowing the American economy to grow as fast as the supply side of the economy   makes possible And I think that is something that we need to say    This is an argument that the Chairman has   made very consistently and I happen to think he’s right    It’s not so important whether we think he’s   right or not, but he is the Chairman of the Committee And if something like this weren’t in the   statement, I think Lynn Fox would get 85 phone calls in the first hour asking about the available   pool of workers Don’t we worry about that anymore?  I think we have to have this in here to be   consistent with the Chairman’s recent speeches    Could I ask a question?    I’m confused on a point of fact Is the proposal   that, when we finally decide on the words, there will be three available statements, and at the end     11/16/99 69   of each meeting we will choose either to use the statement that the risks are balanced or that   there is a likelihood of economic weakness or heightened inflation pressures?  Is the proposal   that one of those three statements will be made at the end of each meeting without any additional   prose?    I agree    Roger, I think President Boehne was just   practicing law It seems ironic that the General Counsel would propose something different and   I want to know why     11/16/99 74    First of all, I respect highly the ability of the   General Counsel to practice law But I think we have to be careful that in the process of   clarifying the Chairman’s authority we don’t overlook the fact that the Committee’s agent to   carry out its responsibilities is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or whichever Reserve   Bank is selected at our annual organizational meeting We wouldn’t want to be in a position     11/16/99 76   where we had the world going up for grabs and have somebody decide that the Desk couldn’t do   anything until it had talked to the Chairman The Desk obviously is not going to change the   official fed funds rate, but surely it is going to provide the liquidity or drain liquidity if that’s   necessary And I think we have to be very careful that the Desk’s authority to do that is not   placed in question by anything we do to solve this other problem    My main desire is that we get away from the   business of looking at ourselves in the mirror Therefore, I like the idea that most of the time-­  ideally all the time--we would have one of three psalms The 23rd psalm, my favorite, which   starts out “The Lord is my Shepherd,” has been around for 2,850 years and it has been doing a   pretty good job So I think if we have our own 22nd, 23rd, and 24th psalms and the only thing we   have to decide is which one we are going to use, that will supply the needed information to the   market That’s option I That would avoid the confusion caused by the modern version of the   Fed watcher deciding that if we change this word or that comma, there are grave market   implications in that change What I like most of all is the consistency    Move approval    I move approval of the domestic operations    Mr Chairman, the Second District’s economy   continues to grow at a moderate pace Despite continued widespread evidence of price   increases for manufacturing inputs and housing, overall inflation remains subdued at the   consumer level   You have all no doubt heard of the drama of the possible New York City transit   strike The Transit Authority reached an eleventh hour agreement with the transit workers   union The settlement calls for a 5 percent wage hike in the first year, 3 percent in the   second year, and 4 percent in the third That actually follows very much the pattern of the   Long Island Railroad settlement about a year ago  Because the pension plan is well funded,   employee pension deductions are being reduced substantially, boosting the average worker’s   take-home pay by an estimated additional 23 percent The City’s Transit Authority is   actually funded through the State government The Mayor is trying very hard to tell all the   municipal workers whom he pays that the rather attractive settlement for transit workers   should not confuse them into thinking that he is going to give them the same deal So we   may have some additional Sturm und Drang in New York on the labor front   There has been much discussion, and I won’t repeat it, on the levels of national and   international economic activity But why should one be concerned?  I think foreign growth,     12/21/99 34   as Karen Johnson and others have said, is likely to be stronger That will increase the   demand for commodities and, ceteris paribus, increase their prices It will also increase the   demand for American exports, thus increasing overall demand in an economy in which   demand already exceeds even the increased capacity of the supply side of the economy to   provide goods and services Despite probably higher exports, the current account deficit   will still be very high And, therefore, we are likely to have either a stable or somewhat   weaker dollar That will mean that we will not have the benefit in the next year or two of   the very substantial help to core CPI that has come from import prices being significantly   less strong than domestic prices Our analysis, using a passthrough of about 04 of the   exchange rate to import prices, tells us that the core CPI would have been 06 percent higher   over recent years if we hadn’t had that benefit from import prices, and I don’t think we will   continue to have it Thus, we don’t have to be concerned solely about whether we are going   to run out of laborers, even though I think that is a valid concern   The mere things that I’ve cited--essentially the effect on the United States of   international developments--leads us to believe that the core CPI will start creeping up and,   left to its own devices, will hit about 28 percent in 2001 I don’t think that is something   that the Committee should wish to see happen But I feel very strongly that we have done   such a good job of defusing Y2K tensions that the time to interest ourselves in that problem,   which I believe is a very real one, is on February 1st and 2nd and not today Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman For somebody   who likes to have firm views on most subjects, it’s difficult to have a firm view on this   unless one is a theologian rather than a central banker I think both draft statements make it   clear, as you’ve said, that we will have a serious discussion about policy at the February 1st   and 2nd meeting and that there is presently a bias toward tightening at that meeting And   both texts make it clear that we will not change the funds rate until then   2/ The language of the two drafts is provided in Appendix 2     12/21/99 53   What I read in the marketplace now is a conviction that the Fed will tighten but that   the tightening will be sensible and realistic I am a bit concerned that if we put out an   asymmetric directive, the marketplace would pick up not so much what we think but what   some observers think we think That could increase the likelihood of a tightening in   markets--markets that may be very illiquid over the rest of this year--with possible   difficulties in settlement systems in the first two weeks of next year   On the other hand, if we put out the draft with the symmetric language--which is   probably the most hawkish symmetric language any human being has ever seen--I believe   there is very little likelihood that the markets would think the Fed is somehow kinder, nicer   and gentler so let’s rally Even if they did that for five minutes, market participants would   read the text very quickly and the markets would settle down, maybe not within five minutes   but rather quickly I’m basing my view, frankly, on this being my 33rd year of very active   involvement in financial markets I think that the balance of risks is such that the symmetric   language is very unlikely to have any negative result for us With asymmetric language   there is a possibility--I’m not stating that it’s a certainty--that the market would price in   additional Fed tightening over the course of 2000 And in my view the markets are just too   slim and we’ve invested too much in the effort to ensure that the Y2K transition is a smooth   one to take that risk   Where do I stand on it?  I’m probably leaning 55/45, 60/40 at most, toward the view   that symmetric is better than asymmetric I certainly am not even remotely thinking of   dissenting if there is a majority in the other direction But I do have 33 years invested in   looking at markets and that’s my assessment of it    It’s the most hawkish symmetric directive in   history!    I am in support of the recommendations in   the Ferguson memo in all areas Let me direct myself, however, to the discussion of the   Chairman’s intermeeting authority We are not establishing anything new  If a member of     12/21/99 73   the Committee doesn’t know what the current practice is, I would think it is a matter of   having failed to ask When I joined the Committee, I asked what the understanding was and   somebody told me--probably Don Kohn--so I knew what it was So, we are codifying that   which already exists--much against my wishes I should tell you, because I didn’t think it   was appropriate for the matter to be discussed since it already existed The General Counsel   thought it would be better to codify a practice that already existed, and that is why we have   a General Counsel So rather than practice law, I very reluctantly came to the view that we   had to discuss this   The idea that we would take away the intermeeting authority from this Chairman is   to me unthinkable As for the question of whether a future chairman would deserve that   confidence If somebody were nominated for Chairman and I were still here and thought   the person didn’t merit that confidence, I would resign so I could go up to the Hill and   testify about why the person shouldn’t be approved by the Senate Robert’s Rules of Order   dictate the way this Committee works If at some stage the Committee decided that its   Chairman had abused this authority, at the next meeting of the Committee we could say we   hereby disapprove of the Chairman’s action And we could change the Authorization if we   thought the Chairman at the time was capable of abusing the authority again That is   absolutely just a “no-brainer” application of Robert’s Rules So I think we should recognize   that it is on the advice of the General Counsel that we are codifying a practice that already   exists And I can’t imagine why we would think of doing anything else Thank you    And a gentleman on top of that!    I think that’s a good point Let’s just put out   the press release when it’s ready in January    Right At least the truth will set you free!     And I support that view of democracy and the   procedures that elected us, Mr Chairman     I move the slate       I nominate Peter Fisher, Mr Chairman, as   Manager of the System Open Market Account       Move approval     SPEAKER(?)  Second     So move     Second     Move approval     I would like to make a comment also to   applaud the conduct of the Desk  But since I got to drop in and watch them on occasion, I want   to note that one would have thought that this was the most relaxing period that any group of very   young people was going through  And they are very young  Peter Fisher and Sandy Krieger are   ancient compared to the average age of the staff involved!  It was commendable that they   behaved as if going through this firestorm was the most normal thing in the world         Move approval    May I add one comment related to this?  Going   back to Karen's Chart 10, we have been doing a great deal of work on the current account deficit   as a percentage of GDP  In a way the work we’ve done was driven by the notion that given   almost any reasonable pattern one assumes for the world economy, the current account deficit as   a percentage of GDP continues to worsen  As one goes from deep concern to sheer terror about   that prospect, the question arises as to what can possibly be done about it  So one comes out   with questions like “what happens if there is a 25 percent devaluation?”  Just about all the   analysis we have done indicates that a continuing worsening of the current account deficit is   inevitable until and if--rationally or irrationally, as Karen suggested--foreigners decide that they   don't want to hold these assets any more  Go back to Peter Fisher's presentation and look at what   has happened to the euro  Everybody who thought it was wonderful to invest unhedged in euro   assets all of a sudden decided that that wasn't such a very good idea  So over a period of a          47  couple of days the hedges went up  Nobody had to sell any of their underlying assets; they just   hedged them  That drives home the validity of the point that Karen was making  There is very   little distinction between foreign direct investment in bonds and bank deposits and anything else    Once a foreigner decides that he doesn't like dollar assets, the derivatives market gets a very deep   and immediate opportunity to do something about it  Now, there is no way in the world that we   can predict when it might happen  But it certainly seems to me to be a very clear and present   danger  We just don't know whether it will happen eight years from now, eight days from now,   tomorrow morning, or never  The least likely prospect of all is that it will never happen It seems   to me something that clearly has to be taken into serious consideration     Right, they won't     Mr Chairman, the Second District’s economy   began the new year with strong upward momentum  Despite ongoing cost increases in housing   and manufacturing, consumer price inflation has actually decelerated slightly  Unemployment   rates in New Jersey, New York State, and New York City fell to 10-year lows at year-end, while   private sector job growth accelerated to a 36 percent annual rate in December, up from 24   percent in the prior two months and 2 percent in the third quarter  Retailers indicate that sales in   January were fairly strong, with minimal effects from either New York State’s tax-free week or   from the recent snowstorm     The general view expressed by our contacts around the District and by business   leaders who have a national and international reach is that certainly in the United States firms do   not feel that they have pricing power  So, businesses big and small have to run themselves better          68  and take advantage of information technology to be able to preserve their profit margins without   the benefit of price increases    We had a particularly interesting meeting of our Small Business and Agricultural   Advisory Committee last week  Manufacturers, in particular one who produces                                                                              and one who produces highly sophisticated                                                    reported that they were being hurt on the cost side largely because of increased costs of   health benefits  But they said that they simply had to use better information technology because   they couldn’t pass these additional costs along in their prices  In a business that is about as   traditional as one can think of--dairy farming--the use of technology is astounding                                                        now has a piece of equipment on each of his 950+ cows that establishes how   much the cow is walking, how much the cow is eating, and how much the cow is producing  It   also gives 30 hours additional advance warning on whether the cow is developing a respiratory   problem so that medication can be administered earlier and, therefore, there isn’t a loss in milk   production  The fellow who runs several                       has an information system that is so   incredible that he actually knew when one of his restaurants was missing 20 orders of                                        The next morning he confronted the restaurant manager to ask him why he wasn’t   doing a better job  These small anecdotes would lead one to believe that the upside potential on   productivity gains may be real  Unfortunately, because it has both a supply and a demand side   effect, it doesn’t make our jobs any easier  What I view as a matter of great concern, as indicated   in the remark I made before the coffee break, is that I think we face a very clear danger from the   growing current account deficit as a percentage of GDP  If there is anything that tells us in the   Committee that we have to carry out our responsibilities wisely, steadily, and well, it is that          69    I associate myself with Governor Ferguson’s   very wise remarks     “Balance of risks”     Mr Chairman, I fully support your   recommendation, but let me make a few comments  The issue clearly is not whether we should   do nothing, but whether we should firm 25 basis points or 50 basis points  And I agree that in   either case we would have to use the balance of risks language indicating that we are more   concerned about inflation  I think we have to look at ourselves  The reality is that we are   perceived everywhere around the world as the best central bank in the business  We are highly   regarded, highly respected  And our commitment to price stability, certainly as defined by you   in speeches and testimony, is I think unquestioned anywhere  Our style is that of a strong, silent   leader, one who moves incrementally  We move 25 basis points at a time in a very systematic   way  If we were to move 50 basis points--to continue my analogy, if all of a sudden the strong,   silent leader starts beating his chest to show what a tough guy he is--what would be your          128  conclusion?  I believe it would be that he is scared!  What do we have to be frightened about?    We can certainly go about our business in our normal way, continuing to exhibit the confidence   that we have earned by our performance  And I think that is the thing that will contribute the   most to stabilizing the economy  I agree with you fully that a working hypothesis that we will   have to have a series of tightening moves is appropriate, and I believe that that should be in the   background of our thinking  But I feel very strongly that 25 basis points combined with a   balance of risks statement toward inflation concerns is by far the right package for today  Thank   you     Perfect!          142  SEVERAL  Perfect!     Move approval of the domestic operations       You want this issue resolved, not the issue the   Chairman’s referring to?              - 13 -      Mr Chairman, it has struck me in watching   Peter and Don develop this work that even if the issue were not resolved until the first meeting of   next year, the holdings of agency issues in the repo book would be of a size that would permit an   orderly unwinding  We could do that if we were to decide that in addition to Treasuries and   agencies there are other things that we would be able to take as collateral  That is the exit   strategy  Now, would it be better if the Treasury were to reach a conclusion on the agency issue   earlier than that?  Probably  I share the concern that you have raised and have been discussing   with Peter  But my own view is that as long as we approve this today, the time we really need to   decide what our exit strategy should be--and that is what the staff will be working on--is no later   than the first meeting of next year  If it could be done earlier than that, it would be better   because the size of the book would be smaller              - 14 -       And very correctly so      Thus the study     Move approval of the second recommendation     Mr Chairman, the Second District’s economy   continues to expand at a rapid pace and rising costs of energy and other inputs have yet to show   up in core finished goods inflation  Employment has risen at a brisk pace in early 2000, despite   persistent job losses in manufacturing  And what had appeared to be a difficult employment   situation in upstate New York has been wiped away by the revisions in the jobs data  It now   appears that in fact jobs have been increasing quite nicely there, by 16 percent last year in   Buffalo and 28 percent in Albany  So, all is well in the Second District   Turning to the international area for a moment, I would note that even the most steely-  eyed investors who go from the United States to Japan return starry-eyed  The reason is that,   although they see the macroeconomic situation as difficult, they are perceiving what a very good   investor might have perceived in the United States in the mid-1980s, which is that at the level of   the firm things are really beginning to change  I am going to be in Japan next week  But on the   basis of reports I’ve heard from others, I am very inclined to think that Japan is beginning to              - 74 -     recover--or some people who don't tend to be confused on the optimistic side are very confused   indeed  So, I think that is certainly something worth looking at    In the domestic economy, it seems very clear to me that we have the basic, rather nice   problem--but it’s a problem nonetheless--that even though the supply side of the economy can   grow more rapidly, the demand side of the economy is simply too strong  There are a variety of   reasons behind that, and we may have made our jobs a bit more difficult by concentrating on one   or the other aspect of the explanation  My pet observation is the very large size of the current   account deficit, which I don't view as sustainable  But it is a symptom, not a cause  We may   talk about the wealth effect but if we talk too much about its effect on the stock market, I think   we are taking upon ourselves the challenge of deciding what is the right level of stock market   prices, as we seek to bring them down  And since life is a solemn circle that never stops, if we   decide that we can control the market at the top, certainly somebody is going to remind us that   we ought to be able to control it at the bottom and get it to go up  In my view, we have to be   very, very careful in that regard, especially since the tool we have, monetary policy, gets at those   institutions that have a cost of capital related to the real world  The most ridiculously overpriced   stocks are those of new technology companies that have never made any profits  So in effect   their cost of capital is zero  We can't get at them  Only the logic of the marketplace will get at   them  And I believe President Poole is right that special institutional investors want to stay in the   market  And if so--if they either take profits or just rotate out of the tech stocks--they are going   to go into the value stocks because that’s where there is to go  So I think that phenomenon is   likely to continue   I have no question that the path we are on of restraining the demand side of the   economy through tightening monetary policy is the right one and that caution is appropriate  I              - 75 -     emphasize the need for caution because there continues to be a lot about this economy that is   very difficult to understand     I agree with your recommendation and the   reasoning behind it, Mr Chairman     "Vengeance is mine saith the Lord!"     You know what happens to those whose hearts   are pure?  Their strength is as the strength of ten!     Excellent!     So move      4    He’s to your right!  [Laughter]      16    Mr Chairman, I just have a comment  After   our March meeting, I was not sure that even Peter would be able to come up with a formula   that would satisfy all the instructions he received  I think it is quite extraordinary that he, in   fact, has done that  And I believe he should be complimented     I just wanted him to know that his boss also   compliments him!     So move     So move     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second   District economy grew at an exceptional pace in the first quarter, but there are scattered signs   that growth is moderating in the current quarter  Price and wage pressures persist, though   there are still no clear signs of a broad-based acceleration in consumer prices  Employment   grew at a brisk pace in the first quarter despite persistent losses in the manufacturing sector    Unemployment rates continue to reach new cyclical lows  An early May heat wave appears to   have buoyed retail sales in recent weeks following a sluggish March and April  But it's too   early to gauge the monthly performance  Persistent tightness in both the residential and   commercial real estate markets has pushed up rents and selling prices throughout the New   York City area and has spurred increased construction and development  Purchasing   managers indicate that growth in the region's manufacturing sector moderated in April from   its vigorous first-quarter pace while price pressures persisted  And finally, banks report   stronger demand for consumer loans and commercial mortgages but weaker demand for home   mortgages  Banks also indicate further tightening in credit standards and continued   improvement in delinquency rates  So, all of the speeches that we have been giving for   bankers to be prudent may just be having some effect      56  We believe that recent data make it even clearer that reducing the imbalance   between the unsustainable growth in demand and the capacity, though increasing, to produce   goods and services is essential  In addition to the data, anecdotal reports of wage and price   pressures are becoming much more widespread and, therefore, those pressures will show up in   the data even if with some delay  An increased pace of monetary tightening is needed for   purely domestic reasons  I don't think our task will be easy  We have all been putting a great   deal of emphasis on the wealth effect; it does have the advantage of being something that we   can measure and calculate  But I think something quite different could show up and make our   task even harder as the measurable aspect of the wealth effect diminishes  The issue is  Are   we really in a different psychological climate after nine full years of an economic expansion   and the lowest unemployment rate since 1970?  Are we not in a period where Americans,   whether or not they own stocks directly or indirectly, are so absolutely convinced that this   wonderful economy will continue that reining in demand will be considerably more difficult   than we are now predicting it to be?  In other words, our task could be even greater than we   expect     I think the reasons for tightening domestically are very clear, but I am increasingly   concerned about the international situation, especially in the emerging market countries  The   situation in Indonesia has worsened again  Thailand is doing less well  Nobody knows for   sure what could be involved in the suicide of the man who managed the very large foreign   exchange reserves of China  Korea’s very rapid recovery, a pure V-shaped one, has stymied   much necessary structural reform  In our own hemisphere, Venezuela and Colombia have   serious political problems that are spilling over into the economic arena and Peru has also   slipped, with a real question on the forthcoming election  The severe drift in sub-Saharan      57  Africa in every aspect--political, economic, and social--has now carried itself into South   Africa, dramatized by the very severe weakening of its currency  So, I think this rather   disturbing background, which at least compensates for some modest improvement possibly in   Japan and in continental Europe, puts even greater urgency on the need for us to reduce the   imbalances in our own economy  I think it is very important as the world situation gets worse   that we get our own situation as shipshape as possible as soon as possible  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your conclusion    Let me address myself to the concern about "sweaty palms"  We have to remember that the   mission that we have been given by the American people is to provide a monetary policy   appropriate for sustainable economic growth through price stability  The demand in the   economy is simply not sustainable  It has worsened significantly since our last meeting and,   therefore, it seems to me absolutely essential that we pick up the pace of tightening  That in   no way leads me to believe that we are going to end up at 7, 7-1/4, or 7-1/2 percent on the   funds rate  I don't have any idea where we are going to end our tightening  And I think we   have to be very cautious and make these judgments very carefully so that we don't overdo the   tightening  That’s especially the case given my concern, which I expressed earlier, that we   have such a state of euphoria among the general public in the United States that it could be   subject to a rather rapid and quick change  In that circumstance the likelihood of overdoing it   on the tightening side is something we have to keep very much in mind     But for today if we did not do 50 basis points with the balance of risks language   indicating a greater concern for inflation, I think we would just feed the euphoria that I believe   at the present time is rather dangerous  That would be very inappropriate to do  So, I think   we are not in the "sweaty hands" period but in the "cool heads" period, and I believe this is the   right action to take     So move     Move approval of the domestic operations     In his comment a few moments ago, Don   Kohn pointed out the degree to which this projection also depends on the model’s forecast of a   fairly significant depreciation of the dollar  The first quarter should remind us that the appetite   of foreigners for investing in the United States seems to be huge  I doubt that anybody in this   room is more frightened about the current account deficit than I am  But it is not at all clear to   me that the deficit could not grow to 4-1/2, 5, 5-1/2 or 6 percent of GDP and we could still   maintain a considerably stronger dollar than in the model  There might still be enough people   outside the United States who think this is a much more attractive place to invest than the   emerging market countries—or, heaven knows, Japan or even Europe with its structural   problems  That is just another area of uncertainty on top of the uncertainty about the NAIRU   that makes one rather humble about the reliability of the forecast  I must say that I commend   the attitude of this discussion with respect to just how wide the confidence intervals are           38    Mr Chairman, economic growth in the   Second District is minusculy slower than it was the last time we were together, but the slowing   is almost imperceptible As I interpreted the comments of other Reserve Bank Presidents, I   think the slowdown in the Second District is not as much as that in other Districts,            78  On the energy question, I had the good fortune to spend about an hour and a half   today with the energy minister of                                        and I think his insights are worth   sharing  He feels that there is inadequate emphasis placed on the effects from the period of very   low prices in two respects  First, the high-cost marginal suppliers were put out of business and   will stay out of business, so a part of the available supply simply has shut down and will stay   shut down  Secondly, the normal level of investment in new supply was reduced considerably    Therefore, until about two years from now, when the current investment in new supply of   petroleum and other energy sources comes on stream, he believes we will continue to have a   fairly high price, unless the Gulf producers decide just to increase their output  In his estimate   they would have to increase production by about 1-1/2 million barrels a day, which does not   seem particularly likely  I note that the gentleman represents a point of view which would   prefer that the energy price be in the $20 to $25 per barrel area, and he is not very optimistic   about seeing that for another 18 to 24 months   As for the national economy, some slowing appears to be evident, but I think we have   to be a bit careful because the data gave false signals of a slowing in the second quarter in both   1998 and 1999  That’s not unrelated to the fact that we haven't had a serious winter in this   country since 1997 and, therefore, the seasonals tend to give off some funny signals  However,   I think we can assume that the likelihood of some slowing is there  All of the research we've   done, going back to the early 1980s, on how long tightening takes to be effective would lead   one to believe that very little effect of the tightening we've done so far is in play  That’s   especially true if one agrees with the view that the first 75 basis points involved a correction or   undoing of the easing that we implemented, for understandable reasons, in the fall of 1998  So,   if we see some slowing already, with very little of the tightening having taken hold yet, then I           79  think it would be reasonable to believe that the economy will continue to slow over the future    However, in my view, the main point is that we should conclude that we have time to watch and   reflect as developments unfold     It seems to me that over the last several years our best judgment has been that we   have been willing to be reflective when we have been uncertain  Yet at the same time, because   of our firming action in 1994 and 1995 and our firming action in the present cycle, including the   most recent increase of 50 basis points, it seems to me that the Federal Reserve has maximum   credibility  And that gives us an opportunity to watch and wait when we think that that is the   right thing to do     On the NAIRU, having become an arch skeptic about its usefulness, I went back and   reminded myself of what I had said in our discussions in 1994 when I certainly sounded like a   very true believer in the NAIRU  So if I have turned agnostic, it is a recent change and the   question, therefore, is whether it is enduring or whether I think the NAIRU is on vacation for a   while  I think it's probably the latter and that in fact the NAIRU is a useful tool, which we will   find more useful in the future when we are a bit more certain about how it is functioning and   where it really is     I bring this up largely because I think we have to be very careful in our statements   about the NAIRU and about an ideal level of unemployment  If one listens to the discussion   today, everybody here, whether skeptical or believing in the NAIRU, views it as a tool and not   as a policy goal  Yet I think many observers, especially journalists, cannot make that   distinction  When we discuss the NAIRU in our public remarks, either in speeches or   interviews, in some cases at least we are coming across as if we believe that we need to have an   unemployment rate of “x”--which is considerably higher than what we have now--and if we           80  don’t, there is something wrong  The Congress of the United States never put us in the business   of having a certain unemployment rate as our goal  So if we want to use NAIRU as a tool, as I   think we certainly did in the past--some still wish to, and probably most of us will in the future--  we ought to be very careful that we're talking about it as a tool and not as a goal  Very clearly,   and I think unwisely, we will lose the support of the American people if they think that what we   are trying to do is to increase the number of unemployed people by 1-1/2 percent of the   workforce     Mr Chairman, I agree 100 percent with the   substance of what you said  Let me suggest a procedure  I think there is great benefit to our   practice of discussing the goals and strategy of monetary policy in detail twice each year  I say           89  that because at most of the other meetings, even though we wander in and out of discussions of   strategy, mainly what we are doing is talking about tactics  I would suggest that we not indicate   in the minutes of this meeting that we are planning to discuss a formal inflation target  First of   all, I have a very strong view that that is the purview of the Congress, not of the FOMC  And if   it were made public that we were going to establish an inflation target, I believe many people in   the Congress--and I would be one if I were in Congress--would say, ”Well, if you’re going to   talk about that, please come up here and discuss it with us”  I think that would be highly   counterproductive  I also agree very much that trying to pinpoint a number that we all agree on   would be a specious exercise in precision  Even though some of us come at it from different   directions, I really do believe that the degree of unanimity on this Committee is quite   extraordinary  And in my view arguing about a number would be counterproductive, not   productive     Mr Chairman, I support your   recommendation     That was meant as a compliment!     Mr Chairman, I have more of a comment than a   question  It seems to me that a country that has a current account deficit of more than 4 percent of   GDP has to be very concerned about anything that would affect foreign views about investing in that   country, as your comment a moment ago suggests  I think the likelihood of our being able to lead   the                                                 to understand what we want them to do and have all those   conversations be tranquil and pleasant is quite low  I believe we have to be very sensitive to the fact   that Peter and those at the Under Secretary level at the Treasury have to have an ongoing amicable   relationship with their                                         This may be a case where some of the heavy hitting   has to be done by people with fancy titles who will have to take on a more aggressive, but I hope   pleasant, posture in getting                       to do what we want them to do  As your comment suggests,   if we have a US Treasury market that is seriously disturbed, it could have a significant negative   effect on foreigners’ views of whether they want to invest in a broader range of US assets  Until   we get our current account deficit reduced--if in fact we do--that is an outcome we simply can’t   afford     Move approval of the domestic operations     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent indicators   suggest that economic growth in the Second District has slowed since the last report  Price pressures   persist but have yet to show up in any broad-based measure of consumer prices  Unemployment   rates in the District were mixed in July, rising from 34 percent to 37 percent in our part of New   Jersey, but falling from 45 percent to 42 percent in the State of New York  Total payroll   employment was pulled down by declines in the public sector, reflecting both a winding down of the   2000 Census and a substantial drop-off in summer jobs programs throughout the state    In the private sector, job growth has moderated a bit in recent months  In July private   sector employment grew at a 11 percent annual pace; that is down from 18 percent in the second   quarter and 21 percent in the first quarter  Most retailers indicate that overall sales continue to run   somewhat below plans since the last report  Our contacts report that an unseasonably cool summer--  actually we didn't have to talk to our contacts to find that out [laughter]--has held down sales of       54  summer wear and air conditioners, leading to some buildup of inventories and very steep   markdowns   The District's real estate markets have been mixed, with signs of slowing in the residential   sector  But in the commercial sector New York City's shortage of office space shows no signs of   abating, with rents continuing to spiral upward  Midtown Manhattan's office availability rate was   little changed at an extraordinarily low 34 percent at the end of July; downtown’s rate was steady at   5-1/2 percent  Both of those figures are less than half of what they were just a year ago  Not   surprisingly the surge in asking rents has been stunning  They have been rising at an annual rate of   nearly 50 percent over the past three months and are roughly 30 percent higher than at this time last   year  Most of the leasing activity is reported to be coming from the high-tech, financial, and   telecommunications sectors  In residential housing, there is a definite slowdown around the District   in general  In upscale Manhattan, that is mainly reflected in the fact that bidding wars are less   frequent and upscale apartments stay on the market for as long as three weeks instead of about three   minutes as was the case about six months ago   The regional purchasing managers’ survey suggests continued improvement in business   conditions in July and some moderation in price pressures  The consumer price index for   metropolitan New York City rose 31 percent over the 12 months ended in July, which is slightly   higher than at the end of June when it was up 29 percent  The rise mainly reflects a sharp increase   in energy prices  Electricity costs in New York City and the lower Hudson Valley surged in July,   with the average customer’s bill up 43 percent from a year earlier  Given that July of 1999 was, I   believe, one of the hottest on records and July of this year one of the coolest, one can imagine how   large the increase was per BTU  Loan demand in the District is slacking off somewhat  So, in   general there is a feel that the economy in the District is still pretty robust but slowing somewhat       55  On the national level, recent data indicate that growth of consumer spending has   moderated, while housing starts and sales are declining  For the second half of 2000 we expect   growth to average about 4 percent, down from 5 percent in the first half  We continue to expect   some further slowing of growth in 2001 to around 3-1/2 percent, largely because we think there is a   fair amount of monetary policy tightening still in the pipeline  The continued acceleration in   productivity growth has led us to adjust upward once again our estimate of the economy's potential    We now have it at 4-1/2 percent  With growth substantially below potential over the forecast   horizon, we expect the unemployment rate to begin rising later this year, eventually reaching about   4-1/2 percent by the end of 2001  That has led to a significant scaling back of the projected rise of   core inflation in our forecast  We now have it at 26 percent Q4-Q4 for 2001, down a full 1/2   percentage point from our forecast in June  Although growth appears to be moderating and the   continued acceleration of productivity has damped inflation projections, we think the balance of   risks continues to be in the direction of concern about inflation  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I   want to talk a bit about the balance of risks sentence we have been using in the press statement as          77   opposed to the asymmetry language we previously had in the directive, and how much we have   benefited from that change  I think what we mainly have accomplished is to convince the   marketplace--and slowly the economists in the marketplace--that we are in fact looking over the   longer run and not from meeting to meeting  They are now convinced that the Federal Reserve is   looking at monetary policy as it affects the economy over a longer period of time  Therefore, the   balance of risks statement toward either inflation on one side or toward too weak an economy on the   other, I believe, has had a very considerable positive effect on our ability to carry out policy  It   certainly does not change the need for us to take action when action is appropriate     There is, I think, a lingering debate within the Committee about what we need in order to   have high credibility  Basically, what I think we need is the reputation of having good judgment and   courage--the judgment to evaluate the risks in a reasonable way and to decide what is the right course   of action and then the courage to take the action  It is easy to make the right decision if it is perfectly   obvious what it is  That is never the case with us  We are always looking through a dark glass,   thinking about what is the best thing to do and then acting courageously to do it  In my view the   Committee has a very, very high reputation in that regard and it is something that is of immense   importance to us     Today I think we clearly have to look at the economy in the way you have suggested  I   agree that maintaining the present stance of policy is appropriate and, certainly, we should continue to   reflect our view that the balance of risks is toward rising inflation     Or 100 percent!     It’s an institutional difference     The Federal Reserve represents both itself and the   Treasury of the United States whereas the ECB does not represent the treasuries of its member   countries but is just the central bank     May I comment?     I’ve been at the Reserve Federal for 8-½ years,   having had Peter’s job and now the Vice Chairmanship of the Committee, and I think economic   theory is wonderful and is extremely helpful in guiding us in our judgments  But in my time here, I   have found that very occasionally one reaches the point, as the Chairman has just been suggesting,   that we as central bankers have to make practical decisions, knowing that they are not consistent   with the soundest possible economic theory  This was one of those occasions  Given that this was   our first intervention since 1998 and one of the very few that we have done over the course of many   years, I think the members of this Committee should have the confidence that the Chairman makes   these decisions very rarely, and in my view very wisely  He is helped a great deal by the New York   Desk  I usually am actively involved and I am the person who is frequently called first because they   know I usually say “no”  And for some reason they have decided that a “no” from me is less   appalling than a “no” from the Chairman  We are constantly telling others--                                       that interventions basically accomplish nothing  But there are very rare occasions, and I think this   was one of them, when the overall responsibility for the management of the world economy, which   is something in which we are the major player but not the only player, requires us to respond   favorably to a request for intervention  But we do so on very arduous terms from the point of view   of the requester  This latest case involved a request that we in fact have been actively turning down   for months  But the situation had reached a point                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And in my      17  judgment, the monetary authorities of the United States very reluctantly made the right decision to   join in the intervention   When we are dealing with these situations we really don’t want to be in the position of   requiring a Committee meeting to say no because we say no 999 percent of the time  It would be   extremely awkward for us to say, when we are in the middle of these rolling negotiations, that we   have to tune out for X hours in order to have an FOMC meeting  With the track record of the   Chairman and the amount of confidence that we have in him, I think having the Chairman make the   decision on use of the System’s money is appropriate  As a matter of fact, if the amounts involved   get to a certain level, the Committee’s standing procedural instructions provide that the Chairman   shall clear the proposed intervention with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee--which currently   consists of the Chairman, Governor Ferguson, Governor Kelley, and me  We are 100 percent in   agreement with you on the theory, but pragmatic considerations very, very occasionally guide us to a   different conclusion       Let me return more to President Poole’s argument,   and perhaps make a less subtle comment than the Chairman just made  If you really want us out   marketing the view that intervention is a terrible idea, we can do it much more effectively with our   present relationship with the Treasury than we can without it  The amount of influence that we have   in international circles is enhanced by the role we play  So it isn’t just Alan Greenspan, Bill   McDonough, and others around the table giving our pet idea on some theory, but rather that we also   have power--and “clout” in the language of my native city--and that’s very important for us  So in   my view we are carrying your gospel more effectively with the present arrangement than we would   without it  I’m absolutely convinced of that     Second     So move     Mr Chairman, before we resume our discussion,   let me mention the Basel capital accord  If all goes well, on our present schedule the Basel   Committee will approve the new accord at a meeting to be held in New York in mid-December  I   thought it might be useful to take advantage of the December meeting of this Committee to provide   an opportunity to brief the Reserve Bank presidents--and your heads of supervision, if you wish to   bring them with you--on that subject  We would plan to give a 2 to 2-1/2 hour briefing on what the   accord is so that you will be familiar with it before it is made public, as presently scheduled, on the   16th of January  If that is attractive to you, would you let Don Kohn know whether you would   prefer to have that session on Monday afternoon, the day before the meeting, or on Tuesday   afternoon, the day of the meeting?  Considering the length of the briefing and the heaviness of the   material, you might want to make it on Monday afternoon, but please inform Don of your   preference  Thank you     Mr Chairman, the Second District’s economy has   continued to expand at a moderate pace since my last report, while consumer price inflation has   remained subdued in the face of ongoing, though diminishing, cost pressures  After adjusting for the   Verizon strike, private sector job growth accelerated noticeably in August to a more than 3 percent   annual rate, though the reduction of Census workers appears to have boosted the unemployment rate   slightly  Retail sales apparently turned sluggish again in mid-September following a brief pickup   early in the month, while retail prices remained virtually flat  Our sources are giving virtually the   same story that President Stern just described of a noticeable slowing in retail sales and considerable   concern about the holiday season   While New York City’s office market remains extremely tight, residential real estate   markets appear to have cooled a bit  Home construction activity has tapered off noticeably in the   third quarter, although some of this slowing, especially in northern New Jersey, seems to reflect land   and labor constraints  Home prices in New York City are up 10 to 15 percent from a year ago but   that represents a slight deceleration, and unit sales continue to decline  Housing markets in upstate   New York are mixed but on balance improving  Purchasing managers in the region report continued   growth in manufacturing activity, with some diminution in price pressures in September  And local      62  banks report a continuation of recent trends weakening loan demand, tightening credit standards,   and falling delinquency rates--a banking supervisor’s dream   We think the national economy is slowing just as monetary policy tightening by this   Committee intended it to slow  We share the view that energy costs will not cause great damage    My own view is that the forward markets are not accurately reflecting the increased supply that will   result from the increased investment taking place, as President Hoenig described for his District  If I   am right and therefore energy prices begin to trail off after the winter in the Northern Hemisphere,   that should bring energy prices down just about in time to avoid what I think is the considerable risk   of the higher energy prices increasing inflation expectations     Our research indicates that the productivity revolution is continuing and is spreading more   broadly to the many users of technology  And, therefore, we agree with the Greenbook’s view and   perhaps are even more optimistic  I also believe that our economy has now demonstrated for long   enough an ability to operate with an unemployment rate at or near 4 percent that we can presume   that it is likely to continue to do so for at least a while  Our growth forecast has the economy   expanding below potential, which we put at 4-1/2 percent per annum  We think the present stance of   monetary policy is just where it should be  As we get into next year I think there will be a question   as to whether our assessment of the balance of risks will have to be shifted  But for the present I   believe that the formal statement that the balance of risks is toward inflation continues to be the   correct one  Thank you     I concur with your recommendation, Mr   Chairman, to keep the fed funds at its current level and to retain the statement that the balance of   risks is on the inflation side      82    Bravo!     Approved by silence it appears!     It's a very low interest rate     So move     Move approval of the domestic operations   SPEAKER(?)  Second     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second   District’s economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace since the last report  Price   pressures persist though they have become somewhat less pronounced recently  Private sector   job growth accelerated slightly in the third quarter to a 21 percent annual rate while   unemployment rates remained unchanged  Retail sales were reported to be on or close to plan   but that's largely because steep price markdowns helped clear out excess inventories and also   pulled overall retail prices down slightly               57      On the national level, we think the economy could slow a bit more than projected in   our own and the Greenbook's forecasts  That seems to be a definite possibility based on purely   domestic considerations  But I will admit that that assessment is based more on anecdotal   reports than on pure analysis     What does concern me considerably on the weakness side is what I feel is going on   internationally and what might go on internationally I think the forecast that Vince Reinhart   presented for the international economy is probably the right forecast  But I feel very much as I   did in the summer of 1998, before August--that there is a sort of eerie calm waiting for an   accident to happen  And there are some places where I think an accident could easily happen    Just looking at the industrial world, Japan has a horrendously badly structured   economy with much too much emphasis on a continuing push from fiscal policy  The business   sector is investing somewhat strongly and really is the only push behind the small amount of   growth that one sees in Japan  The consumer, however, is very, very wary  I think                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  have finally decided that it is time to show their   hand  The present leadership of the country is very much in the hands of the old economy--the   construction industry, farmers, and heavy manufacturers  The aging of the population involves a   fiscal problem that is dramatic even by Italian standards  What the reformers are seeing is that   they are simply going to have to take political power and change rather radically the   macroeconomic policy of the country  But even if they are successful at taking over, the forces   against change are so great that I think their chances of success are not very high  And yet what               58      could happen because of this possible or even likely political change is that an already fragile   situation could become more so with considerable effect on the rest of Asia   In Southeast Asia there are a few areas of strength, including Singapore, Hong Kong,   and Taiwan  But the serious problem countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, continue to be   very weak and are very much dependent on strong exports  Moreover, the structural change that   they very badly needed as of 1997-98 by and large has not taken place  The same is essentially   true of Korea  Even though                                                                                                            there still is a great reluctance to allow economic reality to be manifest  Instead, efforts are   directed at trying to patch things together  That does not leave a situation in which any ripple   effect coming from someplace else would be easily manageable   As for our friends in Europe, when we talk to them about the weakness of the euro,   they understand that the main reason the euro is weak is because they have experienced   substantial outflows of capital  That reflects the fact that their own citizens seem to think,   correctly, that investing in the United States is better than investing at home, and they know the   reason is that there’s a very significant productivity gap  Just as the productivity gap against the   United States led to the long trend of the weakening dollar in the 1970s, it has been the main   driver behind the strengthening trend of the dollar in the latter part of the 1990s  Add in the   short-term effect of higher growth expectations in the United States than in Europe, and those   two factors add up, I think, to a reasonably good explanation of why the euro is where it is   Now, when we talk to the Europeans in those sort of analytical terms, they nod their   heads sagely and find the analysis acceptable  But they are desperately concerned about the   political reaction within their countries to the weakness of the currency  They are particularly               59      concerned that the reaction is going to be more obvious in 2002 when the Deutschemark and the   French franc disappear and the euro takes their place  At that time I believe the underlying and   growing anti-Americanism, which is very clear in Europe, is going to become more manifest    And that is precisely the time when the industrial world should probably be working in   cooperation  I think that will become increasingly difficult   We have a very serious problem in Argentina in my view  Argentina is a country in   which a brilliant politician, President Menem, decided to put in a foreign exchange regime, not   because of its                               but because                                                                                                  That country has seemed incapable of imposing enough                                                      so he tied its currency on a one-to-one basis to the US dollar and decided that he was   going to import discipline  Twice--after the Tequila crisis of 1995 and the Brazilian devaluation   more recently--there was a very difficult macroeconomic adjustment for the real economy  Now,   with a much weaker political leadership and a much more difficult economic situation, there's a   very real question of whether that exchange rate regime--which continues to be vital for the   political stability of the country--can be maintained  Essentially, what the IMF is trying to do,   and what the rest of us will eventually be called on to do, is to try to see what can be done to help   maintain stability there  Can a country with a structurally overvalued exchange rate, which they   don't want to change for political reasons, and with an economic growth of maybe 2 or 3 percent   per year, which they also need to keep the nation together politically, make it?  It's a very, very   tough call as to whether it is going to work  The contagion effects on what I have described as   the other problem spots in the world could be a lot greater than the size of the Argentine   economy in the world would seem to suggest  It may well be that we will continue to muddle               60      along and the world economic situation will be more or less as we’ve described it, which   probably is the right forecast  But I think we have to pray a lot and hope that God is very good   for that to actually work out   As for our own situation, it seems to me that that danger outside our country calls for   us to be even more prudent than usual in our own responsibilities for the management of the US   economy  I do think that we are moving more toward a balance of risks between inflation and   insufficient growth  My own feeling is that we are heading in the direction of balance, but I   don't think we are quite there yet  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I find myself exactly   where you are  I believe that we have to stay with the balance of risks on the side of   inflation but we also have to express our view that the real world has changed somewhat    The proposed verbiage certainly sounds like something a central bank would produce    [Laughter]  Since we are a central bank, I think it says just the right thing and I believe   that the language sets the right tone  So, I agree fully with your proposal      I think we just won the argument!  [Laughter]     Time to vote     So move   SPEAKER(?)  Second     Different people handling the portfolio who don’t   talk to each other     Move approval of domestic operations     Well, I’ll tell you what I was thinking about  In   further answer to Jerry Jordan’s question, if you look back at 1996-97, the A1/P1 line was very flat   then   In 1997-98 we had the Asian crisis, in 1998-99 we had the Russian crisis, and in 1999-2000   we had Y2K  So one can argue that this year is the closest thing we’ve had to a normal year since   this time in 1996  I don’t know if that’s valid, but that’s what I was thinking of when I forgot to   move approval of the domestic operations      11    Mr Chairman, two points One, I associate myself   with your comments 1000 percent, which is 10 times more than the usual enthusiasm with which I   support your views     This will work out better!  My second point is on   the staff presentations  I think the reason there seem to be no questions or comments is that the   presentations were remarkably good and extremely well balanced  I'd like to note that I thought   Karen’s presentation of the balance of risks internationally was right on the mark  I wouldn’t   disagree with a single thing she said     There is no way I can top that!  Mr Chairman, the   Second District’s economy continues to expand, though at a more subdued pace than in some time    Cost and wage pressures persist, but there are few signs that these increases are being passed along   to consumers  Private sector employment grew at a brisk 1-1/2 percent annual rate in October, a bit   below the third-quarter pace, despite declines in manufacturing  Unemployment rates continue to   hold steady near cyclical lows  New York State retailers report that same-store sales slowed   somewhat in early December and were running 2 to 4 percent ahead of a year ago, led by book,   record, and specialty apparel stores   Available official and private sector data make it clear that the expansion is slowing to a   pace below trend growth  Inflation seems quiescent, but it is not decreasing  Anecdotal evidence,   however, is overwhelming that the economy is slowing considerably faster than the available data      59  indicate, and the anecdotal information is more forward-looking  The economy in my view is highly   likely to grow at a slower pace than we had hoped to achieve through our policy tightening   It is clear in my view that the balance of risks has shifted and now points to concern about   economic weakness  For this Committee not to note the realities of the world in which we live   would itself be a source of instability  Our choice today, it seems to me, is between one of two   options  One is a reduction in the fed funds rate, probably by 25 basis points, with a statement that   the risks are balanced between concern about inflation and about economic weakness  Alternatively,   we could leave the rate where it is and go to language expressing the view that the risks are weighted   mainly toward concern about economic weakness  I prefer the latter option for two reasons   First of all, it’s closer to my own view  Secondly, it gives us maximum flexibility to   respond to incoming data by reducing rates early next year either at our next meeting or beforehand   if the data are sufficiently weak to make the more dramatic response of a move between meetings   appropriate  On the other hand, if the data are not clearly in that direction, it also leaves us the   option of not having to move the rate at all  Although a shift in the balance of risks language from   our current stance of risks toward inflation to one of risks toward weakness in economic growth is   rather strong, it really more clearly reflects what is going on in markets  I think the markets are   assuming that, as a minimum, we will go to a balanced risks statement  And in the last few days, the   view has probably become that we will move to language that the risks are weighted toward   economic weakness  On the other hand, I don't think the banging of the gong of a rate change at this   meeting is anticipated  Now, the markets are extraordinarily thin and very risk averse  And   therefore, if we were to do something that might be deemed a bit too dramatic, I am not sure what   the market reaction would be--especially what the second or third tier reactions would be after the   first one  It seems to me that that is a bit more risk than we need to take when there is an option for      60  us to show that we see what's going on--that we are concerned about economic weakness--without   taking the market risk that I think a rate move would involve  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I agree fully with both the   conclusions you’ve reached and the reasoning for them  I believe that the most important thing in   public life is to know what you don’t know  And we don't in fact know enough at this point to move   the rate downward  Doing so would be unwise, in my view, especially for the reasons I cited earlier    The markets are just too thin  But I think we have to have the balance of risks toward concern for   economic weakness, and we have to be very flexible during the month of January as you have   suggested     I don't think we will make you our press secretary!     He is very consistent     I think most people, unlike experts, understand   growth more than activity     Thank you     Mr Chairman, this is Bill McDonough  May I   make a comment, please?     I believe that what you are recommending is   very much the policy action that should be taken in all of its respects  Let me add some   additional elements to the very good analysis of the real economy, as seen from the data and   supported by some anecdotal evidence, you have cited  I believe that the markets and the leaders   of major firms in the world are at or near a point of psychological crisis  The pessimism about     1/3/01 7  what is likely to happen in the economy is at a point where it can start feeding upon itself, which   could make the extent of the slowdown in the expansion greater than would be in the interest of   the country  That, therefore, makes it even more clear that we should act   A number of us often wonder about the credibility of the Federal Open Market   Committee when we consider taking an action that would be rather dramatic both in its timing   and its degree  I believe very strongly, as I’ve said on many occasions, that we maximize our   credibility by making the moves that are necessary when we deem them to be necessary  Merely   maintaining a tough-line monetary policy for the sake thereof diminishes our credibility  We   enhance it and do the best for the country by taking aggressive action when it is necessary, and I   believe that at the present time the action you suggested is very necessary indeed  Thank you     This is Bill again  I think that’s exactly the   right message to give     Mr Chairman, it’s Bill again       I think we’re getting this message much too   complicated for the average human being to understand  In my view, emphasizing the taking   back of our final rate increase of last year, even though arithmetically correct, would lead to a   story that the Fed blew it in its last 50 basis point increase and, therefore, corrected its mistake  I   prefer the way that you described it earlier, before some of the intervening commentary  The   point is that the real funds rate is simply too high in relation to what has been happening in the   economy and, therefore, the Federal Reserve has taken action to bring the federal funds rate   down to an appropriate level  That’s a message that’s quite easy to understand  It really   subsumes all of these other issues we’ve been talking about  When we come out with a move of   this size, that is both unexpected and earlier than people had anticipated, I would caution all of us   to try not to make the message too complicated  We ought to make it fairly simple The Federal   Reserve has decided that it should take appropriate action to reduce interest rates to bring the real   fed funds rate to where we think it should be  Period, full stop     Mr Chairman, it’s Bill  I think the statement is   absolutely right on the mark  I would encourage very strongly that we get it out as soon as   possible  As for my own Reserve Bank, our next telephone conference call is scheduled for   tomorrow  And I’m sure, based on the conversation at our most recent meeting, that a request   from the New York Bank directors for an additional 25 basis point cut in the discount rate will be   in by 500 pm our time tomorrow afternoon      This is Bill  Mr Chairman, this is an awfully hot   decision that we've made and assuming that the Board of Governors will act rather promptly on   the discount rate, I wonder if we couldn't release the press statement immediately after that vote    To sit on this for another hour and eighteen minutes really troubles me  I'd very much like to   force the nice people in the pressroom to have their sandwich a half-hour later      Well, I think the Chairman has to make the call    I'm not concerned about the--      I think I raised my objection largely so that you   could make that comment, Mr Chairman      Make it as boring as possible     So move     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me   make a quick comment on the issue we just discussed before I go into what I had   intended to say  As long as the business cycle exists, I think there will be times when the   government will and should be in surplus  And there are times when the government will   and probably should be in deficit  I hope that doesn’t brand me as a Keynesian, which   certainly I’m not, but I think that’s how the accounting works  There will be times,   therefore, as your testimony last week indicated extremely well, when some entity in the   government will be accumulating assets  For the Federal Reserve to say “not us,” and   then plan to have a particularly palsy relationship with the Treasury in order to avoid that     1/30-31/01 18  entity being the Federal Reserve, I think is ill-advised public policy  I doubt that it would   be a very good idea to encourage the invidious notion of Social Security or any other part   of the US government being in the business of holding private assets There would be   the temptation--and humans would surely succumb to temptation as they have since the   fall of Adam--for political meddling in the private sector  I think we should avoid that in   any way that we possibly can     Let me direct myself now to some of the questions that Don raised  One   involves the relative merits of a highly diversified portfolio versus a portfolio whose   principal attractiveness would be a greater degree of liquidity  I think that dichotomy is   based in its extreme on the notion that our holdings of market assets are of such a size   that if we have a large position in a more diversified group of assets, we would really be   moving the markets and, therefore, having a slight but still significant effect on the   relative prices of assets  I believe the degree to which we have a relatively small portion   of a diversified but liquid portfolio makes that dichotomy less than complete  So I think   we need to study this more  How much can we diversify the portfolio and still keep it   liquid?  How do we achieve both goals?  To me the size of our holdings is the key to   answering that question   As regards the balance between outright transactions and RPs, I think we’ve   had it about right over time  When we have a permanent need to add to reserves, we do it   through outright purchases  The question is, outright purchase of what?  Thus far the   experience we’ve had on the tradeoff between outright transactions and RPs indicates that   the process is working very well, and therefore it should be a guide to how we would   continue to operate in the future       1/30-31/01 19  As for the use of the discount window for monetary policy purposes, it seems   to me that we should look at the present situation and differentiate between two aspects   of the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities  One is our primary responsibility, which is   monetary policy  Another, although not the only other, is our responsibility for the safety   and soundness of the financial system--particularly the commercial banking system,   given our role as bank supervisors  That’s especially true since the passage of the   Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill, which gives us even broader responsibility as umbrella   supervisor of financial holding companies     Let me note one of the good things about the present system, especially if we   could attain Governor Gramlich’s goal of moving the discount rate to a penalty rate  A   penalty rate would be much more consistent with the way the discount rate should be   used than it is now--where by historical accident it is below the fed funds rate  Using the   discount window with a penalty rate is very consistent with the Federal Reserve’s   approach to banking supervision  And that approach is that we expect bankers to be good   bankers  We reward them for being good bankers by allowing them to do certain things   if they’re well capitalized  And we punish them rather severely, including by formal   actions, if they’re not such good bankers  I speak with considerable experience, having   been the risk manager and the financial manager of a large bank holding company, when   I say that if liquidity is readily available at the discount window, it would be easy--even   in a well managed bank--to succumb to the temptation to borrow  Now, the fact that   there is a temptation does not mean that every bank has to be a sinner  There is   temptation in the world and there are highly virtuous people, maybe even saints  But   again, human nature being what it is, I think there would be a tendency for the     1/30-31/01 20  availability of the discount window at a relatively low discount rate to interfere with   sound management of banks  Banks might engage in less sound asset and liability   management practices and less sound liquidity management  That’s not a conclusion; it’s   a question  If we, the Committee and the Board together, decide to move forward and   seriously consider the use of the discount window as an instrument of monetary policy to   any meaningful degree, then I think we would have to expand the scope of the questions   we’ve been asking  And one question to include would be this issue of the tradeoff   between two of our responsibilities  Thank you     Exactly     You mean shooting a mouse with a   cannon     Sandy was here at the time of Drexel      And it certainly explains why we want   to study state and municipals at the same time     Amen!     Move approval     Move approval     Mr Chairman, I assume that we would   be better off to have you go into those discussions with the Authorization for Foreign   Currency Operations in place, which means we should renew the authorization today       If, as a result of your conversations   there is some reason to change it, we can do so later     Do you need a motion for the foreign   currency instruments?     So move     It is the very active marketing of that   facility by the Home Loan Banks that makes me worry about the effect it has on how   well people manage their depository institutions     I share Peter’s view that if the Lombard   rate, or whatever we call it, were above the fed funds rate--which is where it ought to be--   institutions would be much more likely to use the window     Exactly  I was a CFO in the heyday of   banks worrying about going to the window  I can’t tell you how many banks had   somebody assigned to kick the computer from time to time so it would stop working and   the bank could pretend that it didn’t know its reserve position!     The key is that the term RP is the   residual  That's his fudge factor     I move approval of the domestic   operations, Mr Chairman     I think she’s absolutely right on that     At our last board meeting in New York   our directors were less than kind or fully complimentary about our forecasting skills, and   other than trying to stick up for my colleagues I didn’t have a very good answer for them      1/30-31/01 123  Do we have a process around the System of asking--given that in our forecasts we all   missed this sharp drop-off in the third and fourth quarters--what we have learned from the   experience that would enhance our likelihood of at least getting it better the next time?     I made the comment to my directors   that certainly last September, October, and November I was talking a lot to people who     1/30-31/01 125  said that the economy was going to hell  But every month of every quarter I’m talking to   people who say that the economy is going to hell, so that doesn’t help me a whole lot!      So do I     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second   District trailed the national economy in strengthening in the early part of the 1990s and   then grew a bit more slowly thereafter  Apparently justice prevails in the end because I   think we have the most optimistic District commentary so far today  The Second     1/30-31/01 153  District’s economy has shown few signs of slowing in recent weeks and there is little   indication of any pickup in inflationary pressures   In the fourth quarter, private sector job growth decelerated somewhat in New   Jersey to a 09 percent annual pace but remained strong in New York State at 18 percent    Weakness in manufacturing employment, of course, is a lesser problem for us because so   much of manufacturing has long since left the District, but the bit of weakness we saw in   that area was offset by strong job gains in construction, business services, and finance    As a result, unemployment rates were little changed  Retail sales were reported to be   steady in early January, and steep markdowns of clearance merchandise, especially   clothing, helped to keep inventories at satisfactory levels  Construction and real estate   remain generally strong with only very scattered signs of softening, mainly in the   Manhattan office market, which is still very, very tight but slackened somewhat in the   fourth quarter  Availability rates have edged up  Rents have stopped rising but certainly   have not started to fall  And subleasing activity has risen sharply, largely in space given   up by dot-com companies that no longer exist  Regional purchasing managers reported   steady to stronger business conditions in December as well as increasingly widespread   input price pressures  And finally, local banks reported weakening loan demand, some   further tightening in credit standards, and an uptick in consumer delinquency rates     Against that background one might think--if one attended the same sort of   parties that many attend on the upper West Side, the upper East Side, lower Manhattan,   Staten Island, or elsewhere--that everybody seems optimistic  Of course they are not    They are deep in the doldrums and predicting that the end of the world is very close upon   us  That leads me to believe, even though we have essentially the same forecast for the     1/30-31/01 154  economy as in the Greenbook, that we are experiencing an inventory adjustment  We   expect it to be quick, deep, but rather short, ending by the end of the second quarter  Our   forecast for the first quarter is not quite as weak as the Greenbook's, but we certainly   agree that the latter is a definite possibility  We have the same view as the Greenbook   that the economy will snap back because of our belief in the persistence of the ongoing   productivity improvement  However, I do think that business confidence is a very   considerable downside risk  I’m much more concerned about that than I am about   consumer confidence because I agree that consumer confidence tends to be a coincident   indicator by and large  Because of the real concern that I have about business   confidence, a concern I have heard reflected around the table, it does seem to me that a   definite additional easing action by the Committee continues to be in order     Mr Chairman, I fully support your   recommendation and the reasoning for it  I think the only possible alternative would be   to ease even further, and in my view that would be very unwise because it clearly would   give an indication that we do know something that other people don’t know or that we’re   scared, neither of which is the case  Therefore, I think a 50 basis point easing with the   balance of risks statement toward weakness is the appropriate answer     It’s the semiannual--     That’s something to report in the   minutes!       That’s an abnormal sequence of FOMC   proceedings     You certainly do!     Normally we do indicate when it’s   effective     I would take it out     For some it may be tomorrow     So move     Move approval, Mr Chairman     You better say New York!  [Laughter]     3/20/01 7    They’re negotiating     I move approval of the domestic   operations, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I’d just like to make a   comment on some work we’ve been doing in New York on the mysteries of the exchange   rate  Rather than go to the textbooks to try to figure out why the exchange rates were   behaving as they have been, we attempted to look at what had actually happened for an   explanation  If we go back to 1970, say, and look at the fundamentals, the purchasing   power parity tends to lumber along on its predictable path  But there are two periods of   multi-year trends that don’t seem to have an immediate explanation--the weakness of the   dollar in the 1970s and the strength of the dollar in the latter part of the 1990s  And what   seems to fit very well for those periods are the differentials in productivity  Forgetting   the yen for a moment and just looking at the synthetic euro in the ’70s and the real euro   in recent years, the differential was very much in favor of Europe, as productivity in our     3/20/01 24  country began to collapse in ’73 to a 1-1/2 percent annual rate  In the latter part of the   1990s the differential in productivity, as we well know, has been very much in our favor    That factor seems to provide a very good explanation of why the trend line in the dollar   was down, especially in the mid- to late 1970s, and up since 1995  I think the market   came to realize the importance of productivity rather late  In 1996-97 we were thinking   that something different was happening and it looked as if it was productivity, but we   weren’t out making speeches saying that there’s a productivity revolution going on in the   United States  It has been only since that time that the market at least has become   comfortable with the notion that the productivity change is very important  We, the   Federal Reserve, are deemed to be quite expert in this area and because a number of us--  including you, Mr Chairman--have been saying that we believe the higher productivity   trend is still in place, I think that gives some underlying strength to the dollar   The other factor that seems to fit reasonably well in explaining shorter trends   in currencies seems to be market expectations of growth rate differentials in the next six   months  I don’t mean what actually happens, but what people say they expect will   happen over the next six months That seems to give us a fairly good fit for shorter-term   moves in the exchange value of a currency  So, we believe the productivity differential   has given the dollar a very strong lift against the euro since 1996-97, and the expectations   of stronger growth in this country have helped until recently  Now the question is, why   do people currently think that the growth rate in the United States is likely to be firmer   fairly soon and sooner than in Europe?  I think there are a couple of reasons  Even   though financial market participants are expressing much gloom, as Dino pointed out,   they are behaving as if a V-shaped recovery or a U-shaped recovery with a very short     3/20/01 25  bottom is what they are anticipating  In Europe, people seem to feel more and more that   the leaders of the ECB are living in a bit of a dream world  People see the economy   weakening but, with ECB officials making statements that everything is all right, the   perception is that the ECB is not in touch with reality  That may or may not be true, but I   think that’s a growing market perception     Another relevant factor in the fairly recent past is the importance of the   agricultural sector in those European countries  As a share of GDP, agriculture really   isn’t very important, but in the psyche of the society it’s immensely important  If you   had lived in Paris as I once did or in London as I once did, you would have thought you   were in the middle of a farm economy  Agriculture’s effect on the way people think, and   on their confidence and sense of well being, is extraordinarily large--much larger than   seems warranted by its share of GDP  And I think the malaise about the foot and mouth   disease, spreading as rapidly as it is, has pulled down business and consumer confidence   to a remarkable degree and that, too, is being reflected in the exchange rate differentials       It doesn’t  That looks like an aberration   that doesn’t have an explanation on the basis either of the fundamentals or of either of the   two factors I’ve cited  We can’t find anything to explain that except an enormous market   overshoot     Exactly     Yes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second   District economy is holding up rather well, with the labor markets quite strong and   continued strength in housing  Despite much gloom on Wall Street, which I will discuss   later, employment levels in New York City are holding up extremely well  That may   relate to the fact that restaurants are opening in Manhattan at a record pace and some of   the staff look less like out-of-work actors and actresses and more like high-tech types!    In the manufacturing sector, purchasing managers in the District report slow   growth, though the automotive sector--which is very important in western New York     3/20/01 72  because of the volume of parts we supply--is showing signs of recovery  The purchasing   managers outside manufacturing give an increasingly dreary review of current conditions,   which makes me think that their spouses probably work on Wall Street   The gloom on Wall Street has reached the point of advanced silliness, I think    It reminds me of Dickens’ description of a London fog in that it is permeating absolutely   everything  The mood is self-perpetuating and contagious, and there’s very little that   more optimistic or more realistic people like us can do about it except not fall prey to it   ourselves   People in the venture capital community, who tend to be rather realistic--  especially those in the experienced firms--are being very cautious  They are reluctant to   finance even relatively promising companies that are struggling currently  A lot of those   companies are in the high-tech sector, and I think the reticence of the venture capital   firms will probably bring down some companies that deserve to survive, adding to the   sector’s problem of not being able to provide the creative juices that the economy needs   I believe the downside risks to our economy are considerable and since others   have discussed that subject rather thoroughly I won't add to it    In the last couple of months I have been an international sales manager for the   new Basel Capital Accord, and have been around the world literally  So, let me talk a bit   about the concerns I have outside the United States  I have already talked about Europe,   where the quality of leadership does not seem to be what is needed at the political level   and perhaps not in the finance ministries or central banks either  Their neighbor, Turkey,   is going through a problem, which was almost purely political in nature, although it   became economic very quickly       3/20/01 73  Given the questionable future of oil prices, I think we have to keep in mind the   issue of political stability in the Middle East  A return to anything like the very low oil   prices of a couple years ago would place in real question the stability of some oil-   producing countries  Of particular concern are those with aging and not very flexible   monarchs and a society that has become quite accustomed to a much higher level of   spending than a low oil price can finance  That is a situation on which we have to keep a   weather eye   We talked earlier about Japan  The promising development in Japan is that for   the first time its leaders actually are talking in a fairly serious way about reform of the   financial sector, which they should have done twelve years ago  The minister in charge   of the area, Mr Yanagisawa, is extremely sound  He's at least as knowledgeable about   restructuring a private financial sector as anybody I've ever met, so there's no lack of   knowledge regarding what to do  If the country’s leaders are getting close to the point of   thinking that they simply cannot plot a reasonable future unless they reform the financial   sector, it might just get done  It's going to be very difficult  I don't think one would want   to take even 50-50 odds on it  But they are closer to talking and to thinking about doing   the right things than at any time I recall since the bubble burst at the end of the 1980s     The Asian tiger economies are at very serious risk in my judgment  There is   much talk about their dependence on Japan  Actually, they are not dependent on Japan--  they assume that Japan will be in recession or close to it--but they are very dependent on   exports to the United States and Europe  Virtually all the countries have accomplished   essentially no structural reform since the Asian crisis in 1997 and, therefore, weak     3/20/01 74  exports could easily result in considerable difficulties in a number of countries whose   success is so much tied to exports     In Argentina there is a little breath of life  The news since our conversation   this morning is that Mr Cavallo is apparently going to be the economics minister  He is   meeting as we speak with the governors of the provinces, most of whom are from the   Peronista party, which means that he is probably trying to cobble together a political   coalition  You no doubt recall that he was the economics minister for President Menem,   whose political skills along with Mr Cavallo’s technical economics skills were a very   favorable combination for the country  It's important that Argentina emerge from this   situation in good shape because the political system in Brazil is looking rather fragile    The number of corruption cases that are getting near the president and his closest   ministers is increasing to the point that a political or economic contagion coming from   Argentina might find Brazil not terribly capable of dealing with it   So, I think the downside risk coming from outside of our country is very   considerable indeed, with a number of accidents looking as if they could happen  The   likelihood of escaping all of them would impress me as quite low  Given that situation, I   very much sympathize with what Governor Ferguson just said  I think the stance of   monetary policy has to make two things clear to all observers  One is that we will ease   when we need to, including today  The second is that in addition to today’s move, we are   prepared to act if and when necessary  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I very enthusiastically   support your recommendation, including all the nuances  When I was on my most recent   long airplane ride, which was last Wednesday, I thought to myself that what we had to do     3/20/01 91  at this meeting was to be decisive and flexible at the same time  That would require   creating a certain amount of uncertainty among the bears in the market who are forever   trying to find a new carcass to feed on   In my view, therefore, a 75 basis point cut in the funds rate would be very,   very unwise  The market could interpret that as an indication that we had finished easing   monetary policy  We don't know whether we will have finished easing with another 75   basis point reduction  I would note, too, that I think your use of the word “addiction” was   absolutely right  It would be assumed that the new “normal” move was 75 basis points;   we would be feeding the addict’s habit and the next time he or she would want a move of   75 basis points or more  So, such an action would be extremely ill advised  And the   peculiar thing is that the end result would be a reduction in our flexibility at exactly the   time we need it  Thus, I believe that every part of your recommendation, in particular   making it rather clear that we might well move before the next meeting, is appropriate    Thank you     I think the key question is the one the   Chairman himself raised  Is this precedential?  Does it say that we have to do something   in the future?  I think the answer to that is no  We are essentially looking at what the   market reaction is likely to be  My view is that we need this in our statement in order to   show that we are vigilant because I share the Chairman's basic view that we are at a most   unusual, maybe once-in-a-lifetime, moment in the course of monetary policy formulation    And that's what drives the need for us to say something along these lines     Yes     Mr Chairman, this is Bill McDonough    When you want to start the roundtable, I would have something to say     Mr Chairman, I feel as you do that we   have a very important window over the next 10 days, and I definitely believe that an   intermeeting move toward ease is appropriate  I think today is not the right day to do it   for the reasons you suggested and some others  In my view we are better off to wait and   see if that window is available to us sometime next week   I believe, as consistent with your presentation, that the issue before us is   business fixed investment  From all the soundings we hear in the Second District and     4/11/01 8   from the discussions we are working very hard to have with people all around the   country, I’m convinced that, sadly, the view is spreading among business executives that   they must delay investment decisions  Because of the uncertainties about the economic   recovery and the lack of pricing power, corporate executives feel they must postpone   investment decisions in order to shore up their numbers for the second and probably the   third quarters  Therefore, I believe that the downside risk to our economic forecast is   extremely considerable   At the risk of being somewhat unpleasant, I’d also like to say that I think we   have a particular problem at the moment  This is a time when it is highly vital that we get   all the information we can, but that is being made somewhat difficult by the fact that we   are looking at ourselves in the mirror because of what I view as too many statements by   Fed officials  We are all in a position where making statements about policy is a   temptation  But let me suggest that that is something we don’t have to do  If I can hold   myself up as an example, there was a Dow-Jones report yesterday about my comments at   a conference sponsored by the UK Financial Services Authority  The report said that   my remarks “largely repeated recent speeches on the Basle Accord, but failed to touch on   the US economy  McDonough, a voting member of the Federal Open Market   Committee, declined to discuss monetary policy with reporters”  Now, other than patting   myself on the back for virtue, there is a reason I raise this point  Even though we may   believe that a recovery in the second half of the year is likely, when we say that publicly   a degree of certainty is being postulated that I find very troublesome  It makes it difficult   for the Federal Reserve to move if we decide in this period that we wish to do so  More   generally, this is the time of year when I think one should be honoring Passover and the     4/11/01 9   Christian holidays and I believe that in both of those religions silence is considered a   great virtue  Thank you     I would, Mr Chairman  Bill   McDonough here  I very, very much support what you are proposing  Just a quick   comment regarding today’s rise in the equity markets I think it is pinned basically on   both Intel and Texas Instruments saying that life is not quite as grim as they thought it   was   The drop in merchandise imports is good news for our economy  However,   it’s bad news for the producers of goods around the world  In my view the international   economy more generally is looking weaker  The news from Japan, mainly with regard to   the political paralysis, is getting worse  The latest news out of Europe suggests   somewhat lower growth and somewhat higher inflation  So if one is looking at the world     4/18/01 4   economy, I think it is even weaker than it seemed a week ago  And I’m very much in   favor of your recommendation  I assume, Mr Chairman, that the reduction in the funds   rate would be accompanied by the Board of Governors agreeing to a cut in the discount   rate?     This is Bill McDonough  Mr   Chairman, I do  And Don, I would suggest that rather than say “since our last meeting,”   we should refer to the date on which that meeting took place since we had an information   meeting last week--lest in the future some historian say we misstated a fact       Bill McDonough here  I think we have   to have that language on the underlying productivity trend for exactly the reason the   Chairman mentioned     I think that’s taking too long  This is a   very hot piece of news and we shouldn’t sit on it  Lynn, I think you have to move faster     So move     Move approval of the domestic operations, Mr   Chairman     A little psychology here     Unfortunately, we need a motion!     5/15/01     7     Absolutely     And there’s the change of central bank   governor  This issue has come up at a time when he’s adjusting to his new job and I think he   doesn’t want to change anything right now     Right     So even though there is no great ideological   purity in our position, but rather a need to renew these swaps for another year while the   negotiations take place, we do have to approve them again       The Mexicans have to get a fiscal reform   through their congress, and that has been slowed down a bit  I think they are still likely to get   that done, but they certainly would not want to move on this as an isolated event until that   happens     So move, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second   District’s economy continues to perform rather well, especially in relation to the rest of the   nation  It has expanded since the last report, though its growth has slowed somewhat  Inflation   remains subdued and price pressures actually appear to have eased somewhat  Job growth   tapered off in March but unemployment rates remained at or near cyclical lows, edging down to     5/15/01     57   4 percent in New York and edging up to 38 percent in New Jersey, or at least in our half of New   Jersey  Retail sales were described as somewhat sluggish in April but noticeably stronger than in   March  Retailers’ selling prices, merchandise costs, and wages were little changed, but costs of   employee health benefits and utilities have risen sharply over the past year  Purchasing   managers noted some weakening in business conditions and easing in cost pressures in April    Construction and real estate have been mixed but remained generally buoyant  We had a   moderate decline in single-family housing permits in the first quarter but that was more than   offset by a surge in the multifamily sector  There has been a bit of softening in Manhattan’s   apartment market but prices are still up more than 15 percent from a year earlier  The New York   office market slackened in the first quarter but demand and leasing activity remained fairly brisk   and space is still said to be in fairly short supply  Local banks reported widespread increases in   demand for home mortgages, further tightening in commercial loan standards, and very little   change in delinquency rates     Shifting out of the Second District, let me start with the international side and then   work back to the domestic  I think the international situation is quite worrisome  I very much   share Karen Johnson’s observations on the subject, but let me add some of my own  Fortunately,   I recently finished the last of my international trips as “sales manager” for the new Basle Capital   Accord, visiting four countries in Europe about a week or 10 days ago  Although the slowdown   in Europe’s growth is attributable somewhat to the effects of the slowdown in the United States,   the problem is that way too much blame for the weakness in Europe is being placed on the US   slowdown  That means that the authorities in Europe are not doing what they should be doing in   terms of improving the structures of their own economies or making appropriate policy   decisions       5/15/01     58   In Japan, yes, we have a possibility of something different with the new Prime   Minister, but the new Prime Minister is talking about using his political capital to bring about   two changes  One is the direct election of the prime minister, despite the fact that a direct   election of a prime minister in a parliamentary system is a sure formula for even less decisive,   not more decisive, government action  The second is that he wishes to stop calling the military   “self-defense forces” and to call them what they are--which is an army, navy, and air force  That   proposal is a part of a considerably more nationalistic approach  One is hearing very little from   the new Prime Minister about actually fixing the economy, which is desperately in need of   fixing  After 12 years of a problem banking system, the net progress in improving that system   rounds to zero  The level of problem loans is extremely problematic  The possibility of their   taking aggressive action is actually in the talking stage, but it certainly does not appear very   likely to hit the action stage  The exception is that some of the underlying collateral of the most   troubled loans may be moved into the market in an effort to begin a very belated clearing of the   markets  It is not easy to be optimistic about the situation there      The beginning of a slight slowdown in China is reported in the most recent data    That is problematic for two reasons  One is the effect on China itself  Secondly, especially   relative to other countries in Asia which compete with China in the export of consumer goods,   the Chinese are very capable of solving their problem at the expense of their neighbors simply by   dropping prices  They can do that easily and take market share, thus weakening their already   weakened neighbors     As Karen pointed out very well, the situation in Turkey demands a lot of thinking,   perhaps even wishful thinking in terms of the success of their formula  It demands a degree of   fiscal change that is very difficult to imagine taking place, even in a country with a very strong     5/15/01     59   government and a very disciplined population--for example, that their very deep banking system   problems are going to be resolved in two years  That is highly unlikely  So we have a program   that is possible, but very difficult to find convincing  The situation in Argentina is rather similar   in that on paper it works, but it demands a degree of political leadership and political   cohesiveness that also calls for a rather creative imagination     Structurally, I think our new Administration is making the right decision in thinking   that international problems like those of Turkey and Argentina should be tackled through the   international institutions, particularly the International Monetary Fund  That is the approach the   Administration has taken, and I believe correctly, in both Argentina and Turkey  However, in   the last two or three weeks, senior managers of the International Monetary Fund have essentially   announced that they are leaving, so we have a new managing director whose senior staff   colleagues are leaving the organization within the next few months  That means that the key   institution in international problem-solving is going to be looking for capable new senior   executives and it’s very difficult to imagine that the quality of the replacements will be as high as   that of the incumbents  All of this leads me to believe that the international situation provides a   backdrop of downside risks for the national economy   Our forecast is rather like that of the Greenbook  We think it’s very easy to   exaggerate the importance of the IT workout, which probably will take several years  We   believe that the rest of the economy can continue restructuring and move ahead, and that   therefore a recovery in the latter part of the year, probably about the fourth quarter and into 2002,   is the best forecast  But it certainly seems to me that the balance of risks is immensely on the   down side       5/15/01     60   Let me just talk about the up side  Yes, the economy could snap back faster than we   envision  But if it does, we would be able to spot that quite early on  I don’t think we would   have to wait for the data to see that happening; we could discover it through anecdotal evidence    And certainly if it happens, we know very well what to do about it  We do not have a credibility   problem with respect to this institution and this Committee being appropriately concerned about   inflation  Nobody doubts that we’re concerned about inflation  So we don’t have to be raising a   big flag saying we know inflation is a problem because everybody knows that we know that  I   think they also believe that we know what to do about it  Remember, this is the same FOMC   that doubled the fed funds rate between February ’94 and February ’95  Our track record of   attacking inflation, including our doing so before it existed in the data, is quite robust  And our   resolve to do that is something that I think the market assumes     However, on the down side, as has been very clearly presented in the staff briefings,   the forecast depends enormously on the willingness of the consumer to keep spending  Yet the   historical data indicate that if there’s anything to which consumer confidence is tied, it is the   confidence in having a job, holding one’s job, or finding a new one easily  And with a rising   unemployment rate, it’s not very difficult to envision that at some stage the consumer is going to   think this is all too good to be true  It doesn’t have to be quite as dramatic as Wile E Coyote   racing furiously along thoroughly optimistic until all of a sudden he realizes there’s no ground   below him  But it doesn’t take a whole lot of change in the consumer’s view about buying a new   car, a new house, or the items to put in that new house to produce a very significant downturn in   consumer spending  As Dave Stockton pointed out effectively in response to Bob Parry’s   excellent questions, our models don’t work in assessing the effects of a loss of consumer   confidence or a loss of business confidence  And in the current environment the latter is even     5/15/01     61   greater than the former  The level of business confidence, low as it is, is rather appalling  So it   seems to me that the downside risks are very considerable indeed and our ability to model them   is low  Accordingly, we will have to watch very carefully for signs that the downside risk is   materializing, even if we do not judge its likelihood as high     Let me talk a bit about the markets, which have their headquarters in the great City of   New York  One of the reasons market participants think that the economy may be a little better   is that they were in such an enormous funk about six weeks ago that they were thoroughly   convinced that the end of the world would happen between the 1st and the 30th of April  Well,   that burst of immaturity has been replaced by a swing in the opposite direction, which I don’t   think tells us a whole lot about what we should read from the market  Mainly what it tells us is   that the market is volatile  Market participants are trying to figure out where the economy is   going  They understand the upside and downside risks and they don’t know what is going to   happen  So they bounce the market around very rapidly, sometimes with a lot of volume and   sometimes with very little volume  In my view the main message the market is conveying is that   it is extremely uncertain  So am I  Therefore, I would caution that we should not read more into   what the market is telling us than is really there   In summary, Mr Chairman, I think the downside risk is extremely serious  I hope   very much that it will not materialize  But if it does, the outcome could be quite grim indeed    Thank you     Mr Chairman, I endorse fully the entire   package, including your idea that sometime between now and the next meeting we probably     5/15/01     83   should begin to shape the record  And I would suggest, since you already plan to do that on the   24th of this month, that we all remain very silent until then     Mr Chairman, considering how the European   Central Bank managed to completely confuse the market and hurt its own credibility very   recently, I think trying to say things that are essentially contradictory--or that can easily be   interpreted that way--has to be avoided  If we wish to give a signal that the easing moves are   likely over, then the balance of risks statement becomes questionable--even though we all know   that the balance of risks statement has to do with future economic activity  The market would   clearly believe we were trying to have it both ways--trying to say that on the one hand we might   ease because the economy might be weak, but on the other hand we might have finished our   easing  If we wish to destroy our credibility, that kind of wording is what I highly recommend to   you, and I assume that is not what we are seeking to achieve      5/15/01     96   There will be a very large signal received from this statement, which is that we’ve   removed any notion of an intermeeting move  And that is going to sound a big gong  It will say   that the easing moves may slow or may be over  At a minimum the Committee has slowed the   pace and is fairly close to where it wants to be  In my view that is how this statement will be   interpreted  But it will be interpreted because we allow the market to read it  That is preferable   to trying to give two signals--one that says yes and the other that says no--and winding up with a   statement that says maybe  I think that would be very destructive to our ability to carry out our   responsibilities  Also, given the view that some of us have--particularly you, Mr Chairman, and   I, too, I guess--about the downside risks, the last thing we want is to have a central bank that   looks confused   If we want downside risks, a confused central bank will surely bring them     And we offer that in the month of June?     5/15/01     99     The Chairman voted June?      We’ve got your change in     Six-four, close     Well, the anecdotes were all over the place by   April and May So the fact that the shipments didn’t in fact increase would suggest that the   anecdotal reports are a little exaggerated     Mr Chairman, I move approval of the domestic   operations     Mr Chairman, I’m prompted by your unkind   remarks about lawyers to note that it was suggested that the jury is still out on these issues  If   your initial remarks are meant to be the charge to the jury, that jury is going to be out for a long   time!  [Laughter]        6/26-27/01 35   Charlie Steindel mentioned and I think in his presentation made clear that when a   major shift in productivity is taking place, it’s very easy not to spot it at the time  That, I believe,   makes it important that we applaud what the Board's staff was doing, even though it gave rise to   that interesting- looking chart While the staff was struggling with that issue, it was very clear to   the Committee that something was happening that we were having difficulty explaining and we   were searching for an explanation  And since this is not an economics class but rather a central   bank trying to make monetary policy, it's crucial that we know when we’re not sure of something   because then the judgmental factor in making monetary policy becomes even more important  If   you had been giving us the impression that you really understood these productivity issues more   than you actually did at the time, then I think we would have been less aware of the need for   judgment  So I very much applaud what you did  I thought the presentation was excellent and   the work, especially bringing to our attention when you are less certain than you frequently are, is   an important part of helping us make policy     I have a working hypothesis that is essentially   very easy to come up with, Gary  And that is if multifactor productivity depends very much on   the use of information technology in order to make older industries be more efficient, the single   most competitive advantage a country can have, which the United States has, is a flexible labor   force     Yes, but I think it's really a combination of   economics and sociology, since what we’re observing is a society as well as the pure economics   of the situation     Mr Stockton, please proceed [Secretary’s   note The Chairman had left the room briefly and the Vice Chairman was recognizing the next   speaker]     Total production     That identifies the countries and it is the   average IP for those countries     It's the same argument they've been making for   a year--that the Japanese have to pump up the money supply, however they do it     The other problem with the argument is that it’s   wrong     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before I comment   on the Second District I would like to say that I think that assessment of the market’s   interpretation of the balance of risks statement is completely wrong  I believe the market looks at   incoming data and tries to evaluate what the Federal Reserve will do  That's what the market   looks at To my mind, any notion that what we say about the balance of risks is tied to or   determines our next move involves falling into the intellectual trap of post hoc, ergo propter hoc   Anybody who has ever studied logic has been taught that that is a great fallacy   As for the Second District, we apparently should have migrated south slightly to   Philadelphia! Whereas the scene of relative prosperity had been centered in New England and   the Second District, it appears to have moved away from President Minehan and me  Economic   growth in the Second District has shown distinct signs of slowing since the last time this   Committee was together  Employment growth in the District has deteriorated sharply  In New   York State, private sector job growth slowed from a roughly 2 percent annual rate in the first     6/26-27/01 115   quarter to a 03 percent pace in April and May  In New Jersey, private sector employment, which   was virtually flat in the first quarter, declined at a 2 percent pace in April and at a 1 percent rate   in May New York's unemployment rate has held steady recently at 43 percent, while New   Jersey's has risen from 36 to 43 percent in just the past three months   Manufacturing employment has continued to shrink at roughly a 4 percent pace, in line   with its trend over the past year  Construction employment is up nearly 5 percent from a year   ago, though it has leveled off in recent months  Job growth in services--and that's a leading   driver of our regional economy--has decelerated in recent months but remains fairly strong at an   annualized 2 percent pace In the region's key financial services industry employment fell   noticeably in both April and May after rising through March  The disarray in the major securities   firms is continuing  You no doubt noticed the profits warning from Merrill Lynch  The firms on   Wall Street that have a very strong bond trading and underwriting capability have done relatively   well, shifting their profit realizations to that area from investment banking and equities   Consumer spending is holding up reasonably well  Retail sales appear to have picked   up in late May and early June with the arrival of warmer weather  But they remain little changed   from a year ago and are still okay but a little on the sluggish side  Selling prices and merchandise   costs are steady to somewhat lower, and wage pressures in the consumer area appear to be rather   subdued Everybody in the District, as we have been hearing from other Reserve Bank presidents   about their Districts, continues to complain about the escalating costs of health benefits and   utilities   We have a shift in the balance of prosperity and lack thereof in New York State  The   upstate area, with the partial exception of Buffalo, is actually looking quite good  And the New   York City area, because of the financial services industry, is looking relatively weak      6/26-27/01 116   Commercial real estate has deteriorated further since we were last together but home sales and   construction have remained robust  The Manhattan office market has slackened substantially in   recent months  Asking rents are still up from where they were a year ago, but those rents are   usually not being realized; deals are being made at considerably below the asking price    Availability rates in downtown Manhattan have risen from 54 to 6 percent and are going to rise   further; in midtown they are up from 34 to 61 percent  So the bloom is definitely off the rose in   New York City   The financial services industry is a major source of tax revenue for both New York   City and New York State and, therefore, the fiscal situation of the city and the state will certainly   be deteriorating Inflation levels in the District are about similar to those of the nation  As for the   international situation, I think it continues to deteriorate  I believe Karen Johnson’s report   yesterday outlined that well, as have certain remarks this morning   On the national economy, our Bank’s forecast is about the same as the Greenbook’s, so   I won't quibble on the details  We have the same view that the risks are very substantially to the   downside I think we have to accept the fact that until we get into next year, business fixed   investment will remain very weak  So in my view our role as a central bank is to think of what   we can do to keep consumer confidence about as robust as it is, which is very necessary for all of   our forecasts  And with that, business confidence will at least not get any worse and will recover   with the benefits of monetary policy, fiscal stimulus, and relatively subdued price increases   At the FOMC meeting in May, when we were last together, I had hoped very much   that we would be able to go to a balanced risks statement at this meeting and at least pause in our   easing Unfortunately, I think the downside risk is even greater today than it was at the time of   our previous meeting  So I believe we have to continue to offer an accommodative monetary     6/26-27/01 117   policy But I do think we have to slow down its pace  If we were to keep easing at the pace of 50   basis points a crack, that would seem to be overdoing it  That amount of monetary stimulus   would seem to indicate that we think the economy is even weaker than we in fact think it is    With the combination of monetary stimulus, which in my view should total 275 basis points by   the time we leave today, plus the amount of fiscal stimulus that we all anticipate, the likelihood   of our forecast being right is improved somewhat  But I think the risks still will be to the   downside Thank you     Mr Chairman, I just have a comment, which is   very similar to what Don just said  Financial market participants do have a view of this   Committee, and it is reflected both in rates and in commentary  Living in New York, one sees a   lot of these people and talks to them  They believe that this Committee has great courage of its   convictions The degree of credibility of the Committee is extremely high  The markets believe   that what we’ve been doing so far this year has been front-loading an easing of monetary policy    And they’re absolutely convinced that when the time comes to reverse that, we will front-load the   correction I think that’s very complimentary to the Committee  I share Governor Kelley’s view   in that I wish we could get out of all this activism, and over time I think it would be good if we   could But in my view what you’re reading in the markets is a combination of the fact that   they’re a little more optimistic about the recovery but very convinced that when the time comes   to move rates up, we will front-load our actions     Mr Chairman, to synopsize what you just said    We would ease by 25 basis points and we would have a balance of risks statement that indicates   continuing concern about economic weakness  I completely agree with that conclusion  And I     6/26-27/01 145   share the hope, probably best described as a fond hope, that by the next meeting we can issue a   statement that the risks have evened out     I think it is more powerful if we let them draw   the conclusion than if we draw it for them     I guess the silence could be replaced by   applause The silence is pretty pleasant      Move approval     Move approval of domestic operations     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second   District economy has weakened further recently, while both finished goods inflation and input   cost pressures have continued to recede Much of the weakness is still concentrated in   manufacturing, but other sectors have shown signs of slowing as well  In July, private sector   payroll employment was virtually unchanged in New York State but fell at roughly a 2 percent   pace in New Jersey  We can't really allocate that between Tony Santomero’s part of New Jersey   and my part of New Jersey, so I think we tend to double cover it, but that's the fifth straight drop    While manufacturing has sustained the steepest job losses over the past year, weakness in both   June and July was fairly broad-based across industries  Even the construction industry, which   had been an engine of job growth, has shed jobs at an annual rate of roughly 5 percent since     8/21/01 41   peaking in March Disconcertingly, employment in New York City's critical financial services   sector has now declined for four consecutive months, with virtually daily headlines of very large-  scale reductions in staff   Retail sales were described as sluggish in June and July, though the heat wave in early   August boosted sales of air conditioners, swimwear, and other hot weather merchandise    Retailers continue to report a weak pricing environment, with most of our respondents indicating   that both selling prices and merchandise costs are flat to lower  While retail wage pressures   reportedly remain subdued, contacts continue to note fairly brisk escalation in health benefits and   utilities costs  The Buffalo area in New York State is particularly weak  And Siena College’s   survey of New York State residents, which tends to be reasonably accurate, reports that   consumer confidence fell sharply in July both upstate and in the New York City area, more than   erasing the gains in May and June July’s level is the lowest in the survey’s 2-1/2 year history   Construction and real estate activity have been mixed  The commercial sector remains   sluggish and pockets of weakness have emerged in the residential segment, but the tone remains   rather positive, considering that Manufacturers and purchasing managers report that business   conditions weakened in July, while price pressures receded  New York City hotel occupancy   rates and room rates fell significantly in the second quarter from a year ago  A lot of tourists   continue to come to New York City but they don't seem to be spending as much or staying as   long as previously Inflation in the area receded in July, mainly due to a downturn in energy   prices, and it is about on a par with the national average  Bankers report steady loan demand,   rising delinquency rates, and tighter credit standards  Conditions appear to be somewhat more   favorable in the residential mortgage segment of their business   On the national level, we think the near-term outlook is for sluggish growth at best      8/21/01 42   We expect that third-quarter growth could be about 2 percent, but that's putting a lot of faith in   the monetary policy easing in the pipeline and in the checks coming from the US Treasury    With little data so far for the quarter, there is certainly a very great deal of uncertainty about this   short-term growth outlook   Longer term we expect, as does the Greenbook, that the outlook will brighten some,   with GDP growth rebounding to over 2-1/2 percent in Q4 and in 2002  We have taken a first   look at 2003 and it looks as if growth will remain at about the same pace into that year  That will   put growth below what we believe is potential, so the unemployment rate will rise  We think it   will go up to about 5 percent by the end of 2002  We have a rather benign forecast for inflation    We expect the PCE deflator to be about 2-1/4 per cent in 2002 and to drop down to about 2   percent in 2003 So those who are looking for a minor improvement in inflation may just have   their wish fulfilled   In the short term we think that the downside risks are quite severe and that there really   is a significant risk of a recession Weak household consumption and aggregate demand raise   the possibility that the inventory correction will last longer and that business investment will   decline even more than we currently expect  Moreover, weakness in foreign economies could   exacerbate that situation  We could have a vicious circle that produces a recession in the near   term and in the longer term a continuation of the sluggish economy we've seen over the past   year On the other hand, the combination of monetary easing and fiscal policy could have a   greater than expected impact, resulting in a surge in aggregate demand  However, we think that   prospect is very much less likely   Let me talk briefly about the international situation, particularly about two areas, Asia   and Argentina You may have noticed in this morning's paper that Chinese Premier Zhu was     8/21/01 43   making a tour of southern China  You may remember that Deng Xiaoping announced a major   change in policy in China by a tour of southern China  I think the most significant thing that   Premier Zhu said is that the Chinese should do anything to improve their exports  Now, if true--  and he tends not to say things that he doesn't mean--that could very well be the last thing that is   needed for non-Japan, non-China countries of Asia  China does not really compete very much   with the rest of Asia on tech exports, but tech exports in that area are already decimated    However, the Chinese can clean everybody's clock in every other area of exports because the fact   is that they can bring their prices down to wherever they want them to be and are able to compete   at any price level They simply have to move a factory 500 miles farther into interior China and   pay close to nothing for the cost of labor So that plan, if carried forward, is a rather frightening   prospect for the already weakened economies of Asia, the former “tigers”   On Argentina, by chance in my State Department years in the mid-1960s I was in the   office of regional economic policy and one of the countries I was supposed to look out for was   Argentina So it's a place I've known reasonably well for almost 40 years  I think a crisis in   Argentina is likely to be significantly different from most crises  If it would remind us of   anything, it would be closer to what we’ve seen in Indonesia  The reason is this The currency   board was not brought in by President Menem because some economics professor told him that it   was an important piece of economic theory  He brought it in because he inherited about 5,000   percent annual inflation His predecessor had to leave office early as soon as Menem’s election   was certified So Menem brought in the currency board because he realized, as a brilliant   politician, that he had to import discipline in order to get Argentina functioning  But he engaged   in a kind of wishful thinking in hoping that at some stage the economic stars would align   themselves so that Argentina could get out of the convertibility arrangement and the peso would     8/21/01 44   strengthen Well, that never quite happened My concern is that if the present regime collapses,   which it well might, we're not going to see a Brazilian-type situation where the currency   undergoes a significant devaluation and the social situation manages itself reasonably well  I   fear that we will see something that is truly chaotic, with rioting in the streets and a very   unpredictable outcome in the congressional elections in October   Now, one of the things that Argentina is extraordinarily good at is blaming other   people for its problems  In the course of the last week they’ve already set the stage for that   According to the economics minister, people in Washington have been espousing default and   devaluation for Argentina The fact that that isn't true is not enormously relevant  And if we   have a really good-sized problem in Argentina, I think it is likely to have a much bigger effect on   the world economy than the size of the Argentine economy would indicate--rather as Russia,   with a GDP the size of Norway, did in 1998 To me the real downside risk is that, despite the   greatest possible intentions of everybody involved to help Argentina yet again, if it is deemed not   to have worked there will be questions--in this background of a very weak economy--about the   quality of the financial/economic leadership in the world  Now once again, that would probably   be a bad assessment  There's nothing wrong with the quality of economic management in the   world But with this very weak economic climate, if that perception were real, I think we could   have some very chaotic financial markets  Of course, that is not something we can anticipate   through monetary policy  However, I think what we ought to do with monetary policy today is   rather clear And in the very short period ahead, I believe we could have some very serious   damage control requirements coming our way  Thank you     I concur with your recommendation, Mr   Chairman      Mr Chairman, if I could comment  I think by   saying that we’ve reduced the funds rate by a total of 300 basis points and by continuing to take   out any notion of an intermeeting move, the financial markets will interpret the statement in   exactly the way you want     He’s a very important fellow     Amen!     Yes     Thank you, Mr Chairman We had   several meetings in New York today  The first of those was with the heads of the New     9/13/01 7   York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ and with senior people from the public sector    Harvey Pitt represented the SEC, Peter Fisher represented the US Treasury, and I the   Federal Reserve People from the telephone company, Verizon, and from the electric   utility company, Con Ed--which actually supplies electricity, steam, and gas--were also   present because the issue was to try to determine when the New York Stock Exchange   and the NASDAQ could be reopened That to a very large degree is a question of   infrastructure  The major parts of lower Manhattan, both east and west of Broadway, are   now without full power and full telephone service  The exchanges themselves do not   have anywhere near normal telephone service At the New York Fed, which is of course   in that general area, we can make outgoing calls but can’t take incoming calls  The hope   expressed by the telephone company people was that by Monday morning they would be   able to supply to the area east of Broadway--that is the area away from the disaster--about   90 percent of the normal capacity of telephone service  Of course, the other side of that   equation is the demand  The typical demand at the exchanges, even on a day of fairly   heavy trading, would be around 75 to 83 percent of the telephone service capacity    Therefore, if in fact Verizon has capacity up to 90 percent by Monday morning, then   from that point of view the exchanges should be able to be open   Restoring the electric service is, if anything, more difficult because many of   the main transmission locations were destroyed  The seaport is the area from which most   of the power is distributed to the exchanges and to the key recovery area east of   Broadway, and the seaport facility has lost most of its capacity  As you know, most of   the electricity distribution network in New York and Manhattan is underground  There   is, of course, no way in the world in which the capacity can be restored by digging up the     9/13/01 8   streets  So, Con Ed will be stringing heavy cables  Heavily coated wires will just be   strung along the streets against the curbs and protected  Where those wires have to cross   a street, little tunnels of, say, six inches to a foot will be constructed  To very   sophisticated users it will look a bit like a Third World solution  But Con Ed officials   expressed a high degree of confidence that they will be able to do that and that it will   work   A major problem, which has been driving everybody a bit crazy today, is the   questioning about the structural stability of a building called One Liberty Plaza  It is at   the corner of Liberty Street--the street on which the New York Fed is located--and   Broadway So it’s not very far from our building  There is a very significant danger   involved because, if the building should collapse, there is no way one can tell in advance   how it will happen or in which direction the building will fall  The reason the Trade   Center buildings imploded is because the airplanes had so much fuel on them that in   effect they were bombs  The structural steel in the building reached a temperature above   that it was constructed to tolerate  So in effect the steel vaporized and then the buildings   just imploded  That might not be the case with this particular building If it should fall as   opposed to implode, and if it should fall due south toward Trinity Church, it would fall on   top of two very old buildings and there would be a monumental asbestos problem  It   would create a very severe hazard of airborne asbestos  That would place in very big   doubt the ability of the exchanges to reopen Three times in the last 24 hours there have   been rumors that the building was about to fall, and structural engineers were sent in both   by the owners of the building and by the City of New York  The engineers came out and   said that the building was structurally sound even though its outward appearance, which     9/13/01 9   is somewhat distorted at the top, would make a non-structural engineer wonder about   that At any rate, that is the building that is the main source of concern   A later meeting today involved the same participants I mentioned earlier plus   the heads of the major financial institutions in New York  The decision was made, a   purely private sector decision, that the stock exchanges would not seek to reopen   tomorrow, Friday, but would undergo a capacity test  That is a normal test conducted   periodically to see if their systems are functioning  It will be done at 1000 am New   York time on Saturday  If that test proves positive, the New York Stock Exchange and   the NASDAQ will be open for business at 930 on Monday morning  Three of the major   firms most affected by the tragedy, because their offices were in the buildings that were   destroyed, are Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers  The heads of all   three of those firms were at our meeting this afternoon and they committed themselves to   being prepared to participate and function in the markets on Monday  They have offsite   facilities that are going to make that possible for them  Obviously, those firms are three   very big market makers, so their presence is very important to the basic liquidity in the   market     So, Mr Chairman, I think the main concern at the moment is that building near   ours Somebody is going to have to figure out once and for all whether the building is   really likely to fall or not In that regard let me say that the head of the City of New   York’s emergency efforts is a very sensible fellow  He thinks that as vast amounts of   rubble are removed from the site of the tragedy there is a shifting and, of course, when   many, many tons of material shift that causes a tremendous noise  Anybody nearby who   has been traumatized by the events of early this week immediately thinks that yet another     9/13/01 10   building is falling and people go racing into the streets  In this situation nobody is quite   sure whether people are just traumatized and overreacting or whether something is really   wrong So we’re living in a very surreal environment     I think that’s where things stand  In addition, Jamie Stewart and my other   colleagues have been working with the major two clearing banks  As you well know   from earlier calls this week, there was a small problem with Chase on Tuesday that   worked itself out The Bank of New York has been a considerable problem  I had a   conversation with the two top executives at Chase and with Tom Renyi, the CEO of Bank   of New York, after the breakup of the larger meeting I described  Based on these   discussions, Chase is quite certain it can function well  The general feeling about BONY   is that the situation is improving from a low base  There is no question by now that we   have the full attention of BONY management, as do their customers and their   counterparties The bank is hoping to be able to complete its processing on a more   normal basis this evening--but we’ve heard these hopes from them before--and to come   up fully operational tomorrow morning   SPEAKER (?)  Bill, along that line, did you know that we have three of our   people at the BONY backup site here in New Jersey?  As it happens, their report of an   hour ago was optimistic  They were looking over the operations and thought BONY was   making excellent progress  They felt BONY’s view of being able to close around 830   pm tonight was probably a good estimate       I think that’s the view from New York,   Mr Chairman     9/13/01 11     Yes, that’s when we will really know,   after the markets have a chance to put buyers and sellers together for a while     Mr Chairman, obviously in the Second   District, as my earlier remarks would indicate, we’re living very much in the world of   Tuesday and since Tuesday  It’s clear that our District is going to experience a   devastating weakness in its economy  These events will greatly affect the lives of the   people in the District I won’t comment on either the timing or size of a move by the   Federal Reserve because this is an information meeting and by the time we really want to   discuss those issues I think I’ll have a firmer feeling on what would be the right thing to   do   I would like if I may, Mr Chairman, to share with the group part of the   discussion at the afternoon meeting I described here in New York with the heads of the   exchanges, the SEC, and the most important financial firms  There is a general feeling   that what we have to do is to try as much as possible to return to normalcy  One of the   subjects that we specifically discussed was the use of Fed facilities  Of course, as we all   know, the discount window is being used very actively  The normal way of supplying   funds to most of the American economy really ends up occurring through the banking   system using our discount window and through the repo market, which involves not just   banks Even though the Federal Reserve Act provides that other institutions can have   access to the discount window under certain circumstances, I suggested to the people at   that meeting that in light of our overall desire to return to normalcy that is not something   we would wish to see happen That’s because if we had a lot of borrowers using the     9/13/01 20   discount window who usually didn’t, it would be an indication of very large overall   weakness or it would identify the parts of the economy that were in the walking wounded   category or worse if they were singled out  There was a very strong view among the   market participants that that is the right way to go and that we want be seen as   functioning normally in the economy as much as possible  All of us are very concerned   with the credibility of the Federal Reserve  It would be very difficult to imagine in   general a central bank having more credibility than we do  But I think it’s very   interesting that some fairly traumatized people, even though they try to appear very cool   as the heads of major institutions, believe that the confidence they have in the Federal   Reserve is a very important asset our country has at the moment  The reason I bring up   this discussion of the use of Fed facilities is that having tried out this idea on some fairly   sophisticated people, it worked extraordinarily well  I suggest that others might wish to   pick up the same theme if the opportunity should arise  Thank you     Mr Chairman, this is Bill McDonough    May I intervene?     I believe that your recommendation is   absolutely the right thing to do It is the right thing to do for our economy  It is the right   thing for the Federal Reserve to show the flag at this awesome, awful moment in our   country’s history The timing of the action before the major markets of the United States   open this morning I think is absolutely ideal  Fifty basis points is the right amount; 25   basis points would be too little and more than 50 is unnecessary  And I fully agree with   your view that our statement should indicate that the balance of risks remains weighted   toward economic weakness and that the announcement should include mention of the   possibility that the federal funds rate could well trade below our target at times  That   would tell market participants that they need not be concerned about technical,   mechanical, reserve-draining actions if the funds rate should trade on the soft side    Thank you     I think it’s perfect, Mr Chairman     9/17/01 7     I agree with that approach, Mr   Chairman    This is Bill McDonough again  Mr   Chairman, in terms of guidance to Lynn and Michelle in handling questions from the   press If somebody is dopey enough to ask why only five Reserve Banks cut their   discount rates, we ought to indicate that the rest no doubt will be on board before the day   is over, probably before the morning is over  I assume the proper answer would be that   five Reserve Banks happened to have their board meetings after the tragedy and therefore   could make a motion to reduce the rate, whereas most of the other Reserve Bank boards-­  probably all seven--didn’t meet  We might want to make clear that it’s a matter of the   accident of timing and certainly not any difference on the policy view       Well, certainly no corrections, but I can   bring you some updates  I think it’s very important that we not single out BONY, the   Bank of New York, even though they had trouble getting their act together for a couple of   days The accident of their location just gave them a bigger problem than anybody else   had On Saturday a new difficulty surfaced, which was overcome  We now have two   dial-up lines for the funds side and two other dial-up lines for the securities side between   BONY’s backup site in Maywood, New Jersey and our site at East Rutherford, New   Jersey I mentioned the dial-up lines for those of you on the call who are “techies”  As   you probably know, a dial-up line operates at only about 75 percent of the speed of a   normal digital line, so it’s a bit slower  But we think that should not cause any noticeable   problems over the course of today     The building that I mentioned on the information call last week that was   driving us a bit crazy is the one called One Liberty Plaza  It’s where the Merrill Lynch   offices were located and it’s about a block from the Reserve Bank  It is structurally   sound but there are some problems with the façade  A couple of times a piece of the   façade has come tumbling down and, needless to say, that terrifies people who have been   through what those in lower Manhattan have been through  So, one has to calm people   down I think that building is in as good shape as one can hope for  The atmosphere at   the site has shifted from one of excitement and lots of volunteers and curiosity seekers   milling around to one involving just a thoroughly grim job for the iron workers and truck     9/17/01 13   drivers and others working on the project But there’s every reason to believe that lower   Manhattan east of Broadway, which is where we and the stock exchange are located, will   be functioning in a somewhat surreal but normal way today     We have about half of our top   management team here for the symbolism, among other things, of the Federal Reserve   Bank of New York continuing to perform on its normal premises  Most of our operating   people are at EROC just because they can do their jobs more effectively there  Over   time, we will be moving our people back to lower Manhattan  In the meantime we have   the building wrapped in bunting, we have a big flag flying, and we’re playing patriotic   music from the parapet       Right The management team members   who are here are Chris Cumming, Tom Baxter, Bill Rutledge, and Terri Checki  We’re   keeping our public information staff here as well  Steve Malin is with us     So move, Mr Chairman     If I could make a comment, Mr   Chairman?   President Jordan’s concern, as I understand it, is that there not be some sort   of central bank orthodoxy that says that the funds rate target has to be put back in place at   a time when it would be inappropriate  Dino in both his presentation and in his answer to   one of the questions indicated that he was being guided by the desire for a return to   normalcy  That was our mantra at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  We were   dealing with a financial community in which there was an advanced degree of trauma on   the part of people at trading desks and those managing firms  And there was a very   strong conviction in the community that the Federal Reserve System and the New York   Reserve Bank as its agent were going to do whatever was necessary to make the system   function Part of getting through a battle fatigue period is that it is necessary to return life   to normal  So the Desk was under instructions that when it could conduct operations in   the way it normally does, it should do so, because that gives a signal to the financial     10/2/01 13   community that life is okay again And traumatized people need that signal  In my view   it’s a very important message that the Fed must continue to deliver because the trauma   period is not over Some of the firms are still operating out of temporary facilities and   will do so for months  Some have suffered enormous human losses  In the case of   Cantor Fitzgerald, two-thirds of the people in the firm lost their lives on September 11th   So this is not a situation where everybody will soon start to feel tranquil and okay; that   won’t happen for quite a long period of time  The more the Federal Reserve can say   things are all right, we’re functioning as we traditionally do, the better  That’s a very   important message to give           Second     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Dave   Stockton got us off to a wonderful start in admitting just how uncertain we are  Now we   are at least as uncertain but with an unbelievable amount of specificity about it!     What do we know about the Second District?  It was weak going into the   tragedy and it is weaker now One of the results of that is going to be a stress on the   fiscal situation of New York City Even so, our analysis to date says that the City’s fiscal     10/2/01 64   situation will hold up; that will have some effect on the fiscal situation of New York State   as well   We think the Greenbook forecast is as good a forecast as one could make  And   we agree with the authors that the downside risk is very considerable, especially in   coming quarters, and that we don’t know what the longer term is going to look like  The   likelihood is that the economy will snap back, as suggested in the forecast     As regards monetary policy, I believe that we are being rewarded for the high   degree of confidence in the Fed and the greater transparency we have achieved in recent   years by the market forecasting what I at least think we clearly should do at this meeting    I believe we would be very ill-advised to test our credibility by saying this is what we’re   doing at this meeting but we’re so certain about the future that we want to put everyone   on notice that we may tighten monetary policy sometime soon  We don’t know enough   to say that  And nobody expects us to say it If we say things that test our credibility in   order to show our central banker virtues, I think we will lessen our central banker virtues   and certainly lessen our credibility  Thank you     I fully support your recommendation,   Mr Chairman     The market will assume that     So move     I’d like to add a comment  However the   accounting authorities rule, the situation is clearly one in which the Japanese banks are taking a   massive interest rate risk at a time when they have enough risks in the portfolio  And this practice   involves an additional risk that they should not be taking  Wearing my Basel Committee hat, I have   been trying to bring that to their attention with absolutely no positive result     11/6/01 8     No, they just continue to ignore that risk   Essentially, anything that will produce some additional earnings, however great the risk, is a risk that   the banks are willing to take And as Dino pointed out very well, if the Japanese government has to   start issuing more government bonds in order to bail out the banking system, whatever is   accomplished by putting in additional capital could easily be reversed by the hit the banks will take   on the interest rate risk     I move approval of the domestic operations     Mr Chairman, the Second District’s economy has   deteriorated further since the last report, but it is very unclear how much of the weakening can be   tied to the terrorist attacks and how much would have happened in any event  Widespread   transportation disruptions that developed immediately after the attacks eased substantially in   October That includes the subway service to lower Manhattan, which is now reasonably well   restored  Our big problem is getting people from New Jersey to lower Manhattan  About 55 percent   of the people who commute into lower Manhattan come from New Jersey and an average commute     11/6/01 52   time that was an hour and a half is now two-and-a-half hours  Efforts are under way to get more   ferries and other rerouting of the rail and subway lines, but that continues to be a difficulty   Businesses most clearly affected by the disaster include retailers, hotels, and other travel-   related firms  Retailers note that sales in October remained well below plan at Manhattan stores    That mainly reflects fewer tourists, especially international tourists who spend substantially more   than residents of New York or tourists from elsewhere in the United States  Manhattan hotels   experienced their worst September on record  Business reportedly rebounded moderately in   October The outer suburbs and outer boroughs are pretty much back to business as normal     The impact on the local labor market is not yet clear  An estimated 75,000 additional   jobless claims, well above trend, were filed in New York and northern New Jersey in the five weeks   after the attacks Commercial real estate markets in Manhattan and the suburbs have not tightened   as expected since the attacks What seems to be the case, despite the enormous loss of office space,   is that firms were hoarding office space during the boom years and they have discovered they can   now give it up Citicorp, for example, had about 400,000 square feet earmarked for further   expansion that it was able to make available to Lehman Brothers with really no burden to itself  The   further expansion is now less likely, so Lehman Brothers won and Citicorp won  In general the view   seems to be that relocation--most firms are actually going to midtown Manhattan--can be achieved   without much additional building  That puts an another question mark on “Whither lower   Manhattan?” In that regard I’ll mention an interesting side note  Last Friday Governor Pataki   declared, after a great deal of pressure from the business community--including our Reserve Bank,   which in some ways considers itself part of the business community--that he was creating a   corporation for the restructure of lower Manhattan  The members of that group I believe will be   named later this week  That’s a very positive development because there has been a real question     11/6/01 53   about who is in charge The answer is that nobody has been in charge and therefore the degree of   uncertainty hovering over Ground Zero as it’s now called and neighboring lower Manhattan has   been greater than it should have been   Not surprisingly, because of the downturn in the financial services industry, Manhattan   apartment sales activity has been very thin  It’s hard to gauge exactly where the prices are but they   are probably down 10 to 15 percent, with very few deals actually taking place  Bankers report   weaker loan demand, tighter credit standards, and increased delinquencies  The residential mortgage   segment appears to be faring relatively well     On the national level, we share the view about the general shape of recovery that the   Greenbook describes and that Dave Stockton presented so well  On the international side, I’m   inclined to believe that Karen’s forecast is accurate, but optimistic, and that the downside there is   probably even greater than it is domestically     Regarding consumer confidence, the fact is that housing has held up rather well  And   certainly the pace of automobile sales in October, at 21 million units, indicates that people want to   buy cars It’s nice to have zero percent financing, but presumably people don’t purchase an   automobile even with no financing costs unless they want one in the first place  So I think there are   indications that consumer confidence is holding up better than we might have anticipated  How long   it will hold up at this level is a very big question, as many of us have discussed     Business fixed investment is abnormally low even for a recession  There may well be   enough of it waiting on the sidelines that fiscal policy directed at increasing investment will work    But in my view there are some very legitimate questions about whether that will be the case  In any   event, partisan politics are alive and well  They did not go away except for a very brief respite after     11/6/01 54   the 11th of September  So I think there is a real question of when and if the fiscal policy that is being   discussed will happen   We believe that the downside risk is very clear and quite dismal  That is a view that is   shared fully by the members of our board of directors and by those on our Small Business and   Agriculture Advisory Committee  It is also the view of everybody that I and my colleagues at the   New York Bank talked to in trying to ascertain what is happening in our District as well as   nationally and internationally  So I believe our forecast is the best forecast that can be made under   the circumstances but it is one where the downside risk is very clear and the role of monetary policy   continues to be a vitally important one  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation,   probably with the usual enthusiasm of the recently converted, because I entered the weekend with a   view that we ought to ease by 25 basis points and over the course of the weekend changed my   opinion Somewhat symbolically I have a pond behind my house in Westchester County and there   are a lot of fish in the pond Therefore, I have two hawks, and the hawks enjoy fishing in the pond    This is a true story, though what will follow is not true  [Laughter] This past weekend--now we get   into mythology--one of the hawks miraculously turned into a beautiful white dove  I was very   confused until I realized that what was even more miraculous was that the dove spoke with a   southern accent! [Laughter] And that convinced me even more that the 50 basis point move was   appropriate     Let me respond to the question that Tom Hoenig   raised on the market reaction  If we ease 50 basis points, the market will assume that we will ease at   least 25 basis points more  If we ease 25 basis points, the market will make the same assumption but   will be confused, I think, about whether we are slowing down just for the sake of slowing down,   which I think is a bad message to send  If we ease by 75 basis points, that will create an immense   amount of confusion, probably starting with the notion that we know a whole lot more with a greater   degree of certainty than anybody else does and that the downside we’re all concerned about is now     11/6/01 82   our central forecast  That would be very dangerous  So we certainly don’t want to do that  The   conclusion is that a 50 basis point cut, with the balance of risks still toward inadequate growth, is the   right though difficult conclusion     You missed Governor Gramlich     No     Well, if we don’t say something about the   reduction in productivity over the short run, for whatever reason, the statement will suggest that we   think productivity is going to bounce back as soon as this economic slowdown abates  That sounds   too much like whistling in the wind  I’m not sure we need to blame it on protection and security   measures  But I think we have to say that something is happening that likely will affect productivity   adversely for a while     11/6/01 93     Yes, that does it     That turns it positive     That’s better    I don’t think we need that     “Reallocation” is more positive     Yes     Absolutely  I dispute the major premise here,   which is that it’s negative I don’t find it negative for the Federal Reserve to say that investment in   security is a good thing, which is in my view what we’re saying  I absolutely fail to see how that’s   negative     You’re on a roll, Al! [Laughter]     Great     We’ve had that in our statements since the    Ferguson Committee came up with it     So move     I move approval of the domestic operations     At our board meeting last week at the New York Fed   we had a considerable discussion about the possible effect on the economy of additional terrorist   activity My own view is that the big surprise of 9/11 was that we thought it couldn’t happen here and   that if there is more terrorist activity, the American people will respond quite strongly  Do I gather   correctly that your forecast essentially says either that there will be no terrorist activity or that if there   is it will not have a significant effect on demand?     That research project got shifted to New York!    [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second District’s   economy has shown clear signs of rebounding from the depressed levels noted in my report to you at   the last meeting, and there are further signs of downward price pressure  Consumer spending in the   District seems to have rebounded in November but remains below pre-attack levels  Retailers across   New York State report that sales were up 2 to 3 percent from a year earlier over the Thanksgiving   weekend but were flat in the following week In both weeks, sales were said to be particularly   sluggish in New York City   Construction and real estate activity have been mixed  Manhattan’s office market softened   further in October despite the loss of the Trade Center  Manhattan’s apartment sales and rental   markets also have softened since the attack  However, single-family home sales throughout New York   State rebounded in October with prices remaining well ahead of year-earlier levels  Both single-  family and multifamily housing permits in October were little changed from pre-attack levels     The story about Manhattan’s commercial real estate market is really quite interesting   because everybody was quite convinced until the 11th of September event that the commercial real     12/11/01 60   estate market was quite tight  About 7 percent of the office space was wiped out by the attack on the   Twin Towers, but suddenly we don’t have any shortage of available office space  So it became clear   that some of the apparent tightness in commercial space reflected hoarding--a real estate version of the   over-investing that seems to have been taking place, and not just in the tech sector   There has been good news for the future of lower Manhattan  John Whitehead, who for   four years was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has   been named by the governor to be Chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation  I   think that will bring some necessary decisiveness to what is going to happen in the City, which is a   very important factor in restoring both consumer and business confidence     Nationally, based on the assumption that monetary policy will be eased and that the funds   rate then would be held steady through a good portion if not all of next year, we have forecast   economic growth of 3 percent Q4 to Q4 in 2002 and of 34 percent in 2003  We see the core PCE   deflator at 17 percent next year and 16 percent in 2003  The unemployment rate in our projection is   quite benign It reaches 59 percent by about the middle of next year and then gradually comes down   to about 57 percent in 2003  We do assume in this forecast that about $100 billion of fiscal stimulus   will be passed by the Congress and that it will be reasonably effective  Should that not happen, our   economic forecast would be somewhat weaker although obviously, depending on the nature of the   fiscal stimulus package, how much effect it will have next year is very questionable     The mood of business leaders in the District is extraordinarily glum  It’s reaching the point   where it seems to be becoming fashionable in New York business circles to show that one can be at a   greater depth of despair than one’s neighbor  In fact, I’ve given up trying to discuss rational forecasts   with business leaders and now have shifted to asking this question  When you figure out that you’re   wrong, can you revise your business plan and do it quickly?  The answer to that is yes, which I think is     12/11/01 61    far more pertinent than whether these business leaders have the right forecast  But the degree to which   the spreading of gloom can be self-fulfilling I think is a downside risk to the forecast     We are assuming that growth abroad will continue to be anemic and that, therefore, the   current account deficit--what I view as the long-run weak point of the American economy--will   continue at about 4-1/2 percent of GDP  We think that can be financed and probably financed with   very little if any weakening of the dollar  But it is something that concerns me greatly over the longer   run as an indication that the world economy simply isn’t balanced well  Thank you     I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, the reduced size of the rate decrease,   from 50 basis points several times in succession to 25 basis points, will in and of itself send the kind of   signal that I think we’re looking for  That’s part of the message that comes from reducing the size of   the cut    The statement captures it just fine  It’s good     We are prepared to serve, Mr Chairman     Move approval     Mr Chairman, especially with that background, I   enthusiastically move approval       I already made it      Move approval     Move approval of domestic operations                                                                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 11 of 194    Mr Chairman, like everybody else, I found these   studies to be enormously interesting and very beneficial to my own thinking  I do think that we   have a problem, as you suggested, in that we don’t have any episodes over the last thirty-five   years with which to compare this  So we look at the Great Depression or we look at the situation   in Japan        January 29-30, 2002 Page 29 of 194  I think the mistakes that were made in the Great Depression are sufficiently known that   we can be hopeful that we wouldn’t make those mistakes again  I always have a great deal of   difficulty in thinking that we could possibly learn anything from the Japanese experience  I say   that because if we look just at monetary policy, there’s an impression that the rest of the   economy and the Japanese society are really quite similar to ours when in fact they are not  The   greatest competitive advantage the United States has is that we have the most flexible economy   in the world It could easily be argued that the Japanese have the least flexible economy in the   world And if one compares the two banking systems, it is clear that the banking system in Japan   has never been very strong even in its best day, whereas ours—certainly at the moment—is   extremely strong  The quality of bankers in Japan, in terms of their being able to analyze a credit   and understand how it is likely to be repaid, is extraordinarily low, whereas in fact in this country   we have some very good bankers    On occasion in any democracy one is challenged to ask if the elected officials really are   dedicated to the good of the people  In the case of the United States of America, the answer to   that is clearly “yes,” whereas I think the elected officials in Japan are demonstrably interested in   only one thing and that is being re-elected  Therefore, I think their patriotism is open to   considerable question So I really don’t think that the Japanese experience tells us very much    We don’t even have to go into the self-congratulatory area of comparing the relative qualities of   the central banks because that probably would be unkind   I have a bit of difficulty in dealing with some of Marvin’s thoughts—not the   recommendations  I think there’s a certain point, when there is a degree of togetherness between   the central bank and the Treasury, at which the central bank’s independence has long since   become a thing of the past  Leaving aside that institutionally we at the Federal Reserve probably        January 29-30, 2002 Page 30 of 194  wouldn’t like that, I think the American people would notice that, and there would be a   tremendous loss of confidence in the system as a whole  I think that’s a price that we shouldn’t   pay   I’d say that my principal interest is in the recommendations for monetary policy that stem   from this research  If I’m right in my thinking, the Reifschneider-Williams paper leads, after a   very good analysis of the problem, to the following three recommendations on monetary policy    Aim for a long-run average inflation rate that is not too low; respond aggressively to movements   in inflation and output; and pursue policies that promise higher inflation following zero-bound   episodes Let me assume that that’s pretty close to what you’ve concluded     As for the first recommendation—aim for a long-run average inflation rate that’s not too   low—we actually already do that There are occasional efforts by my distinguished friend Mr   Parry and one or two others to suggest that we take advantage of the opportunity to drive the   inflation rate lower And as an admirer of hope conquering experience, I think it is good to   discuss that every now and then But clearly, there is no mood on this Committee to drive the   inflation rate down to 1 percent or 05 percent, say, and get near the area that many of us would   find, for the reasons you cited, to be a little dangerous  Let me go to the second   recommendation, which is to respond aggressively to movements in inflation and output  In both   directions the Committee in recent years has shown an incredible willingness to act aggressively   and highly preemptively  Therefore, I think we’re doing that also   As for deliberately pursuing policies that promise higher inflation following zero-bound   episodes, I actually believe in doing that To me the question is, Do we go about giving speeches   about it?  If we did, I think we’d have the problem that a number of us have been concerned   about for some time, and that is the issue of whether to have a formal numerical inflation target      January 29-30, 2002 Page 31 of 194  My own view is that if there is to be such a thing, it should be established by the Congress  And   I’d rather not have the Congress do that because I believe the people of the United States have   been served very well by the fact that in our minds, and not necessarily way to the back of our   heads, we do have an inflation target It’s not a numerical target but a movable one  It’s the   Greenspanian definition of whether people are thinking of inflation as they make their decisions    That’s the kind of inflationary target I like  So, after considering the staff analysis of the   problem and their recommendations, I came to the conclusion that we’re so close to where the   research staff suggests we should be that I’m not sure what in addition the staff would want us to   do At long last, that’s my question     That’s certainly consistent with all the anecdotes   we’re hearing as well That’s exactly what they have in mind     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions   in the Second District continued to improve since my last report, and inflation has remained   negligible State governments in the District face very significant budget gaps, but they are   handling them in my view both responsibly and well  New York City, to a large degree related   to the events of September 11, has a rather significant budget gap for the coming fiscal year  But   the general feeling of the City is extremely positive, as we continue to recover from September   11 and as the new mayor is off to an extraordinarily positive start  He has been successful not   only in attracting some unusually good people to his administration but also in reaching out to           January 29-30, 2002 Page 101 of 194  minority communities in a way that has brought to the City a renewed feeling of togetherness  It   seems to be a very positive beginning   Retailers report better-than-expected sales in late December and early January and say   that inventories are lean Private-sector job losses in New York State, New York City, and New   Jersey abated noticeably in December  In fact, in the City we lost 70,000 jobs in October, 20,000   in November, and only 10,000 in December  Indeed, it looks very much as if the District is not   going to have as much of a problem period as it did in the early 1990s, when its economy   performed much less well than the rest of the country  Rather it seems poised to do at least as   well, and perhaps even a little better, than the nation  The office market in New York City   appears to have improved somewhat in December, but the suburban markets in the metro area   continued to soften You’ve probably been reading about the announcements by some securities   firms that they are moving their backup sites  That was really anticipated, so it’s not particularly   new news except perhaps to the reporter who broke the story   On the national level, we share the view that the economy is already recovering and that   the inventory correction will return the economy to fairly decent growth by midyear  We believe   the expansion will then continue but at a pace that’s a bit modest, as the Greenbook suggests  On   the downside, let me expand on one risk that has been mentioned and cite some additional   factors that are of concern The stock market and the yield curve in the bond market clearly are   forecasting a much stronger economic recovery than any of us is anticipating, with much   stronger growth in profits The equity markets could, as the Greenbook suggests, limp along   sideways for a while and then grow On the other hand, when profits disappoint, as I think they   will, we could have an equity market correction of some significance with a resulting adverse   effect on consumer confidence           January 29-30, 2002 Page 102 of 194  In the business community there is such a degree of gloom that, in response to the clear   views of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have in fact been   recommending a discount rate cut since December 29  The only way I could have avoided that   was to tell our directors that they should do what I want and not what they want, and I don’t   believe that’s what the president of a Reserve Bank should be doing  To what degree this gloom   could become a self-fulfilling prophecy is very, very difficult to predict  I think what is likely to   occur is that business fixed investment will come back more slowly than any of us would like to   see Of course, as in the Santomero-Jordan view, we could have excessive gloom, then a big   swing toward a rebirth of optimism, and then business fixed investment would come back even   stronger than we anticipate I believe that the risks are somewhat to the downside in that I think   the economy could experience a recovery in the middle of the year and then pause—not stall out   and go back into recession but look as if it’s not going to pick up further  At that time, we might   be required to do some additional easing of monetary policy  On the other hand, even though I   view Tony Santomero’s scenario as less probable, I think it’s entirely possible  Therefore, it   seems to me that in the monetary policy area we have to be unusually watchful and prepared to   move in whichever direction appears appropriate, if either does     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation    Let me just add a comment since I’m supposed to know something about markets  I think that   the market reaction to our going to a balanced risk statement would be formidably dangerous    And, therefore, I believe it is especially important that we follow your recommendation     Mr Chairman, I don’t have any big ax to grind,   but my view is that the average American thinks of “business spending” as business spending   and that “business fixed investment” is more the jargon of economists and market types  I think   the term “business spending” actually is better at explaining to real people what we’re talking   about   SEVERAL How about “capital spending”?     That’s fine     Sure     Why is that?  Why would we be obliged to release   it immediately at the time of the second request?     May I ask a follow-up question to counsel?     Let’s say I dissent, which I don’t plan to do, and   the press asks me why I dissented  Is there a FOIA obligation for me to explain that?  Or can I   explain it when I choose to explain it or when the Committee chooses to have me explain it?     No He understood the question I asked  My   question was, Do I have to answer inquiries about the reason for my dissent as soon as somebody   from the press asks for it?    And the answer to that I gather is “no”     FOIA is an American law     So move     If I could make a comment, Mr Chairman?  Roger   Ferguson and I attended a meeting of leading private-sector bankers and central bankers in Basel   a couple of weeks ago When the subject turned to Argentina, it was the most fascinating   experience I’ve ever had in that there was absolute agreement between the public-sector and the   private-sector participants  All agreed that the main issue was the grotesque violation of any   concept of the rule of law by that which passes for a government in Argentina  There was no   pressure whatsoever from the private sector for a public-sector rescue package  Rather, the   contrary We were being very strongly advised not to touch Argentina with a helping hand of   any kind because of a new version of the contagion effect  That is, if a country could in any way   be rewarded for violating the law of contracts, it would encourage irresponsible governments   elsewhere in the world to think that they should do the same thing So there is, I believe, a view   that the present government of Argentina just has to be allowed to stew in its juice until and if it   figures out a way to implement a program, which would include putting back in place the rule of   law And I think the ability of the present government to do that is questionable  I must say that,   in my forty years of working on these types of problems and working with Argentina, this is the   most difficult situation I’ve ever seen That’s because not just Karen but nobody can figure out   what to do The Argentine people have a view that their politicians are either inept or corrupt or   both, and by and large they are right  Therefore, no one can quite figure out how Argentina can   get out of this situation     Sad stuff     I move approval of the domestic operations   SPEAKER(?)  Second     I agree fully And New York wouId have the staff   do them both after we have finished the contingency work     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I associate myself   very substantially with what President Santomero has just said  I think the GNMAs are   preferable to the repos with foreign sovereign debt collateral for the reasons that he cited  I also     March 19, 2002 Page 20 of 117  would like to remind us of the resource constraint  The limited number of people who can work   on this issue have been working flat out since September 11, and they were working pretty hard   before that So I think the first order of business really is that they finish the work on the   contingency issues and relax on all of this other material until then, which would probably be a   matter of, say, three to six months  At that point I think they should concentrate their efforts on   GNMAs I agree that management of GNMAs would be somewhat more complicated than   managing what is in the portfolio now, but it is certainly doable  As President Santomero said,   many firms that we supervise do that sort of work very extensively     I also believe that we have to avoid getting into the situation of saying that we will decide   which securities are acceptable if they have the full faith and credit of the government of the   United States If the Congress and the President decide that an instrument has the government’s   full faith and credit, it is not altogether clear to me that, as a creature of the Congress and as an   independent central bank, we should second-guess that decision  It isn’t at all clear to me what   would give us the authority to decide—to make the highly political judgment—that pure   Treasuries are okay but GNMAs or something else are not  It is nice that we have been able to   deal with pure Treasuries until now  As Don Kohn points out very well, even if deficits   continue, the trends are such that we’re going to have to make use of securities other than pure   Treasuries I think what the Congress and the President decide has the full faith and credit of the   United States is clearly the right place to go And if they decide that some other kind of credit   has the full faith and credit of the United States, we may have to go there, too  Thank you     Don’t laugh It just encourages him!  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second District’s   economy has shown further signs of improvement in recent weeks  Retail sales were reported to   be above plan in February, rebounding from a lull in January  Consumer confidence picked up   noticeably in metropolitan New York City; there’s a much better feel to the community  Labor   markets are showing signs of bottoming out across most of the region, with modest job gains in   both New York City and northern New Jersey in January  Residential markets for single-family   homes as well as co-ops and condos have continued to gain momentum since my last report  In   fact, the only weakness in the Manhattan market now is for rental office space and rental   apartments  Bankers report some let-up in consumer loan demand  They are enforcing tighter   credit standards on their commercial borrowers, and delinquency rates are holding about the   same     We agree essentially with the size and shape of the forecast in the Greenbook, and I must   say that I, too, applaud today’s staff presentation  Anything that combines humility, self-  confidence, and humor is much to be applauded  We think that the risks in the outlook are in fact   about balanced Consumer confidence could be a little less than both our staff and the             March 19, 2002 Page 70 of 117  Greenbook anticipate, and the international situation, which I think Karen captured very well,   probably has more downside than upside risk to it               In regard to the query about business fixed investment, I think you probably all heard of   the business conference that was held in Boca Raton about three weeks ago  They should have   been looking at the same data we are, and yet the vast consensus was that we were still in a   recession and would not pull out of it until toward the end of the year  I think business people   clearly are mesmerized by their own concerns about their profit pictures and probably are   drawing too flat a trend line from their experience in the latter part of last year  One would have   to think, if the business recovery is stronger than they expect, especially in light of labor   productivity, that profits almost have to be stronger than they are anticipating or that at least a   pleasant surprise in their profits could take place  And that could get business confidence turned   up more than we are anticipating in our forecast   Inventories are also an interesting situation because those of us who firmly believe that   the inventories were being handled better because of information technology actually had a   pretty good story going through the first three quarters of 2001  But in the last quarter the steep   drop in inventories was just way off the scale So I think one has to assume that a lot of the   inventory liquidation was involuntary on the part of businesses and was a result of consumer   spending coming back much stronger than they thought it would  Now the question is whether   the secular downward trend in the inventory-sales ratio will continue—which I think is   essentially what all of us are assuming in our forecasts—or whether the present inventory-sales   ratio after that fourth-quarter drop is lower than businesses want it to be  If it’s the latter,   restocking could occur sooner and be more intense, which would be a very big positive kick and   an upside risk to the forecast         March 19, 2002 Page 71 of 117  So in general, we think that intellectually the balance of risks is equal  I must say,   though, that my gut is telling me that the upside potential is probably greater than we have in the   forecast So it seems to me that we’re in a period of watchful waiting and that perhaps we should   be particularly aware of the upside risk potential Thank you     I have a comment and then a question The   comment is that I think the difference between now and February 1994 is that we have been so   much more transparent, beginning around that time, when we initiated the practice of announcing   the decision taken at each meeting  So I think the likelihood of our surprising the market to the   degree we did then is very, very low or certainly much lower than it was then     Turning to the model, which you explained very well, Vince, am I right that the terms   “right away,” “in one year,” or “ in two years” as a policy model should really be viewed more   broadly than that?  Isn’t it more along the lines of “right away,” “wait a while but we’re not quite   sure how long,” or “wait a little while longer though we’re not quite sure how long that is   either”?  What I draw from this exercise is that essentially it’s a very good guide on whether we                  March 19, 2002 Page 85 of 117  have to do something today and not a very good guide on whether the delay should be a year or   less than a year Is that right?      Yes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I concur with your   recommendation  And I would point out that if the next move has to be up, which I think it will   be, we can certainly move from a balanced balance of risks statement  There is no reason at all   in my view to inhibit us from doing that     That’s it     It deserves a standing ovation Brilliant!     Oh, Mayor Daley would have loved you! Guided   democracy       Move approval     Just a comment, Mr Chairman  We run into the   trap of “all other things equal” and that’s so hard to figure out     Move approval of the domestic operations      Might I suggest that until we construct the index   the Chairman wants we don’t really know whether it’s going to tell us very much  So why don’t   we construct it and see if it’s useful     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second District’s   economy has been giving mixed signals since the last report, which is what we’ve been hearing   from around the country  There are scattered signs of increased price pressures, mainly in   manufacturing inputs and shelter costs  But overall, inflation remains relatively subdued  Retail   sales were on or close to plan in April, and prices were steady  Consumer confidence was little   changed in April, while labor market conditions were mixed but also generally steady  Housing   markets showed some strength, though prices of co-ops and condos have retreated from their   recent peaks  Office markets in and around New York City have remained weak but have   stabilized Business at Manhattan hotels has been improving and continued to improve in March   even though room rates are down about 10 percent from a year ago—which means that they’re   still expensive! [Laughter] Surveys of manufacturers and purchasing managers suggest   continued improvement in the region’s manufacturing sector in April  And bankers report   stronger demand for nonresidential mortgages, tighter credit standards, and steady to lower   delinquency rates   I’d just like to make a few comments on the national economy  The level of gloom in   New York business circles, which was profound at the beginning of the year and lessened   slightly about a month ago, is now even greater than before  The explanation for why business   people are so gloomy even though profits are beginning to improve is that the profit   improvement comes only from cost cutting not from revenue increases  And they will not   believe that they should move on business fixed investment until revenue increases improve as   well On the inventory side, as I think all of us have been saying, the rundown of inventories   actually did continue—though much more slowly—in the first quarter  That continued   liquidation now has inventory levels well below where it would seem businesses had wanted            May 7, 2002 54 of 81  them, based on the trend line in business inventories going back to the mid-1990s through the   first three quarters of last year  Clearly, the inventory drop in the last two quarters leaves   businesses in general with the choice of adjusting their view of the appropriate inventory-sales   ratio to a lower level and deciding it is possible to run the business that way or of bringing it   back up to the trend line  If the latter is the choice, then of course we could get a bigger push   from inventory rebuilding than I believe is in any of our forecasts     The mood on Wall Street is very grim, indeed  There is much comment about the   investigations by the New York State Attorney General and the SEC of what may be a   dichotomy between what analysts were thinking and what they were saying publicly  Also, the   cover article in Business Week is making them feel that this onslaught on Wall Street is   broadening to a popular cry One might argue that that’s their problem and they should resolve   it, which of course is my view  However, because of all this, there’s a skittish, nervous feel   about financial markets, which I think has to be a concern to us  And if the brokerage firms get   into the bomb shelters sufficiently and are not making markets to the same degree that they have   been, that would adversely affect liquidity Liquidity problems are bad enough in normal times,   but if we were to have anything like a crisis from, say, some geo-political event—which is   entirely possible given the situation in the Middle East—I’m concerned about whether we could   have exaggerated market reactions simply because of the constraints on liquidity  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I concur with your   recommendation     I consider this that the Vice Chair is on a roll,   which everybody is following     I think it’s great  I see many heads nodding   around the table, Mr Chairman     So moved     Move approval of domestic operations     I could make a facetious remark and stop there,   Mr Chairman, to the effect that Art’s presentation is particularly attractive if you have not   devoted many years and much energy to getting a PhD in economics  The more important lesson   from the various analyses that are used, however, is that—as David has pointed out I think quite   well—they show us what we don’t know I have long felt that in public policy it is important to   know what you don’t know because then you’re not likely to go happily along making policy   decisions based on a view that you know more than you do  I do think that historians probably   will say that one of the great performances of this Committee was in the 1996-97 period when   we knew that some quite unusual things were happening  The staff did not pretend to say that all   of our models were working; they were very straightforward in saying that the models were not   working and that, therefore, we had to look at more figures and perhaps place greater weight on   anecdotal information  But I do believe that it’s important for us to keep digging and digging        June 25-26, 2002 19 of 179  into these various theories to see what we know or what combinations of theories can be put   together to guide the Committee in making decisions  I am in the happy position of being able to   say that I can’t think of a decision we’ve made, at least in the nine years I’ve been here, that with   the full brilliance of hindsight I would like to go back and change  That’s all I have to say,   especially if you’re given to intellectual honesty, which I hope we all are  So I think the   imperfect methodology we’re using has served us rather well       Looking at the second panel on your exhibit 4,   where structural productivity growth was taking off—with a drop-off recently that is about   typical of the reduction in productivity growth during a recession—I would think that the   improving productivity trend is still very much alive  The question, I think, is why it took place    It seems to me that the lack of pricing power, which you suspect is at least part of the explanation           June 25-26, 2002 32 of 179  of what was driving the productivity improvement, is in fact very important  That’s especially   the case for the improvement in productivity that came from the use of information technology in   the non-tech sector I think the main reason that people running firms were investing in such   technology is that in a global economy they simply couldn’t raise prices  They had to give some   increases in wages and benefits, and the only way to avoid financing that out of profitability was   to invest in productivity enhancements and not share the benefits from that with the staff  It   seems to me that the economy we will be looking at in the foreseeable future—say, the next five   years—is going to be that same kind of economy  Now, a little of the discipline may come off   unless Karen can get the dollar strong again because clearly a strong dollar enhanced that   discipline even more and made businesses invest in improvements in productivity  I think we’re   still going to have a lot of that discipline, and it will continue to be a big factor  You say that it   may be long lived but not permanent; I’m old enough that permanent doesn’t matter too much to   me  So if it goes on for another five or ten years—and I think it’s likely to—I believe it will   serve the nation well     I think David’s record on psychology and   diplomacy has just gone up to match his skill as an economist!  [Laughter]     Two remarks, Mr Chairman  As my earlier   comment indicated, I think the staff may be confusing cyclical and secular trends  That is, I   believe the pickup in participation of labor is a result of the recession and very likely will not   continue On the international comparisons of productivity, we’ve been spending a fair amount   of time in New York looking at a question that I believe is a matter of considerable concern in   many ways, and that is, Why has productivity in the United States since the mid-1990s been so   much better than that experienced by our friends in the European community?  There are no   high-quality studies on the whole European community, but there are some very good studies on     June 25-26, 2002 51 of 179  the big four—Germany, Italy, France, and Holland, which though much smaller than the first   three is actually quite a lot larger than the other small countries  And if one looks at the area in   which tradable goods are involved—in the pure tech sector—the productivity improvement in   the European four in that sector is just about the same as it is in the United States  And in the   rest of manufacturing it’s quite similar     The remarkable area where the United States is hugely ahead of the European four is in   the services sector When one tries to look for an explanation, first I would note that in the   services sector in Europe there is not as much international competition  Also, I think the   strength of their views on the role of the state—in terms of the state being responsible for the   individual—and the strength of the trade union movement play through in very, very little   productivity improvement in the services area, whereas in the United States, it is in some of the   services areas where the use of information technology has been most helpful in very   substantially improving productivity  I found it very interesting that it was productivity in the   services sector that accounted for virtually the entire explanation of the differential in our favor     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second District’s   economic performance has been mixed, as we’ve been hearing is the case in most parts of the   country There are some signs of increased price pressures in manufacturing and real estate; but   aside from shelter costs, finished goods inflation has remained stable and low  Retail sales   bounced back in June after a weak performance in May  Consumer confidence has been rather   mixed, and labor market conditions are as well, but overall both are fairly steady  The housing   markets in the District have been restrained, with prices continuing to rise but modestly  Office   markets in and around New York City remain weak but have stabilized, and the hotels have   reported further increases in occupancy and room rates  Our surveys of manufacturers and   purchasing managers suggest a mixed performance in the manufacturing sector in May  And   bankers in the District report some softening in consumer loan demand but a pickup in demand   from commercial borrowers, tighter lending standards, and steady to lower delinquency rates     On the national level, our quibbles with the staff forecast are so minor as to not require   any discussion I’d like to comment on some of the views around the table that somehow we   have to prepare the market for what seems like an inevitable tightening of monetary policy  I’m   not sure who it is that we think we need to convince of what  If the world outside really   questioned the inflation-fighting skills and the willingness of this Committee to combat inflation,   then I guess we’d have to go out and try to convince the world of that  But with the exception of   a few loonies who write rather silly columns—such as one in the Wall Street Journal today—in   order to make a living, nobody questions the ability and the willingness of this Committee to   fight inflation when it needs to be fought It’s rather like Babe Ruth running around and saying,                   June 25-26, 2002 100 of 179  “I’m a great hitter,” or Lefty Grove saying “I’m a great pitcher”  Nobody questioned their   abilities     He’s the greatest left-handed pitcher in baseball   history Thirty-one wins and six losses in his best year, with a lifetime earned-run average of   about 253?     He was a very good pitcher The point I wish to   make is that we would be ill advised now to be preparing the market for something that I don’t   think the market needs to be prepared for  Our balance of risks statement says that we think the   risks are balanced If we were to say that we think there is a greater risk of inflation, people   would wonder on which planet we had taken up residence!  We certainly don’t need to posture   ourselves as virtuous inflation fighters; that would seem to place in doubt whether we consider   ourselves to be good inflation fighters when necessary  Otherwise, why would we be talking   about that?   I have a position in the world’s financial center that provides me with about a zillion   international contacts If anybody were seriously worried about our willingness to take on   inflation, I would surely be inundated by such comments  I don’t get any So I would suggest   that we not get involved in a fight that nobody thinks we need to engage in  There are some   very, very serious problems out there, and we don’t need to contribute to them by placing our   own skills in question     June 25-26, 2002 101 of 179  The markets continue to be pounded by what appears to be an expanding scandal in   corporate America, leading a growing number of our fellow citizens—and even more foreign   investors—to fear equity investments in this market  A month ago I think one could have said   that the corporate scandals were relatively isolated and that there weren’t too many Enrons  Just   too many are coming to light for people to be able to say that now  And the willingness, despite   all these developments, of the final four accounting firms to spend their considerable skills on the   Hill trying to ensure that no legislation is passed that calls for oversight of them—no oversight at   all—indicates a lack of common sense that is really quite dangerous   The probability of an international financial crisis would be difficult to exaggerate, I   think Argentina is as we have described it in recent meetings  Brazil, in my view, is an ever-  growing danger The question is not whether Lula da Silva would be   elected President of Brazil Rather, it is whether the financial markets in the country, and   especially the citizens of the country, are going to sit around and wait to see what happens  If his   lead in the polls continues, I think we have to stand by for a very high probability of massive   capital flight as we get closer to the election  There is nothing the IMF or anybody else can do   about that If the Brazilian people decide that they’re going to vote with their money, the rest of   the world will have to watch But if that happens, the likelihood of a very serious contagion   effect on the world economy is great indeed  For a while we could say that there was almost no   contagion effect coming out of Argentina  That is no longer true  It may not be coming out of   Argentina, but there is a fear in the emerging-market area that is getting considerably greater     If we have an international financial crisis, we are not in very good shape to deal with it    We, the people of the United States, are very solidly in support of our President in the war   against terrorism  But if you were to spend as much time as I do dealing with the international     June 25-26, 2002 102 of 179  community, you would know that the support of our traditional allies for our position is weak at   best Their attitude that the United States is being unilateral, which I think is a bum rap, is   spreading, and it takes on a reality of its own  If we have an international financial crisis, the   world is going to say that the present economic leadership team in the United States has never   been through such a crisis Anytime that a group has not been through the handling of a crisis,   there will be questions about how good it will be at it  I hope and expect that this team would   handle such a crisis very well indeed  But I think the world would expect the central bank of the   United States to take on the leadership role if needed, as we did in the fall of 1998 particularly    And because of what I see as a very murky and rather dangerous international environment—and   it could get quite bad indeed —I think it is particularly important for us to conduct ourselves in a   way that indicates our self-confidence We need to show that we are sure of ourselves and   confident in our own abilities to manage domestic monetary policy well and to manage our role   in promoting financial stability as brilliantly—a word well selected, I think—as we have in   recent years  It is not the time to go around preparing the market for something for which it   doesn’t need to be prepared and in the process to place in doubt our confidence in ourselves    Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I concur with your   recommendation fully     While the statement is being distributed, I will   make this correction regarding my observation on Lefty Grove’s lifetime ERA  I was right on   his record in his best season  His lifetime ERA was 306  He won 300 games while losing 141       No     That’s the advantage of the eight years you have   on me       Silence means consent     So move     Don Kohn isn’t sure! [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, I think another factor that   increasingly has crept into the market, and for some reason it seems to have increased a lot on or   about August 1, is the risk aversion on the part of marketmakers  One can see it in the bid-asked   spreads and investors’ willingness to hold in portfolio amounts that would have been considered   quite manageable a year ago  One can see it in the international markets and the domestic   markets  Market participants are just running scared; and when they’re running scared, they tend   to manage much lower positions, and we get much greater volatility in markets       Well, I think one is looking for a rational   explanation of fear, and fear is not entirely rational     I think they have reasons to be frightened, but   they’re a little more frightened than one would wish they were     I move approval of the domestic operations     Mr Chairman, I’d like to compliment Karen on   what I thought was an extremely sensitive and unfortunately highly accurate picture of the   dangers in Brazil  Her report was very well done Aggravating the Brazilian situation is the fact   that the major international banks dealing there are, as I mentioned earlier, part of the “running   scared” group The two big Spanish banks are very active in Brazil  They’ve taken severe losses   in Argentina and are very concerned about what could happen to them in Brazil  The major   American banks are seeing their names in the paper in a rather unflattering way and are also   quite risk averse So, unfortunately, what seems to have happened in the last few days is that the   international banking community is taking advantage of the IMF package to reduce their   exposure That in any long-term sense is very much against their interest and is not very smart,   but that seems to be what they’re doing     Another effect of their conduct, if it continues—which I sincerely hope it will not—is   that it will almost certainly bring about a much higher likelihood that any future IMF program   will have as a conditioned precedent a quite formal agreement between the country and its         August 13, 2002 20 of 92  international creditors The reason that the IMF didn’t do so in the case of Brazil, I think wisely,   is that the situation was sufficiently precarious that, if they sat around negotiating some sort of   “stand still” agreement with Brazil’s creditors, the country certainly would have tanked  So it   was a risk that the Fund had to take  But if the international banking community continues to   behave as it has in the last few days, I think it will be very difficult in the future for the Fund to   organize a major package like this and take the risk of the same thing happening  So, in addition   to the very accurate picture that Karen gave, there is this potential aggravating factor  Thank   you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Developments in the   Second District’s economy have been mixed since the last report, though housing has continued   to be robust On the price side, despite continued escalation in nonwage benefit costs, prices of   finished goods and services have remained remarkably stable  Retail sales, which were weak in   April and May, seem to have improved and gone up with the temperature gauge in June and July    Consumer confidence slipped in June and July, but labor markets, although sluggish, were quite   stable Housing markets and home construction activity were robust in the second quarter                August 13, 2002 60 of 92  Office markets weakened a little more  Surveys of manufacturers and purchasing managers in   the District suggested some rebound in activity in the last few weeks, following a pause in July    And our bankers reported some softening in consumer loan demand but improved commercial   lending They also noted tighter lending standards, which are appropriate, and steady   delinquency rates   I would like to talk a bit more about what I see as the fragility in the financial sector both   in the United States and in other industrialized countries  I think that fragility is a result of both   real developments and, perhaps even more, a high degree of risk aversion, especially in the   commercial banking sector The banks have been quite profitable  Their capital ratios are good,   and therefore, in my view their degree of risk aversion is considerably overdone  If we look at   Europe, their insurance companies are very heavy investors in equities both in Europe and the   United States  And many of those companies would be of questionable positive net worth if they   were marked to market  Banks in Europe are very heavily involved in the telecom sector, much   more than those in the United States, and their risk-taking ability is quite severely affected as a   result As for Japan, the Japanese bank institutional situation has not improved any  An   indication of where some of the big banks in the United States stand is that the spread between   Treasuries and credits of Citigroup, the holding company, is considerably wider than that of its   much lower rated customer, Gillette  And even though I hope lots of us are shaving with   Mach-IIIs, one would think that Citigroup is a little better credit     The syndicated loan market is very, very quiet  Now to a large degree, that’s because of   lack of demand But when we have more demand for credit in the economy, I think the   availability of the syndicated loan market is going to be quite questionable  The reason is that   there are three strong managers of syndicated loans  Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of         August 13, 2002 61 of 92  America  All of them have lost a great deal  of credibility with the banks that make up their   syndicates, much more than would be the case with proper banking  The syndicate leader had   done the due diligence, and most of the members of the syndicate took the word of the syndicate   leader on that score  There has been a question in recent times on whether the syndicate leader   was quite as loyal to the syndicate as it was to its own shareholders and in addition on whether   the due diligence of the lead bank had been what it should have been  Therefore, I think it will   be difficult for syndicated credits to be put together for quite some period of time until that faith   is restored   We, like all the other people who have commented here today, believe that the economy   is clearly weaker than we thought it was at the last meeting  And I think it’s important that the   central bank of the United States show that it lives in the real world by reflecting that in our   statement  On the other hand, given the vast importance of this institution to the stability of the   United States and the world, it is imperative that we act with prudence When we have to ease   monetary policy, if we do—and I certainly believe the time is not today—I think we should do so   with some degree of boldness in order to show the leadership that will be required of us  In the   meantime, it seems to me crucial that we remain prudent and appear to be prudent  Not even St   Jude himself, the patron saint of lost causes, would hope that this entire group would remain   silent But in our public statements I think it would be unwise and even dangerous if we shared   some of the discussion of the downside risks that we have traded among ourselves today  Thank   you     I concur with your recommendation, Mr   Chairman     Bravo Silence indicates admiration               August 13, 2002 87 of 92    So moved     Unfair question, good answer     Move approval of the domestic operations     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would describe the   Second District as limping along  The regional economy is growing slowly, with very little job   growth and essentially no price or wage pressures  Business sentiment is split  Wall Street, at   least as reflected by the Bank’s board of directors, is extremely pessimistic and risk averse          September 24, 2002 43 of 115  Main Street, as represented by our Branch board in Buffalo, is cautiously optimistic  And our   forecast for the national economy is about where the Greenbook is   The chasm between the United States and our traditional allies is in my view greater than   it has been at any time since World War II  Our economy is operating below capacity and below   trend Europe is barely growing at all, and the future of its most important economy now   depends on the whims of the Greens and of the trade unions  Japan is Japan The emerging-  market situation is full of growing problems, with Brazil too close to call My usually reliable, at   least to me, stomach lining is telling me that a major storm is brewing, but when or even if it will   hit is difficult to tell   I believe that the third quarter is sufficiently strong and that too many Fed officials have   had too much to say recently, so the market would be overly surprised if we were to act today    And we could create some real confusion at the weekend meeting of the World Bank and   International Monetary Fund, which is likely to be confused enough anyway  We must,   however, make sure that we do not paralyze ourselves into inaction or expect some event to   make a policy move an easy and obvious call  If the malaise here and abroad continues, it just   becomes too dangerous for us to stand by and pray that American consumer confidence will hold   up the world economy  Rather, activity and prices could slowly but steadily sink and put us into   a very, very difficult policy trap I believe that it is not yet certain but increasingly likely that we   will have to ease policy and do so robustly either at or between meetings  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Still     Japan is Japan  I said that     A Wednesday  The previous day is Election Day     Mr Chairman, I concur with your   recommendation, but I would like to explain why  If we were to move today, I believe that   would send a signal that we know something about the economy that nobody else knows  The   markets, the American people, and those around the world simply are not prepared for that    Now, one of the reasons they’re not prepared for it is that we on this Committee have had too   much to say recently  Because of the geopolitical considerations going forward, I think it is   extremely important that—with the exception of the Chairman, who happens to be giving some        September 24, 2002 89 of 115  speeches tomorrow in London—all of the members of the Committee use common sense and   remain quiet about monetary policy  I say that because it will be very difficult for us to amplify   on the statement that we will release after this meeting  Few of us—probably none of us—can   pretend to be great geopolitical experts, so we shouldn’t be giving speeches about geopolitics  If   we say that we didn’t take an action but we still believe that the risk is on the downside, I think   we’ve said everything that needs to be said  Saying that the outlook is gloomier creates   problems, and saying that everything is okay is contrary to what we’ve heard at this meeting  So    I sincerely hope that we can maintain some discipline   Second, I do believe that the economic situation will likely clarify itself in the next four   or five weeks, and therefore if we move at all—and I say if—it may well be in an intermeeting   move Thank you     May I make a comment?     I think there’s a little confusion about what we   mean when we’re talking about the importance of geopolitical events  It’s not as if we mean that   a geopolitical event is, say, that we start bombing Iraq three or four weeks from now  Maybe we   will, and maybe we won’t  Rather, the point is what the geopolitical environment does to the   level of uncertainty and the effects of that on the real economy  That’s a lot easier to convey in a   couple of words in the statement    Are we ready to vote?    All this silence suggests agreement     They read fast    I certainly don’t interpret it that way     My view is that it’s not just not half bad, it’s   essential that you do that I think we need to prepare the market for the possibility, not the   certainty, that we may make a move    We all agree that you have a unique talent in that   regard     So move, Mr Chairman     I don’t have a question I have a comment  I   think your handling of the account when you had the reduction in holdings was very well done       Move approval of the domestic operations     Could I comment on this issue?  The immigration   experts are virtually all in agreement that if a country has a toughening up of legal immigration,   which we’ve had since September 11, illegal immigration just increases accordingly  So the   likelihood, therefore, of immigration being stronger and creating more housing demand than the   official data would indicate I think is greater       The Second District economy has shown some   signs of weakening since the last report, but labor market conditions and prices have remained   fairly stable  Retailers report that sales weakened in October despite a slight weather-related   pickup in the second half of the month  Inventories are down from a year ago, but they’re   described as a bit high, and retailers say they are discounting more heavily  Consumer   confidence in the region fell sharply in October, reaching a new cyclical low  Unemployment   rates in the District were steady to low in September, and payroll employment was about         November 6, 2002 62 of 122  unchanged Home construction was fairly strong in September, but sales of existing homes   weakened, particularly in the New York City area  Office vacancy rates across most of New   York City continued to climb, but we’ve had some luck in filling office space in lower   Manhattan Surveys of District manufacturers and purchasing managers indicate some    improvement in recent weeks  And bankers in the District report steady to rising loan demand,   further tightening in business lending standards, and very stable delinquency rates     The fiscal plight in New York City is very difficult to exaggerate  The size of the deficit   is approximately equal to that in the mid-1970s at about $5 billion to $6 billion  It looks as if a   combination of increased taxes and reduced expenditures may solve about $2 billion of the   shortfall Some smoke and mirrors will take care of about another billion dollars, but that leaves   $2 billion to $3 billion that will have to be borrowed in a very inhospitable market  The State is   in no position to help the City in any substantial way, and I think we are going to hear about the   magic of revenue sharing being expressed very loudly by the congressional delegation from New   York in coming months     No, the revenues come from here to there    It’s called revenue sharing  It’s a euphemism  At   the national level, we at the New York Reserve Bank think that the economic outlook remains   uncertain, to put it mildly, with very considerable near-term downside risk  Our forecast has   growth of less than 2 percent in the fourth quarter, and we believe that a reasonable forecast for   next year calls for fairly decent growth like that of the Greenbook  But we as a Bank believe and   I personally believe very strongly that the time to take out some insurance against the downside            November 6, 2002 63 of 122  risk has arrived In my view, one can reach that opinion easily just by looking at the domestic   economy alone, but I think the international situation makes the need for insurance even clearer     Europe is stagnating There was an agreement announced this morning between France   and Germany that they would combine positions going into each meeting of the Economic and   Financial Council of the European Community, which means that a large center right majority in   France is going to be guided by a very small center left majority in Germany  How that would   make sense to French voters baffles me somewhat, but that’s what they decided  I mentioned at   the last meeting that Japan is Japan  Well, it’s still Japan but even more so after the recent   adventures with bank restructuring or not bank restructuring  And Latin America, despite some   respite for Brazil, is if anything weaker  It’s my belief that the time for the Committee to act has   arrived And in my view the action that we take today should be decisive  Thank you, Mr   Chairman       That’s what the policy discussion is going to be   about     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Not surprisingly, I do   think that you’re right, but let me explain why  It seems to me that it’s very clear from the   discussion around the table that we need to take out insurance against the downside risks in the   Greenbook forecast and in everybody else’s forecast that I heard  When one is taking insurance   against downside risks, one should take out the amount of insurance that is appropriate; 25 basis   points simply is not enough  First of all, the immediate market reaction to 25 basis points slanted   toward weakness would be that the Committee is composed of a bunch of wimps, which is not an   attractive assessment for a group that is supposed to be a very important public body  But   second, the market would immediately crank in an assumption of another 25 basis points either   in the intermeeting period or at the December meeting, which would be considerably more   destabilizing than doing the right thing in one move today  Why would we say that we’d go with   a statement of balanced risks?  Well, if taking out insurance against downside risks is what we’re   about, which I think it is, the whole purpose of that is to balance the risks  If 50 basis points is   the right number, it should balance the risks If it isn’t the right number, we should use a bigger   number, which I don’t think is necessary  If we did 50 basis points with the balance of risks   toward weakness, in the first place I think it would be wrong  In the second place, it would scare   the hell out of everybody I can assure you, as your man in New York, that if there’s anything of   which I’m certain after many years of being in markets, that would scare them; that would be   very, very unwise   Now, I think a legitimate question if we go with 50 basis points and a balanced risk   statement is, Does it tie our hands?  I don’t think so  It certainly doesn’t tie our hands if in fact   we took out insurance and didn’t need it That would be good news  That would be great, and   everybody would cheer, starting with us So it certainly doesn’t tie our hands in that direction          November 6, 2002 86 of 122  On the other hand, if at the next meeting or the meeting after that we decided that the situation   was deteriorating further and we had to take out more insurance or we wanted to make a more   normal non-insurance move, our hands would not be tied either     So it seems to me that the recommendation that you have given us is the right and   prudent thing to do, and it in no way prohibits any action that we may wish to take in the future    Thank you     There’s a difference?  [Laughter]     The Committee’s informal judgment       Yes     My Chairman, not unrelated to the fact that a lot   of the work done on these studies is done by people at the New York Reserve Bank, I would   suggest that we ask the staff to concentrate on the Ginnie Mae study and get that done at some   reasonable pace  After that is brought back to the Committee to look at, then we could decide         November 6, 2002 103 of 122  whether there is a need to move on the other studies  Otherwise, I think we’re overloading the   staff unnecessarily     Yes    Exactly That’s why I think that is worth   pursuing     A wee bit more than adequate     I think some guidance we might add is that the   staff ought to pursue this as they can—not by hiring new people or by working overtime, but   they ought to take it seriously If it takes you six months or twelve months, that’s not going to   endanger the republic     Dino has already been told that he has no room for   expanding the budget for this—not two sous more than what he already has in the budget     I move approval     Move approval of the domestic operations                          December 10, 2002 7 of 87    Governor Kohn     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second District   economy appears to have picked up some steam since my last report, with signs of improvement    in the labor market and stabilization in manufacturing  Retailers are reporting some    improvement in sales in November, particularly over the Thanksgiving weekend, with the winter   weather producing a rebound in apparel purchases  And the streets of Manhattan were filled   with tourists, which we were very happy to see  Surprisingly, considering all this, consumer   confidence remained depressed in November following a big drop in October  Unemployment   rates are about flat; they edged up very slightly in the most recent month  Sales of existing   single-family homes weakened noticeably in October, while selling prices slipped very modestly    Home construction retreated a bit in October but remains at a fairly high level, particularly in the   multifamily sector  Lower Manhattan’s office market remained stable in October but office   vacancy rates in the rest of Manhattan rose further  Manufacturers and purchasing managers   report that conditions generally have been stable in recent weeks    The fiscal situation in New Jersey, New York City, and New York State has remained   very grim indeed  And we have what I think could now be called a fairly high probability of a   transit strike beginning at midnight on Sunday  The demands by the transit workers are well   beyond the ability of the transit authority or the city to accept  The effect of a transit strike on   the city, especially on consumers and tourists, would be very unfortunate  It looks as if it’s an   accident that should be avoided but may very well not be    The bankers in the District report that residential and commercial mortgages are being   increasingly sought and not just refinancings  They have been tightening up on their lending   standards, which is not surprising because delinquency rates on consumer and home mortgage   loans have increased some  We share the view that the fourth quarter will be weak, perhaps even               December 10, 2002 56 of 87  less than 1 percent on GDP, and that growth should come back somewhat slowly next year    However, we still think the risks to the forecast are somewhat to the downside, although that’s   less clearly the case than at our last meeting largely as a result of our move    On the international front, I think Karen’s report was as usual very well balanced    However, the news in Latin America, my early area of specialty, is getting worse  The Mexican   political situation is essentially frozen until next July’s congressional elections  The president   does not wish to negotiate with the opposition, and the opposition doesn’t want to negotiate with   the president, and so nothing will happen  Fiscal policy cannot be expansive simply because the   government can’t find the revenues, and monetary policy has been tightened a little very   recently  In Brazil, the delay in President-elect Lula da Silva’s naming of his Economic Policy   Committee is not good news  I think there is a growing conflict between his economic advisers   and the leadership of his labor party  If it continues, that could result in an additional and   unnecessary blow to confidence among both domestic and international investors  That would   keep real interest rates high and, therefore, make the sustainability of the debt levels in Brazil   more questionable In my view, the risks are not overwhelming, but the direction is not a happy   one Thank you     Yes     I support your recommendation and applaud the   brevity And I hope that it will be imitated by all     I think silence indicates approval, Mr Chairman     Second  [Laughter]     Maybe for the record somebody else should   second the motion   SEVERAL  I’ll second     Move approval, Mr Chairman     It’s really a necessary technical correction     Move approval of eliminating paragraphs 3   though 6 of the guidelines   January 28-29, 2003 7 of 195      Move approval     Move approval     Move approval     Move approval     Not only have we tried, we’ve succeeded very   well     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Most of the people   that I know in financial markets understand as much about these models as I do, which isn’t very   much  Having the enormous benefit, unlike all previous speakers, of not having a PhD in   economics—or perhaps in English literature, in the case of President Santomero—I think the rule   that we need to apply is the rule of what I would call prudent central banking  If we look back   on the conduct of the Committee, going back at least to 1987 or to 1993, when I got here, I   believe that we’ve passed that test quite well  If we reexamine what we’ve done together—with   the possible exception of the case President Broaddus mentioned, although I would not agree   with his conclusion on the timing of our tightening in 2001—even with the brilliance of   hindsight, I believe that we have been prudent central bankers  What do I mean by that?  What   does that tell us about how the Committee behaves?   I’ve bored you many times by saying that in my view the most important thing in public   life is to distinguish between what we do know and what we do not know  When we reached a   point as we did in February 1994 or as we did on January 3, 2001, when it was time for a   significant shift in monetary policy—tightening in the case of 1994 and easing in the latter   case—what did we know on those occasions?  Actually, I should note that I think the seeds of   the January 2001 action go back to the December 2000 meeting of this Committee at a time   January 28-29, 2003 54 of 195    when the markets were essentially closed for the year  There was an underlying feeling going   through the room at the December meeting that we were going to keep monetary policy on hold   but that there was a strong likelihood that we’d be chatting soon in a telephone conference call    We did that the very first day the market was open in 2001  I remember that we knew on both of   those occasions that a significant change in monetary policy was required—tightening in the first   case, easing in the second case  But what didn’t we know?  We didn’t know what the total size   of the needed monetary policy corrective move would turn out to be  I certainly didn’t know   that, and I think even our distinguished Chairman didn’t know that at the time  It was very clear   with the 25 basis point move in February 1994 or the 50 basis point move on January 3, 2001,   that our work wasn’t finished  There was more to do   In such situations, we get into the combination of not knowing how far we’re going to go   or necessarily how quickly  But we start dealing with the financial markets through which our   policy operates, and we observe the reaction in those financial markets  Then we try to judge the   likely effect on the real economy of that reaction  If the financial markets are working with us,   then the pace of our monetary policy move can be accelerated  We can be bolder, but we are   being bolder while being wise and prudent at the same time, which in my view is highly   necessary  So I think a prudent central banker is not a timid central banker or a risk-averse   central banker but rather one who says the following  This is where I think I want to go; how   fast and how far I’m not quite sure, so I’m going to deal with the real world in which we live and   do it as effectively as possible   At the end of most of those lengthy cycles, which usually last about a year, we realize —  as we’ve said frequently in this Committee—that either the last two moves or the last move is   going to turn out to have been unnecessary  That was the reasoning behind our explaining the   January 28-29, 2003 55 of 195    50 basis point move that we made most recently as an action taken against a soft spot in the   economy  We made it very clear that it was an insurance policy against downside risk  Why did   we do that?  Because when we reverse that move—when we cancel the insurance policy—it will   be very easy for financial market participants and the public more generally to understand      I think the model building is extremely useful, and this kind of discussion is very   important and very enlightening for us  But in my view the likelihood—as you suggested, Mr   Chairman—of our ever getting the model so exactly right that we can base anything on it other   than a sense of policy direction is very low  If we decide, well, let’s be bold, then somehow the   markets will figure it out over time; that is a risk that I don’t think a prudent central banker will   take  Eventually the markets may figure it out, but in the meantime, if we scare the hell out of   everybody and tank the economy—losing the confidence of the American people, never mind   market participants—that would be imprudent  A central bank should not engage in imprudent   behavior  It’s wonderful to feel bold, but I think it’s even more important to be prudent  Thank   you     That’s why you’re prudent—also known as risk   averse—but prudent sounds so much better     Well, as the Chairman said, there’s a good deal of   psychology involved  Therefore, we’re dealing with all the social sciences, however   mathematical we try to make them, at the same time  What is the reaction of financial markets?    That’s largely psychological  What is the reaction of the real people?  It’s almost purely   psychological   I don’t know of any model that perfectly links psychology and economics    Maybe some day we’ll have such models  I don’t know that they exist yet       May I slide a comment in here?  In talking with   people in the New York, London, and Paris financial centers, it’s very, very hard to determine to   what extent they are saying that the uncertainty is geopolitical when it’s really a cover story for   uncertainty about economic issues  It’s absolutely impossible to distinguish between the two    My own view is that people think it’s rather fashionable to say you’re worried about geopolitical   risks—it’s such an eloquent word—when the real fact is that they’re worried very much about   economic developments  The point is that, if all the concerns are geopolitical and we do   something in Iraq and it’s over very successfully, one might think, wow, the economy could take   off  If on the other hand it’s a cover story for concern about the economy, the reaction to a   successful war effort might not be anywhere near as positive  I don’t know how to distinguish   this mix of uncertainty and risk aversion      Exactly     We ought to amplify the charts to show that     Mr Chairman, I move approval of the domestic   operations  Sorry, I almost forgot       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me shift to the   international arena  I think two very important events occurred yesterday that affect which of the   likely Iraq scenarios will play out  One was obviously the State of the Union speech by the   President  The other, which may be equally important, was that President Putin of Russia gave a   clear signal that the Russians are shifting their view  If they do shift, the European powers that   have been giving us a bad time in the United Nations will be faced with becoming irrelevant,   which usually gets their attention  Therefore, I think it is very likely that we will have the one-  month successful war scenario sooner rather than later  As laid out, and I have no dispute with   that, I think that is very good news economically  In my view what this Committee will be   thinking about next year, the year after, and five years from now is what the longer-term effect of   that will be on the Islamic/Arab world  You will recall that in the sixteenth century [laughter]—   SPEAKER(?)  We’re getting on a bit from that period!       The West, after being subservient to a   predominantly and powerful Islamic world, began to modernize  The Islamic world had a choice   of either competing or of retreating into religion and an unwillingness to modernize  That has   continued ever since  Iraq is the seat of civilization as we know it, never mind Islamic   civilization  It is the great intellectual leader of Arab and Islamic thought  A successful war in   Iraq, if it were to bring about a change in Iraq that looks anything like a modern regime, would   have a great shock effect of the rest of the Arab/Islamic world  What we don’t know, first of all,   is whether the change would just involve Saddam being replaced by a more benevolent general,   in which case there would be very little effect     Indeed  That’s exactly where I’m going  If there   is a successful modern regime and there is reform, that would be wonderful  The question is,   Will the reform be benign?  Will it take place over an orderly period of time, therefore allowing   that part of the world to modernize and become a seat of stability and of growth for the world?    Or will we see regimes that simply are not capable of changing and thus will be toppled, in   which case we could have year after year in this Committee a question of what is going to   happen in the oil-producing areas?  I think we have to remember that That’s not going to affect   us for the rest of this year or maybe next year, but it will be a challenge to the Committee over   time   Let me shift to another area, following up on the exchange rate discussion  One of the   things that the dollar’s strength depends on—against the background of a huge, and in my view   unsupportable over time, current account deficit—is whether the people of the world have   confidence in world leadership, which is not completely but very largely American leadership    For whatever reason, our leadership is not providing a very clear view of the way we would like   to see the world economy functioning  Sometimes when that happens, people do some very   unfortunate things     So, my question is to Karen, and it relates to what is going on in South America at the   moment  The International Monetary Fund has decided—their staff was pushed by the member   nations to do something that the staff thinks is unwise, and I agree with them—to reward   Argentina for a violation of the most basic rule of law, which is that one is supposed to pay one’s   debts  Argentina has been rewarded by a rollover of its obligations so it can pretend to be   current with the IMF and other international institutions  At the same time, across the river   Plata, the Uruguayans have been trying very hard to do the right thing—not quite making it but   January 28-29, 2003 92 of 195    certainly putting forth a very good effort  But the IMF has decided that Uruguay may not be able   to pay its debts in a couple of years, so why not have Uruguay declare default now  I might just   add that the econometric models used by the Fund in this analysis have conditions that probably   would make the United States look potentially bankrupt  Put those two cases together  One   country does everything wrong and is rewarded by the IMF saying we’ll roll over your debt  The   other poor little country tries to do everything right—and like the rest of us isn’t perfect—and the   IMF decides that it will not allow them to pay their debts but, in effect, requires them to default    Let’s move slightly north into Lula da Silva’s Brazil  When the international community is   saying to one nation that it’s okay if you don’t pay your debts—and to another that if you try like   the devil to pay your debts and aren’t quite perfect, you should default—why should Brazil jump   through hoops and pay its debts?  They can figure that out  My question is this  Is anybody in   this capital at the International Monetary Fund or anywhere else realizing what I’m convinced is   a signal to all the emerging-market countries that the rules have changed?     Deliberately     The sad part is that it’s exaggerated but factual     Just as a footnote, I think Karen’s answer is what   one would have to say; it’s the right answer  In these countries when you forbear, you appease   the worst of their politicians, and you discourage the ones—they may be somewhere—who are   sensible enough to do the right thing  So the likely next president of Argentina probably is going   to be weaker as a result of this action than he or she would have been if the action had been   tougher  That’s I think the ultimate tragedy   January 28-29, 2003 95 of 195      Governor Gramlich and I had a fascinating   discussion over coffee about the Revolutionary War  I will spare you that conversation   SPEAKER(?)  Which revolution?     The American Revolution     The Second District economy has been mixed but   generally weaker since the last report  The labor market has softened noticeably  Housing   activity has retreated, but manufacturing conditions have improved a bit  Retailers report that   holiday season sales were generally sluggish, marked by very steep discounting but decent unit   sales  Consumer confidence fell to a cyclical low in December  While unemployment rates in   the District were mixed in December, private-sector employment retreated sharply, mainly   reflecting reductions in retail holiday staffing    Sales of both single-family homes and apartments slowed noticeably in the latter part of   the year, but selling prices remained well ahead of a year earlier  In part what I think is going on   is that people are unwilling to accept real prices and therefore are slow to sell  That will have to   January 28-29, 2003 126 of 195    change  New home construction also retreated in October and November but remains at a fairly   high level  Office markets in downstate New York were relatively stable in the fourth quarter   but office vacancy rates in New Jersey and Connecticut continued to escalate  Manufacturers   and purchasing managers report mixed but generally improving conditions in the last few weeks    The state and local governments in the area are considering ways to close sizable budget gaps   projected for the upcoming fiscal year, and they are doing it at this stage with varying degrees of   realism  I mentioned at the last meeting the possibility of a very crippling transit strike  That   fortunately did not take place  Bankers are reporting increased loan demand from commercial   borrowers as well as tighter lending standards on that segment of their business  They also note   a widespread retreat in consumer delinquency rates     On the national picture and the international picture, I am by nature an optimist, and   therefore I am very inclined to think that the Greenbook forecast, with which we largely agree, is   a quite reasonable one and is likely to take place  But we do have an enormous amount of   uncertainty  So the question is, What does the prudent central banker do in an atmosphere of   enormous uncertainty?  It seems to me that one should think very hard, do nothing, and stay   extremely alert  Now, if fortune is kind and the large degree of uncertainty is dissipated, I share   the view that when we begin a policy move it is likely that boldness will be appropriate—more   along the model of January 3, 2001, than the 1994 example  But that is a decision that we will   make appropriately at that time  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I think in an atmosphere of   enormous uncertainty it’s the easiest call in the world to agree with your recommendation, which   I support fully     A lot more attention than the statement would     Perfect draftsmanship     So move     I think what is really happening is that the   management of Freddie Mac—when one discusses this with their chairman it’s very clear— does   March 18, 2003 8 of 101    not want to take as much risk as Fannie does  In my view, however, the market is much too   inclined to see Fannie and Freddie as if they’re two identical companies and their PEs not being   the same is a market imperfection  Obviously there are various factors that can affect the PEs,   but I think it is the case that Freddie is more conservatively run and is not rewarded for it       I think the bottom line is that it’s good judgment   on their part  It just shows that markets are not perfect after all     I move approval of the domestic operations, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our views regarding   the Second District, the national economy, and the international economy are all clouded by   uncertainties  So rather than sharing our confusion about those three subjects, I’d like to talk   about the uncertainty  What we do not know is the degree to which that uncertainty is really   geopolitical  As for a war against Iraq, the near certainty of quick military victory and the   aftermath of a more stable Middle East are the very positive hopes  Unfortunately, the more   conversations I have with people who know about the Middle East, the less certain they are of a   stable aftermath  I think it is almost certain that we’ll be very successful militarily  However,   there is not a single neighboring country of Iraq that can be deemed to be stable, so the shock of   a military attack against their neighbor could bring about very uncertain consequences either   sooner or later  Therefore, I believe that the geopolitical uncertainty is likely to remain     March 18, 2003 27 of 101    In my view, a considerable amount of the uncertainty voiced by American business   leaders in the name of geopolitics is in fact a cover story for their concern about the direction of   the economy  They are not certain whether the consumer will hang in there as we hope he will    They aren’t certain whether it is a good idea to make the business fixed investment decisions that   our forecasts call for  The effect on them of the Enron/Arthur Andersen/WorldCom debacles is   that it is much easier to avoid making decisions than to make them  If you as a business   executive make a decision, even if you happen to be right, the board of directors or shareholders   may deem you to be excessively risk oriented  If you make a decision and it turns out to be   wrong, those very same directors and shareholders can punish you severely  On the other hand,   if you do nothing, you appear to be studious and virtuous  Now, no economy can prosper and no   business can prosper if that degree of caution continues for any extended period of time  But it   doesn’t have to continue for very long to make the downside of our forecast turn out to be likely   One thing that I think could militate against that is if the war is very successful very   quickly, as I think it will be, and if the adverse geopolitical aftermath is later rather than soon and   therefore the situation looks very good for a while  Then I think our President, with his rather   remarkable leadership skills, could turn those skills to the economy, and we could see a burst of   confidence stemming from the notion that somebody is really in charge  If you’ve been in   charge and have just won a war, that shows formidable leadership  I think that could well   happen, and obviously by mentioning it, I rather hope it does     In the midst of all this uncertainty what does a prudent central banker do?  It seems to me   that a prudent central banker thinks a lot, does nothing, talks as little as possible, and makes it   very clear that the central bank is very attentive and ready to take action when and if required    Thank you   March 18, 2003 28 of 101      If you go down and look, there could be two   openings on the Committee [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, I assume that what you are   recommending is that we do nothing today, that we have no balance of risk statement, and that   we remain very alert to developments  Assuming that’s what you are recommending, I’m fully   in favor of it     The idea is to have the possibility but not the   certainty of a move; otherwise the market will be waiting every morning for us to have a   meeting     Mr Chairman, the present Manager of the System   Open Market Account and I, as a previous Manager, are absolutely in agreement with you  We   cannot peg an intermediate rate  It would be very, very dangerous to try to do that     I’d suggest weekly       I agree   March 18, 2003 82 of 101      That does it     Bravo!     Mr Chairman, I fully agree with your analysis of   the possible need for an intermeeting move and your judgment that we simply don’t know   enough at this stage to determine whether that will be necessary or not  I do believe, though, that   your analysis of the situation is right on     That really wasn’t worth repeating!     Thank you, Mr Chairman  When I discussed this   with you before it became public, I asked you whether you thought I was taking leave of my   senses to accept this position, and it’s true that I may be  But when Bill Donaldson started to talk   to me about it, he was able to invoke two of my character traits—my puritanism on some issues   and my patriotism streak  So I decided, rather than take it easy or make lots of money   somewhere, that I would respond to the call of public service again  And I must say that I’m   looking forward to the challenge and to continuing to work with all of you, if not as a member of   the Fed team anymore     Mr Chairman, I’ll be very brief  The mood in the   Second District is very much related to what is going on in financial markets and financial firms    Usually reliable sources say that the global settlements with the financial firms regarding their   research conflicts of interest may occur very soon and that the global settlement on Enron will   take place perhaps a week later  That will remove the fog of uncertainty very substantially in   this District, and I think the attitude of the investment houses and the commercial banks will be,   Let’s get this behind us and go back to doing our business with a more optimistic mood  That   certainly will help the District and probably will help the national mood as well         Mr Chairman, Bill McDonough here  I think that   is very wise The likelihood of our needing to have meetings for the next two weeks is very low,   and I believe we ought to go into May 6 with our eyes very wide open to our responsibilities   then     So moved     May I make a comment?  I think the general Street   talk in New York is that, since the Mexicans have been the most vehemently opposed to CACs,   their going first was rather statesmanlike—especially since they didn’t pay anything for   including the CAC  The Brazilians went next, but there’s a big question as to whether less high   quality borrowers would not have to pay a premium for the CAC  I think the real answer is that   we don’t know yet, though it’s clearly the question     Move approval of domestic operations       Move approval   SPEAKER(?)  Second     Dave, you mentioned that there was a very   considerable spread between the OMB and the CBO forecasts of defense expenditures in the   second and third quarters  The big variable in defense expenditures clearly has to be the speed   with which the armaments that were used in Iraq are restored  By this time the Defense   Department would have had to place most of the orders if the expenditures are going to be costed   in the second and third quarters  This is a factual question, but I would assume that, given a   difference between the CBO and the OMB forecasts, OMB is more likely to be right because   they are part of the Administration  You mentioned that the OMB numbers were more   aggressive than your own forecast, I think     Ah, I had it backwards  How much weaker would   your forecast be if OMB is correct?     But that would add to my view that they called the   Defense Department and got the facts       Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second District   economy has shown scattered signs of improvement since my last report  But generally most   sectors can still be characterized as weak  Employment and labor force indicators have been   mixed with little change overall, as labor markets have remained slack  Manufacturers note   some improvement in business conditions in recent weeks and are increasingly optimistic about   the near-term outlook  Retailers reports that sales remained below plan in March but picked up   somewhat in early April  Based on two separate surveys, consumer confidence has improved   moderately since the last report  Housing permits weakened in the first quarter as the slowdown   May 6, 2003 57 of 115    in single-family construction more than offset increases in apartment construction  Sales of   existing single-family homes and apartments slowed noticeably, though selling prices have   remained firm except at the high end of the market  Demand for office space in the New York   City area continued to slacken in the first quarter, and District banks reported increased demand   for home mortgages and steady-to-lower delinquency rates     I find myself so in agreement with Governor Kohn’s remarks that I would just like to add   some very small, almost footnotes to them On the geopolitical uncertainty, I’ve argued at   previous meetings that the Middle East is basically an unstable place and, therefore, that the   geopolitical uncertainty is likely to continue but will be different  As for the likelihood of Iraq   stabilizing into a model democracy, it could well happen; but if it does, it will happen slowly and   there will be many bumps along the road  The possibility of instability in some of Iraq’s   neighboring countries is quite high, and therefore I think it is likely that we will live in an   environment of continuing geopolitical uncertainty  What one doesn’t know is whether the   American people and those in other nations will react the way they did to terrorism—that is, to   accept it as a fact of life and learn to live a reasonably normal life with normal economic   reactions despite that reality     As for risk aversion, I think it is likely to continue  But risk aversion is a psychological   condition and is rather similar to an oversold trading position  If half a dozen of the most   respected business executives in America suddenly turn openly optimistic, I think the possibility   of others following is quite high  Whether that will happen, I don’t know  But the nature of the   American society is that one would expect that to happen, with the timing being difficult to   guess     May 6, 2003 58 of 115    I think the main thing we have to cope with today is the reality of the marketplace  After   a period of substantial volatility in the equity market, the recent upturn in the market impresses   me as something other than just an extra bit of volatility  It has at least the makings of a   breakout, but it is a rather unstable and very uncertain one  In the debt markets, as has been   discussed, spreads have narrowed, but they’re still broad by historical standards, and that too is a   rather tentative movement  The dollar weakness has continued; today the euro is at about   11350  I think we have to be careful about the move into the euro as the currency of choice,   with growing speculative long positions in the euro  That could turn into something that would   not be very pretty to watch—that is, a dollar that is weakening far beyond what the   macroeconomic fundamentals would indicate     But last and perhaps far more important, there is absolutely no sense in the marketplace   that we are going to change policy today  Even though a week ago I thought that changing   policy today would have quite a lot to say for it, I believe it would be very, very dangerous to   surprise the market in light of the precariousness of its recent strengthening  I think the   immediate reaction of market observers would be to ask, What does the Fed know that we don’t   know?  The answer to that is “nothing”  So it seems to me that the prudent central banker would   think very seriously and decide that policy should stay where it is  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman I support the   recommendation of no change in the fed funds rate, and I further support the reasoning behind it   as evidenced by the statement you have distributed     If not in seven weeks!     I don’t share that view because, if we take out that   sentence, we in effect divorce ourselves from the previous form of the statement before we have   an opportunity to discuss it adequately at our next meeting     As do I
