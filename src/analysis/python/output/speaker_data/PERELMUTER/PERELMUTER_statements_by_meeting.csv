7378,2004-09-21,"  No  This situation has arisen only around the FOMC meetings; it   is just in the maintenance period encompassing a meeting when this sort of activity begins  In   the previous period of this intermeeting interval we were, as you know, close to the 1½ percent   objective  But as soon as we got into the current maintenance period on Thursday, banks began   trying to build up reserves and to buy them cheaply  That’s all people are saying  And they   figure we’re managing reserves to meet demand  "
8153,2008-03-10,"  Thanks, Bill  Should the Committee approve the proposal   for the TSLF, we intend to announce tomorrow to the public the total program size  envisioned as of today—as Bill mentioned, up to $200 billion  It will consist of  $100 billion against pledges of OMO-eligible collateral and $100 billion against  pledges of TSLF-eligible collateral beyond the OMO-eligible  Together the two  tranches will be comparable in size to the TAF program plus the recently announced  28-day single tranche RPs      March 10, 2008 7 of 39    For an immediate impact, we are thinking about auctioning $50 billion in each of  the tranches at the outset, with the first auction occurring during the week of March  24  Specifically, the plan is to hold separate 28-day auctions for each main category  of collateral in successive weeks with our primary dealer counterparties  We will  auction the first tranche against pledges of OMO-eligible collateral on Thursday,  March 27, to settle the following day (T+1) and to mature 28 days hence, and we will  auction the second tranche against pledges of the non-OMO-eligible collateral on the  following Thursday, April 3, also for T+1 and for a period of 28 days  The auctions  will be held at 200 pm and will close at 230 pm with results posted shortly  thereafter  We plan to auction in this pattern, each Thursday, alternating between the  two collateral tranches for the duration of the facility       The auctions will be based on a fee rate, in a bonds-versus-bonds construct  It is   similar to our daily securities lending operations, and it is very familiar to our primary  dealers  The fee rate bid will represent the spread, in basis points, between the cost of  28-day financing of general collateral Treasury securities and the cost of 28-day  financing of the respective basket of collateral in the respective tranche  As with the  TAF auctions and our daily securities lending operations, a minimum fee will be set  by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the collateral tranches ahead of  each auction  The fee will be set by a competitive single-priced auction process in  which the accepted dealer bids will be awarded at the same fee rate, which shall be  the lowest fee rate at which bids were accepted  Similar to our temporary open  market operations, haircuts for the OMO-eligible collateral pledged will be the same,  given that the facility is open to the same set of counterparties—the primary  dealers—and the collateral in this tranche is identical  In addition, the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York will use the services of the major clearing banks, BONY  and JPMorgan Chase, and all transfers of collateral will be made through the  borrower’s clearing bank account  This is how we do things for our open market  operations     Overall, the terms and conditions are similar to those of the TAF auctions in the   following ways  There will be a 28-day fixed fee determined via a single-price  centralized auction  The TSLF will have a minimum fee rate, and settlement will be  forward settling  The term of operation will be 28 days except for holiday conflicts   The TSLF will have a minimum bid amount ($10 million as opposed to $5 million in  the TAF)  The maximum number of bids per participant will be two  The total  propositions for each bid submitted and the total award may not exceed a specified  percentage of the announced offering amount  We are contemplating a 20 percent  limit per dealer  If a participant ceases to qualify for the TSLF (if it is no longer a  primary dealer, for instance), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York may accelerate  the unwinding of the loan, making the return of any pledged collateral immediately  due     The main differences between the TAF and the TSLF are as follows  They   involve different sets of counterparties  The TAF provides direct funds, and the  TSLF will provide securities  A different range of collateral is accepted  The TSLF   March 10, 2008 8 of 39    is limited to OMO-eligible collateral and AAA non-agency residential-mortgage- backed securities  We expect to assess higher haircuts on non-OMO-eligible  collateral as loans will be to the primary dealers and not to depository institutions   Overall we expect haircuts to be higher than those in normal times but lower than  those in extremis  The haircuts on non-OMO-eligible collateral are expected to be  higher than those on OMO-eligible collateral     We expect to develop the terms and conditions of the TSLF more precisely after   consultation with the primary dealers and the clearing banks  Should the Committee  approve the proposal this evening, we expect these conversations to begin shortly  following the announcement  Thank you     "
8248,2008-07-24,"  Thanks, Bill  We will propose auctioning the options in   two $25 billion offerings  This will allow dealers to adjust their bidding behavior in  response to the first auction results  The first TSLF options program (TOP) auction is  currently anticipated during the week of September 1 for the option to lock in TSLF  financing over the September quarter-end  We expect to hold the second auction two  weeks later  These auctions will be in addition to our ongoing TSLF auction cycle   Thus, there will be two TSLF schedule 2 auctions totaling $125 billion and another  two TSLF schedule 1 auctions totaling $50 billion that will also span quarter-end   The plan is to hold TOP auctions against schedule 2 collateral in weeks on either side  of the two regular TSLF schedule 2 auctions during the months ahead of quarter-ends  or year-ends  The first of these auctions would be for $25 billion  If that auction is  undersubscribed, we intend to add the unused option authorization to the second  auction two weeks later        July 24, 2008 6 of 50    Each auction will offer the option for dealers to borrow general collateral  Treasury securities against pledges of TSLF schedule 2 collateral, which includes  AAA-rated private-label residential and commercial MBS and ABS, agency CMOs,  and the basket of collateral already eligible for our regular open market operations   Our initial recommendation is for the options to have a one-week duration spanning  the month-end and a strike price of 25 basis points, annualized  The strike price  represents the lending fee that the dealer is willing to pay to borrow general collateral  Treasury securities against pledges of their choice of schedule 2 collateral  This fee  concept is very familiar to the dealers participating in both the TSLF auction program  and the Desk’s regular daily securities lending auction  The 25 basis point strike  price for the TOP correlates to the minimum fee already in force that dealers can bid  in the regular 28-day TSLF schedule 2 auctions       Dealers will bid for these options by specifying the quantity of TSLF options they   demand and the price or premium they are willing to pay for the set maturity loan at  the set lending fee  As with the TAF and the TSLF, a minimum bidding premium  level will be set  We are recommending a minimum bid of 1 basis point with bidding  increments of 01 basis point  Volume parameters will be similar to those of the  TSLF—a $10 million minimum with a maximum of 20 percent of the auction size for  any one dealer  We expect that auctions will be held in the afternoons with results  posted very shortly after the auctions close  The premium that each dealer will pay  will be determined by the competitive single-price auction process, in which the  accepted dealer bids will be awarded at the same premium, which shall be the price at  which the last bid was accepted  The options will not be transferable between  dealers  Dealers who have received awards in the auction will have to notify the New  York Fed at least one day before the exercise date if they wish to enter into the TSLF  loan  Dealers may also let the options expire unexercised at no cost beyond the  premium paid at auction  All haircuts, collateral eligibility, and settlement  conventions will be the same for the TOP as they are for the TSLF  As Bill noted  earlier, and consistent with how the program parameters were developed for the  TSLF program, we expect to develop more precisely the terms and conditions of the  TOP after consultation with the primary dealers  Should the Committee approve the  proposal this afternoon, we expect these conversations to begin shortly after the  announcement next week  Thank you  Please let me turn the floor over to Sandy  Krieger to discuss the TAF maturity extension proposal       You will also be bidding at a premium, so it will cost you to lock   that in    The options also are for a shorter maturity, so you can lock in for   the days surrounding the stress date rather than need to have it outstanding for 28 days  So this is   another opportunity to manage your risk just around those dates  "
