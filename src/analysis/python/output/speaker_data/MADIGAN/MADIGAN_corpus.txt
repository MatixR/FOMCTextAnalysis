 Certainly, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package labeled,  "Material for Staff Briefing on Annual Ranges" [Statement--see Appendix]  Given our methodology for forecasting, I think that really is a  question about how confident we are that nominal GDP growth would behave as projected in the  Greenbook We forecast money demand by looking at growth rates of nominal GDP, making an  adjustment for projected movements in opportunity costs consistent with any changes in interest  rates Obviously, the staff could be wrong, and one source of error in projecting money demand  or money growth would be our assessment of the likely growth in nominal GDP that would be  consistent with a 5-1/4 percent funds rate Another source would be errors in projecting money    2/4-5/97  demand itself, given a forecast for nominal GDP and interest rates Clearly, we are still very  uncertain at this point on that score  Yes Certainly in the steady state, if you will, when price stability  is achieved we would not see a 5-1/4 percent nominal federal funds rate as consistent with that  outcome I guess the question relates partly to what federal funds rate path will take us to a  steady state with price stability Chart 2 in the Bluebook presented one scenario where we gave  what we consider to be our best shot at projecting that sort of interest rate path That involved,  as you know, a considerable increase in the nominal and real federal funds rates over the next  year or two and then a reduction in the nominal funds rate as inflation came down   Yes, Virgil Mattingly says it is    This briefing provides background for your review of the  ranges for money and debt for 1999 and your decision regarding provisional  ranges for 2000 I’ll be referring to the charts and tables from the Bluebook that  have been distributed separately to you this morning in a package labeled “Staff  Presentation on Money and Debt Ranges” 3/   Last February, the FOMC reaffirmed the growth ranges for 1999 that were  chosen provisionally one year ago 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3,  and 3 to 7 percent for domestic nonfinancial sector debt, shown in Chart 1 The  Humphrey-Hawkins report in February noted the FOMC’s continued uncertainty  regarding appropriate rates of money growth in the intermediate term and stated  that the Committee intended the monetary ranges to be benchmarks for growth  under conditions of price stability, sustainable economic growth, and historical  velocity relationships In addition, the report pointed out that the monetary  aggregates could exceed their ranges during 1999   As shown in the top panel of the chart, M2 has indeed been running above  its range so far this year, with growth through June at a 6¼ percent annual rate  M3 growth for the year to date has been about 6 percent at an annual rate, just at  the top of its range Debt, by contrast, has been comfortably within its range   The relatively rapid expansion of M2 this year importantly reflects the  brisk pace of nominal income growth In addition, it has mirrored a further  decline in V2, shown by the solid line in the top panel of Chart 2 To a small  degree, the decline in V2 over the first half of this year probably was a lagged  response to the drop in opportunity cost--the dashed line in the upper panel--late  in 1998 following the easings of monetary policy In the middle panel, the lower  solid line, labeled “Fit from 1959Q2 to 1989Q4,” shows the historical  association between opportunity cost--the horizontal axis--and V2, the vertical  axis Points corresponding to the experience over the period since mid-1994 are  shown in the box and are repeated in magnified form in the lower panel That  scatterplot suggests that the demand for M2 may retain an interest sensitivity  somewhat similar to that apparent in earlier decades   Since its peak in mid-1997, however, V2 has dropped considerably while  this measure of opportunity cost has changed little on net We can’t pin down the  reasons for the downtrend, but it seems reasonable to suspect that wealth may be  playing a role Large stock market gains have boosted wealth but have left  portfolios skewed toward equities As investors, in response, have diversified  some of their wealth into other assets, such as deposits and money fund shares,   3 / A copy of the material used by Mr Madigan is appended to the transcript (Appendix 3)     6/29-30/99 62   M2 has been growing more quickly than nominal income Nonetheless,  econometric studies have not identified a clear role for wealth in M2 demand, and  considerable uncertainty continues to surround the determinants of M2   Chart 3 shows the velocity of M3 in the upper panel and the velocity of  debt in the lower panel In 1999 V3 has continued to drop at a pace a bit quicker  than its trend from 1960 to 1985 The velocity of debt has remained roughly flat,  as was the case before the mid-1980s   Table 1 summarizes the staff projections for 1999 and 2000 As shown in  the third column, M2 is projected to expand 6 percent over 1999, outpacing the  5¼ percent gain in nominal income forecast by the staff in the Greenbook and the  similar central tendency of income growth in your own forecasts The projected  decline in V2 reflects an assumption of continued, albeit diminishing, portfolio  influences and a small boost to M2 demand from Y2K concerns These effects  are partly offset by the assumed tightening of monetary policy this year Next  year, M2 growth is expected to slow further to 5 percent, owing in part to the  deceleration in nominal income, which is anticipated by your own forecasts as  well as the Greenbook A reversal of the Y2K effects and the continued fading of  the portfolio effect on money demand, given the projected leveling-out of the  stock market, also contribute to M2’s expected deceleration   M3, the second line of the third column, is forecast to expand 6¼ percent  this year The sharp slowing from last year’s pace of nearly 11 percent mainly  reflects a steep drop-off in bank credit growth after the surge that resulted from  last year’s market turmoil Next year, M3 growth is seen as edging off to 6  percent, with the effects of the deceleration in M2 being partly offset by a  strengthening in bank funding needs as bank credit picks up some   Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand 5½ percent in  1999 and 4¼ percent next year, about in line with nominal income The  contraction in federal debt steepens, owing to the widening budget surplus, while  nonfederal debt expands briskly, again outpacing nominal income, although it  does slow   Table 2, on the following page, shows the two sets of ranges for money  and debt presented in the Bluebook for Committee consideration Both sets were  developed under the presumption that the Committee would wish to retain its  current, long-run price-stability rationale for the monetary ranges and the current  projection rationale for the debt range   Under Alternative I, the Committee would keep the existing ranges for  1999 The ranges for M2 and M3 under this alternative are centered on growth  rates that would likely prevail under conditions of price stability and historically  typical velocity behavior, with a trend in potential GDP more in line with  performance earlier in this decade--before the apparent recent improvements in     6/29-30/99 63   productivity growth For instance, the M2 range of 1 to 5 percent under  Alternative I would be consistent with potential real GDP growth of 2½ percent,  the staff estimate of ½ percentage point bias in inflation measured using the GDP  deflator, no true inflation, and flat V2 Under this alternative, the same monetary  ranges presumably would carry over to next year since the underlying  assumptions would be unchanged   By contrast, the monetary ranges for Alternative II are designed to be  consistent with an expectation that the stronger productivity gains of the past year  or so will persist, with implications for more rapid growth in potential GDP The  M2 range of 2 to 6 percent could be roughly consistent with potential GDP  growth of 3¼ percent, as in the Greenbook, the staff estimate of ½ percentage  point bias in inflation using the GDP deflator, near price stability, and flat V2   For domestic nonfinancial sector debt, the Committee has not applied the  price-stability rationale but instead has selected a range that has been  approximately centered on its expected growth Consistent with this approach,  both alternatives propose ranges for debt that are roughly centered on staff  projections With the staff forecasting debt growth for this year of 5½ percent,  the existing 3 to 7 percent range would still be approximately centered on the  expected outcome Given the staff’s projection of a slowdown in debt growth  next year to 4¼ percent, the Committee might want to consider reducing the debt  range to 2 to 6 percent on a provisional basis for 2000 as proposed in both  alternatives As it happens, such a range would be the same as one based on price  stability considerations under the assumption of more rapid growth in potential  GDP that is the basis for the Alternative II monetary ranges     As background for this briefing, I have distributed two charts   from the Bluebook in a package entitled “Material for Staff Presentation on Monetary   Policy Alternatives” 3/         The baseline scenario, shown by the solid lines in chart 4, used the key  elements of the staff’s view of the macroeconomy to extend the Greenbook  forecast through 2005  Under this baseline, and in contrast to those shown  in Bluebooks in recent years, monetary conditions are seen as already  relatively close to those that, over time, would foster sustainable economic  growth  In effect, the real funds rate is now estimated to be very close to its  long-run equilibrium value--the rate that eventually would result in no  output gap and stable inflation  The FOMC is assumed to reduce the  nominal federal funds rate slightly further--another 25 basis points at this  meeting--and then to hold that rate over the forecast period  As shown in  the upper right-hand panel, the real funds rate eases somewhat more over the  balance of this year because short-term inflation expectations, as proxied by  four-quarter inflation in the core PCE shown in the lower panel, edge up a  few tenths over 2001  These lower real short rates help cushion the negative  shock that the economy currently is experiencing  Nonetheless, the  unemployment rate, the middle panel, rises over the course of this year to  nearly 5-1/4 percent  Still, core inflation declines only very gradually over  the next few years because the effective NAIRU edges up over time  This  occurs because the catch-up of wage gains to previous productivity  increases, as those increases level out, brings the restraining effects on  inflation of the previous acceleration in productivity to an end          The other scenarios depicted in chart 4 focus on two major supply-side  uncertainties--the level of the NAIRU and prospects for productivity  The  dot-dash line assumes, in contrast to the staff’s view, that the current 4  percent unemployment rate is sustainable  The dotted line portrays the  much less appealing possibility, discussed by Dave Stockton yesterday, that  productivity growth soon reverts to its 1973 to 1994 average of about 1-1/2  percent, rather than remaining at the 3 percent rate of the baseline  In both  cases, monetary policy operating under a Taylor rule would ease  But the        __________________  3/  A copy of  “Material for Staff Presentation on Monetary Policy Alternatives” is                                  appended to this transcript  (Appendix 3)       1/30-31/01 171  Committee’s choices are considerably more attractive under the 4 percent   NAIRU scenario than in the baseline or in the productivity slowdown   scenario  Here we have assumed that the Committee opts to take the  windfall partly in lower unemployment than in the baseline--the dot-dash  line in the middle panel--and partly in lower inflation, the lower panel  With  structural productivity continuing to grow strongly, the estimated long-run  equilibrium real funds rate is about unchanged from its roughly 4 percent  baseline level, but the actual real funds rate can run well below this value for  the next few years to foster the spending consistent with the higher  sustainable path of output  Achieving that track for the real funds rate  requires a considerable reduction in the nominal funds rate--to nearly 4-1/2  percent by the end of next year--before tightening after that          Chart 5 shifts the focus from the supply side to the demand side of the  economy  The dot-dash line portrays a situation in which final spending is  temporarily weaker than in the baseline, pushing the economy into a  recession this year  The Taylor rule calls for aggressive easing, with the  funds rate declining to 4-1/2 percent by the fourth quarter as unemployment  rises steeply to about 6 percent  Inflation, after initially edging higher  because of weakness in the dollar, eventually drops below the baseline   Ultimately, though, with underlying productivity growth remaining strong,  the real funds rate needs to be returned to its estimated long-run equilibrium  value--a little above 4 percent          The dotted lines, by contrast, assume that the stalling in output that is  currently evident is due entirely to the desire of businesses to adjust  inventories rather than to persistent weakness in final demands, which  rebound promptly in the second quarter  The upshot is a growth pause  In  this case, the Taylor rule, which looks at the current output gap rather than  the situation likely to prevail in the future, still calls for an easing in the  funds rate to 5-3/4 percent in the current quarter  It then reverses course  fairly quickly as pressures on resources remain intense and as policy needs  to adjust to the permanently higher equilibrium real rate that results from  stronger spending propensities than in the baseline  Even with the tighter  policy, policy does not succeed completely in capping inflation near current  levels during the simulation period          Market prices suggest that investors see a different economic outlook  than the one portrayed in the baseline  In particular, futures quotes now  reveal expectations that you will cut the funds rate to nearly 4-1/2 percent  this year, before beginning to firm policy in 2002, and longer-term yields do  not indicate concern on the part of investors that such a policy course will  produce heightened inflationary pressures  Apparently, many investors  subscribe to some combination of the low NAIRU possibility explored on  the previous chart and the potential for appreciable economic weakness  assumed in chart 5     1/30-31/01 172         Market quotes and surveys suggest that investors, consistent with this  economic outlook, anticipate that you will cut the funds rate by at least 50  basis points today--with a few apparently seeing the possibility of a 75 basis  point move--and state that the risks remain weighted toward economic  weakness  Consequently, the 25 basis point action of alternative A, even if  it were accompanied by the anticipated balance of risks statement, would  likely lead to a sharp selloff in financial markets         Nonetheless, the Committee may see benefits from this course, especially  if you think that market interest rates probably exaggerate the degree of  monetary ease that will ultimately be consistent with sustainable growth and  stable inflation  Taking account of the usual lags in the effects of policy, the  more accommodative financial conditions that would evolve from action  now would have little effect on near-term weakness as inventories are  adjusted  Indeed, the bulk of its effects may be felt when the weakness has  already passed and when fiscal expansion measures may just be coming on  line, with the combination potentially providing excessive stimulus to  spending         But, as was evident from your discussion yesterday, many Committee  members see good reasons for choosing the stronger, 50 basis point action  of alternative A  Even if you view the staff outlook as the most likely  outcome, many of you clearly put substantial weight on the possibility that  the economy could turn out to be appreciably weaker  Such weakness could  be prompted by any number of factors, such as deteriorating confidence, on  which you received another reading yesterday  But it could be exacerbated  by a substantially larger-than-expected negative response in financial  markets to a more measured policy action, resulting in a substantial further  pullback in risk-taking  That could involve a selloff in the stock market, a  widening of spreads in the open markets, and additional stringency in loan  terms and standards at financial intermediaries  Moreover, a sense that the  staff may be too pessimistic about the sustainable degree of labor market  tightness would suggest that inflationary pressures going forward could  remain relatively subdued even with the added stimulus from more  aggressive action at this meeting and consequently stronger aggregate  demand  This, and the fact that inflation expectations evidently have  remained reasonably well anchored, may be seen as giving the Federal  Reserve scope for decisive action to shore up spending and output, and even  to front-load such action to help safeguard against cumulating weakness          With regard to the balance of risks sentence, investors anticipate that a  50 basis point move today would be accompanied by a statement that the  risks remain weighted toward economic weakness  Such an assessment  would seem justified, even after a 50 basis point reduction, by the lack of  firm evidence that growth has stabilized, much less begun to rebound, and     1/30-31/01 173  by a sense that inflation pressures are more likely to abate than intensify if  demands remain weak  A statement instead that risks were balanced would  surprise market participants, who, as noted, seem to be anticipating nearly  100 basis points of further easing this year even after a 1/2 percentage point  action today  Markets would probably sell off in response as prices adjusted  to the prospect of a much flatter trajectory for the funds rate  If the FOMC  announced that it saw the risks as still weighted toward weakness, any  immediate reaction would probably be muted, although it seems more likely  to be a bit negative than positive, given the perceived possibility of a 75  basis point move today  There is a chance that such a statement could  condition markets to rally sharply further in the event of apparently weak  economic data  The wording of the announcement could help make clear  that, although the FOMC might see the risks as still skewed toward  weakness, it remained optimistic about longer-term prospects and  recognized that considerable stimulus was now in the pipeline  The  Chairman, of course, also will have the opportunity in the semiannual  monetary policy testimony to temper market perceptions should they evolve  in a way inconsistent with the Committee’s objectives     2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the table and  chart labeled “Material for Monetary Policy Briefing”  As background for your  policy decision today, I thought it might be useful to review in a bit more detail how  market participants reacted to your decisions at the November meeting  On the eve of  that meeting, a small minority of investors anticipated no change in the stance of  policy, most looked for a 25 basis point easing, and some expected a larger move   Survey results suggested that market participants were essentially unanimous that you  would retain a balance of risks toward weakness, and market yields appeared to  incorporate expectations that you would reduce rates by a cumulative 50 basis points  by early next year   Thus, the announcement of an immediate 50 basis point move and a shift to   balanced risks surprised market participants  As shown in line 1, column 5, of the    2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                              December 10, 2002 68 of 87  first exhibit, over the afternoon of the announcement, the expected fed funds rate for  the month of December dropped 14 basis points  Column 4, lines 4 through 6,  indicates that Treasury coupon yields declined modestly in the first few minutes after  the announcement, and equity prices, line 7, increased a fraction of a percent  Bond  yields then apparently reacted to the advance in equities and the implied spur to  activity by more than reversing their previous declines, and Treasury coupon rates  finished the afternoon actually up a bit, column 5   Market participants seemed somewhat divided on how to interpret the risk  assessment  Policy expectations derived from the February fed funds contract, line 3,  should not have been contaminated by turn-of-the-year effects, unlike those for  December and January, and the 118 percent value derived from the February contract  seems to imply that markets on the whole did not take the assessment as indicating  that the easing cycle necessarily had ended   Over the next few weeks, economic reports and news bearing on earnings boosted  investors’ spirits, and longer-term policy expectations, indexed in exhibit 2 by the  expected funds rate for August—the dotted line—moved higher on balance  Over the  past ten or so days, however, investors saw the news as more downbeat  As a result,  equity prices most recently have declined, leaving broad indexes off about 2 percent  on the period and pulling policy expectations back down  On the positive side, as a  number of you have noted, credit spreads have fallen considerably and liquidity in  bond markets has increased, sparking a pickup in corporate issuance  Thus, your  November action could be judged as having contributed to a modest net improvement  in financial market conditions   With that improvement and the outlook for the economy not too different on  balance from that just after your November easing, market participants all but  unanimously expect that you will keep the stance of policy unchanged today  And a  large majority reportedly think you will again judge the risks to be balanced  A  policy decision consistent with those expectations could be justified in terms of an  economic outlook similar to that of the Greenbook  The Committee might find the  gradual increase in resource utilization and the modest decline in core inflation in that  forecast credible and appealing  And even if it preferred a faster decline in  unemployment, it might be skeptical about its ability to calibrate an additional dose of  stimulus to achieve the desired small boost to growth and not much more, given the  uncertainties about underlying trends and the amount of stimulus still in the pipeline   At the same time, the Committee might find the risks around that forecast still to  be about roughly balanced, perhaps with the possibility of greater fiscal stimulus that  President Minehan and others noted offsetting the downside risks stemming from  geopolitical threats Or, as noted in the Bluebook, it might see the current stance of  policy as roughly balancing the low odds but high costs of marked further disinflation  accompanied by economic weakness against the arguably higher odds but lower costs  of an unexpected overshoot of growth and inflation  Even if the Committee has a  somewhat stronger outlook than the staff—which, based on your comments today,                       December 10, 2002 69 of 87  appears not to be the case—it might find holding to its policy stance for a while   longer to be warranted, given the likely persistence of slack for at least several   quarters    If the Committee conversely is of the view that the outlook remains a bit too  weak, it might choose to ease policy another quarter point at this meeting  While  credit market conditions have improved on net over the intermeeting period, the  improvement has been modest and perhaps less than would have been anticipated in  view of the November policy move  And although the acceleration in activity in the  Greenbook is plausible, as was noted it is still largely a forecast  Moreover, the  pickup is rather gradual, and some slack remains even two years hence  The resulting  continued decline in inflation could constrain the Committee’s ability to engineer  lower real interest rates should a negative shock at some point require another  aggressive easing of policy The Committee might prefer to preserve a somewhat  greater inflation buffer and make faster progress against economic slack by easing  policy again   A policy adjustment at this meeting, of course, would surprise market  participants A 25 basis point move could feed through almost fully to other short- term rates, especially if investors extrapolated the two consecutive policy actions   The response of bond yields is difficult to predict, but an increase could not be ruled  out if equity markets rally, as was the case following the November move  Of course,  leaving the stance of monetary policy unchanged, with a statement of balanced risks,  would be right in line with participants’ expectations, and market prices probably  would change little in response As always, market participants will be looking  carefully at the wording of the announcement for clues about the Committee’s  outlook Thank you, Mr Chairman   Your first question relates to why the baseline assumption for   monetary policy was chosen I’ll pass to Dave Stockton for that   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  labeled “Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which was distributed during the  break  The sharp rise in market interest rates was, without a doubt, the major                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   August 12, 2003 67 of 110    development in financial markets over the intermeeting period  As shown in the top  left-hand panel of your first exhibit, yields on ten-year Treasuries and other high- grade bonds generally climbed about 110 basis points on balance  The increase took  place amid considerable volatility, the right-hand panel  As Dino noted, the steep  advance in yields triggered a cascade of portfolio adjustments, including in particular  a large volume of hedging transactions by mortgage investors, and the volume of  those transactions and the high degree of volatility briefly took a toll on liquidity in a  number of fixed-income markets  The stresses were particularly visible in a spike in  swap spreads, the middle left-hand panel, but market functioning has improved  considerably in the past few days     One potentially significant development is the substantial increase in   compensation that bond investors require for inflation, the solid and dotted lines in  the middle right-hand panel  However, the most recent results from the Michigan  survey, shown in the inset, suggest no pickup in households’ longer-term inflation  expectations and, in fact, indicate some further decline in their anticipated short-term  inflation rates  As shown in the bottom panel, the sharp increase in yields over the  intermeeting period to an important degree represented a reversal of a considerable  decline over the previous period, as a number of you mentioned earlier  The recent  run-up in rates, while sparked by Federal Reserve words and actions, also reflected  incoming corporate earnings reports that were better than anticipated, some of the  economic data releases, and perhaps the news that the federal deficit was widening  substantially  Thus rates are now higher than they were in early May     The reversal in market sentiment showed through clearly in expectations for   monetary policy  As indicated by the dotted line in the top left-hand panel in your  next exhibit, just before your last meeting many investors apparently anticipated that  the funds rate would be eased to 75 basis points before long and that the rate would  remain low for an extended period of time  By contrast, the solid line suggests that  markets now think you probably will begin to firm policy next spring  Although the  direction of the revision is not surprising, its extent may be  And the fact that markets  see tightening as commencing in less than a year apparently indicates that they see the  expected rebound in growth as potentially leading directly to inflationary pressures  without much of a role for a persistent output gap in determining price changes      The top right-hand panel provides additional information about market   participants’ expectations for your policy stance in the near term  According to a  survey conducted by the Desk, all twenty-two primary dealers anticipate that you will  leave the target for the federal funds rate unchanged at today’s meeting  Sixteen  expect that the risk assessment will also be unchanged—that you will again see  balanced risks to sustainable growth, downside risks to inflation, and downside risks  overall  Four seem to think that you will shift your view of the risks to growth to the  downside, while two believe that you will move to a judgment that the two  components, as well as the overall assessment, are balanced        August 12, 2003 68 of 110    The market’s view of the likely course of monetary policy contrasts with the  Greenbook assumption that you will keep the funds rate at 1 percent through 2004   As David Wilcox discussed earlier, the staff forecasts that such a policy stance, in  combination with the monetary and fiscal stimulus that is either in place or coming on  line, should result in a considerable acceleration of aggregate demand  However,  because the staff also projects continued strong expansion of productivity and hence  aggregate supply, an output gap lingers throughout the projection period  That leaves  the civilian unemployment rate at 55 percent at the end of 2004—a touch higher than  in the June projection—and brings core PCE inflation to a tad below 1 percent next  year     Some discomfort with that higher track of unemployed resources is the first of   three basic arguments outlined in the middle left-hand panel that might support an  inclination to ease policy at this meeting  Even if you find the Greenbook forecast to  be credible, you might prefer to pursue more-rapid gains against economic slack— and, perhaps, to increase slightly the inflation buffer in view of concerns about the  zero bound to nominal interest rates  A FRB/US simulation not reported in the  Greenbook indicates that a 25 basis point lower path for the federal funds rate would  boost GDP growth ¼ percentage point over 2004  Also, even if you view the  Greenbook outcome as acceptable, you might want a little more insurance that it will  eventuate  Second, you might be concerned that aggregate demand could turn out to  be weaker than in the staff forecast, perhaps because of a larger impact of the recent  advance in long rates than in the Greenbook, or because the expected, and seemingly  emerging, brightening of business sentiment fails to materialize  Third, you might  see a good chance that aggregate supply could be even stronger and inflation even  lower than projected by the staff, reflecting robust productivity gains and, perhaps,  declining inflation expectations on Main Street, if not on Wall Street, feeding through  to wages and prices     On the other hand, you might see the Greenbook projection of accelerating output   and decreasing slack as supporting an unchanged stance of policy, as indicated in the  first bullet in the right-hand panel  Some of the data that have become available since  the last meeting may be early evidence that economic activity is now in the process of  accelerating, as the staff has been projecting  Also, the additional fiscal impetus now  being implemented should help sustain the projected improvement, and you might  want to see some evidence of the effects of that stimulus before undertaking further  action  Moreover, the recent increases in long rates could be seen as a possible signal  of a pickup in business confidence and a strengthening of spending that may outrun  those forecast by the staff  A calculation reported in the Bluebook suggests that if  bond investors use something like a Taylor rule in forecasting future monetary policy,  then the recent run-up in interest rates implies that their expected level of output a  year and a half ahead has revised up as much as 1 percent  If the Committee places  appreciable weight on this possible signal, it might be inclined to leave the stance of  policy unchanged at this meeting  Finally, the recent increases in inflation  compensation implied by indexed securities, while not confirmed by other gauges of  inflation expectations, may incline the Committee toward moving gingerly in   August 12, 2003 69 of 110    providing any further stimulus  In these circumstances, the Committee may wish to  defer action at this meeting and assess the data over coming weeks to determine  whether adjustments to the stance of policy are necessary     As I mentioned, such a policy decision is uniformly anticipated in financial   markets, and most investors expect that you will couple it with unchanged  assessments of the risks to attainment of your objectives for growth and inflation  As  noted in the bottom panel, such an evaluation of risks would seem consistent with  developments over the intermeeting period  The encouraging incoming data on  spending and the backup in market rates may be viewed as having roughly offsetting  effects with respect to the risks to the attainment of sustainable growth, leaving them  balanced  And the continued very low rates of inflation, accumulating evidence that  productivity growth remains strong, persistently weak labor market performance, and  a small downward revision to the staff economic forecast may be seen as arguing that  the risks to inflation remain tilted to the downside     While certain developments over the intermeeting period—particularly the sharp   backup in interest rates and the rise in inflation compensation—could be taken instead  to argue for adjustments to the risk assessment, in the current environment any  change might well prompt a sizable market reaction and possibly reignite recent  volatility  The prospect of a strong response presumably would not deter the  Committee from revising its assessment if the case was clear  However, should the  case for change be seen as marginal, the possibility of an outsized reaction—together  with the Committee’s intention to revisit its communication policy at its next  meeting—might set a relatively high hurdle for the FOMC to reach a judgment at  today’s meeting that the risks had changed  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That  concludes my prepared remarks       I don’t have too much to add to that  I would just note that probably   the mortgage-hedging activities that were very prominent in the summer did play a role, and that   makes it a little difficult to interpret the exact timing of the movements in the inflation   expectations series  But I personally wouldn’t be inclined to completely rule out the possibility   that market participants may be looking at longer-run inflation trends and that a slightly larger   premium may be built in there now    Coming back to your question on forward rates, Mr Chairman, over   the past year it looks as if one-year forward rates of the ten-year maturity haven’t really done   anything on balance  They did decline in the spring and then moved back up in the summer    They have been roughly flat in recent months   December 9, 2003 30 of 133   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  that is being distributed now  Financial markets were subject to two strong  crosscurrents over the intermeeting period generally robust economic data and  policymakers’ statements emphasizing that policy could remain accommodative for a  long time  As of the close of the Bluebook on Thursday evening, the economic data  had predominated  Although market participants saw no chance of policy tightening  at this meeting, a majority thought that, in view of evidence that the economy has  turned the corner, you would modify or drop the “considerable period” sentence  today to begin laying the groundwork for an eventual move away from  accommodation  As shown in the top left-hand panel of exhibit 1, the expected path  of the federal funds rate estimated from futures market quotes (the blue line) had  steepened a little relative to that prevailing at the previous meeting (the red line)  The  top right-hand panel shows that yields on Treasury coupon issues were up 10 to  25 basis points for the period     However, Friday’s employment data proved disappointing to traders, and the   picture in financial markets has changed noticeably as a result  Treasury yields now  are about unchanged to up several basis points for the period  The expected path of  the funds rate over the next eighteen months (the red line in the left-hand panel) has  tilted down a touch  Its trajectory remains notably flat for the next few months,  testifying to the efficacy of your statements in anchoring near-term expectations   Indeed, as indicated by the probability distribution in the bottom left-hand panel,  markets see good odds that the target funds rate will still be at 1 percent around  midyear  Still, the five bars to the right of 1 percent indicate that markets place  considerable weight on a tightening over the next six months                                                        2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   December 9, 2003 84 of 133    Much of the market debate on monetary policy over the past six weeks has  focused on just when this firming process will begin and, especially, on how you will  adjust the statement in advance of that tightening  As shown in the bottom right-hand  panel, about half the primary dealers now expect you to modify or drop the  “considerable period” language at this meeting  That fraction was noticeably larger  before Friday, but the employment data prompted some to revise their predictions   Only a few anticipate any change in your individual risk assessments at this meeting,  and five of the twenty-two expect you to shift to an indication that, overall, the risks  are balanced     The Bluebook similarly devoted much attention to alternative balance of risk   assessments and “considerable period” statements  By the way, as noted in the top  panel of your next exhibit, the Bluebook also discussed two policy alternatives  an  unchanged stance of policy and a 25 basis point easing  Our decision to include some  discussion of easing was motivated partly by the Committee’s existing risk  assessments and “considerable period” language  Support for that alternative came as  well from the staff’s projection that an output gap would persist over the next year  and that, as a consequence, inflation would tend to edge down further from an already  low level  From one perspective, a case could also have been made for consideration  of a tightening  Aggregate demand has heated up, the real funds rate appears to be  below its longer-run equilibrium; and in the Greenbook, the next policy move is the  first in a sequence of tightenings  Nonetheless, we didn’t discuss the pros and cons of  policy firming at this meeting because any near-term move in that direction would  seem completely out of sync with both the existing balance of risks statement and the  FOMC’s indication that policy can remain accommodative for a considerable period     Indeed, judging by your comments so far at this meeting, the issue on the table   today would appear to be not what to do but what to say in the rationale paragraph of  your announcement, in your risk assessments, and in the “considerable period”  sentence  The main changes to the rationale paragraph, outlined in the top right  panel, presumably would be to update the analysis to reflect the recent data—for  example, by characterizing the expansion as now “brisk,” or something along those  lines, rather than as “firming,” and perhaps by describing the labor market as  “improving modestly” rather than as “stabilizing”     The balance of risks assessment, however, is considerably more complicated  To help   address this issue, the middle panel repeats table 1 from the Bluebook  The two columns  present what would appear to be the plausible choices for the balance of risks on inflation— the risk of unwelcome further disinflation and balanced risks  The two rows refer to  balanced risks to sustainable economic growth and upside growth risks  As Vincent noted at  your last meeting, the Committee’s current communications structure gives it plenty of  toggle switches, and those rows and columns, together with the numerous entries in the table,  plus some less plausible choices that have been omitted, reflect that multitude of options     Beginning with the current configuration, indicated in the top left-hand cell, the   Committee could choose to retain its assessment that the risks to sustainable growth are   December 9, 2003 85 of 133    balanced, that the risks to inflation are weighted toward an unwelcome fall, and that a decline  in inflation is the predominant concern  This assessment would seem especially warranted if  the Committee interprets the phrase “sustainable economic growth” as allowing for  expansion for a time at a rate above potential—an outcome that recent data seem to be  suggesting—so long as growth is expected to moderate to a pace that would eventually bring  the level of output into line with that of potential  In this case, the likely persistence of an  output gap for several more quarters even in the context of above-trend growth—and the  possibility that productivity could continue to come in above expectations—would seem  consistent with downside inflation risks  With these individual risks, the Committee  presumably would again indicate that the risks are weighted toward an unwelcome decline in  inflation, although it could also assess the risks as about balanced if it saw the downside  inflation risks, while still present, as having diminished substantially     You might instead view the risks to inflation as now balanced  Although you   might project that an output gap could well persist for some time, tending to tilt  inflation down, you might also now see some upside risks  These upside risks could  stem from a variety of sources, including the possibility of speed effects caused by  strong economic growth, inflation expectations that may have edged up—at least as  inferred from financial markets—dollar depreciation, or even economic growth that  could turn out to be rapid enough to push the level of output above its potential in the  foreseeable future  As shown in the upper right-hand cell, the combination of  judgments that inflation risks as well as growth risks are now balanced presumably  would be accompanied by an assessment that the overall risks have been equalized     The bottom two cells pertain to cases in which the Committee judges that the risks   to the attainment of sustainable growth have shifted to the upside  This assessment  might be appropriate if the Committee sees a strong chance that the economic  advance will remain rapid for a while and would be especially consistent with an  interpretation of “sustainable economic growth” as strictly denoting growth at the  same rate as that of potential output  Even with this appraisal of output risks, the  Committee could still see the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside in view of  the likely effects of the output gap, as noted in the bottom left cell  With these two  component judgments, the Committee would likely conclude either that the overall  risks are balanced or that undesirably low inflation remains the predominant concern   The choice between those two conclusions would depend on the Committee’s  assessment of the relative probabilities as well as the relative costs of the various  possible outcomes  In particular, the Committee might feel that the risks are still  predominantly to the downside if it saw the potential economic costs associated with  significant further disinflation as especially acute  But if the Committee saw the  downside inflation risks as now smaller, it might view the overall risks as balanced   As noted in the Bluebook, a third net assessment—that unsustainably rapid growth is  now the main concern—would also be a logical possibility in this cell  But it seems  unlikely that the Committee would make such a sharp change in its assessment of the  overall risks while making no change to the risks to inflation  The final set of  choices, shown in the bottom right-hand cell, would arise if the Committee concludes  that the risks to growth had moved to the upside and that the inflation risks were now   December 9, 2003 86 of 133    balanced  Particularly if the Committee had arrived at this judgment partly because it  interpreted “sustainable economic growth” as the growth rate of potential, then it  might gauge the overall risks as balanced That’s because the expansion of output at a  pace above potential would presumably not involve any significant economic costs as  long as the level of output remained at or below that of potential  However, if the  Committee had concluded that the risks to growth were to the upside even using a  more liberal definition of sustainable expansion, then it might also see the overall  risks as skewed to the upside     As noted just below the table, the Committee could also choose to qualify any of   its judgments about the risks—for example, by indicating that the risks to inflation are  now only marginally to the downside  Particularly if the Committee saw one of the  component risks as just slightly out of kilter, there are cases in which gauging the  overall risks would seem to involve excessive hair-splitting  If so, you might see  advantages in refraining from characterizing the overall balance of risks, letting the  individual assessments in the context of the overall announcement convey your sense  of the risks  In that regard, your treatment of the “considerable period” sentence will  be key in terms of the market reaction  Some options for this decision are outlined in  the final panel  Obviously, retention of the sentence is one option  It would seem to  be warranted if you saw a reasonably high likelihood that the stance of policy could  be left unchanged for some time  Repeating it might seem particularly appropriate if  you were fairly confident that markets have built in a steeper trajectory for the funds  rate than will prove necessary  However, you might be inclined to modify or delete  the sentence for any of several reasons  You might be uncomfortable as a matter of  principle with a policy precommitment, particularly one that seems tied simply to the  passage of time rather than to economic developments  Alternatively, you might feel,  at a more practical level, that the statement has served its purpose but is no longer  necessary  Or in view of the recent economic data and the relatively low real federal  funds rate, you might think that the time at which policy might need to start moving  toward neutral is drawing closer     A range of possible modifications to the sentence in question also could be   considered by the Committee, with the intention that the sentence could be further  adjusted in the future and eventually dropped  One approach would be simply to vary  the words slightly, say, by substituting “for a while” instead of “for a considerable  period”  Even such a slight change would be read in the markets as significant   Another option is to explain why policy accommodation can be maintained by  incorporating a preface to the sentence  “With inflation quite low and resource use  slack,” etc  A similar approach would be to declare that, in view of the substantial  slack and low inflation, the Committee can be patient in adjusting the stance of  policy  These formulations would hint not only that policy tightening need not start  soon but also that it could be implemented at a measured pace when it does begin   Still another approach would be to condition the maintenance of policy  accommodation not on the passage of time but on economic developments, such as a  substantial reduction in disinflationary risks  A final option would be just to drop the  sentence   December 9, 2003 87 of 133      As I mentioned above, the Committee now has several dimensions along which it   can adjust the communication of its monetary policy intentions  Because of this  complexity, predicting the market response to any particular configuration has  become even more difficult  Nonetheless, the “considerable period” sentence  probably is key  Given current market expectations, interest rates likely would tend  to fall somewhat in response to combinations that leave that sentence more or less in  place, although that effect could be offset at least partly by other changes to the  announcement  But dropping or significantly modifying the “considerable period”  sentence at this time could prompt a noticeable sell-off in fixed-income and equity  markets      Those who participate in drafting the Bluebook would share that view   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material that  was passed out at the break labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy  Alternatives”  As shown in the top panels of exhibit 1, the incoming indications of  softer-than-expected economic growth—especially Friday’s employment report— have had a pronounced effect on financial markets  Over the intermeeting period, the  yield on nominal ten-year Treasuries, the solid black line in the left-hand panel,  dropped nearly 45 basis points, to about 44 percent—its lowest level since early  spring  At the same time, equity prices, shown in the right-hand panel, dove sharply  lower, as investors reacted to the sluggish data, rising energy prices, and corporate  guidance suggesting a less robust outlook for earnings  The S&P 500 index fell more  than 6 percent, while the Nasdaq plunged nearly 13 percent  But with business  balance sheets perceived as mostly being in excellent condition, credit spreads on  investment-grade issues were about unchanged; and yields on such securities, the  dotted red line in the top left panel, declined virtually point for point with those on  Treasury bonds  Spreads on speculative-grade issues (not shown) widened a little but  stayed relatively narrow       As is evident in the middle left-hand panel, the signs of persistent sluggishness in   the economy prompted a significant tilt down in market expectations for the path of  the federal funds rate  The blue line, showing quotes for last night’s close, suggests  that market participants now fully subscribe to the FOMC’s view that policy can be  tightened at a measured pace  Investors apparently have come to believe that two  years will elapse before the funds rate will reach 3½ percent  In other words, they  now see you moving ¼ point at roughly every other meeting  At the same time,  though, market participants appear to have read your recent policy announcements, as  well as your public statements that the flagging in growth is likely to be temporary, as  implying that policy will be tightened another notch at this meeting  As illustrated by  the blue bars in the chart to the right, options on federal funds futures point to very  high odds among investors that you will firm policy 25 basis points today  As shown  in the bottom left-hand panel, the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, which was  updated on Friday following the labor market report, indicates that dealers  unanimously share the expectation of another ¼ point move today  All of the dealers  also think that you will again characterize the risks to growth and inflation as  balanced, and most expect that you will retain the “measured pace” language or some  variant of it  The solid blue line in the bottom right-hand panel again shows the  current path for the expected funds rate derived from futures contracts but focuses on  just the next few months and assumes that policy moves will be made only at  meetings  The expected value of 161 percent for the September 21 meeting suggests  that market participants see only about a 2 in 5 chance that you will boost the funds   August 10, 2004 66 of 103          rate another ¼ point six weeks from now  And the value of 189 percent for the  December 14 meeting indicates that markets have built in only two and one-half  tightenings of 25 basis points over the four meetings remaining this year  By  contrast, at the time of the June meeting, investors anticipated an average of a ¼ point  move at each of the remaining five meetings      The same factors that have spurred market participants to ratchet down their   expectations for the pace of tightening might lead you to contemplate leaving policy  unchanged at this meeting, as discussed in exhibit 2  As portrayed in the top left  panel, the surge in payrolls earlier this year has tailed off sharply in the past three  months  And incoming NIPA data for the first half of the year (the second line of the  right-hand panel) revealed that economic growth was ¾ percentage point slower than  had been estimated by the staff in the June Greenbook  In response to the weak  employment data for June and July as well as to other indicators, the staff has revised  down appreciably its forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year (the  third line) from 5 percent in June to about 4 percent currently  As reviewed in the  middle panel, the staff forecast suggests that a considerable amount of economic  slack will linger over coming quarters  The output gap is projected to shrink slowly  and still be around 1 percent at the end of next year  Partly reflecting that slack, both  core inflation and overall inflation are forecast to move lower over the second half of  this year and during 2005 (the bottom left-hand panel), with the rate of core PCE  inflation edging back below 1½ percent by the end of next year  Particularly with this  price forecast, the Committee may not be satisfied with a prospect for continued slack  and may wish to foster increased resource utilization by pursuing a slightly easier  path than in the staff forecast, starting with an unchanged stance of policy at this  meeting      Market expectations for inflation could be read as giving the Committee some   latitude in the timing of its policy tightening  As shown by the black and blue dashed  lines in the bottom right-hand panel, the difference between yields on nominal and  indexed Treasury securities suggests that inflation expectations in financial markets  have reversed course over the past few months, declining significantly from their  recent peaks, while the solid red line indicates that households’ longer-term inflation  expectations have remained fairly stable at a level just under 3 percent      At the same time, though, the Committee might find the persistent relatively high   level of inflation expectations to be troubling and one of a number of factors that  incline it toward the continued tightening of policy at this meeting that is discussed in  exhibit 3  With the economic expansion now apparently well established, even if its  pace is somewhat below earlier expectations, the Committee may still believe that the  dominant policy consideration is the need to reduce the existing degree of monetary  accommodation  As shown by the solid line in the top panel, the real federal funds  rate is not only low but negative, and it has edged down on balance over the past year  as inflation has increased  Moreover, it is noticeably below even the lower edge of a  range of estimates of its equilibrium value  The 25 basis point firming of  alternative B would move the real rate toward zero, whereas a 50 basis point action   August 10, 2004 67 of 103          would leave it at about zero and just within the range of estimates of its equilibrium   In addition, as shown in the middle panel, a firming would be consistent with results  from a range of monetary policy rules that are reported in each Bluebook      As indicated in the bottom left-hand panel, the Committee may be attracted to the   50 basis point increase in the funds rate at this meeting of alternative C if it is  especially concerned about the highly accommodative posture of monetary policy  implied by a negative real federal funds rate  The Committee might also feel that the  staff has read too much into the recent run of weak economic indicators  By many  measures, financial conditions remain quite supportive of growth, and the Committee  may judge that it is just a matter of time before very low real rates of interest, if  maintained much longer, show through in accelerating economic growth and,  possibly, higher inflationary expectations and actual inflation      In view of the spate of soft indicators, though, the Committee may judge that the   25 basis point firming of alternative B is appropriate for this meeting  As noted  previously, inflation expectations, for now, appear to be well contained  And while  the Committee may feel that the existing degree of monetary accommodation needs to  be reduced over time, it may also believe that incoming data have tended to confirm  its previous judgment that policy can be tightened at a measured pace  Assuming a  gradual tightening of policy, the staff forecasts a moderate economic rebound,  persisting resource slack, and a resumption next year of some net downward  pressures on core inflation  Moreover, market participants have come to believe that  policy will be firmed at a gradual pace, and a larger move at this time would likely  prompt a sharp adjustment in market prices and could provoke considerable  uncertainty about the Committee’s motivations and intended policy path      Should the Committee choose to move by 25 basis points at this meeting, the   remaining issues have to do with the language of your announcement  These issues  are addressed in your final exhibit—the third revision of Bluebook table 1   [Laughter]  The second revision, which was circulated to the Committee yesterday,  responded further to the weak employment report and in particular to the suggestions  of several policymakers  This third revision is substantively similar to the second,  with the change in wording intended primarily to simplify the language  As shown in  rows 3 and 4 of alternative B, the rationale section of this version reads as follows  “In recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in  labor market conditions has slowed  This softness likely owes importantly to the  substantial rise in energy prices  The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume  a stronger pace of expansion going forward  Inflation has been somewhat elevated  this year, though a portion of the rise in prices seems to reflect transitory factors”   Here I ask that you note a slight fourth revision—“seems to reflect” rather than  “evidently reflects” transitory factors  As shown in rows 5 and 6 under alternative B,  June’s assessment of continued balanced risks to both sustainable growth and price  stability would be retained today, together with the indication of the Committee’s  judgment that policy accommodation can be removed at a measured pace  Certainly,  both upside and downside risks to growth as well as inflation can be identified, and   August 10, 2004 68 of 103          recent developments would seem to support a continued belief about proceeding at a  measured pace        In a memorandum distributed to the Committee last week, Vincent Reinhart   discussed alternative wording that could eventually supplant the current risks  assessment and facilitate the deletion of the “measured pace” language  That wording  is shown in row 5 of alternative C  In brief, it would separately characterize the risks  to sustainable growth and to price stability—and potentially the overall risks—on the  explicit assumption that the stance of policy was maintained for several quarters  In  current circumstances, with the real funds rate estimated to be well below  equilibrium, those risks would most likely be viewed as to the upside  That new  wording could conceivably be used for a time simultaneously with the existing  “measured pace” sentences or be substituted for them immediately  Although the  Committee may see advantages to moving to the new formulation over time, one  consideration in a contemplation of adopting it today is that any change in the form of  the risk assessment is, at present, completely unanticipated by the markets  Without  the ability in the announcement to explain in detail the conditionality of the  forecasting exercise in the alternative wording, yields could back up somewhat if an  assessment of upside risks were introduced without warning at this time       By contrast, it seems likely that a choice of alternative B today, accompanied by   an announcement that included an assessment of balanced risks, that continued to  suggest that policy can be firmed at a measured pace, and that took note of the recent  moderation in growth and in the improvement in labor market conditions would elicit  little immediate reaction in financial markets  That concludes my prepared remarks       I don’t have that either, Mr Chairman, but I would note that our   estimates of growth in foreign-held currency are actually still somewhat larger for this year than for   domestic currency, despite the negative net shipments that Dino referred to  For instance, we are   projecting that foreign currency is growing about 6¾ percent for 2004 as a whole, whereas domestic   currency growth we estimate at about 4 percent  2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial markets were subject to  a number of crosscurrents over the intermeeting period  Nonetheless, most financial  market prices showed relatively small net movements over the period  As indicated  in the top left-hand panel of exhibit 1, line 1, yields on short-term Treasury coupon  issues were up somewhat as investors concluded that a pause in policy tightening was  not imminent  At the ten-year mark, however, yields on nominal Treasuries (line 3)  and TIPS (line 5) declined modestly, apparently reflecting in part investors’ sense that  growth in real activity was likely to be a bit less vigorous than they had previously  anticipated  As noted, implied inflation expectations for the next five years continued  to edge higher, while those for the succeeding five years were little changed   Meanwhile, the Wilshire index (line 6) rose 2½ percent, while the Nasdaq (line 7)  rose 4 percent, with equity prices supported particularly by falling oil prices  Risk  spreads on corporate, GSE, and emerging-market debt, not shown, declined virtually  across the board   December 14, 2004 59 of 118           As portrayed in the top right-hand panel, money market futures rates indicate that  the expected path of monetary policy edged up on balance for the next year but  declined slightly over a longer period, roughly consistent with the flattening of the  Treasury yield curve  Futures quotes imply that a ¼ point firming today is essentially  built into market interest rates, and as indicated by the first bullet in the middle panel,  a Desk survey taken last week similarly reveals that all twenty-two primary dealers  expect a 25 basis point move today  All of the dealers also think that you will retain  the assessment that the risks to both sustainable growth and price stability are  balanced and that you will keep the “measured pace” language  And the survey  responses and conversations with the dealers indicate that none expects you to use  today’s announcement to signal a pause in tightening going forward       Still, market participants do not think you will tighten ¼ point at each meeting   indefinitely into the new year  As noted in the bottom panel, two of the primary  dealers expect you to pause in February—even absent a signal today—and seven  anticipate that you will do so in March  Futures quotes can be interpreted as implying  that you will most likely tighten 25 basis points in February, pause in March, and  slow your pace to roughly a ¼ point move at every other meeting over the rest of the  year  The quarterly average funds rates in the Blue Chip consensus released on  December 1 suggest that private forecasters expect a bit faster pace of tightening than  built into futures rates, but that consensus still is consistent with your pausing twice  before the fall  The issue of whether and how soon to slow the pace of policy  tightening was the theme of the Bluebook presented to the Committee for this  meeting  Alternative A was distinguished by a pause at this meeting  Alternatives B  and C both involved a ¼ point firming today, but only alternative B included  language that would suggest a pause in the near term     A case for continuing to firm policy by raising the target funds rate another   ¼ point at this meeting is summarized in the top panel of exhibit 2  Most  importantly, the expansion now seems to be well entrenched, with labor market  conditions improving gradually  The forces that had previously been restraining  spending appear to have weakened considerably, and the Committee might thus  believe that it can continue to reduce the unusual degree of monetary accommodation  put in place in the past several years without jeopardizing satisfactory growth  The  Committee might also be concerned about a possible buildup of inflationary pressures  for several reasons  For instance, members may feel that the staff could be overly  optimistic regarding trend productivity and worry that slowing productivity could  begin to put upward pressure on unit labor costs  Also, some anecdotal information  suggests that increased business costs continue to put upward pressures on prices in  some industries  Moreover, actual inflation has risen over the past year, and the  recent inflation data have tended to come in a bit above market expectations,  potentially giving momentum to inflation expectations  Indeed, while long-term  inflation expectations have been essentially flat, the rise in actual inflation apparently  has fed through to some degree into shorter-term expectations  Finally, ongoing  downward pressures on the dollar seem to have augmented market concerns about   December 14, 2004 60 of 118           inflation  All of these factors suggest the possibility of some upside risks to the staff  inflation forecast       The Committee may also interpret the staff’s revised estimates of equilibrium real   interest rates as pointing toward continued monetary tightening over time  The  estimates of short-run r* presented in the middle panel suggest that equilibrium real  rates have climbed sharply since early 2003 as the economy has strengthened   Although your monetary policy actions have boosted the actual real rate as well, that  increase has lagged the advance in measures of r*  Consequently, the actual rate  remains a bit below the 70 percent confidence interval of the model-based estimates  (the darker blue band) and noticeably below the estimate implicit in the Greenbook  forecast (the dashed line)  These measures suggest that policy will need to be firmed  substantially over time; but as emphasized in the Bluebook and the staff memos, the  estimates of equilibrium real rates should not be interpreted as prescriptions for the  current stance of monetary policy  Rather, these measures estimate the real funds rate  that, if maintained over the next three years, would close the output gap at the end of  that time period  Interpreted a bit more loosely, the r* estimates attempt to measure  the weighted average real rate over the next several years consistent with closing the  output gap at the end of that period and thus do not have a direct implication for the  setting of the funds rate today     Even assuming that such estimates are accurate, bringing the real rate quickly to   some estimate of r* would likely be undesirable for several reasons  First, the  Committee might be dissatisfied with the persistence of a positive output gap for  another three years  Second, the Committee might be concerned about the downward  pressure on inflation that could result from that persistence  And, third, for a variety  of reasons the Committee may consider gradual adjustment of the funds rate toward  its ultimate equilibrium to be the preferred policy approach  From that perspective,  these r* estimates may be most useful in providing a benchmark for thinking about  the appropriate trajectory of policy over the next several years, for example, by  considering the average amount of stimulus that ought to be applied during that  period as policy moves gradually toward a stance thought likely to be consistent with  medium-run equilibrium  But even if you find these measures generally helpful in  thinking about policy, as we obviously hope, you will still need to weigh a number of  other factors in setting policy—for example, how your outlook differs from those  embedded in the models and the Greenbook, how quickly any output gap should be  closed, where inflation is now relative to your preferred level, and where it would end  up under a policy derived from considering these measures     The question of the appropriate trajectory of policy going forward is what   motivated the staff to present alternatives B and C as distinct policy choices in this  Bluebook  As noted in the bottom left-hand panel, if the Committee believes that  policy tightening can proceed at a slower pace than it has over the past six months, it  might wish to combine a ¼ point move at this meeting with a signal of a possible  pause in the firming process before long  Policymakers might think that the process  of firming can now proceed at a slower pace for at least several reasons  First, some   December 14, 2004 61 of 118           output gap apparently remains, and it does not appear to be closing particularly  rapidly  Second, the four rate hikes so far may be seen as having already reduced  significantly the degree of policy accommodation  That would be the case if, for  instance, members had a weaker outlook than the models and thought short-run r*  was near the lower edge of the 70 percent confidence band in the middle panel  A  relatively low r* could result from a continuation of the range of factors that have  apparently been restraining the expansion over the past few years—for example, the  persistence of unusual business caution  Such considerations might incline the  Committee to shift to a somewhat slower pace of policy firming and signal such a  shift today through the wording suggested under alternative B       However, policymakers may instead believe that the recent pace of tightening   should be maintained, at least for a while longer, or even stepped up—and  consequently that, as in alternative C, the Committee should not give any signal at  this meeting of an imminent pause  As noted in the right-hand panel, the existing  degree of policy accommodation is substantial, at least as judged by the difference  between the real funds rate and the range of point estimates indicated by the red band  in the middle panel  All economists agree that monetary policy works with long lags,  and members may be concerned that the considerable amount of monetary stimulus  could be cumulating into an inflationary impetus that will become fully evident only  with the passage of time  Policymakers may see the recent inflation data, as well as  the downward pressures on the dollar, as possibly the leading edge of a ramp-up in  underlying inflation trends  Finally, the seemingly buoyant attitudes toward risk in  financial markets may argue at the margin for a firmer path of policy     Your last exhibit repeats table 1 from the Bluebook  Should the Committee wish   to suggest the possibility of a pause at an upcoming meeting, as in alternative B, it  could do so by indicating, as shown by the red text, that “the Committee’s policy  actions since mid-2004 have resulted in a significant reduction in the degree of  monetary policy accommodation” while noting that “nonetheless, the    stance of  monetary policy remains somewhat accommodative”  The economic description  could be updated by referring to the “earlier” rise in energy prices and by indicating  that labor market conditions “continue to improve gradually”  Although market  participants appear to anticipate some slowing in the pace of policy firming in 2005,  few if any expect you to signal a downshift today  Hence, selection of this alternative  likely would lead investors to mark up the probability of a near-term pause  Short-  and intermediate-term interest rates would likely decline noticeably, stock prices  could rise, and downward pressure on the dollar could resume     If the Committee, in contrast, believes that policy tightening should continue at   the recent pace—and perhaps even wishes to allow for a potential acceleration in  policy tightening—and hence does not wish to signal the possibility of a pause, only  modest changes to the statement would appear necessary, as in alternative C  Choice  of this alternative today likely would have minimal market impact  Should the  Committee harbor significant concerns about inflation, it could indicate that “the  earlier rise in energy prices and an escalation of business costs have the potential to   December 14, 2004 62 of 118           contribute to upward pressure on prices”  It could also state that “labor market  conditions continue to improve,” thereby hinting that conditions on the real side of  the economy are not likely to impede continued policy tightening at upcoming  meetings     In closing, it might also be worth noting that the Committee would not necessarily   have to signal a pause in advance through its announcement  First, the phrase  “measured pace” presumably was intended, at least originally, to allow for the  possibility that policy might not be firmed at each meeting—although some market  participants have come to read it as implying regular policy moves  Second, the  market’s expectations for policy have not been completely immobilized by the  existing language  Market yields still fluctuate to some degree with incoming  economic and financial information, given the implicit conditionality in the language,  and thus markets could come to anticipate a pause—even without a signal—should  the data point fairly clearly toward the desirability of a slower pace of tightening      Yes  I wouldn’t focus solely on energy costs, but that was the intent—to   highlight that in particular as well as other elements of costs that are putting pressure on prices    We’d simply say, “Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, but   the earlier rise in energy prices and an acceleration of business costs have the potential to contribute   to upward pressure on prices”    That’s correct   December 14, 2004 63 of 118            I think that’s right This has been an evolving pattern over the past   several futures settlements  There was a pattern in the last few months of pronounced tightness   in the particular issue that we’re talking about, which is the February 2012 note  And it is the   case that currently the cheapest-to-deliver issue into the September contract has an even smaller   outstanding size So this situation will bear some watching   Yes, potentially  These issues that enjoy a lot of “specialness” in the   repo market because they can be financed cheaply tend to trade noticeably below the yield curve,   at least at times  3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package  of charts distributed during the break entitled “Material for Briefing on  Monetary Policy Alternatives”    Your monetary policy discussion today takes place against a backdrop of  significant revisions to the economic outlook and substantial changes in  financial market prices  As shown in the upper left-hand panel of exhibit 1,  market interest rates rose considerably over the intermeeting period, pushed  higher by a steady stream of data releases suggesting greater momentum to  aggregate spending and output, some signs of heightened inflation pressures,  and indications from policymakers that measured firming would continue in  coming months  Yields on nominal Treasury securities climbed 45 to 50 basis  points, bringing the 10-year yield above 44 percent  As shown in the upper  right-hand panel, one-year forward rates ending one year ahead through 10  years increased appreciably, although the larger part of the increase occurred  near the front end of the curve—a common pattern when yields respond to signs  of strength in the economy   The middle left-hand panel indicates that real yields as read from inflation- indexed Treasury issues rose about in line with nominal rates  As shown in the  middle right-hand panel, market participants evidently expect that you will  counter the perceived increase in aggregate demand and inflation pressures with  additional policy restraint, as CPI-based inflation compensation rose less than  10 basis points on net over the intermeeting period  Inflation expectations thus  appear to have been remarkably little affected by the $5 per barrel further rise in  spot oil prices over the intermeeting period (the black line in the lower left-hand  panel) and the more than $3 increase in far futures crude prices (the red line) to  record high levels   Likewise, equity prices, shown in the lower right-hand panel, seem to have  been held back little by the further rise in energy prices  Indeed, boosted by  strong earnings reports, the Wilshire 5000 index climbed 2¼ percent while the  Nasdaq surged 4½ percent The apparent enthusiasm about business prospects  was mirrored in corporate bond spreads, not shown, with the spread on high- yield issues dropping more than 60 basis points   3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)                               August 9, 2005 76 of 110  Market participants sharply marked up their expectations for monetary policy  firming  As shown in the upper left-hand panel of your next exhibit, investors  appear to have boosted their forecast for the peak federal funds rate from around  3¾ percent as of the last FOMC meeting (the dotted line) to just above 4¼  percent (the solid line) And whereas previously investors had anticipated a  slowing in the pace of tightening this autumn, the steepening visible in the left- hand part of the panel indicates that market participants have significantly raised  their expectations for policy action over the next several months   This revision in near-term policy expectations can be seen even more clearly  in the step-path in the upper right-hand panel, which portrays market  expectations for your actions at each of the four remaining meetings this year,  as given by our reading of fed funds futures quotes  The uptick for the August  meeting from 346 percent to 349 percent indicates that investors have gone  from fairly sure to essentially certain of a 25 basis point move at this meeting   Especially striking are the upward revisions to expectations for the November  and December meetings  Previously, only a very small probability was assigned  to a move in December, but that likelihood has now been marked up to above  50 percent Despite these upward revisions, the 409 percent rate after the  December meeting suggests that investors still see high odds that you will take a  pass at one of the meetings over the balance of the year, most likely in  December     This pattern of expectations is reflected in the Desk’s survey of the 22 primary  dealers As shown in the lower left-hand panel, on average dealers assigned a  93 percent probability to a 25 basis point move at this meeting, 84 percent for  September, and 76 percent for November  For each of those meetings, both no  action and a 50 basis point move were also seen as possibilities, with the  likelihood of a pause still slightly outweighing that of a policy acceleration   As indicated in the middle panel, for today’s meeting, dealers almost  unanimously expect you once again to judge the current stance of policy as  accommodative, to assess the risks as balanced, and to retain the “measured  pace” language   As shown in the right-hand panel, dealers were also surveyed as to their  estimates of the neutral nominal funds rate  Their average estimate of the most  likely neutral nominal federal funds rate—4¼ percent—is consistent with that  suggested by the pattern of money market futures quotes  However, dealers  were also asked about their range of estimates, and the average responses,  indicated by the “low” and “high” entries, suggest a significant degree of  uncertainty Dealers’ average forecast that core PCE inflation will be about 2  percent in mid-2006, not shown, seems to suggest that their 4¼ percent average  estimate for the nominal funds rate translates into roughly a 2¼ percent estimate  for the equilibrium real funds rate                            August 9, 2005 77 of 110  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 3, an equilibrium real federal funds rate  in a range of roughly 2 to 2¼ percent is also consistent with both a range of  model-based staff estimates (the red band) and the Greenbook forecast (the  green dashed line) As indicated in the upper part of the lower panel, the range  of model estimates has narrowed substantially this round  In the June  Bluebook, the right-hand column, the estimates went from 15 percent at the low  end to 28 percent at the high end, but in this Bluebook they are relatively  tightly clustered roughly between 2 to 2¼ percent   The width of the red band, however, should not be interpreted as a confidence  interval Rather, 70 and 90 percent confidence intervals capturing uncertainty  about model specification, coefficients, and the level of potential output are  denoted, as usual, by the dark and light shaded areas in the chart  According to  these rather wide intervals, the real funds rate could already be above its  equilibrium level or remain well below it   Moreover, at least some of these estimates of the equilibrium funds rate are  subject to uncertainty regarding the outlook for a range of exogenous variables   This point is made using a different framework in exhibit 4  This exhibit shows  the results of a benchmark scenario and two alternative scenarios that are  prepared using the version of the FRB/US model with forward-looking  investors and assuming optimizing policymakers whose outlook is similar to the  staff’s The benchmark scenario, denoted by the black lines, captures economic  conditions and inflation pressures as interpreted judgmentally in the Greenbook  and extended through 2012 But in the benchmark scenario as well as the two  alternatives, policymakers pursue an optimal policy rather than following the  funds rate path of the Greenbook or a Taylor rule  Specifically, policymakers  minimize the sum of squared deviations of unemployment from the NAIRU,  deviations of inflation from an assumed 1½ percent target, and changes in the  federal funds rate Under that benchmark scenario, the federal funds rate moves  up gradually to about 4½ percent, a little higher than in the Greenbook, and then  drops back to 4 percent, as core PCE inflation tilts down toward its assumed  target of 1½ percent and the unemployment rate varies narrowly between 5 and  5¼ percent This scenario, by the way, assumes that the currently very low term  premium in bond yields rises gradually, reaching its historical average level in  10 years   The red lines are based on the “stronger demand” scenario that was discussed  in the Greenbook, with personal consumption, residential investment, and  business investment expenditures all considerably stronger than in the baseline  scenario Here, policy tightens much more steeply than in the baseline  And,  with financial markets immediately recognizing both the positive shock to  demand and the resulting tightening of monetary policy, nominal bond yields  promptly jump to about 5¼ percent  As shown in the lower panel, inflation  initially drops below baseline under this scenario because the sharp tightening  of monetary policy induces a substantial appreciation of the dollar and because                                         August 9, 2005 78 of 110  the modest initial decline in unemployment below the NAIRU, the middle  panel, imparts little momentum to inflation   The blue lines in this chart focus on a topical issue—the unusually low term  premium in bond rates  This scenario addresses the question  What would  happen if the term premium jumps 80 basis points, thus reverting immediately  to its historical average? Here, the assumption of forward-looking policymakers  and markets is key  To offset the incipient upward pressure on bond yields  arising from the increased term premium, the Committee eases policy  considerably relative to baseline  Investors see right away that you are, and will  be, taking countervailing action  Consequently, as shown in the upper right- hand panel, the effect of the higher term premium on bond yields is essentially  offset by markets’ correct anticipation that the stance of policy, as gauged by  the nominal funds rate, will be easier over the next 10 years  As shown by the  lower and middle panels, this policy is nearly completely successful in  eliminating the effects of the term premium shock on the real economy and  inflation   Certainly, these alternative simulations contain some extreme elements—the  large shock to aggregate demand in the first, the immediate substantial jump in  the term premium in the second, and the assumption of immediate recognition  of the shocks and a high degree of forward-looking behavior in both  simulations  But they nonetheless illustrate some useful lessons  First, it is easy  to imagine that the economy or financial markets could evolve in such a way as  to require a federal funds rate notably above or below the rather concentrated 4  to 4¼ percent center of gravity that currently seems to be suggested by the R*  measures, fed funds futures, and dealers’ expectations  And the second scenario  in particular suggests the potential value to policymakers of being able to  decompose changes in nominal bond yields into expectation and term-premium  components   Even acknowledging the uncertainties illustrated by these scenarios, though,  the weight of the evidence seems to suggest that monetary policy will need to  firm at least somewhat further in coming months  Accordingly, the Bluebook  once again presented three policy alternatives, summarized in your final exhibit,  that each would involve a further increase in the federal funds rate at this  meeting   As shown in the second column, under alternative A the funds rate would be  boosted a quarter point today, but the language in your announcement would  hint at an imminent downshift in the pace of tightening  With the real funds rate  currently at only about 1¼ percent, it seemed implausible to propose statement  language suggesting that the end of the tightening cycle was just around the  corner; a suggestion of a pause, with further tightenings to come, seemed a bit  more relevant to current circumstances                                          August 9, 2005 79 of 110  At the other end of the spectrum, alternative C, the fourth column, could be   motivated by a sense that the real funds rate is currently well below its   equilibrium, possibly far enough below that an intensification of inflation   pressures could already be in train  To move more rapidly to close the real rate   gap, this alternative would raise the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting    Moreover, the statement would convey fairly serious concern about both the   strength of aggregate demand and rising cost pressures  With a move of this   size, the Committee would presumably no longer express a view that future   policy moves would occur at a measured pace and might take the opportunity to   eliminate other forward-looking elements of the statement as well    Under alternative B, the Committee would stick with its established program   by firming policy another 25 basis points today, retaining the assessment that   the risks to growth and inflation should be balanced with appropriate policy   action, and reiterating that policy firming likely can continue at a measured   pace However, the proposed language in the “rationale” sentences of the   announcement—those characterizing real activity and inflation—have been   modified significantly  These changes could be read by investors as conveying   a bit more concern about the pace of demand growth and the degree of inflation   pressures than they had expected    In weighing alternative approaches to near-term policy, policymakers as usual   would seem to have to make some key judgments  These include, for example,   whether the staff is correct in its assessments that only a bit of slack remains in   the economy, that current financial conditions are consistent with a near-term   slowing in the growth of aggregate demand to a pace in line with that of the   economy’s potential, and that core PCE inflation will probably remain near 2   percent over the forecast horizon with a continuation of gradual tightening  The   staff could be wrong in those assessments, but if so it will likely have a good   deal of company among financial market participants     That concludes my prepared remarks   I think that would not be notably different from the Greenbook   scenario where essentially we do have the term premium going away but very slowly   Yes   That’s right   Yes, that’s correct    I might add, President Poole, that we do make estimates of the growth rate   of the domestic component as well as the growth rate of the foreign component  According to our   estimates, the deceleration over the past several years has occurred in both components  But we   estimate that growth for the domestic component would be about flat or slightly negative for this year   for the first time in many years—maybe ever—whereas the foreign component, according to our   estimates, has slowed from growth rates of around 9 percent earlier around the turn of the decade to a   little less than 6 percent recently  Of course, these estimates have to be taken with a big grain of salt   for the reason Dino indicated                                    December 13, 2005 9 of 100 2  Mr Chairman, earlier you referred to the comedic talents of my  two colleagues to the right For my part, in drafting the Bluebook over the past week, I  fear that I may have been engaged in tragedy  [Laughter]  That is, there certainly was  drama depicting a protagonist—yours truly—engaging in a significant struggle ending  in ruin or utter disappointment    For the remainder of my remarks, I’ll be referring to the material that was handed   out at the break    Over the intermeeting period, indications of considerable momentum in economic  activity led market participants to build in a little more near-term monetary tightening,  as shown in the upper left-hand panel of exhibit 1  Market participants now appear to  believe that the funds rate will peak at about 4¾ percent in mid-2006 but be rolled back  slightly thereafter  The consensus Blue Chip forecast released on December 1, not  shown, also indicates a median anticipation that about three more quarter-point moves  are in store, but those forecasters don’t have the Committee easing until early 2007     For the near term, as shown in the upper right-hand panel, fed funds futures indicate  that investors are all but certain that you will firm another 25 basis points today  They  see about an 80 percent chance of another such step in January and put better-than-even  odds on one more move in March   And seemingly everyone recognizes that your statement is in play today  The  financial press and market letters in recent days have devoted most of their monetary  policy analysis not to your rate adjustment but to your choice of words  As shown in  the middle left-hand panel, the Desk’s survey indicated that most primary dealers  expect that today you will modify or drop the references to “accommodative” monetary  policy and that half look for the “measured pace” language to be changed or deleted   But there is little indication that market participants anticipate a structural change to  your risk assessment   A case for firming policy today is outlined in the middle right-hand panel    According to staff estimates, the economy appears to have little remaining slack, with    2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                            December 13, 2005 63 of 100  the unemployment rate in the vicinity of the NAIRU and real GDP just a fraction of a  percent below the level of its potential Moreover, the economy appears to have  considerable momentum that, without further firming, could carry aggregate demand  beyond the level of potential output Such momentum might be seen as consistent with  a real federal funds rate that is still relatively low  As shown in the lower panel, the  real funds rate is within, but near the lower end of, the range of staff estimates of its  equilibrium  With some of the indirect effects of higher crude and natural gas prices  still in prospect and likely providing some impetus to the inflationary process, you  might be particularly concerned about the implications of resource pressures for  inflation On the whole, though, incoming data over the intermeeting period have  seemed broadly consistent with your earlier expectations that the economy and inflation  would evolve in such a way as to warrant further measured firming  And financial  markets have inferred from those developments and your policy communications that a  quarter-point move today is a sure thing   A more difficult question—one that could bear particularly on your statement this  afternoon—is how much more tightening is likely to prove necessary  Even  recognizing the substantial firming of policy to date as well as the lags in the effects of  policy—an issue flagged by a number of you this morning—you may still believe that  considerable further policy tightening lies ahead  If so, you might be attracted to the  language of the Bluebook’s alternative C, shown in the right-hand column of exhibit 2   In the rationale section, row 2, this announcement would point to vigorous growth in  the real economy and would retain the references to policy accommodation and robust  underlying productivity growth  The recent strength in aggregate demand might  suggest a relatively high level for the equilibrium funds rate and thus imply that policy  remains accommodative  And, certainly, the remarkable figures for the third quarter  could support a judgment that underlying productivity growth remains robust  In row  3, alternative C would point to “relatively high levels of resource utilization” as another  reason for policy firming  In rows 4 and 5, this alternative would retain both the form  and substance of the Committee’s assessment of risks from recent policy statements,  including the judgment that policy accommodation could probably continue to be  removed at a measured pace  Markets would be quite surprised by such an  announcement, and rates would likely back up considerably   If, however, you believe that the end of this tightening cycle is not far off—or if  you simply believe that the time has come to jettison the reference to accommodative  policy and some other stale language—then you may prefer the wording of alternative  B This statement would differ significantly from recent announcements  As shown in  row 2, the Committee would indicate that the expansion appears solid despite the  effects of the hurricanes and high energy prices, while deleting the references to  accommodative policy and underlying productivity growth  In row 3, the statement  would again acknowledge that core inflation has been low of late and that longer-term  inflation expectations remain contained It would express concern, however, that  “possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the  potential to add to inflation pressures”                         December 13, 2005 64 of 100  The assessment of risks would be modified notably  Rather than making the  arguably tautological assertion that the risks appear balanced assuming “appropriate  monetary policy,” it would indicate that the “Committee judges that some further  measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of  both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance”  I emphasize  “measured” because views on the Committee regarding the inclusion of this word  clearly vary As a staff memorandum indicated last week, the Chairman requests that  in your comments in the upcoming round you express your preferences on this score   In your consideration of this matter, you might see “measured” as representing a  needless restraint on your possible actions  But, as shown in row 5, the Committee  would in effect also indicate that—as has always been the case—the risk assessment is  not a commitment but a conditional expectation and that, should incoming data diverge  from expectations, the Committee would commensurately recalibrate its actual and  anticipated actions Moreover, you might see little prospect that policy will actually  need to move in 50 basis point steps but be concerned that, if the Committee were to  drop the word now, especially in the context of the other proposed changes to the  statement, market participants could conclude that you saw the potential need for such  large moves     One factor that could influence the Committee’s decision about the new  assessment-of-risks language is whether you anticipate any problem adjusting that  language as circumstances evolve in coming months  This appears unlikely to be a  major problem  If, contrary to current expectations, more aggressive policy tightening  comes to appear appropriate, the Committee could change the reference in row 4 to  something like “considerable further tightening”  Or, should the end point seem to  move out in time a little, the Committee could simply repeat the proposed assessment   And, finally, if and when it appears that policy has reached a resting point, the  Committee could firm a final 25 basis points and change row 4 to something like the  following “Under these circumstances, the Committee judges that the current stance of  policy roughly balances the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth  and price stability” And at that point the “measured” terminology could be honorably  discharged from service   Given the large number of changes in the announcement proposed for alternative B,  it is difficult to be confident in anticipating the market reaction that it would engender   Indeed, investors also seem to be rather uncertain about the market effect of this  afternoon’s announcement, but markets are striving for completeness by offering  insurance on the direct effect of your imminent policy action  Specifically, an option is  being traded on the change in the 10-year Treasury yield in a two-hour window around  your announcement today  The pricing of that option suggests a one-third probability  that the 10-year yield will move one way or another by more than 43 basis points   [Laughter] For our part, the staff’s guess is that the announcement proposed for  alternative B would likely boost interest rates, but not by much   Finally, let me say a word about procedure  As you will recall, the survey of the  FOMC that the staff conducted last month regarding statement language included,                                               December 13, 2005 65 of 100  among other things, questions on the scope of the Committee’s policy vote—that is,  whether the Committee should vote on just the directive and the risk assessment, or  whether the vote should be expanded to cover all forward-looking elements or the  entire statement  In preparation for a possible change, Chairman Greenspan has asked  the staff to provide to the Committee early next year a memorandum that will discuss  the pros and cons of alternative approaches to this issue      Thank you That concludes my prepared remarks   I expected no less  [Laughter]     Yes    2 As shown in the top panel of exhibit 1, the probability of a  25 basis point firming at this meeting implied by federal funds futures quotes trended  down over the intermeeting period  Policy expectations were boosted briefly by  higher-than-expected inflation readings, but those increases were more than offset by  Federal Reserve policy communications and several economic data releases—most  recently, the July employment report—that came in weaker than market participants  had anticipated The pattern of declining expectations of firming at the upcoming  meeting stands in sharp contrast to the previous experience in this tightening cycle, in  which market expectations of firming generally rose over intermeeting periods,  converging to a level close to 100 percent by a day before the FOMC meeting  But  the current situation is similar to the previous episodes in that markets arrived at a  high degree of certainty about the outcome several days in advance of the meeting   Still, as shown in the middle left panel, primary dealers responding to the Desk’s  survey have, since last November, evidenced both increased disagreement among  themselves (the light blue bars) and greater uncertainty individually (the dark blue  bars) about policy actions to be taken at the next meeting two weeks ahead of that  meeting  Presumably these developments reflect a realization that, with policy  accommodation essentially removed, policy actions have become less  pre-programmed and more dependent on the evolving outlook   Regarding your statement today, as indicated in the right-hand panel, dealers  anticipate language that expresses more conviction that economic growth has  moderated, acknowledges the recent elevated inflation readings, expresses concern  about inflation risks, and indicates that future policy actions will be dependent on the  data Although dealers expect your statement to cite inflation risks, implying a  likelihood of further policy firming, slightly less than half see any further tightening  in this cycle, and all of those anticipate at most ¼ point either today or in September   As shown by the black line in the bottom left-hand panel, the peaking of rates implied  by fed funds futures at just 531 percent suggests that investors see only 1-in-4 odds  that you will take another firming step in this cycle  Indeed, looking further ahead,  the black line in the middle panel illustrates that market participants continue to  anticipate policy easing to commence before long, and their projected downward  trajectory for the federal funds rate steepened somewhat over the intermeeting period   Investors seems to remain surprisingly assured in these views  As shown in the right- hand panel, measures of market uncertainty about policy six and twelve months  ahead, the black and the blue lines, respectively, have crept higher of late but are  quite low by historical standards   Reflecting our own sense of uncertainty about the Committee’s future actions, in  the August Bluebook we presented four, rather than the usual three, alternatives for   2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   August 8, 2006 77 of 158                              Committee consideration, spanning a fairly wide range of policy approaches   alternatives A and B, which would keep the stance of policy unchanged at this  meeting but are distinguished by different risk assessments; and alternatives C and D,  which would involve a 25 basis point firming today but are similarly differentiated by  their risk assessments   A case for holding the federal funds rate unchanged today is summarized in the  top left-hand panel of exhibit 2  Based on an assumption of an unchanged federal  funds rate, the staff forecast is for economic growth to run slightly below the  expansion of the economy’s potential over the next six quarters  As shown in the top  right-hand panel, real GDP growth is projected to average about 2¼ percent over the  second half of 2006 and 2007, and the unemployment rate is forecast to creep up to  5¼ percent The negative output gap that develops by the end of next year is small  and exerts only very modest restraint on inflation; but the leveling-out of energy  prices that was assumed in the staff forecast has a more noticeable effect, and core  PCE inflation in the Greenbook edges down slowly over the forecast period  Should  the Committee find this outlook likely and, in the circumstances, acceptable, it might  be inclined to maintain its current stance at this meeting   The model-based estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate portrayed in  the middle left panel present another perspective that might be seen as arguing for  holding steady at this meeting Over the past two years, seventeen consecutive policy  actions have brought the real federal funds rate from a quite low level to the middle of  the range of estimates of the equilibrium (shown in red)  This configuration might  provide some comfort that leaving the stance of policy unchanged for six weeks is  unlikely to turn out to be a serious mistake—that is, unless the Committee is  particularly concerned that inflation expectations could become unmoored by further  bad news on inflation in circumstances in which policy evidently had gone on hold     Moreover, some monetary policy rules reported in the Bluebook suggest holding  policy steady at this meeting  For example, the first-difference rule using an inflation  target of 2 percent, which is portrayed to the right, points to only ¼ point of  additional policy firming through the end of next year, based on the staff baseline  forecast However, even if the Committee thought that leaving the stance of policy  unchanged was appropriate for this meeting, it might—as noted immediately below  the panel—continue to see several sources of upside risks to inflation  most notably,  high levels of resource utilization, which might be a larger concern now that labor  cost pressures look to be greater than previously perceived; elevated energy and other  commodity prices; and the potential for further increases in those factors—the latter  possibility highlighted by yesterday’s news from Alaska  In these circumstances, the  Committee might see the language of alternative B, communicating a judgment that  “some inflation risks remain” and referencing a potential need to address those risks,  as appropriate in conjunction with an unchanged stance of policy     At the same time, the Committee might perceive emerging downside risks to the  economic outlook, as noted in the first bullet in the bottom left-hand panel  Output   August 8, 2006 78 of 158                        and employment have decelerated substantially in recent months, and certainly a  sharper-than-expected further deceleration cannot be ruled out  In particular, housing  may be slowing more quickly than anticipated  The housing slump scenario  presented in the Greenbook illustrates the possible consequences of a realization of  that risk Under that scenario, not illustrated in this exhibit, policymakers following  the Bluebook’s outcome-based rule respond to emerging slack by lowering the  federal funds rate to 4¾ percent by the end of next year  Even without particular  concerns about such risks, an outlook along the lines of the Greenbook baseline  forecast might be consistent with alternative A if policymakers judge such inflation  performance to be satisfactory in light of the below-trend projection for output  growth, as in the optimal control policy path with an inflation target of 2 percent   Moreover, the Committee’s past behavior as captured in the estimated forecast-based  rule would, as shown in the bottom right-hand panel, suggest a slight easing of policy,  given the staff outlook In these circumstances, the Committee might find it  reasonable to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting and not have any  predilection for the likely direction of policy going forward, as in alternative A   However, as discussed in the top panel of exhibit 3, even if the Committee  thought that downside risks to growth were becoming more palpable, it might still  wish to firm policy another notch at this meeting  If the Committee saw significant  potential for inflation to exceed expectations, it might believe that another 25 basis  point increase in the federal funds rate is necessary to balance the risks   Alternatively, the Committee might feel, given the already relatively high level of  inflation, that a significant upside surprise to inflation could be quite damaging and  would exceed the cost of a downside surprise to growth  If so, the Committee might  be willing to tighten policy a bit further to provide more insurance against persistent  high inflation The Committee might also believe that a rate increase today could be  a useful signal of its anti-inflationary resolve while, as under alternative C, suggesting  that it was not necessarily expecting to firm policy further   All that said, members may have reservations in current circumstances about  suggesting that the risks are balanced, even after the 25 basis point firming of  alternative C Such reservations may motivate the Committee to consider alternative  D, discussed in the remainder of your exhibit  Under this alternative, the Committee  would both raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting and imply that  further increases may well be in store  As noted in the middle panel, members might  be inclined to adopt alternative D for several reasons  First, the Committee might  agree that the staff forecast presents the most likely outcome for the economy and  inflation should the federal funds rate be held at its current level over coming  quarters, but it may prefer a steeper decline in inflation than in that forecast and be  willing to tolerate a slower pace of economic growth to achieve it  Indeed, as  reproduced in the bottom left-hand panel, the optimal control simulations presented in  chart 7 of the Bluebook suggest that considerable policy firming lies ahead if the  Committee wanted to pursue a 1½ percent inflation objective—especially should it  seek to attain that rate within a few years  The Committee also might believe that  appreciable further policy firming could be in prospect because it does not expect   August 8, 2006 79 of 158                                                growth to slow as much as the staff expects or because it is concerned that inflation   pressures could turn out to be more durable than forecast by the staff, a risk that is   illustrated by the “persistent inflation” scenario  As shown by the black line in the   bottom right-hand panel, if those incremental inflation pressures were fully   anticipated, optimal policy would call for boosting the federal funds rate about   75 basis points above baseline over the next year  In the optimal control case with   gradual learning (the dashed red line) or with the empirically estimated rule that   reacts only to outcomes (the dashed blue line) the policy response is more drawn out   but is eventually of similar dimensions  Should the Committee see a significant risk   of persistent inflation pressures along these lines, it may wish to continue to point to   upside risks in its announcement if it firms 25 basis points at this meeting, as in   alternative D    Your final exhibit is the version of table 1 that was distributed on Friday  Thank  you That concludes my prepared remarks      It is in alternative C, as President Minehan mentions  I think it’s simply   a question of whether or not the Committee prefers to speak in those terms, whether it would like to   mention that factor at this meeting  I don’t think the staff has a strong view on whether or not it   should be included    I do not   2       Thanks, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the material that  was distributed labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy  Alternatives”  Financial market conditions eased noticeably on balance over the  intermeeting period  As shown in the top panels of exhibit 1, ten-year nominal  Treasury yields dropped 30 basis points, the dollar declined nearly 2 percent, and  equity prices rose more than 3 percent  As portrayed in the middle left-hand panel,  the decline in Treasury yields seems to have been prompted in part by incoming  spending and production data that were generally weaker than investors anticipated  and inflation figures that were viewed as relatively benign  The labor market reports  for October and November, however, came in at or above market expectations,  interrupting the general downward trend in rates  As shown in the middle right-hand  panel, inflation compensation was little changed for the next five years, after  adjustment for carry effects, and was only a little lower for the subsequent five years   Thus, almost all the decline in nominal yields represented a drop in real rates     The bottom left-hand panel indicates that one-year nominal forward rates at the  two-year and three-year horizons dropped the most, but the decline in yields was  spread across the forward rate curve  The fact that relatively near-term forward rates  declined steeply seems consistent with an interpretation that investors marked down  their views of the cyclical strength of the economy, but the considerable drop in far  forward rates seems to suggest that investors believe that more-persistent factors are  also at work  As shown to the right, however, primary dealers and Blue Chip  forecasters revised down their forecasts for GDP growth over the five quarters ending  late next year by only about ¼ percentage point, and private forecasts of long-run or  potential GDP were essentially unchanged, leaving unanswered questions about the  source of the drop in rates     As can be seen in the top left-hand panel of exhibit 2, our three-factor term-  structure model attributes the decline in the ten-year Treasury yield over the  intermeeting period primarily to lower term premiums, the green portion of the bars   Ten-year term premiums are estimated to have declined from 31 to 12 basis points,  leaving them almost invisibly thin and around their record lows  Expected future  rates over the next ten years, the blue portion of the bars, are estimated to have  accounted for only 9 basis points of the decline  However, we have some doubts  about this estimated decomposition, in part because a sizable drop in the term  premium, which at least conceptually represents compensation for interest-rate risk,  seems hard to square with measures of interest-rate uncertainty  As shown to the                                                     2  Material used by Mr Madigan is appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   December 12, 2006 83 of 134         right, implied volatilities on Treasury yields, the black line, have edged up in recent  weeks, and uncertainty about the Eurodollar rate six months ahead, the red line, has  risen quite noticeably  Also, as shown by the blue bars in the middle left-hand panel,  the average individual uncertainty that primary dealers expressed about the stance of  policy three meetings ahead has crept up since the summer       In any case, both market participants and market economists on average anticipate   that policy easing is not far off  As indicated in the middle right-hand panel, primary  dealer economists expect that the federal funds rate will average 516 percent in the  first quarter and 482 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007  Quotes on fed funds  futures, the right-hand column, suggest that investors see an even steeper easing of  policy, with the funds rate expected to drop about ¾ percentage point over the next  year  As shown by the red bars in the bottom left-hand panel, the downward shift of  rate expectations over the intermeeting period has been accompanied by a greater  leftward skew of the distribution  As noted in the bottom right-hand panel, dealers  uniformly expect you to keep the federal funds rate unchanged today, and most  anticipate little change to the wording of the statement apart from updating the  characterization of the economic situation  A week ago, a minority expected a more  significant softening of the statement, perhaps by referencing downside risks to  growth or possibly even by describing the risks to growth and inflation as balanced;  but informal reports suggest that some have backed off such expectations in view of  Friday’s employment report     If Committee members see significant odds that the market expectation of a near-  term easing of policy could prove warranted, they might wish to start adjusting the  policy statement in that direction, as in the Bluebook’s alternative A, discussed in the  top left-hand panel of exhibit 3  While Committee members might remain concerned  about the upside risks to inflation with an unchanged federal funds rate, they might  also believe that the substantial slowing in the housing sector, relatively high  inventories in some sectors, and the sluggishness of manufacturing mean that the  downside risks to economic activity have increased and now roughly balance the  upside risks to inflation  Such an increase in downside risks could be a result of the  gradual weakening of the near-term outlook, particularly if members place some  weight on the possibility of nonlinear effects as economic growth slows  Moreover,  while we do not fully understand what investors are reacting to, policymakers may be  concerned that the decline in market rates could be signaling a degree of economic  weakness that we do not yet appreciate  Also, our estimated policy rule indicates that  maintaining rates at their current level would be consistent with the Committee’s past  behavior       On the other hand, the Committee might see the recent easing of financial   conditions as one of several considerations tilting it toward alternative C  As noted in  the top right-hand panel, financial markets evidently are imparting increased stimulus  to aggregate demand even as labor market conditions have tightened further   Members may view that stimulus as unwarranted and undesirable if their view of  economic fundamentals hasn’t changed much and may believe that at least some of it   December 12, 2006 84 of 134         should be offset by a firmer stance of monetary policy  Moreover, while core  inflation has edged lower by some measures, it may not be seen as convincingly on a  downward trend  And even if the Committee does believe that inflation is gradually  ebbing, it may be dissatisfied with the anticipated pace of that decline  These  considerations may motivate the Committee to consider firming policy today     However, the Committee might once again conclude that holding policy steady at   this meeting is likely to be consistent with achieving its goals over time while  perceiving that, if anything, modest additional firming may be required, as in  alterative B  Although the Greenbook forecast for near-term activity has been  marked down slightly, the medium-term outlook is essentially unchanged, and as  illustrated in the middle left-hand panel, the real federal funds rate remains at the  upper end of the range of model-based estimates of its short-run equilibrium and  slightly above the Greenbook-consistent measure  In the Greenbook, maintaining the  current stance of policy over the next two years produces economic growth a bit  below that of potential in 2007 and core PCE inflation that edges down slowly to  about 2 percent by 2008  While you would likely prefer stronger output growth and  lower inflation, you might find the outcome projected in the Greenbook to represent  both a plausible outcome and a reasonable balancing—given your dual objectives—of  what is actually achievable in the circumstances  As noted previously, maintaining  your stance for the near term would also be consistent with the Committee’s past  behavior, as captured in our estimated outcome-based policy rule  Similarly, as  shown in the panel to the right, optimal control simulations based on the extended  Greenbook projection and an inflation objective of 2 percent would call for holding  the federal funds rate at its current level over the next several quarters before easing  slightly     While maintaining the current stance of policy, the Committee might believe that   the risks remain tilted to the upside, as noted at the bottom of the exhibit  The  unemployment rate is below most estimates of the NAIRU, suggesting that labor  market strains could be putting upward pressure on prices, and the Committee may  consequently be concerned that inflation may not decline as in the staff’s outlook   Moreover, with core inflation recently running around 2¼ to 2½ percent, somewhat  above the preferred ranges cited by some of you, the Committee may continue to feel  that risk-management considerations argue for an assessment that the risks remain  tilted toward higher inflation, as in alternative B     Table 1 as it appeared in the Bluebook is included as exhibit 4 for your reference    Under the formulation of alternative B shown in this table, the Committee would refer  to the “substantial” cooling of the housing market, indicate that “the recent pace of  growth appears to have been somewhat more subdued than anticipated,” but still  conclude that “the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance  over coming quarters”  This alternative would retain paragraphs 3 and 4 as they  appeared in the October statement  If you found that version of section 2 too broad,  you might prefer the version of alternative B presented in exhibit 5, shown in  seasonally appropriate colors  [Laughter]  Under this formulation, in section 2 the   December 12, 2006 85 of 134         first sentence and the second clause of the second sentence would be identical to that  presented in the Bluebook  However, the first clause of the second sentence would  indicate that “some recent indicators of production and spending have been slightly  weaker than anticipated”  This formulation may be seen as superior in that, first, it  characterizes recent indicators without making a pronouncement about overall growth  for the fourth quarter and, second, it suggests that not all economic indicators have  been weak  Both the exhibit 4 and the exhibit 5 versions of alternative B seem  broadly in line with market expectations  Thank you, Mr Chairman      No, they really don’t  The three-factor term structure model doesn’t   provide a breakdown; it doesn’t allow us to distinguish between changes in risk perceptions and   risk appetite  So there’s no evidence from that score  You may be seeing some reflection of   what’s shown in the bottom left-hand panel with that pronounced downward skew to interest   rates  If investors believe that bonds could prove to be a particularly good investment, given the   possibility of economic weakness, they may actually demand a lower term premium because of   the covariances that you referenced  But I think we need to do more work on that before we   push hard on that analysis     In that respect I actually don’t see much distinction between 4 and 5    On the whole, my guess would be that it is not far from what the median market participant   expects  Dino may have a comment on this     Yes  In that comment I was referring specifically to our estimated   policy rules, which are empirical renditions of the Committee’s past behavior  If you have the   Bluebook handy, in chart 7, right at the bottom under “Memo,” two policy rules are referenced—  the estimated outcome-based rule and the estimated forecast-based rule  Both of them show the   federal funds rate in the vicinity of 5¼ percent  If you look at the top part of that panel, being   careful to look at the corrected version that we sent around late last week, a number of those   rules suggest somewhat higher federal funds rate paths  Of course, it depends on the inflation   December 12, 2006 87 of 134         objective  An important distinction between the upper and lower parts of that panel is that the   lower part doesn’t have any direct evidence on what the Committee’s inflation objective is  So   your question partly gets to what people would be expecting if they had a specific inflation   objective in mind that is different from what is incorporated in the upper part of the panel     I think the basic answer to that is “yes,” but there are perhaps things   going on here at a cyclical level and at a more structural level  Chairman Bernanke’s hypothesis   was more of a structural or a secular explanation of interest rates  What we’re seeing in the   upper panel of chart 5 obviously has important cyclical characteristics with, among other things,   investment spending being depressed for quite a while in the aftermath of the bubble that   apparently prevailed earlier   December 12, 2006 88 of 134           One point to make in that regard is that, to the extent you take a very   highly articulated model like FRB/US as a reasonable representation of the way the world works,   it tells you that equilibrium real interest rates are determined by a broad range of factors  There   is no real presumption that there is constant level to which it returns over time without   considerations of those exogenous variables     Unless you have some reason for thinking that market participants’   uncertainty about future inflation pressures, spending, profits, and so forth or risk aversion tends   to change rapidly, I would say “no”     Well, I assume just generally stronger real-side data—as the   Committee has been discussing today, some firmer indication perhaps that the downturn in   housing is leveling out and that overall the economy is growing at a solid pace      Thank you very much  2  I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for FOMC   Briefing on Trial-Run Projections”  As in shown line 1 of the top panel of exhibit 1,  the central tendency of your current forecasts for real GDP growth for the second half  of 2007 is 20 to 27 percent  Combined with the BEA’s estimate of 20 percent  growth in the first half, your projections imply a central tendency for the year of 20  to 23 percent, down 02 percentage point from the June trial run  The growth rates  for 2008 and 2009 were revised down by a similar amount and now center on about  25 percent  As can be seen by comparing rows 3 and 4, the central tendencies of the  projections for the unemployment rates at the end of 2007, 2008, and 2009 are  essentially the same as in June  The downward revisions to real GDP growth together  with the unchanged forecasts for unemployment suggest that, like the staff, many of  you revised down your estimates of potential GDP growth about ¼ percentage point   Still, as in June, FOMC participants generally are a bit more optimistic than the staff  about potential growth  Indeed, many of you made those points in your forecast  narratives  As shown in row 5, the central tendency for core PCE inflation for the  second half of 2007 is 19 to 21 percent  Together with the 19 percent rate for the  first half, this implies a central tendency of 19 to 20 percent core inflation for the  2007 as a whole, down slightly from the June projections  The central tendencies for  the next two years are nearly identical to those in June, with the midpoint edging  down over time  The central tendencies for total PCE inflation, line 7, collected for  the first time in the current exercise, are similar to those for core inflation for 2008  and 2009  The central tendencies of your projections for core inflation this year and  next lie just below the corresponding staff forecasts, and the central tendencies of  your projections for unemployment late this year and next are also just below the staff  forecasts  These comparisons suggest that many of you have a somewhat lower  estimate of NAIRU than the staff’s estimate of 50 percent, a point that some of you  made explicitly in your narratives     In earlier discussions of the role that your projections might play in enhancing the   Committee’s communications, some of you noted that extending the time horizon for  your projections would give the public more information about your estimates of  potential GDP growth and your judgments about optimal or acceptable trend  inflation  To the extent that argument is correct, the 11 percentage point range of  your projections for GDP growth in 2009, shown in line 1 of the middle panel of  exhibit 1, suggests noticeable dispersion in your views of potential growth, though  those growth rates may also be affected by projected adjustments toward inflation  rates that you see as desirable  The range of your projections for total inflation in  2009, line 7, is not quite as wide, suggesting somewhat greater commonality in your  views about the rate of inflation consistent with price stability; and the range for your  core inflation forecasts in 2009, line 5, is a bit narrower, remaining at 15 to 2 percent                                                      2 Materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   August 7, 2007 24 of 136    As shown in the bottom panel, most of you again characterized the appropriate path  for the federal funds rate as broadly similar to the Greenbook assumption  As in  June, a few of you assumed a modestly lower path for the federal funds rate,  evidently reflecting expectations of more-favorable aggregate supply conditions than  in the Greenbook forecast, while two assumed an increase in the fed funds rate later  this year or early next year (followed by a reduction) to foster more disinflation     Exhibit 2 summarizes the results on uncertainty and skews  You were asked to   characterize your judgment of the uncertainty attached to your projections relative to  levels of uncertainty over the past twenty years and to indicate your judgment of the  risk-weighting around your projections  As shown in the top two panels, about two- thirds of you see uncertainty about growth as broadly similar to that experienced  historically and see the risks around your growth projections as broadly balanced   Compared with the situation in June, however, a few more of you see greater  uncertainty than historically; and a few more view the risks as tilted to the downside   Similarly, with regard to the outlook for unemployment, not shown, noticeably more  of you than in June see the risks as tilted to the upside  With respect to core inflation,  the middle two charts show that almost all of you again judge that the uncertainty  attached to your projections is similar to past levels, while the number of you who see  the risks as tilted to the upside edged down  As shown in the bottom panels, your  judgments about the uncertainty and risks for total inflation are nearly the same as  those for core inflation     I would like to end on a personal note  As the Chairman noted, Vincent Reinhart   will be leaving us  Vincent joined the Board’s staff in 1988  For a while, Debbie  Danker and I oversaw Vincent’s work, but before long Don and the Board recognized  prodigious talent, and eventually the tables were turned  [Laughter]  The Chairman  has already indicated how the Board and the FOMC have benefited from Vincent’s  unparalleled expertise and work ethic  But I want to note that we on the staff have  benefited equally, from Vincent’s generous contributions to our research, current  analysis, and policy work and from his insightful and creative approaches to day-to- day management issues  Finally, Vincent’s eclectic wardrobe was useful to the staff  in generating random numbers for stochastic model simulations  [Laughter]  On any  given day, for any given occasion, whether he would choose to show up snazzy or  shabby was perfectly unpredictable  Vincent, all members of the Federal Reserve  staff have been proud to be associated with you  We will miss you  Thank you, Mr  Chairman    3  Thanks, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  Financial  markets have experienced exceptional strains over the intermeeting period  The  Bluebook provided a thorough review of these developments through Thursday, and I  had intended to provide only a brief summary of and update on those developments,  as in exhibit 1, and some thoughts on their implications for monetary policy  But  given the extensive discussions of this topic so far this morning, those points seem all  to have been made, and I will turn directly to a discussion of policy alternatives       As noted at the top of exhibit 2, the risk of weakness in aggregate demand   stemming from tighter credit conditions and disruptions in credit flows formed part of  the rationale for the 25 basis point easing of alternative A that was presented in the  Bluebook  Even if your views about the modal outlook are similar to the Greenbook  baseline forecast, you may be concerned that the deterioration in credit conditions, the  significant increase in market volatility, and potential declines in confidence have  tilted the risks to growth distinctly to the downside  You may also see the recent  spate of soft spending indicators as having raised the likelihood of sluggish growth in  aggregate demand  The considerable gap between the Greenbook-consistent real  federal funds rate, the dashed green line in the panel to the right, and the range of  model-based estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate, shown in red, may  add to questions about the possibility of weaker growth than in the staff forecast and  reinforce your belief that some easing of policy is appropriate  Moreover, you may  be more optimistic than the staff about either productivity growth or the NAIRU or  both  Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, several of you noted just such optimism in the  narratives accompanying your trial-run projections  The financial stimulus from a  policy easing, of course, would help support growth directly  A policy action might  be highly potent in current circumstances, possibly helping to buoy consumer and  business confidence in a period when sentiment may well be deteriorating  You may                                                     3 Materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   August 7, 2007 86 of 136    also believe that the inflation outlook would support a near-term policy easing  Core  inflation readings have been relatively subdued in recent months, wage growth seems  to have remained moderate, and labor market pressures may be starting to ease,  although the evidence on that score is so far quite limited  In the staff forecast, core  inflation converges toward 2 percent, an outcome that, judging by your projections,  some of you would find acceptable—and your forecasts suggest that you think the  odds favor a prompter and slightly steeper decline in inflation     In contrast, as noted in the bottom left-hand panel, you may concur with the   Greenbook forecast for spending and prices, given its policy assumptions, but judge  that the forecasted trajectory for inflation is too slow and leaves inflation at a level  that is too high to foster optimal economic performance  If so, you may be inclined to  firm policy ¼ percentage point, as in alternative C  The decline in core inflation in  the Greenbook is slight and slow  As shown in the bottom right panel, the optimal  control simulation in the Bluebook based on a 1½ percent target for core PCE  inflation suggests an increase in the federal funds rate of about ¾ percentage point  over the next year  Credibility or learning effects that might flow from a policy  firming, as in the simulation, could limit the output and employment sacrifice  necessary to foster a lower path for inflation  Moreover, you may agree with the  staff’s baseline assumption that the effects of current market strains will prove  temporary, that markets will soon resume clearing, albeit at higher and perhaps more- rational and more-sustainable spreads, and that the restraint on aggregate demand will  be modest  Finally, you might see the risks to the inflation outlook as tilted to the  upside, given high levels of resource utilization and increased energy prices      Alternative B, discussed in exhibit 3, may be seen as an appropriate balancing of   the considerations motivating alternative A, on the one hand, and alternative C, on the  other  Under this alternative, the Committee would leave the stance of policy  unchanged today  The statement would acknowledge the recent volatility of financial  markets and tighter credit conditions but would also convey an expectation that  moderate growth will likely continue  Core inflation would be characterized as  subdued in recent months but subject to upside risk  The Committee would expressly  refer to increased downside risk to growth but indicate that its predominant policy  concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected     A rationale for alternative B is laid out in the upper left-hand panel  In the   baseline Greenbook forecast, the economy expands at a moderate pace, resource  pressures ease slightly, and core inflation ebbs to 2 percent with the federal funds rate  held at its current level through next year  That forecast may be close to your own  view about the modal result, and you may see it as an acceptable outcome  As shown  to the right, optimal control simulations based on the Greenbook baseline and an  assumed core inflation objective of 2 percent would suggest leaving the federal funds  rate unchanged for the rest of the year before easing slightly  Returning to the left- hand panel, holding steady at this meeting would also be consistent with the  Committee’s past behavior as captured by the estimated outcome-based and forecast- based policy rules presented in the Bluebook    August 7, 2007 87 of 136       You may also believe that alternative B represents a suitable weighting of the   risks  For example, even if you are a bit more optimistic about potential growth and  the NAIRU than the staff, you may nonetheless see maintaining the federal funds rate  at its current level as an appropriate risk-management approach, given the upside  risks to inflation and the higher costs should they be realized  Careful consideration  of the most recent developments also may incline you toward alternative B  In  particular, even if the incoming data and increased financial market strains of recent  weeks incline you to believe that the downside risks to growth have increased, you  may be quite unsure about the extent of those risks and not wish to exaggerate them   As suggested by yesterday’s developments, it is not inconceivable that markets will  soon begin to right themselves and that the Greenbook baseline assumption of only  modest financial restraint will prove correct  In these circumstances, watchful  waiting may be the best approach in order to allow more information to accumulate  that will enable you to better assess the likely eventual adjustments of market prices  and flows and the appropriate policy response  Indeed, you may be especially  concerned about the risk of overreacting (or being perceived as overreacting) to  temporary market developments—particularly if you see a significant probability that  markets could misinterpret changes in the stance of policy, or in your words, as an  indication that you place a higher priority on financial market stability or economic  growth than on price stability  Moreover, your inflation concerns may not have  diminished much, if at all, over the intermeeting period  While the most recent core  inflation readings have been relatively low, you may concur with the staff that some  of that good performance will likely prove transitory  Also, overall inflation has  remained high, and with resource utilization elevated, you may be worried that high  rates of overall inflation could allow inflation expectations to move higher        The statement associated with the revised version of alternative B is provided in   the bottom panel  Given the volatile market conditions of late, getting a reliable read  on market participants’ expectations at this point is difficult, but an announcement  roughly along these lines seems to be anticipated by most market participants   Notably, the statement explicitly mentions downside risks to growth  That mention  may be seen as opening the door a crack to future easing or at least giving the  Committee greater scope to move in that direction  Although only a minority of  market participants apparently expect the Committee to point explicitly to downside  risks to growth, a sizable market reaction to the inclusion of such a reference in  paragraph 4 seems unlikely, as the Committee still would state that inflation risks are  its predominant concern      The final exhibit is an updated version of table 1 for your reference  Changes   relative to the Bluebook are shown in red      Well, as I said earlier, it’s a little hard to judge market reactions right   now, given the flux in financial markets  That said, I do think that the introduction of “downside   risks,” as an explicit phrase in the statement will obviously not be overlooked by market   participants, [laughter] and I think that they will see it as at least some slight shift in the   Committee’s body English  With regard to “predominant,” that’s just another step in the same   direction—and I think maybe even a bigger shift    I just want to point out, Mr Chairman, that those two clauses seem to   overlap to a considerable degree, “tighter risk premiums” and “tighter credit conditions”  It’s not   clear to me precisely what distinction we’re trying to draw there    So it raises a question in my mind as to why the first clause is necessary     No, that was complete, Mr Chairman     The only point I’d add, Mr Chairman, has already been made  But just   to reiterate, the lower the spread over the target federal funds rate, the more difficult it becomes to   maintain a “no questions asked” facility because it obviously becomes more attractive at the margin,   particularly for smaller banks whose cost of funds may be a bit above the target federal funds rate at   the margin    Governor Mishkin, it’s not clear that, once we’re back to normal, there   should be any persistent problem  I think the issue, as Bill Dudley said, is that it is very difficult to   judge  We’ve had no experience with any spread other than 100 basis points    Is that “appreciably” or “significantly”?     That would include brokered trades and nonbrokered trades    There is not a regular data source  2  I will be referring to the table in the package labeled   “Material for FOMC Briefing on September Trial-Run Projections”  I will first focus  on the near term  The upper panel of the table shows the forecasts for the second half  of the year that are implied by the estimates that you submitted for the first half of  2007 and your projections for the year as a whole  Participants revised down their  expectations for real GDP growth in the second half of 2007 by several tenths of a  percentage point  Most of you cited the steeper-than-expected downturn in housing  markets and tighter credit conditions as key factors  The downward revision to output  growth was accompanied by a slight upward revision to the unemployment rate   Your forecast for total inflation in the second half of this year was revised down  noticeably, but the central tendency for core inflation was unrevised  Almost all of  you conditioned your outlook on near-term monetary policy easing  A slight majority  characterized the Greenbook’s assumption of a 50 basis point near-term reduction in  the target funds rate as appropriate monetary policy, but almost as many think a  somewhat larger cumulative decline will prove appropriate     The lower panel shows your annual forecasts  The central tendency for GDP   growth in 2008 was revised down about ¼ percentage point and now centers on about  2¼ percent rather than 2½ percent  The central tendency for the unemployment rate  at the end of the year revised up 02 percentage point  Your total inflation forecast for  next year edged down 01 percentage point, but the central tendency of your core  projections was unchanged  You also again characterized your views of uncertainty  relative to historical norms and skews  Those views presumably apply primarily to  the relatively near term outlook  Most of you again see risks to growth as tilted to the  downside  In contrast, almost all of you now see inflation risks as roughly balanced  rather than as tilted to the upside  A majority of you judge that the uncertainty  attending the prospects for economic activity is greater than has been typical in the  past     Looking further ahead, the projections for 2009 changed little  For the first time,   you submitted forecasts for 2010  The forecasts for those years and your commentary  suggest that most of you see actual and potential GDP growth over that period at  around 2½ percent, a bit above the staff’s estimate  The unemployment rate hovers  just below 5 percent  (Let me note at this point that in the table there is a typo in the  2009 column for the unemployment rate  The central tendency of August projections  should read 47 to 50 percent)  With the unemployment rate just a bit above the  4¾ percent that a number of you have identified as your estimate of the NAIRU, both  core inflation and total inflation are expected to edge lower in the out years—at least  if you squint hard and focus particularly on the lower bound of the central tendencies   [Laughter]  Your forecasts for core and total inflation in 2009 are essentially  unrevised—not surprisingly, if you view those forecasts as reflecting to an important                                                     2 Materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   September 18, 2007 25 of 188    degree your longer-run objectives  The relatively narrow central tendencies and  ranges for total and core inflation in 2009 and 2010 suggest substantial agreement in  your views on this score  That concludes our presentation    3  Thank you, Mr Chairman   To guard against the contingency  that our security procedures have broken down and the Committee’s policy drafts are  being monitored by unknown forces, the staff has taken countermeasures by  circulating multiple drafts of table 1  [Laughter]  Of the two drafts circulated this  morning, I will be referring to the draft labeled, perhaps too obviously, September 18,  2007  To summarize, alternatives A and B would both reduce the target federal funds  rate 50 basis points today to 4¾ percent but would differ in their risk assessment   Alternative A would conclude that, even after the 50 basis point easing, the downside  risks to growth would outweigh the upside risks to inflation, whereas alternative B  elides an assessment of the balance of risks but cites heightened uncertainty about the  outlook  Alternative C reduces rates 25 basis points and describes the risks as tilted  to the downside  Alternative D leaves the stance of policy unchanged but would  characterize the risks to growth and inflation as now balanced  Based on your  remarks this morning and the proposals by nearly all the Reserve Banks to reduce the  primary credit rate, it seems likely that most or all of you favor some easing in the  stance of policy today  Thus, the questions this morning would seem to be how much  to reduce rates as well as the rationale for that action and the type of forward-looking  language to provide       The modal outlook in the staff’s Greenbook forecast would seem to argue clearly   for policy easing before long  The staff has interpreted recent financial developments  as likely to inflict an appreciable and fairly immediate adverse shock on aggregate  demand  As Dave noted, real GDP growth is projected to slow to 1 percent in the  fourth quarter and to remain nearly that sluggish in the first quarter  The economy  skirts recession, but real activity expands only 1¾ percent next year, less than  potential, so modest slack emerges, and the unemployment rate rises to nearly  5 percent, a bit above the staff’s downward-revised estimate of the NAIRU  This  slack contributes to an edging down of core inflation to just under 2 percent, and  declines in energy prices help push total PCE inflation down to 1¾ percent next year   Beyond next year, real growth gradually strengthens to around its potential rate  As I  noted earlier today, the central tendencies of your out-year projections suggest that  most of you would find a PCE inflation rate leveling out in the vicinity of 1¾ percent,  in conjunction with economic growth returning to a potential rate of around  2½ percent—a rate a bit higher than estimated by the staff—to be an appealing  outcome     Of course, while you may be satisfied with such an outcome, the key question is   what monetary policy path would be most likely to produce it  In the staff’s baseline  assessment, a 50 basis point easing in the federal funds rate over the next few months  sufficiently cushions the blow of the current financial shock to keep the expansion  going in coming quarters while still allowing inflation to settle down to rates that                                                     3 Materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   September 18, 2007 95 of 188    most of you evidently would find consistent with price stability  If your own modal  outlook is similar to the staff’s baseline assessment, you might find the selection of  any of alternatives A, B, or C at this meeting to be appropriate  An immediate  50 basis point reduction, as in alternatives A and B, would accelerate the drop in the  actual federal funds rate by just a month or two relative to the Greenbook  A 25 basis  point easing today coupled with an assessment that the risks are tilted to the  downside, as in alternative C, and an expectation on your part that another easing  would likely be forthcoming would also be essentially consistent with the staff  outlook  Thus, your choices among those three approaches might depend importantly  on risk-management considerations         Several of the Greenbook alternative simulations explore the possibility that   policy might need to be eased more aggressively  In the “greater housing correction”  scenario, the subprime mortgage market is assumed to remain closed over the entire  projection period rather than to recover partially as in the baseline, and housing prices  decline 20 percent over the next two years, rather than just a few percent  In such  circumstances, aggregate demand weakens considerably below baseline, and the  Taylor rule suggests that the funds rate should gradually be eased to 4¼ percent by  2009  The “greater housing correction with larger wealth effect” scenario, in which  the effects of the greater housing contraction are augmented by a larger sensitivity of  household spending to household wealth, points to an even greater easing  Another  possibility is that forced acquisition by banks of large volumes of ABCP, leveraged  loans, and other assets erodes their capital ratios, bringing them closer to regulatory  thresholds and benchmarks negotiated with rating agencies, and that banks respond  by tightening credit terms and standards  Partly because episodes featuring sharp  changes in credit availability are relatively rare, assessing these effects is fraught with  uncertainty  But the “bank capital crunch” scenario in the Greenbook, which was  based loosely on the early 1990s headwinds episode, suggests that policy might need  to be eased significantly and quickly, with the funds rate dipping to 3¼ percent by  June       If Committee members are inclined to put appreciable weight on the possibility   that something resembling any of these three scenarios could transpire, they might be  inclined toward alternative A—an immediate reduction in the funds rate of 50 basis  points at this meeting coupled with an assessment that the risks remain tilted to the  downside  The effects of a preemptive easing of policy—working through the  standard transmission channels of lower long-term yields, a lower exchange value of  the dollar, and higher equity prices and household wealth—might help cushion the  economy from a sharp weakening of aggregate demand  In current circumstances, a  relatively aggressive easing of policy and the sense that more could be coming if  needed might be particularly helpful in thawing financial markets or at least in  preventing a harder freeze and thus might work importantly through credit channels  as well as directly through open market prices  A relatively large and immediate  reduction in the federal funds rate might go some considerable distance toward  alleviating concerns on the part of market participants regarding further erosion in the  value of assets held as collateral  It might also be seen by investors as a signal that   September 18, 2007 96 of 188    the Federal Reserve will act forcefully to sustain economic growth, helping to limit  lenders’ concerns about losses  By reducing the fears of market participants and  bankers about counterparty credit exposures and credit risks more generally—or at  least helping to prevent them from worsening—a prompt and sharp easing of policy  might help avert a significant tightening in credit terms and standards and thus sustain  growth in aggregate demand  In this way, monetary policy might be directed  proximately at improving the functioning of financial markets but ultimately at the  Committee’s longer-run objectives  This argument is easy both to misconstrue and to  exaggerate—easy to misconstrue because it may appear that policy is responding  directly to asset prices and easy to exaggerate because policy easing cannot do much  to dispel the fundamental economic losses already in train, for example, on subprime  mortgage investments  But it may be able to help prevent them from contributing to a  cumulative weakening of activity that would increase credit risks more generally and  feed back adversely onto growth     On the other hand, the Committee may not be persuaded that the hit to aggregate   demand will be as severe as projected by the staff in its baseline forecast, let alone in  the weaker alternative simulations in the Greenbook  Members may feel that at least  some of the history of financial crises over the past two decades suggests that  financial markets can bounce back fairly quickly once the immediate crisis has passed  and that the real economy can be surprisingly resilient in the face of temporary  financial disruptions  Both 1987 and 1998 come to mind, as was pointed out  previously, as episodes in which, at least arguably, the restraining effects of financial  events on the domestic economy were not nearly as severe as policymakers feared  A  separate point is that many of you see potential GDP growth as a bit more robust than  the staff, suggesting that you may also see equilibrium real short-term interest rates as  a bit higher  Coming back to the near-term outlook for aggregate demand, even if  you think that the staff may be right about the likely degree of forthcoming financial  restraint, you may be quite uncertain on that score  Any of these arguments may  motivate you to consider the approach of alternative C  Under that alternative, you  would ease 25 basis points today and issue a statement that characterizes the  downside risks to growth as outweighing the upside risks to inflation  Such an  assessment would position you well to respond to incoming signs of economic  weakness, should they appear, by easing policy at some point over the next meeting  or two  This approach might also be seen as advantageous if you are particularly  concerned that the Committee would find it difficult to quickly reverse easing moves  that subsequently proved to be unnecessary  You might also prefer a 25 basis point  rate cut for now if you are concerned that investors could misread a 50 basis point  easing as a sign that the Committee was responding directly to asset prices,  potentially exacerbating moral hazard by encouraging excessive risk-taking        Alternative B may be seen as the middle ground between alternatives A and C    Alternative B would adopt the more aggressive 50 basis point policy easing of  alternative A but would not make an explicit assessment of the balance of risks and  thus would provide no direct indication that the Committee was considering a further  easing move  As noted in the Bluebook, adoption of alternative B would be   September 18, 2007 97 of 188    consistent with the 50 basis point downward revision to the Greenbook-consistent  measure of r*  Policy easing of roughly that magnitude over the next several quarters  would also be consistent with the optimal policy calculations under a 2 percent  inflation rule as well as with a number of the policy rules presented in the Bluebook   Even if you are not sure that the adverse effects on aggregate demand of ongoing  financial developments will be as severe as built into the Greenbook baseline, you  may be concerned enough to judge that a 50 basis point easing of policy today would  provide a measure of insurance that could prove valuable if, as seems likely at a  minimum, further financial aftershocks become evident  As I noted, the risk  assessment proposed for alternative B is relatively open-ended  The current version  suggests being explicit that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased; for  that reason, it does not provide an explicit risk assessment You may believe, given  considerable uncertainty about the implications of financial developments to date and  their likely course going forward, that characterizing the balance of risks would be  quite difficult and may lack credibility  For the same reasons, you may find  appealing the noncommittal approach of this alternative regarding future rate actions      As Bill Dudley noted, market expectations for the path of monetary policy have   fallen sharply over the intermeeting period  At the moment, market participants seem  to put substantial odds on both a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point easing today— although, given the modest improvement in credit markets over the past few days, the  former is now seen as somewhat more likely  Short-term rates would likely drop a  little under alternative B and more sharply under A, whereas they might move up a  little under C  Longer-term yields could decline noticeably under alternative A if the  statement and the action prompted greater concern among market participants about  the outlook  The inconclusive risk assessment of alternative B would likely surprise  market participants and might prompt some volatility as they attempted to discern  your message  But all things considered, the rate actions and the statements  associated with alternatives B and C do not seem sharply at odds with expectations,  and we would not expect large net market reactions      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Your introductory remarks and the  questioning and some answers that we just had covered some of the points that I was   September 18, 2007 130 of 188    going to make in my introductory comments  It has been a long day already, and you  received a detailed memo  So in view of that, we thought we would abbreviate our  briefings relative to what we had initially planned     In response to recent developments, as you know, the staff has proposed   consideration of a set of responses that could be coordinated with actions of foreign  central banks  We distributed considerable material to you on Friday, the gist of  which is proposing an auction credit facility and swap lines for foreign central banks   I’d like to note that a large number of staff here at the Board and at the New York Fed  contributed intensive work to that document and to planning for the facility more  generally, and I’d like to mention Pat Parkinson and Myron Kwast, whose names  were inadvertently omitted from the list of authors     Under the proposed facility, the Federal Reserve would auction blocks of   collateralized twenty-eight-day discount window credit to institutions eligible to  borrow from our primary credit program  As the Chairman said, based on discussions  with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, we understand that  those institutions are interested in conducting parallel auctions of term dollar credit to  institutions located in their jurisdictions  Those institutions have requested, but to  date only on a preliminary basis, the establishment of reciprocal currency swaps lines  on which they would draw to fund the extensions of dollar credit under such auctions   We have provisionally assumed that $20 billion of twenty-eight-day ACF loans  would be auctioned each week over the course of four weeks, building up to a  maximum of $80 billion  The ECB would, similarly, auction up to $40 billion, and  the Swiss National Bank would auction up to a total of $20 billion     Jim Clouse was going to present a briefing providing additional background on   the markets and the pros and cons of the proposal, but we have decided to skip that at  this point in the interest of time  Jim could answer questions on that if you’d like   But you may not have had a chance to absorb the details of the implementation, and  the Reserve Bank Presidents in particular as well as the Board members may be  interested in them  Sandy Krieger will talk a little about that, and then Karen Johnson  will wrap up with some comments on the swap line  Sandy?      They will be able to bid in both, President Fisher    September 18, 2007 133 of 188     One point in this regard, Governor Kroszner, is that we’ll be taking   the bids over the telephone  That just means that there is going to be a certain amount of time   depending on how many bidders show up  It’s not a fully automated process     Well, partly by auctioning credit, so institutions are coming to the   Federal Reserve voluntarily and paying a price that is market based  Another point is that the   institutions are regarded as generally sound  They have to meet a certain qualification standard   to get to the discount window, and we would be taking certain steps in terms of our reports to try   to distinguish this from other discount window credit  Now, that said, I think we have to admit   that we’re not sure the degree to which this would deal with the stigma issue    Of course, this wouldn’t substitute at all for secondary credit, by   construction   2  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for FOMC   Briefing on October Projections”  The table shows the central tendencies and ranges  of your current forecasts for 2007 and the next three years  Where available, the  central tendencies and ranges of the projections last published by the  Committee―those submitted for inclusion in the July Monetary Policy Report―are  shown in italics                                                          2 Materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   October 30-31, 2007 14 of 162    Notably, a majority of you conditioned your current projections on an easing of  monetary policy, with most of that majority apparently seeing lower rates as  appropriate either imminently or within the next six months or so  Even with that  assumed easing, your GDP growth forecasts for 2007 have been marked down  slightly since last June, and your outlook for next year has been revised down more  substantially  Many of you noted that last summer’s NIPA revisions led you to lower  your estimate of potential GDP growth  Most of you cited the intensification of the  downturn in housing markets, the turmoil in financial markets, and higher oil prices  as factors leading you to scale back your expectations for actual growth in 2007 and  2008, though some participants commented that rising net exports could provide  support to aggregate demand  The central tendency of the economic growth forecasts  for 2008 is now 18 percent to 25 percent, below the central tendency of 2½ percent  to 2¾ percent in June  Perhaps partly because you expect easing whereas the staff  assumed an unchanged stance of policy, the central tendency of your economic  growth projections is above the Greenbook forecast of 17 percent for real economic  growth in 2008  That difference may also reflect your somewhat more optimistic  view of potential growth  It is worth noting that the divergence among your views  concerning the outlook for next year has widened substantially  The width of the  central tendency, for example, at nearly ¾ percentage point, is about three times that  in the June projections       The downward revision to the outlook for GDP growth was mirrored in a small   upward revision to the unemployment rate  The central tendency of the projections  for unemployment at the end of this year is around 4¾ percent, and it centers on a rate  just under 5 percent at the end of next year  Based on the comments that some of you  have made about sustainable rates of unemployment and on your longer-run  unemployment projections, many of you apparently predict the emergence of a small  amount of slack by the end of next year       With incoming data on core inflation a bit better than you had expected and with   some slack likely next year, the central tendency of your projections for core PCE  inflation is down noticeably for 2007 and is a shade lower for 2008; most of you now  see core inflation below 2 percent in both years  Your near-term forecasts for total  PCE inflation are higher than those for core inflation, reflecting surging energy prices  and, in some cases, an expectation of continued brisk increases in food prices        With regard to the uncertainties in the outlook, most of you see the risks to growth   as tilted to the downside—even with an assumed easing of policy—and judge that the  degree of uncertainty regarding prospects for economic activity is unusually high  relative to average levels over the past twenty years  Your commentaries highlighted  downside risks arising from the possibility that financial market turmoil and tighter  credit conditions could exert unexpectedly large restraint on household and business  spending and that the downturn in housing could prove even steeper than currently  anticipated  A slight majority perceived the risks to total inflation as broadly  balanced, and a more sizable majority judged that the risks to core inflation are in  balance; in both cases, those in the minority saw the risk to inflation as tilted to the   October 30-31, 2007 15 of 162    upside  As the experience in the September trial run highlighted, the Committee’s  policy statement will need to be reviewed carefully for potential inconsistencies with  the risk assessments submitted with the projections  I will return to that issue  tomorrow        Turning to the longer-horizon forecasts, you expect real GDP growth of around   2½ percent and unemployment slightly above 4¾ percent in both 2009 and 2010   Judging from your forecast narratives, these projections are close to your estimates of  the economy’s potential growth rate and the level of the NAIRU  The former is a bit  higher than the staff estimate of about 21 percent potential growth, and the latter is  close to the staff estimate  For 2009 and 2010, all of your core inflation forecasts are  in a range of 1½ to 2 percent  A couple of you expect rising prices of food and  energy to keep total inflation above 2 percent in 2009, but all of your forecasts for  total inflation are within a range of 1½ to 2 percent in 2010  Many of you state that  you view your projections for inflation in 2010 as consistent with price stability      Mr Chairman, I would just like to take this opportunity to remind the   Committee that you will have the opportunity to revise your projections that you submitted a few   days ago in light of the information available through the time of this meeting—of course   including the data that were released this morning  We would need to get your revised   projections by close of business tomorrow  4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  That  package includes two versions of table 1  The first is the version that was discussed  in the Bluebook, and the second is a revised version dated October 31  The revised  table presents basically the same policy alternatives as the Bluebook version but with  some changes in the rationale and risk assessment sections  To review, alternatives B  and C contemplate leaving the stance of policy unchanged today, but they differ  importantly in their assessments of risk  Alternative C characterizes the downside  risks to growth as roughly offsetting the upside risks to inflation, whereas alternative  B indicates that the downside risks to growth are the Committee’s greater policy  concern  Alternative A, in contrast, eases the stance of monetary policy 25 basis  points and indicates that the Committee assesses the risks to growth and inflation as  roughly in balance  In discussing these alternatives, I will basically be working from  right to left across the two versions of the table      As Dave Stockton discussed yesterday in response to a question from Vice   Chairman Geithner, the Greenbook projection is a modal forecast  Without  consideration of risks, the Greenbook analysis would seem to support the  Committee’s selection of alternative C  In that forecast, which is conditioned on the  federal funds rate remaining at 4¾ percent, economic growth slows in the near term,  and below-trend growth over the next few quarters closes the small positive output  gap that the staff sees as currently prevailing  Maintaining the present stance of  monetary policy leads to a gradual strengthening of the expansion over 2008 and  2009 and by enough to leave the economy producing at its capacity  Core inflation  stays under 2 percent, while total inflation runs a bit lower, reflecting declining  energy prices  Judging by your projections, most of you would find such a trajectory  for inflation satisfactory, at least for the next couple of years if not over the longer  term  Your projection submissions, however, as well as your comments yesterday,  suggest that many of you see less vigor in aggregate demand than the Greenbook does  as well as appreciable downside risks—an outlook that might argue against  alternative C  The Greenbook provided several alternative simulations involving  greater weakness in housing and larger fallout from financial stress that illustrate  some prominent risks to spending; they suggested that the path of the federal funds  rate might need to run ¾ percentage point or more below baseline should such  weakness in aggregate demand eventuate        The choice of alternative B could be consistent with a modal expectation along   the lines of the Greenbook coupled with appreciable concerns about downside risks  and a judgment that you need to await additional information before deciding whether  to ease policy further  As noted in alternative B, section 2, of either version, the  statement would in effect explain the decision to stand pat, first, by recognizing that  economic growth last quarter was solid and perhaps conveying the implicit  suggestion that the economy was likely to continue to expand at an acceptable pace,  even if growth were to slow temporarily; second, by noting that strains in financial  markets have eased somewhat on balance; and third, by indicating that the domestic                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   October 30-31, 2007 82 of 162    economy apart from housing has proven resilient and that the global economy  remains strong  At the same time, the statement would indicate that the Committee is  concerned about downside risks to growth, explicitly citing the potential effect of  tightening credit conditions  Regarding inflation, the language would be identical to  that used in September  The statement would conclude by indicating that, on balance,  the Committee saw the downside risks to growth as the greater policy concern        As Bill Dudley noted, the market was all but certain as of yesterday that you will   ease policy today 25 basis points  Today, in response to the economic data released  earlier, intermediate and longer-term interest rates have risen somewhat; however,  futures quotes still suggest that investors now see high odds that you will ease policy  today  Thus, the announcement of an unchanged stance of policy would come as a  considerable surprise to markets  To be sure, the assessment under alternative B that  the downside risks are the greater policy concern and its implication that further  easing might well be forthcoming before long would soften the blow  But a selloff in  bond and equity markets would no doubt ensue  Moreover, financial asset prices  could remain volatile for a time, as investors attempted to recalibrate their  expectations of the probable path of monetary policy going forward      Concern about such market reactions clearly would not persuade you to ease   policy at this meeting if you judged that an unchanged stance of policy would likely  be more consistent with maximum employment and stable prices, and hitching  monetary policy to market expectations would make for extremely poor economic  outcomes  But especially in circumstances of persisting financial strains, concern  about unnecessarily adding to those strains might incline you a bit more toward  easing, as in alternative A, if you were already strongly leaning that way today based  on your view of economic and financial fundamentals  As I noted yesterday, your  economic projections suggest that most of you believe that the stance of policy should  be eased within the next six to twelve months, and many of you indicated that some  easing was appropriate imminently  You may see several reasons for preferring to  move earlier rather than later  In particular, you may think that a timely reduction in  interest rates could be valuable now in buoying household, business, and investor  confidence  Yesterday the Chairman noted the possibility of a vicious cycle  involving a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook and tightening credit conditions   By bolstering confidence in the outlook, easing policy as expected could help reduce  concerns about deteriorating economic fundamentals and declining asset values   Beyond reducing the risks of nonlinear responses, easing policy as expected by  market participants would support growth of aggregate demand over time through the  usual channels        Of course, you may also be worried about a possible increase in inflation  Such   concerns may reflect a variety of factors—the further sharp increase in oil prices of  recent weeks, the depreciation of the dollar, accelerating unit labor costs, and perhaps  the relatively high level of resource utilization  But given the recent good inflation  performance, you may feel that downside risks to growth are the more immediate  danger and believe that further easing today to address those risks is warranted  You   October 30-31, 2007 83 of 162    may also believe that, should the easing eventually appear to have been unnecessary,  you could act as quickly to remove stimulus as you did to put it in place  If you were  inclined toward easing policy another 25 basis points at this meeting, you would need  to confront the question of the appropriate statement language  In both versions of  alternative A, the first two sentences of section 2 are similar to those proposed for  alternative B  But rather than emphasizing remaining downside risks, the statement  would then repeat most of the “help forestall” language used in September  The  language proposed for the inflation paragraph in both versions is identical to the  corresponding paragraph suggested for alternative B; again, the language shown in  the October 31 version suggests a bit more concern about inflation risks than the  September language  Finally, both versions of alternative A would characterize the  upside risks to inflation as roughly balancing the downside risks to growth  This  indication might well lead market participants to reduce the nearly two-thirds odds  that they currently place on another quarter-point easing in December and might trim  the extent of the overall easing of policy anticipated over the next year or so  Thus,  implementation of alternative A also could prompt some further backup in market  interest rates     In closing, let me remind the Committee that the September trial run highlighted   the potential for inconsistencies between the results of the projections survey and the  Committee’s statement  Your latest forecast submissions indicated that, while a  minority of you sees the risks to inflation as skewed to the upside, a slight majority  perceives the risks to total inflation as broadly balanced, and a more-sizable majority  judges that the risks to core inflation are in balance  These results could be seen as  incongruent with the draft statements for some of the alternatives  For example,  alternative A references upside risks to inflation  Several considerations might  explain this apparent inconsistency  For example, your responses on skews in the  projections survey may capture only the subjective probabilities that you attach to  various outcomes, while you may see the statement language as capturing not only  the odds but also the economic costs associated with those outcomes  Or perhaps the  upside risks to inflation referenced in the statement should be interpreted as reflecting  the views of all members not just of the majority who saw inflation risks as balanced,  thus encompassing the views of those in the minority who see upside inflation risks   Finally, I am worried about the possibility that some of you may have provided your  numerical projections under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy but may  not have applied that assumption as well to your individual risk assessments  In your  upcoming remarks, you may wish to address whether there is any tension between  your own views of the distribution of risks and the risk assessments in the draft  statements  Thank you       Yes   October 30-31, 2007 84 of 162     I’m not sure I could answer that without doing a fair amount of   research, President Evans  My sense is that, as I think I indicated in my remarks, for the policy   decision today there is effectively 23 basis points or so of easing still built in  So there would be   a considerable surprise in that dimension  According to a chart that I am looking at, the biggest   upside surprise in the federal funds rate that we have experienced since the era of policy   announcements began in 1994 has been more on the order of 12 basis points  So that dimension   of alternative B would, I think, be pretty significant  I don’t really know how much the   assessment of risks might moderate the shock  I think there would be some moderating effect   there, but it would be limited    A very small one, I think    Breakevens were up about 3 basis points across the curve    Well, one point to make is that the histograms aren’t in the public   release  They won’t see those data per se    Right    I am not sure what the question is exactly  What is the question?    Well, I think it is a matter of how the members interpreted it in   responding  [Laughter]  The memorandum to the Committee asks whether the risks around your   projection for each variable are weighted to the upside, weighted to the downside, or broadly   balanced   October 30-31, 2007 135 of 162     The memorandum to the Committee says, “Please provide your   projections of the most likely outcomes,” et cetera    And appropriate policy going forward      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Bill Dudley will begin our  presentation with a briefing on recent developments in bank funding markets and then  take your questions on market developments  Next, I will discuss in general terms a  range of discount window options that policymakers might consider  Nathan Sheets  will continue with comments on a proposal for swap facilities with foreign central  banks  Sandy Krieger will then provide more detail on the staff proposal for a term  auction facility (TAF); that proposal was discussed in a memo that you received   Spence Hilton will then discuss plans for the timing of auctions and settlement and  reserve management considerations should policymakers decide to proceed with the  TAF and foreign exchange swap  Let me turn the discussion over to Bill Dudley at  this point      Given the circumstances that Bill discussed, policymakers  might wish to explore possible policy measures that might help address the strains in  bank funding markets  A range of options that involve the discount window could be  considered  These options might include (1) a temporary reduction in the spread  between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate; (2) the adoption of a  term credit program, under which term credit could be extended, potentially at a  lower rate than the primary credit rate, at a borrower’s initiative; and (3) the adoption  of a term auction facility (TAF) at which term discount window funds would be  auctioned at the System’s initiative  All these options share the potential advantage  that their announcement would provide a highly visible signal of the Federal  Reserve’s willingness to provide adequate liquidity to promote market functioning   At the same time, it is clear that what ails financial markets now is not simply a  shortage of liquidity  There are more fundamental problems of credit losses, credit  risk, and balance sheet capacity that these options cannot address  But easing banks’  concerns about access to liquidity could be helpful in the current circumstances  I  will now briefly summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each of these  options  Of course, various combinations of these options are also possible, at least in  principle; but the marginal effectiveness of exercising multiple options is not clear,  and rolling out more than one initiative might run the risk of suggesting a greater  degree of concern on the part of the Federal Reserve than is actually the case      December 6, 2007 5 of 51    The first option is a reduction in the primary credit rate that would temporarily  narrow the spread of that rate over the target federal funds rate, say to 15 or 25 basis  points  This approach has several possible advantages  First, from one perspective it  has the lowest operational risk, as it does not involve the creation of new discount  window facilities; and by the same token, it does not require a lightning campaign to  educate banks on the characteristics of a new facility  Second, this approach is  simpler for the general public to understand  Third, this approach would be relatively  easy to coordinate with parallel foreign central bank actions to reduce the spreads on  their own lending facilities—assuming that they were inclined to do so  A reduction  in the primary credit spread has some disadvantages  These disadvantages relate  primarily to the difficulty in predicting the reaction of banks to the change  First, it is  quite possible that the stigma of borrowing at the window would persist or even  intensify  If so, a reduction in the primary credit spread would likely be ineffective in  stemming money market pressures  Conversely, it is also possible that banks will  respond nonlinearly to the reduction in the spread and demand quite large amounts of  primary credit  Given the unpredictability of the banks’ demand for discount window  funding, the Desk could experience significant difficulties in reserve management  under the approach of reducing the primary credit spread     Another option would be to establish a term credit facility, under which banks   could come to the window at their own volition for fixed-term discount window  loans, say of twenty-eight-day maturities  This option was not covered in the  memorandums that you recently received  These loans could well be priced  differently from primary credit, partly to help sharpen the distinction from primary  credit  This option shares some of the potential drawbacks with the first option that I  discussed  In particular, it is difficult to predict how banks would react  In order to  help guard against the effects of abrupt and large increases in discount window  borrowing that would complicate reserve management, the Federal Reserve could  require the borrower to provide advance notice of, say, two days before drawing  funds  Even with this notice, however, such a program might risk triggering very  large demands for discount window credit whose absolute size could pose reserve  management difficulties and balance sheet issues for the Federal Reserve  Reducing  this risk might require applying limits on individual banks’ borrowing through some  form of rationing  Determining such limits and explaining them to the banks and the  public would complicate the design, exposition, and implementation of this program     The third option that might be considered is a term auction facility  This program   would be generally similar to the auction credit facility discussed by policymakers in  September  The TAF has several advantages relative to the other two options  First,  it would allow the Federal Reserve to retain close control over the supply of reserves  because we would determine the auction amounts—at least assuming that the  minimum bid rate is not binding  Second, the facility arguably has a better chance of  avoiding stigma, partly because the auction format implies that no institution is being  forced to borrow  Third, each auction would reveal information about the strength of  the demand for funds  Finally, a TAF could also have potential longer-run benefits  for managing reserves and conducting monetary policy both in routine circumstances   December 6, 2007 6 of 51    and in circumstances of financial stress  A temporary TAF could provide valuable  experience to the Federal Reserve about these possible longer-run benefits  The TAF  has some potential disadvantages as well  Among these are some degree of  operational risk, questions about whether the contemplated sizes of the facility would  be sufficient to be effective in addressing market pressures, and the fact that no  individual institution will have assurance that it will win funds at the auction  Nathan  will now continue our presentation       Thanks, Spence  The staff recognizes that weighing the   advantages and disadvantages of the various options is difficult  Choice of any of  these options—or none—might be reasonable in the circumstances  Still, we believe  that, for the reasons we have discussed, the adoption of a temporary TAF and the  establishment of a swap line with the ECB at this time are warranted  As Bill  discussed, conditions in term money markets have been deteriorating, and those  strains are focused particularly on year-end  It seems likely that the proposed  measures could be helpful in providing assurance to banks that funding will be  available over year-end and could reduce the odds of gradual further deterioration or   December 6, 2007 10 of 51    a sudden worsening of money market conditions  Should the Board and the FOMC  approve these proposals, the Federal Reserve could announce them Wednesday  morning in coordination with the foreign central banks that may be taking related  actions  The coordinated announcements would help maximize the benefit of these  measures  That concludes our prepared remarks       President Hoenig, that would be my inclination  I think we will have   to just get some experience and see how this works before we can commit ourselves as to how   the program might evolve    Certainly  Spence or Bill may want to respond to the first question   with regard to the $20 billion in President Poole’s example  Let me just respond to some of the   December 6, 2007 17 of 51    other questions that President Poole raised  He noted that banks have a lot of CDs outstanding   and asked whether they couldn’t just raise additional funds in the wholesale market  I think the   basic issue is that their cost of funding in the wholesale market is high and rising and that those   markets are becoming increasingly thin, almost day by day  So there are questions as to whether   or not they might actually experience funding difficulties over the next days, weeks, or months    I’m not sure I fully got President Poole’s question, but I think we all agree that this facility   doesn’t address directly the capital issue or the credit loss issue  It simply will help provide   additional term funding to banks and help banks be more assured of their ability to access funds    Let me ask either Nathan or Bill next to address the question of the ECB’s reserves      Sandy, do you want to respond to that?    Bill, do you want to take that one?   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the draft  announcement language in table 1, which is unchanged from the version distributed  in the Bluebook and which is included in the package labeled “Material for FOMC  Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  As shown in section 4 of the left-hand  column, following the October meeting the Committee issued a statement that  concluded that the upside risks to inflation roughly balanced the downside risks to  growth, suggesting that the Committee saw reasonably good odds that, after 75 basis  points of easing, the stance of policy would foster sustainable economic growth and  price stability over time  As many of you have noted, however, events over the  intermeeting period have undermined this view  The staff and the markets have  interpreted incoming information as pointing to a distinctly weaker outlook for the  economy  As Dave discussed, the staff has lowered its forecast for aggregate demand  in light of deteriorating conditions in financial markets, incoming data on spending  and output that were weaker than expected, and the higher path for energy prices  suggested by futures markets  That weaker forecast for aggregate demand was  reflected in a 70 basis point decline in the Greenbook-consistent measure of the  equilibrium real federal funds rate, which placed it about 40 basis points below the  current real federal funds rate  These developments have prompted the staff to tilt  down its assumed trajectory for monetary policy, with a 25 basis point easing at this  meeting and another ¼ point move in 2009  The assumed easing is not quite fast  enough to offset the adverse shock to aggregate demand, and a small degree of  economic slack consequently emerges over the next year or so that was not present in  the October Greenbook  That slack can be seen as purposeful, as the staff has also  interpreted incoming information as implying a modest adverse shock to aggregate  supply  Recent inflation data and higher energy prices point to higher total and core  inflation in the third and fourth quarters and, in the staff forecast, over the next few  quarters as well  Given the restraint on inflation resulting from the projected  emergence of modest slack, the staff judges that its assumed path for monetary policy  will leave total inflation and core inflation, respectively, at the same 17 percent and  19 percent annual rates in 2009 that were projected in the October Greenbook       Should the Committee find the staff forecast persuasive as a modal forecast,   view that outcome as satisfactory, and see the risks around that projection, while  perhaps larger than previously, as not sharply skewed in either direction, it might be  inclined to ease policy by the quarter point assumed in the staff forecast and adopt a  statement along the lines shown as alternative B in table 1  Like the staff, members  might see the incoming evidence as suggesting that the outlook for real activity has  weakened and perhaps that the downside risks to growth have increased  The  deterioration in financial markets, in particular, might be a source not only of a  downward revision to your outlook but also of a greater sense of uncertainty about  prospects for aggregate demand  The financial system is dealing with significant                                                     2 Materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   December 11, 2007 92 of 138    credit losses and resulting capital erosion and constrictions on balance sheet capacity   The eventual effect of those problems on the availability of credit to households and  firms is unknown  In particular, the potential interactions of financial stress with real  economic developments, especially those in the housing sector, are difficult to assess   In view of these considerations, as shown in section 2 the suggested rationale  language for alternative B would state that economic growth is slowing; would cite  softening in recent spending data; and would indicate that financial strains have  increased in recent weeks  While the Committee may see significant downside risks  to spending, it might also remain worried about the potential for an increase in  inflation pressures and might view inflation risks as having risen a bit over the past  six weeks  The recent inflation picture looks slightly less benign than it did earlier   Moreover, the increase in oil futures prices suggests that energy prices could continue  to boost overall and core inflation  Members may also view downward pressure on  the dollar as likely to persist  The language shown in section 3 would continue to cite  the same concerns about inflation that the Committee has recognized in recent  statements      In circumstances of increased risks to growth and continued substantial inflation   risks, the Committee might, as back in September, prefer not to express an overall  assessment of the balance of risks  As shown in section 4, the Committee could say  that “recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions,  have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and  inflation”  However, if the Committee’s predilection is that further easing will  probably be necessary but it still wishes to underscore its concern about inflation, you  could insert a sentence after the first sentence in section 4 saying that “on balance, the  Committee sees downside risks to growth as having increased, but it must also remain  attentive to the upside pressures on inflation”  Most dealers expect you to couple a  ¼ point easing today with an assessment that the risks are skewed to the downside   But even the version without an explicit risk assessment probably would be read as  consistent with further policy easing going forward, particularly since you eased in  October following a statement in September that was comparable to the one shown in  section 4  It might be worth noting that many market participants expect the Federal  Reserve to augment its monetary policy action today with some announcement  regarding the discount window—for example, a reduction in the primary credit  spread  As the Chairman noted earlier today, the absence of such a reference in  today’s announcement could prompt some investor disappointment; but given your  monetary policy action under alternative B, the effect on market interest rates seems  likely to be limited, and presumably, any effect today will be reversed tomorrow      If the Committee is already persuaded that the economic outlook has weakened   more sharply than in the Greenbook or if it has become significantly more concerned  about the downside risks to growth, it might prefer the 50 basis point easing of  alternative A  The Committee might see the larger move at this time as warranted  particularly by risk-management considerations  The Greenbook presented two  alternative scenarios—a “greater housing correction” and a “credit crunch”—that  illustrate downside risks and suggest that the Committee may need to ease markedly   December 11, 2007 93 of 138    further over coming quarters  In the case of the credit crunch scenario, for example,  the estimated version of the Taylor rule calls for a funds rate that troughs at  26 percent, well below the low point currently built into market interest rates  As  shown in the second column, the language suggested for alternative A explicitly cites  both a weaker outlook and greater downside risks in explaining the relatively large  policy move  As in alternative B, the language on inflation would be nearly  unchanged from that employed in October  But in section 4 of alternative A, the  Committee would indicate a judgment that—following the further reduction in  interest rates—the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to  growth  Or the risk language shown in red in section 4 of alternative B could instead  be employed under alternative A; this might be appropriate if the Committee felt that  the same elevated risks that motivated it to ease 50 basis points also suggested that it  was difficult to weigh the remaining risks after the action  In either case, short- and  intermediate-term market interest rates would likely decline noticeably under  alternative A  In contemplating the pros and cons of alternative A, one consideration  might be whether the Committee views this combination of sharp easing and the  associated language, particularly the version coupled with an inconclusive risk  assessment, as likely to lead market participants to worry about what information the  Committee might have that would lead it to take such a substantial step, and so  undermine investor confidence      If, in contrast, the Committee saw the downside risks to growth as somewhat   greater but was not yet convinced that the outlook had deteriorated substantially and  remained concerned about inflation prospects, it might consider implementation of  alternative C  As indicated in the right-hand column, under this alternative the  Committee would maintain the stance of policy at this meeting but conclude that the  downside risks to growth now are the predominant concern  With overall inflation on  the high side and upward pressures stemming from energy prices and dollar  depreciation, members might be concerned that policy easing could go too far  The  stance of policy has already been eased 75 basis points despite only limited evidence  to date that economic weakness is spreading to a significant degree beyond the  housing sector  Indeed, as some of you suggested, the incoming indicators of slowing  growth over the intermeeting period may be broadly in line with what you expected in  October  If so, the Committee may feel that its monetary policy actions to date—and,  at the margin, the establishment of the TAF as well as swap lines with foreign central  banks—probably will provide sufficient insurance that financial problems will remain  contained and will not greatly restrict the availability of credit to households and  businesses  Thus members may believe that further easing is not and probably will  not be necessary  Indeed, members may find worrisome the prescription of the  optimal control simulation in the Bluebook that a slight degree of policy firming  would be appropriate over coming quarters if the Committee were pursuing a  1½ percent long-run objective for inflation  Even with such unease about inflation  prospects, though, the Committee may be sufficiently concerned about the current  threat to growth to judge that, on balance, the risks are tilted to the downside with an  unchanged stance of policy      December 11, 2007 94 of 138     I will conclude by responding belatedly to a question that President Evans posed  at the last meeting  He asked what the experience has been with including an  indication of downside risks in the policy statement  In particular, would markets  likely see such a risk assessment as signaling a likelihood of an imminent policy  easing?  Answering the question on the basis of the historical record is not entirely  straightforward, partly because the Committee’s practices have evolved over time; as  President Evans noted, it has been only since 1999 that the Committee has released a  risk assessment or some other form of a tilt along with its announcement  Despite  some qualifications, the basic answer seems to be, not surprisingly, that the risk  assessments have been predictive of future Committee action  The experience from  December 2000 through January 2002 makes this point clearly  During that period, at  fourteen meetings in a row the Committee indicated that “the risks are weighted  mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable  future”  In eleven of those fourteen instances, that indication was followed by a  policy easing at the next meeting  Later, toward the end of 2002, one of two  indications of downside risk was followed by an easing, and in June 2003, a different  balance of risks—one concerned with disinflation—was followed by an easing         All in all, it seems reasonable to judge in current circumstances that maintaining   the stance of policy while assessing that the risks are tilted to the downside, as under  alternative C, would lead market participants to continue to put high odds on future  policy easing  But the absence of policy action at this meeting despite nearly  unanimous expectations of policy easing would mean that the expectation of a  downtilt in rates would begin from a notably higher level and might be less steep,  prompting a significant upward shift in short- and intermediate-term interest rates   That concludes my prepared remarks      President Evans, in response to your first question, the suggestion for   section 4 of alternative B would be to add after the “Recent developments…” sentence, “On   balance, the Committee sees downside risks to growth as having increased, but it must also remain   attentive to the upside pressures on inflation”  With regard to your other question, I think that   characterizing whether the slowing in economic growth right now is what you anticipated may be a   little difficult  It is relatively early in terms of the information that’s available for the fourth quarter,   so it may be difficult to pin that down very precisely     Mr Chairman, if I could  I think, President Lacker, just one point is that   the detailed information on the bidders was sent only to those Reserve Bank presidents and Board   members who specifically asked for it, so it was not distributed unilaterally    Yes  Well, the spreadsheet of bidders    That is correct, yes  The second point I would make is that I do not think   there is particular sensitivity about foreign banks but instead sensitivity about taking any chance of   identifying who the bidders are at all because of the great concern about avoiding stigma from the   TAF  3  I will be referring to the separate package labeled “Material   for FOMC Briefing on Economic Projections”  Table 1 shows the central tendencies  and ranges of your current forecasts for 2008, 2009, and 2010  Central tendencies  and ranges of the projections made by the Committee last October are shown in  italics  As for conditioning assumptions, most of you see the appropriate near-term  path of the federal funds rate as at or below that assumed in the Greenbook  Eight  policymakers explicitly assumed somewhat more near-term easing than in the  Greenbook  However, several of you assumed that policy would need to begin  firming no later than 2009  Many of you also projected that the funds rate would  exceed the level forecasted in the Greenbook by the end of the forecast period       As shown in the first row, first column, of table 1, the central tendency of your   forecasts of real growth for 2008 has been marked down about ½ percentage point  since last October  Most of you remarked that a range of factors had prompted you to  lower your growth expectations for the current year, including the continued turmoil  in financial markets and the resulting tightening of credit conditions, the persistent  deterioration in the housing market, incoming data suggesting slower consumption  expenditures and business investment growth, and higher oil prices  A few of you  suggested that stronger export demand as well as fiscal stimulus would provide some  offset to weakness in private domestic demand, particularly beginning later this year   Your half-yearly projections, not shown, suggest that you all think that, more likely  than not, the economy will skirt recession  On average, you see real GDP growing at  an annual rate of about ¾ percentage point over the first half before picking up to a  2½ percent pace in the second half  As shown in the second row, in view of the weak  growth forecast for this year, most of you revised up your expectations for the  unemployment rate in the fourth quarter about 04 percentage point, to around  5¼ percent  Most of you project slightly brisker growth this year than the Greenbook  does—perhaps partly reflecting the assumption that a number of you made that there  would be more near-term monetary ease than the staff assumed  As shown in the  third and fourth sets of rows, with incoming inflation data a bit higher than previously  expected and despite projected weaker real activity, the central tendencies of your  projections for total and core PCE inflation this year have increased about  03 percentage point  That upward revision is a bit larger than the 02 percentage  point upward revision to the Greenbook inflation forecasts but leaves the level of  your projections close to those in the Greenbook  Most of you see total and core                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   January 29–30, 2008 31 of 249    inflation this year at a little above 2 percent  But as shown in the bottom section, the  upper limit of the range of your overall inflation projections for this year has moved  up to 28 percent  Your forecasts for total PCE inflation this year remain a bit higher  than for core inflation, reflecting the expectation of higher energy, food, and in some  cases, import price inflation       Looking ahead to next year, your forecasts indicate that you expect economic   growth to pick up as the drag from the housing sector dissipates and credit conditions  improve  The midpoint of the central tendency of your forecasts for real GDP growth  is 24 percent  Your growth forecasts for next year are mostly above the staff’s  forecast of 22 percent, perhaps again because a number of you assumed more- aggressive policy easing in the near term and perhaps because at least some of you  appear to see potential output growth as a bit brisker than the staff does  With most  of you evidently seeing growth a bit above trend next year, the unemployment rate  begins to edge lower, but the central tendency of your unemployment projections still  remains distinctly above that in October  Although you are generally optimistic about  improving conditions next year, your views have become considerably more  dispersed  As shown in the lower section, the width of the range of the growth  projections for 2009 has nearly doubled, as has the width of the range of the  unemployment projections  The third and fourth sets of rows in the upper panel  indicate that most of you see overall and core inflation as moving below 2 percent  next year  Some of you said that those declines reflect less pressure from energy  prices and, with the unemployment rate above the NAIRU, the emergence of some  slack in the labor market  It is worth noting, however, that despite the easing of  pressure on resources during 2008 and 2009, the central tendencies of your inflation  projections for next year are essentially unchanged from October  This development  presumably reflects your perception of some deterioration in the near-term inflation- output tradeoff, perhaps prompted in part by the publication of surprisingly high  inflation data for the fourth quarter of 2007 and an expectation that those effects will  linger in 2009     Turning to 2010, the interpretation of your longer-term projections is a bit less   straightforward than it was in October  It was noted during the trial-run phase that a  time may come when the economy is seen as unlikely to be in a steady state by the  third year of the projection  To some extent, that time seems to have already arrived    In particular, a comparison of the central tendencies for unemployment in 2010 from  your January and October projections suggests that you now see a bit of slack  persisting that year  The central tendencies and ranges of your total and core inflation  projections for 2010 have changed just a bit from those in October, but those changes  might be viewed by outside analysts as significant  In particular, the central tendency  for total inflation in 2010 has inched up 01 percentage point, and the lower limit of  the central tendency for core inflation has increased the same amount  Absent  guidance to the contrary, some analysts might now conclude that your “comfort zone”  has edged up to 1¾ to 2 percent from 1½ to 2 percent  To counter this impression,  presumably the published “Summary of Economic Projections” should suggest that,  because a bit of economic slack is expected to persist at the end of 2010, inflation   January 29–30, 2008 32 of 249    could continue to edge lower beyond the projection period  This discussion,  however, raises not only a presentational point but also a substantive one, and that is,  Why should your inflation projections for 2010 have revised up at all?  True, the  inflation-output tradeoff appears to have deteriorated a little recently, but as Dave  Reifschneider noted, some of that deterioration is likely to be temporary  Also,  higher inflation than otherwise might in principle be a consequence of taking out  some insurance now against especially weak economic outcomes  But given the  significant negative shock to aggregate demand embedded in your modal forecasts  and the associated upward revision to slack across all three years of your projections,  as well as the absence of any upward revision to your inflation projections for 2009,  even the small upward revision to your inflation projections in 2010 seems somewhat  surprising      Turning to the uncertainties in the outlook, the upper panel of exhibit 2 shows that   even more of you than in October judge that uncertainty regarding prospects for  economic activity is higher than its historical level  Even with the significant  reductions in the target funds rate already in place and, for many of you, an  assumption of more easing to come, the lower panel illustrates that most of you still  see the risks to growth as tilted to the downside  As reasons, you again cited tighter  credit conditions for households and businesses emanating from further disruptions in  financial markets as well as the persistently deteriorating housing outlook  As shown  in the upper panel of exhibit 3, more of you than in October see the uncertainty  around your total inflation forecasts as close to that of the past two decades, while a  smaller minority viewed uncertainty as greater than in the past  As shown in the  lower panel, fewer of you now see the inflation risks as predominantly to the upside   On balance, as in October, downside risks to growth were more frequently cited than  upside risks to inflation, which seems broadly consistent with each of the alternative  policy statements that were in Bluebook table 1  Thank you       Well, I could start if you would like    I think the points we are trying to make in that memo regarding inflation   compensation were that, first of all, it’s very difficult to make these judgments about what is going   on with inflation expectations, inflation risk premiums, and so on; but our best reading of the   evidence was that probably inflation expectations have not moved up significantly recently  We   base that on a variety of indicators  I won’t go through all of them now, but to me the most   compelling evidence to support that point is that inflation compensation over the next five years has   actually come down over the intermeeting period, and it is a little hard to rationalize why inflation   expectations would have risen so far out, whereas in the near term they seem, if anything, to be   declining  Of course, various factors can affect inflation compensation, including relative liquidity   and inflation risk premiums, and we certainly don’t want to exaggerate our ability to decompose   these changes into these various factors  It is possible that inflation risk premiums, in particular,   have moved up, and some evidence does suggest that    Well, that is a hard question, actually  You know, obviously in some   sense the numbers at some level do speak for themselves    I think they say that the Committee is expecting relatively slow   growth in the period immediately ahead but that the economy avoids a recession  There is some   January 29–30, 2008 37 of 249    recovery over the subsequent years  It is not extraordinarily brisk  It is a fairly gradual recovery   in terms of growth  The unemployment rate moves up a little, as you would expect with a period   of growth below trend, but does not get extraordinarily high; and inflation, after coming under   some upward pressure of late, gradually edges back down to levels below 2 percent  I am not   sure that I am saying anything terribly enlightening here  Of course, one point that I should   emphasize is that the full summary of economic projections, we hope, gives more texture than I   was just able to give to the Committee’s views about the modal outcome and to the Committee’s   concerns about the risks to both growth and inflation    Maybe I can respond to that  It is very inferential, and it is based   partly on the two-tenths’ difference from the October exercise when it was actually clear—I   think clearer at that time—from participants’ forecasts that many participants characterized their   NAIRU as being in the vicinity of 4¾ percent  Unfortunately, the writeups this time were not all   that explicit on this point, but it is the comparison with October that I was leaning on fairly   heavily  5  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  Your policy  decision today takes place against an unusually complicated and uncertain backdrop   Over recent months, reverberations from the contraction in the housing sector have                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Stockton are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)  5 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   January 29–30, 2008 102 of 249    spread to the subprime mortgage market, to financial markets and institutions more  generally, and now evidently to the broader economy  It seems clear, based on the  Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey and numerous other sources of information, that  these factors are interacting, with mortgage-related writedowns and concerns about  the economic outlook triggering a broad and substantial tightening of credit to  businesses and households and the tightening of credit feeding back onto the housing  market and the economy  At the same time, recent inflation performance has been  disappointing, the near-term policy tradeoff appears to have deteriorated somewhat,  and inflation compensation has risen  Meanwhile, investors have been rather skittish  and, in the environment of heightened uncertainty, have sought more clarity in your  communications and more assurance about policy prospects than you can reasonably  provide  The combination of all these factors has left financial market prices  unusually volatile  In these circumstances, the Committee faces a difficult task in  reaching judgments as to the outlook and the balance of risks, gauging the appropriate  policy course, and communicating your views to the public       To provide some assistance in your policy deliberations today, a box in the   Bluebook explored the possible implications of addressing pronounced downside  risks to growth through monetary policy, and the charts from that box are replicated  in exhibit 1  The panels in the left-hand column consider the possible benefits of risk  management under the assumption that a recession does develop  The recession  considered in this exercise is the same as that examined in an alternative scenario in  Part 1 of the Greenbook  As you may recall, that scenario was calibrated to match the  typical degree of weakness relative to fundamentals in expenditures other than those  for housing in six past recessions  The dotted line shows the results, as gauged using  the FRB/US model, if the Committee were to respond to emerging evidence of an  unfolding recession by adjusting policy in a manner similar to its past behavior, as  captured by the staff’s estimated outcome-based policy rule  In this case, the  Committee lowers the federal funds rate gradually to about ¾ percent by mid-2009   The unemployment rate peaks at about 61 percent, and inflation eventually falls  below 1½ percent  The blue line shows the results that would be predicted if, instead,  the Committee responded more aggressively  Here we have arbitrarily assumed that  the Committee lowers the federal funds rate to 1½ percent this quarter and holds the  rate at that level through the second quarter  From that point forward, it follows the  outcome-based rule  If the recessionary conditions do eventuate, the timely policy  stimulus moderates the downturn in activity, trimming about ¼ percentage point off  the peak unemployment rate, and helps keep inflation from falling toward a region  that some of you might find uncomfortably low      Although aggressive policy easing would help mitigate economic weakness, it   would also raise the risk that policy could add unduly to inflation pressures should  recessionary weakness not develop, a possibility explored in the right-hand column   The simulations underlying this column are carried out under the baseline Greenbook  scenario  As shown by the blue line, the cost of an aggressive near-term easing in the  absence of a recession could be limited if policymakers were to recognize quickly  that the economy was not weakening to the degree feared and boosted the federal   January 29–30, 2008 103 of 249    funds rate rapidly  In this simulation, the Committee increases the funds rate about  2½ percentage points in six months—that is, at a pace of more than 50 basis points  per meeting—to around 4 percent  This prompt reversal brings the funds rate  1 percentage point above the baseline, providing an offset to the earlier period of  excessively easy policy  In this case, core inflation would run slightly higher than  baseline for a couple of quarters—as shown in the bottom right-hand panel by the  distance between the solid blue line and the dotted black line—but would  subsequently return to baseline  In contrast, as shown in the dashed red line, if  policymakers were slow to recognize that no recession was in train and so reversed  policy more gradually after the first two quarters—that is, in line with your historical  behavior—considerable momentum could be imparted to economic activity, with the  unemployment rate, the middle panel, running roughly ¼ percentage point below  baseline into 2011  The cost of responding more aggressively to the risk of a  recession in this case could be inflation that remains 01 or 02 percentage point above  the baseline path for several years, the bottom right-hand panel  Concern about such  an outcome could give you some pause as you consider how much insurance you  wish to seek at this and coming meetings      Your concerns in this regard may also be exacerbated by the fact that the   inflation picture seems to have deteriorated somewhat in recent months  Your current  projections reflect some worsening of the inflation–output tradeoff, with more slack  apparently required over the next three years to push inflation down toward what  would appear to be your preferred outcomes  Also, as was discussed yesterday, five- year-forward inflation compensation increased notably over the intermeeting period   While there are reasons to question whether much of that rise represents an increase  in inflation expectations, it might be due in part to a higher inflation risk premium,  perhaps signaling that inflation expectations are becoming more loosely moored and  are hence more prone to drift in response to various shocks       If you were particularly concerned about a possible unmooring of inflation   expectations, you might be inclined toward alternative D, shown in the right-hand  column of table 1, which is included as the next page  Under this alternative, you  would hold the stance of monetary policy steady at this meeting but would indicate  that the risks to growth remain tilted to the downside  However, based on the interest  rate assumptions provided with your forecast submissions, the recommendations of  most Reserve Banks to reduce the discount rate by 50 basis points, and your  comments yesterday, it appears that most if not all of you see some easing today as  appropriate  Consequently, I will dispense with a detailed discussion of alternative D   Rather, the questions for today’s meeting would seem to be not whether to reduce  rates but how much and what to say about the outlook for growth, inflation, and  policy     Under alternative C, the Committee would reduce rates 25 basis points today    The rationale section of the statement would note that financial markets remain under  stress, cite the tightening of credit availability, and mention the deepening of the  housing contraction and the softening of labor markets  With regard to inflation, the   January 29–30, 2008 104 of 249    Committee would note its expectation that inflation should moderate, but it would  also cite a range of factors that could put upward pressure on inflation  The statement  would conclude by indicating that the policy action, combined with actions taken  earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time, but it would also warn that  downside risks to growth remain  The Committee might see alternative C as  appropriate if it believes that some further easing of policy is warranted by the  deterioration in the economic outlook and the associated risks but feels that a  moderate move is preferable today, given the policy steps you have taken to date, the  possibility that the fiscal stimulus could still turn out to be larger than currently  envisaged, and questions about how firmly inflation expectations are anchored   Market participants currently put considerably greater odds on a 50 basis point move  today than on a 25 basis point action  Moreover, market participants reportedly  expect you to issue a statement similar to the January 22 announcement, but the  addition of the sentence on inflation risks in the third paragraph would likely suggest  to investors that you have significant concerns about inflation  The combination of a  smaller-than-expected policy move and the statement drafted for alternative C would  likely suggest to investors that monetary policy had shifted into an incremental mode   Shorter-term interest rates would likely rise somewhat, and equity prices could  decline noticeably     Should the Committee see an outcome along the lines of the Greenbook forecast   as most likely, it might be attracted to the 50 basis point easing of alternative B   Under alternative B, the Committee would issue an announcement that closely  resembles the January 22 statement  However, the fourth paragraph would include a  sentence indicating that the policy actions to date should help to promote moderate  growth over time and to mitigate downside risks to growth  In the second sentence of  that paragraph, the word “appreciable,” used in the January 22 statement, would be  dropped from the characterization of the risks, presumably in recognition of the  significant further adjustment of policy under this alternative  As discussed  yesterday, the Greenbook-consistent measure of r* has declined more than  1¼ percentage points since the December meeting, to about ¾ percentage point  A  50 basis point move today would leave the real federal funds rate just below  1 percent, gauged on the same basis as our r* measure  Thus, by the r* metric, policy  would remain slightly restrictive under alternative B, consistent with applying modest  downward pressure to inflation going forward  Policymakers might view such a  policy stance as appropriate if they saw the downside risks to growth as roughly  balanced by the upside risks to inflation following such a policy action  However,  given the views expressed in your economic projections—in particular, the  assessment expressed by many that the trajectory for the funds rate would probably  need to be a little lower in the near term than assumed in the Greenbook—it seems  more likely that you would prefer the approach of alternative B if you believed that  further easing will likely be warranted but should be implemented somewhat  gradually, perhaps to provide time to assess the effects of the policy easing already  put in place  With investors placing greatest weight on a policy choice at this meeting  along the lines of alternative B, this approach would likely prompt relatively little   January 29–30, 2008 105 of 249    reaction in financial markets this afternoon  Given recent developments, the  Committee may place a larger premium than usual on avoiding policy surprises     If you have lowered your economic outlook even more sharply than the staff or if   you see the downside risks as particularly large, you might not see moderation as a  virtue and prefer to ease policy aggressively by 75 basis points at this meeting, as in  alternative A  This approach would seem consistent with the concerns and policy  assumptions expressed by many of you in your forecast narratives  Indeed, some of  you have espoused a risk-management approach to policy in which the federal funds  rate is lowered sharply in the near term to provide greater assurance of continued  economic expansion and then that policy easing is reversed quickly once it becomes  clear that risks are diminishing  As suggested by the risk-management simulations  that I discussed earlier, this approach relies heavily on your ability to recognize  promptly that the stimulus is not needed and to reverse field rapidly  Binary options  on target fed funds futures suggest that, over the past few days, market participants  have essentially priced out the possibility that you will take such aggressive action  today  Thus, money market rates would likely decline sharply in response to  implementation of this alternative, downward pressure on the foreign exchange value  of the dollar could increase, and equity prices could rise somewhat, although any rally  could be damped by a sense among investors that you were motivated to take this  action by concerns about pronounced economic weakness  Obviously, a significant  concern with a step of this magnitude today would be the possible implications for  inflation expectations and inflation uncertainty  Although the relative contributions  of various factors to the recent increase in inflation compensation can be debated, last  week’s policy move seemed to be well understood at the time as a response to  incoming evidence of a sharply deteriorating economic outlook  By contrast, the  motivations for a larger-than-expected move today might be less clear to market  participants, potentially elevating the risk of loosening the inflation expectations  anchor  Thank you, Mr Chairman      That is correct, Governor Mishkin    I think my response is that it is very difficult to say how your   communications should or will evolve going forward at this point because of the very substantial   uncertainty in the economic outlook, which shows up very clearly in the Committee participants’   economic forecasts  Presumably, what you say will depend on evolving circumstances  In terms   of the yield curve, again, I think that is difficult  That will depend on the interaction of market   participants’ perception of incoming economic information with their sense of your own policy   reactions    In these simulations, the standard channels of monetary policy are   working through things like the yield curve, asset prices, the foreign exchange value of the   dollar, household wealth, et cetera    The financial markets are forward-looking in these simulations      I don’t think they fit in in a direct way  We still have a lot of work   ahead of us, despite the progress that we have made in modeling in recent years, to consider   things like the distribution of different economic outcomes and how skewness in those   distributions, both with respect to output and with respect to inflation, would interact with risk-  aversion in monetary policymaking  I don’t think our science has quite gotten to that stage yet,   but I agree that these are worthwhile things to study further    I see the point you are making, and that sounds plausible  You know,   again, our thought was that, if investors were concerned that monetary policy makers were   making an inflationary mistake, it would begin to affect inflation in the near term, meaning   within several years rather than seven or eight years ahead     Okay  “Since the coordinated actions taken in December 2007, the G-10   central banks have continued to work together closely and to consult regularly on liquidity pressures   March 10, 2008 37 of 39    in funding markets  Pressures in some of these markets have recently increased again  We all   continue to work together and will take appropriate steps to address those liquidity pressures   To that end, today the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank,   the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing specific measures”   There is a section called “Federal Reserve Actions”   “The Federal Reserve announced today an expansion of its securities lending program    Under this new term securities lending facility (TSLF), the Federal Reserve will lend up to   $200 billion of Treasury securities to primary dealers secured for a term of 28 days (rather than   overnight, as in the existing program) by a pledge of other securities, including federal agency debt,   federal agency residential-mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and non-agency AAA-rated private-  label residential MBS    The TSLF is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other   collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally  As is the case with   the current securities lending program, securities will be made available through an auction process    Auctions will be held on a weekly basis, beginning on March 27, 2008  The Federal Reserve will   consult with primary dealers on technical design features of the TSLF    In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee has authorized increases in its existing   temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the European Central Bank and the   Swiss National Bank  These arrangements will now provide dollars in amounts of up to $30 billion   and $6 billion to the ECB and the SNB, respectively, representing increases of $10 billion and   $2 billion  The FOMC extended the term of these swap lines through September 30, 2008   March 10, 2008 38 of 39    The actions announced today supplement the measures announced by the Federal Reserve   on Friday to boost the size of the term auction facility to $100 billion and to undertake a series of   term repurchase transactions that will cumulate to $100 billion”   Finally, there’s a section on related actions being taken by other central banks with links to   the other central banks’ websites     Three is right on the Board’s measure    2  Thanks, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the revised  version of table 1 distributed earlier today in the package labeled “Material for  FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  The revised table presents the  same basic set of alternatives that was discussed in the Bluebook  However, we have  proposed some changes in language that affect the statements for alternatives A and  B  I will discuss those changes, shown in blue, shortly     Alternative D, presented in the right-hand column, would leave the federal funds   rate unchanged at this meeting at 3 percent  Committee members might be inclined  to favor this alternative if they were particularly concerned about prospects for  inflation and if they believed that, with due allowance for lags, the monetary and  fiscal stimulus in train would likely be sufficient to lead to a resumption of moderate  growth over time  The wording of this alternative would acknowledge the downside  risks to growth  But as shown in paragraph 3, the statement would indicate that  inflation has been elevated, cite several factors that could put additional upward  pressure on inflation, and state that the upside risks to inflation have increased  No  net assessment of the balance of risks would be included        Under alternative C, the stance of policy would be eased by 25 basis points   today  A modest easing of policy might be motivated by judgments that the  economic outlook has weakened, but by appreciably less than in the Greenbook, and  that the inflation outlook is troubling  Members might see financial strains as  concerning but likely to exert less restraint on growth than in the Greenbook forecast                                                      2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   March 18, 2008 80 of 127    In these circumstances, the Committee might want to be cautious about policy  adjustments that could add impetus to inflation, particularly given the substantial  easing of monetary policy to date and the lags in the effects of policy  The language  proposed for alternative C would note that the tightening of credit conditions and the  deepening of the housing correction are likely to continue to weigh on economic  growth  The inflation paragraph for this alternative is the same as that for alternative  D  As shown in paragraph 4, the Committee would make an explicit judgment that  the downside risks to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation      Under alternative B, the Committee would reduce the federal funds rate 50 basis   points today, to 2½ percent  Such an approach could be seen as consistent with the  Greenbook forecast  Indeed, under that forecast, the Committee is assumed to ease  policy 50 basis points at this meeting and another 75 basis points over the next three  months  The motivation for such a trajectory is provided partly by the 1¼ percentage  point downward revision to the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r*  The  Committee might concur with the staff’s assumption regarding the amount of  cumulative easing that will eventually prove necessary and find a gradual shift in  policy attractive, particularly in view of what seems to be some upward drift of late in  inflation expectations  Such a path would also be qualitatively consistent with the  optimal control simulations shown in the Bluebook for a 2 percent inflation target, in  which the federal funds rate is eventually eased to around 1¼ percent  As shown in  paragraph 2, the statement issued under this alternative would indicate that the  outlook had weakened  We have suggested striking the reference to risks as that  thought is picked up in the risk assessment  The statement would go on to mention  several factors that could weigh on economic growth, and we have suggested adding  “over the next few quarters”      With regard to inflation, the Committee would note that inflation has been   elevated  It would also indicate an expectation that inflation will moderate in coming  months and cite several factors that could contribute to that moderation but note that  uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased  Notably, the list does not  mention “reasonably well anchored inflation expectations” or some variant of that  phrase, which has been used recently in the minutes and other policy  communications  Indeed, the first sentence of the paragraph notes that some  indicators of inflation expectations have risen  Partly because inflation compensation  includes a premium for inflation risk as well as inflation expectations, we thought that  “indicators” of inflation expectations might be a better word than “measures” and  have suggested that substitution  Over the past few days, inflation compensation as  read from TIPS has plunged; however, we are skeptical that the decline represents  primarily a drop in inflation expectations or inflation risk  Rather, we suspect that it  is importantly a result of shifting liquidity premiums, as yields on nominal Treasury  securities have fallen sharply partly because of increased demands for safety and  liquidity  The final paragraph of alternative B would repeat the risk assessment  issued after the January meeting  It would again indicate that downside risks remain  and emphasize that the Committee will act in a timely manner to address those risks      March 18, 2008 81 of 127    Finally, under alternative A the Committee would lower the funds rate 75 basis  points today  Given the extent of policy easing assumed in the staff forecast, this  alternative could easily be consistent with an outlook along the lines of the  Greenbook  This policy approach could also be motivated by concern about the  possible implications for the economic outlook of the worsening in financial market  conditions in the five days since the staff forecast was finalized or by a risk- management approach that gave particular weight to the downside risks around the  outlook     The language proposed for the rationale section, paragraphs 2 and 3, of   alternative A is identical to that proposed for alternative B  As with alternative B, the  risk assessment paragraph says that policy actions should promote moderate growth  over time and mitigate downside risks, but this version also alludes to the measures  that the Federal Reserve has implemented to promote market liquidity  This language  could also be used in alternative B  Rather than providing an assessment of the  balance of risks, as we did in the Bluebook version, here in alterative A we have  suggested simply indicating that downside risks to growth remain  Given the high  degree of uncertainty, you might again prefer not to make an overall risk assessment   This paragraph differs from the corresponding part of the January statement also by  indicating that the Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to promote  sustainable economic growth and price stability  Thus, while the Committee eases  75 basis points, this language of alternative A would signal some increase in the  Committee’s concern about inflation in several ways  by indicating that inflation has  been elevated; by noting that some indicators of inflation expectations have risen; and  by incorporating a traditional formulation of the dual objectives, including price  stability, in the final sentence       As Bill noted this morning, market participants appear to place substantial odds   on a 100 basis point policy move at this meeting  Thus, implementation of any of  these alternatives would involve at least somewhat less easing than expected  Given  what would appear to be very fragile market conditions and highly skittish investor  sentiment, you might see somewhat greater risks than usual in diverging from market  expectations, and obviously the risks would be larger the greater the gap between  anticipation and your actions  At the same time, you might see good reasons for  some divergence  First and most obviously, you might see a smaller move as  appropriately calibrated given your outlook and sense of the risks  Also, some  indicators do seem to suggest that inflation expectations have become a bit less firmly  moored  Even if you see gradual dollar depreciation as likely to be appropriate given  the weakness of the US economy and quite possibly a necessary factor in fostering  an improved current account balance over time, you may be concerned about the  downward lurch in the dollar over recent days and the potential for disorderly  conditions to develop  You may judge that a policy decision today to implement  somewhat less easing than markets expect and a statement that implies somewhat  greater concern about inflation could be helpful in leaning against inflation  expectations and any sense in markets that you are indifferent to downward pressure  on the dollar     March 18, 2008 82 of 127       Alternative A would likely prompt some increase in shorter-term interest rates;   but given that the risk assessment would point to continued downside risks, market  participants would infer that further easing is a likely prospect, and the effects on  other financial asset prices and financial conditions more generally could be  reasonably limited  The 50 basis point easing of alternative B, in contrast, would  suggest to market participants that you are inclined to be considerably more cautious  in easing policy further, even with the downside risk assessment, and short- and  intermediate-term interest rates could ratchet considerably higher, equity prices  decline, and credit conditions tighten—responses that presumably would be  amplified, perhaps nonlinearly, under alternatives C and D       Vice Chairman, it has moved up somewhat further at least as of maybe   an hour ago  It looked as though, at least for this meeting, the odds were roughly evenly balanced   between 75 and 100, in terms of what was priced in    I just want to make one point to the Vice Chairman’s question  The way   I think about this is that monetary policy tends to move continuously  Of course, the federal funds   rate is essentially continuous, but what we are doing with liquidity measures is designed to combat   nonlinearities to the extent that they’re discontinuities, and so I think they have a different   qualitative feel  We’re attempting to prevent a breakdown in markets and allow monetary policy   thereby to operate more normally in a more continuous way    I think an issue with “edged higher” is that it really does sound as   though you have some very specific measures in mind     I think if you take it out that very much raises the question of what to   do with that language in red about the factors that would push inflation down  It would be tough   to drop the inflation expectations thought and not have inflation expectations mentioned   anywhere in the paragraph  There would just be vacant space where you had, at least in previous   minutes, referred to it    I’m not sure  I mean, in my mind it mitigates it   2  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for   Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Table 1 shows the central  tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2008, 2009, and 2010  Central  tendencies and ranges of the projections published by the Committee last February  are shown in italics  Regarding your monetary policy assumptions (not shown) about  three-fourths of the participants envisage a moderately to substantially higher federal  funds rate by late next year than assumed in the Greenbook, a path perhaps similar to  the one incorporated in financial market quotes  Most of you conditioned your  projections on a path for the federal funds rate that begins to rise either in late 2008 or  sometime in 2009, in contrast to the Greenbook path, which remains flat through  2009  Many of you were less clear whether you differed from the Greenbook path                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   April 29–30, 2008 30 of 266    over the near term; but with a little reading between the lines, it seems fair to say that  most of you assumed a slightly higher funds rate over the near term       As shown in the first set of rows and first column of table 1, the central tendency   of your real economic growth forecasts for 2008 has been marked down nearly 1  percentage point since January  Most of you pointed to weak incoming data, tight  credit conditions, falling house prices, and rising energy prices as factors that  prompted you to lower your growth expectations for this year  About half of you  forecast a decline in economic activity over the first half of the year (not shown), with  another quarter of you seeing a flat trajectory over that period  However, only four of  you used the word “recession” to describe the current state of the economy  None of  you has a more negative first-half outlook than the Greenbook  The downward  revisions to your growth forecasts are roughly equal across both halves of 2008, and  so the contour remains one of a rising growth rate over the year  Members’  projections for the speed of the recovery in late 2008 exhibit considerable dispersion,  with some calling for a quick return to near-potential growth supported by monetary  and fiscal stimulus, and others seeing a prolonged period of weakness owing partly to  persisting financial headwinds  Most of you appear to expect growth to return to near  its trend rate in 2009 (column 2) and to move slightly above trend in 2010 (column  3)  The Greenbook forecast for real growth in 2008 is near the low end of the central  tendency of FOMC members’ projections, but it is at the high end in 2009 and 2010     The second set of rows indicates that you have revised up your projections for the   unemployment rate throughout the forecast period  Of those of you who provided  estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, most expect unemployment to remain  above the natural rate in 2010 with the others seeing a return to the natural rate     As shown in the third set of rows, your projections for headline PCE inflation in   2008 have been revised up a full percentage point, largely due to the surge in the  prices of energy and other commodities  Incoming information has also prompted a  small upward revision to your projections of core PCE inflation this year (the fourth  set of rows)  The rate of decline of core inflation in 2009 is essentially unchanged  from that in the January projections, presumably reflecting the offsetting effects of  the higher unemployment rates in the April projections, on the one hand, and the  lagged pass-through of this year’s higher food and energy prices, on the other  By  2010 the prolonged period of economic slack pushes down core inflation to around  the same rates that were projected in January  Although the central tendencies for  headline inflation, the third set of rows, also decline markedly over the forecast  period, overall inflation is projected to be about ¼ percentage point higher next year  than you anticipated in January  Nonetheless, by 2010, headline inflation is expected  to be in essentially the same range of around 1¾ to 2 percent that you forecasted in  January  Your inflation projections for 2010 are close to their values in January, but  more than half of you raised your projections for the unemployment rate in 2010  significantly more than 01 percent  To the extent that the higher unemployment rate  projections are viewed as implying an economy operating below its potential in 2010,   April 29–30, 2008 31 of 266    outside analysts may infer that you expect inflation to edge down further beyond  2010       Turning to the risks to the outlook, as shown in the upper left-hand panel of   exhibit 2, a large majority of you regard uncertainty about GDP growth as greater  than normal  The upper right-hand panel shows that most of you perceive the risks to  GDP growth as weighted to the downside  Correspondingly, the risks to  unemployment, not shown, are seen as weighted to the upside  You typically  attributed the downside growth risks to the potential for sharper declines in house  prices and persisting financial strains  Overall, the distributions of your views on the  uncertainties and skews regarding growth are little changed from January  However,  as shown in the lower panels, your perceptions of the risks regarding inflation have  changed noticeably since January  As shown in the lower left panel, only half as  many participants now see the degree of uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook as  historically normal, and twice as many see the uncertainties as larger than usual  As  indicated to the right, fewer see the risks to their outlook for overall inflation as  balanced, and more see the risks as skewed to the upside  Your narratives indicate  that you see the upside risks to inflation as deriving from the potential for continued  increases in commodity prices, further depreciation of the dollar, and an upward drift  in inflation expectations  That concludes our remarks      If you like, I could try to address that tomorrow    We must have used that just in March  It was not here in January  5  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We will be referring to the package  of material labeled “Implications of Interest on Reserves for Monetary Policy  Implementation”  Today, the staff will report on work prompted by two changes the  Congress made to the Federal Reserve Act in October 2006 and will seek your  guidance on further work  Both changes become effective in October 2011  As  shown on page 2, the first change allows the Board to authorize the Reserve Banks to  pay interest on balances maintained by depository institutions at an interest rate or  rates not to exceed the general level of short-term interest rates The second allows  the Board to set required reserve ratios on transaction deposits within a range of 0 to  14 percent rather than the currently mandated range of 8 to 14 percent, permitting the  Fed effectively to eliminate reserve requirements if it chooses These two changes  will allow the Federal Reserve to make significant improvements in its approach to  monetary policy implementation  They give us an opportunity to reduce distortions  and deadweight losses resulting from our current complex system of reserve  requirements  They also give us an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of  monetary policy implementation in routine circumstances as well as in conditions of  financial stress                                                     5 The materials used by Messrs Madigan, Meyer, Clouse, Hilton, and Dudley are appended to this transcript  (appendix 5)   April 29–30, 2008 143 of 266      While the Congress made important changes in the law, it also left some key   statutory constraints in place  As discussed on page 3, if the Board chooses to retain  reserve requirements, the law continues to allow them to be imposed only on  transaction deposits, nonpersonal time deposits, and Eurodollar liabilities and only on  depository institutions  In effect, the law continues to enshrine a system of reserve  requirements that was designed to facilitate control of M1—an objective that has had  little relevance to the conduct of US monetary policy for a quarter-century  Second,  the prohibition against paying interest on demand deposits remains in force and is a  significant continuing distortion in the US financial system  We continue to work  with congressional committees and staff to seek opportunities for the repeal of this  prohibition  Third, the law retains significant constraints on the assets that the  Federal Reserve can purchase in the open market  Fourth, interest on reserves has  potential implications for priced services and for Reserve Bank operations more  generally  Finally, the Federal Reserve remains unable to pay explicit interest on  balances held at the Federal Reserve by the Treasury and by foreign central banks     Page 4 summarizes the steps we have taken to date in our work on interest on   reserves  Shortly after the legislation was passed, the Chairman asked the staff to  begin background work  Last year, a System workgroup undertook a preliminary  study of a range of options for implementing monetary policy given the new  authorities  I’d like to recognize the participants in that workgroup, who made  remarkable progress during a period in which some of these individuals were  experiencing considerable pressures relating to the implementation of monetary  policy that day, not just in five years  These individuals included Jim Clouse, Seth  Carpenter, John Driscoll, Sherry Edwards, David Mills, and Travis Nesmith from the  Board; Spence Hilton, Leo Bartolini, Chris Burke, Todd Keister, Antoine Martin, and  Jamie McAndrews from the New York Fed; Ron Feldman from Minneapolis; Steve  Meyer from the Philadelphia Fed; and Huberto Ennis and John Weinberg from  Richmond  Separately, a System workgroup co-headed by Don Hammond here at the  Board and Ron Mitchell at the Boston Fed has begun work on the implications for  priced services of paying explicit interest on balances  In February, the Board hosted  a workshop on monetary policy implementation; five foreign central banks and the  Federal Reserve participated     As shown on page 5, our briefing today is in four parts  After this introduction,   Steve Meyer will present a summary of the Federal Reserve’s current approach to  implementing monetary policy  Next, Jim Clouse and Spence Hilton will discuss five  options for implementing the new legislative authorities  Finally, Bill Dudley will  make a number of concluding comments and present our recommendations       As shown on page 6, we will be seeking your comments on the criteria that we   have tentatively adopted for evaluating the options; on the options themselves; and on  the process and timeline that we are tentatively proposing for this project  One of the  key issues is whether you would be prepared to see reserve requirements reduced to  zero  Steve will now continue our presentation   April 29–30, 2008 144 of 266       President Hoenig, I would say that we believe we already have a fairly   good sense as to how paying interest on the required reserve balances and on excess reserves would   work, at least qualitatively  We do think it would be an acceptable means of implementing   monetary policy  As Jim noted, it probably wouldn’t be all that different in terms of monetary   policy effectiveness from the way things work now  Of course, as we also emphasized, the current   system of reserve requirements has a lot of problems  Admittedly, paying interest on required   reserve balances in some sense solves the first-order problem, but there are lots of costs associated   with the system of reserve requirements that we’ve discussed, and we think that those may warrant   serious consideration of eliminating reserve requirements  But to be clear, we’re not suggesting that   we rule out option 1 at this stage  We could certainly view it as a fallback position, for instance    Maybe I could just take the second question, and Spence or Jim may   want to take the first  On the corridor approach, for other countries that are using it—I’m thinking   of the Bank of Canada in particular here—their institutional set-up allows them extremely precise   control over the supply of reserves  Also the demand for reserves—I’m talking about reserve   balances—is considerably less uncertain than in the United States  Part of it comes from the fact   that they have only a handful of large banks    So the communication with banks regarding their reserve management is   extremely simple compared with what we could expect here in the United States    Governor Mishkin, to state the obvious, we’d want to avoid that situation   completely  We want preparation and consultation with banks ex ante as to how they would react   under various subparameterizations    If I may start with the last question, we can work our way up or around   the list  On pursuing legislative authority, the Federal Reserve is interested in accelerating that   authority  We have had some conversations with congressional staff about this  For instance, the   staff of Senate Minority Leader McConnell has asked us recently whether we’d be interested in   legislation to accelerate the authority  Of course, we responded enthusiastically  We did say to   them that it would be helpful if it were clear that we could use that authority in such a way as to be   April 29–30, 2008 167 of 266    able to pay interest on excess reserves or, rather, to buy federal funds as a way of paying interest on   excess reserves, in effect  Buying federal funds when the rate is falling would help us put a floor   under the funds rate  So we would want to be sure—perhaps Scott wants to comment on this—that   the legislation clearly permitted that  Presumably we would be able to use that authority fairly   quickly at an operational level—Bill or Spence may want to comment on this   Paying interest on required reserve balances is, of course, a whole other matter  That   involves complicated systems, and we would simply want to be sure that we made this clear to the   congressional staffs, that it would take a longer time before we could implement that    My impression is, as Bill said, that it is small and there may not even be   positive costs if you confine it to excess  The issues of paying interest on required reserves are   possibly a little more troublesome, but that may be viewed as a worthwhile cost to undertake at this   point    Well, the governance issues are that the FOMC is in charge of open   market operations and setting the target for the federal funds rate, at least under current approaches   to policy  The legislation specifies that the Board is in charge of setting the rates paid on balances to   April 29–30, 2008 169 of 266    institutions  For instance, there may be differential rates as in option 1 on required reserve balances   and excess reserve balances  Presumably, if we went with option 1, for instance, one approach   would be to simply set them by formula relative to the target federal funds rate  We don’t mean to   say that this is likely to be an enormously large issue, at least in some of the options, but it ought to   be handled carefully    I think that’s worth some further thought, Governor Kroszner  One issue   though, as I’m sure you know, is that the Board is required by law to publish weekly information on   the individual Banks’ balance sheets as well as the consolidated balance sheet with a certain amount   of detail  I don’t remember the exact legal wording, but at least within the current law, to back   away from that might be difficult  Of course, you could conceivably pursue a change in the law, but   I think we would want to think about the pros and cons of that before you went in that direction    Absolutely, we agree  Of course, when the Board adopted the primary   credit program in 2003, we gave a lot of thought before that and did considerable work after that to   try to minimize the amount of stigma by trying to make very clear to banks that in our view use of   the window didn’t entail stigma  But the fundamental problem still is that banks are concerned that   their use of the window may be detected in the market one way or another, especially in a period of   financial stress, and that is just not a cost worth incurring    Well, I certainly think at this point the three that you mentioned first    At this stage, if we are going to go to with three, we might want to think about putting all five   out, just to flesh out all parts of the spectrum and acknowledge that option 1 could be a fallback    We have to think about the pros and cons of that, but certainly the three at this point is where the   consensus seems to be   3  I will be referring to the separate package labeled “Material   for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  The top two sections of  table 1 show the central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for the first  and second halves of 2008; central tendencies and ranges of the projections published  by the Committee this past April are shown in italics  To facilitate comparisons, the  Greenbook projections are shown in the bottom section      In your forecast submissions, most of you indicated that you saw appropriate   monetary policy as entailing a path for the federal funds rate that lies above that  assumed in the Greenbook  As shown in the first row, first column, of table 1, the  central tendency of your real growth forecasts for the first half of 2008 has been  marked up substantially since April  However, a number of you noted that recent  upside surprises to consumer and business spending are likely to prove transitory and  that falling house prices, tight credit conditions, and elevated energy prices will  probably restrain growth over the remainder of 2008  Accordingly, some of you  revised down a touch your growth expectations for the second half of this year (the  second column) especially those of you who had previously anticipated the briskest                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   June 24–25, 2008 21 of 253    growth rates, as indicated by the downward revision to the upper end of the range  shown in the middle section  Most of you think the economy will skirt recession   Nonetheless, your projections for the speed of recovery over the second half exhibit  considerable dispersion  Four participants are projecting growth rates of real GDP  between 2 and 2¼ percent, whereas an equal number are calling for growth at an  annual rate of only around ½ percent, a pace similar to the one projected in the  Greenbook, with many of you attributing the tepid growth partly to financial  headwinds  The tendency for some clustering of your second-half growth forecasts at  the extremes can be seen by noting the similarity between the central tendency and  the range  As shown in the second set of rows in the top panel, your projections for  headline PCE inflation in the second half of 2008 have been revised up more than  1 percentage point, to around 3½ to 4¾ percent, largely as a result of the surge in  prices of energy and agricultural commodities  However, in view of better-than- expected news on core PCE inflation, the central tendency of your projections for  core inflation during the second half (shown in the third set of rows) revised up only  01 percentage point       Looking ahead to 2009 (table 2, the middle column), you continue to expect   growth to pick up as the drag from the housing sector dissipates and credit conditions  ease  The midpoint of the central tendency of your forecast for real GDP growth next  year is 24 percent, the same as in April and the same as the staff’s current forecast   Your growth forecasts for 2010 (the third column) are a shade lower than in April,  and the central tendency of your forecasts for the unemployment rate is a touch  higher, perhaps because a number of you assumed more policy tightening over the  forecast period in order to counter heightened inflation pressures  The midpoint of  the central tendency of your projections for the unemployment rate edges down from  about 5½ percent in 2009 to about 5¼ percent in 2010  Your commentaries suggest  that many, albeit not all, of you view those rates as a quarter-point to a half-point  above your estimates of the NAIRU  The third and fourth sets of rows indicate that  most of you see overall and core inflation staying above 2 percent next year; but by  2010, the extended period of economic slack and the assumed leveling-out of energy  prices push down overall and core inflation to around 1¾ to 2 percent; for core  inflation, the central tendency and range are a touch higher than you forecasted in  April  For the first time since you started these projections last October, the upper  end of the range of your projection of total inflation in 2010 exceeds 2 percent, albeit  marginally  Thus, many of you project that, at the end of the forecast period, the  economy will still be operating with some slack and real output growth will be  slightly above the growth rate of potential  The continued presence of slack suggests  that you anticipate that inflation will continue to edge lower in 2011 and, given the  assumption of appropriate monetary policy, implies that you typically anticipate that  inflation will still be a bit higher in 2010 than you see as consistent with price  stability         Exhibit 3 presents your views on the risks and uncertainties in the outlook  As   shown by the green bars in the top two panels, a large majority of you continue to  perceive the risks to growth as weighted to the downside (the left panel), and many   June 24–25, 2008 22 of 253    judge that the degree of uncertainty regarding prospects for economic activity is  unusually high (the right panel), although the number of you seeing uncertainty about  growth as elevated has declined slightly over the first half of the year  In your  narratives, you attributed the downside risks primarily to the potential for steeper  declines in house prices and persisting financial strains, which through a further  tightening of credit conditions could exert an unexpectedly large restraint on  household and business spending  Although your views of the risks regarding growth  have shifted only modestly, the distribution of your perceptions of the risks regarding  inflation (shown in the bottom two panels) has changed significantly so far this year   As shown in the lower left panel, about three-quarters of you now see the risks to the  outlook for overall inflation as skewed to the upside  In your commentaries, you  typically pointed to continued increases in energy and food prices and an upward drift  in inflation expectations as the main reasons for the upside risks to inflation  In  addition, as shown to the right, the number of participants who perceive the degree of  uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook as larger than usual has risen considerably       Turning to exhibit 4, as I noted, your projections suggest that you do not see the   economy as having fully settled into a steady state by 2010  The dynamics of the  economy evidently are such that, following moderately large shocks, it can take quite  a few years to converge back to steady state, a view that is captured by many  econometric models such as FRB/US and is also reflected in the current Greenbook  forecast  Thus, the three-year forecast horizon currently used by the Committee does  not necessarily allow your forecasts to reveal fully your views of the steady-state  characteristics of the economy and your views of the rate of inflation consistent with  the dual mandate  Recognizing this, the Subcommittee on Communications recently  sent the Committee a memo outlining several possible approaches to providing  longer-term projections  The approaches are summarized in the lower panel     One option would be for participants to extend their entire set of projections out   to, say, five years  Under this option, participants would be asked to submit  projections for economic variables in year 4 as well as in year 5  You would also  expand your individual forecast narratives to explain the trajectory of the economy  and inflation over the five-year projection period  This approach would have the  advantage of providing the basis for a complete presentation of the Committee’s  medium-term and long-term views  The principal disadvantage of this option is the  relatively heavy burden it places on Committee participants to make projections  covering five years  Another disadvantage is that in some circumstances—that is,  following a very large shock—the economy still may not be in a steady state after  five years     A second option is for participants to continue to submit economic projections   and narratives out to three years as now but also to provide estimates of the values of  output growth, unemployment, and inflation in year 5 under the assumption of  appropriate monetary policy  Under this approach, you might wish to collect and  publish long-term projections only for output growth, unemployment, and total  inflation, and not for core inflation, in order to emphasize that total inflation rather   June 24–25, 2008 23 of 253    than core inflation is the appropriate metric for the longer-run goal of price stability   This second approach presumably places less demand on your time than the first but  it would make for a less integrated presentation  It would also suffer from the same  defect as the first approach, in that the figures you submit might not reveal the steady- state characteristics of the economy after a large shock     In a third approach, you would augment your three-year projections with   projections of the average values for output growth, unemployment, and total  inflation over the period five to ten years ahead  This approach would have the  advantage of more directly revealing your estimates of the key operating  characteristics of the economy—that is, the parameters related to productive capacity  and your inflation objective  It might also be less demanding of your time in the  sense that you would need to project fewer time periods than in the first option  On  the other hand, it might be more difficult in that you would need to consider likely  trends in demographic variables and productivity further ahead than is ordinarily  necessary for monetary policy making  Moreover, it is possible that some of the  parameters you would be supplying for the period five to ten years ahead might take  on different values than would apply to the medium term that is relevant for monetary  policy     In your comments in the upcoming economic go-round, you may wish to express   your views on whether you support publication of longer-run projections and, if so,  which of the approaches you prefer  You might also wish to comment on the  desirability of conducting a trial run with long-term projections—say, in October— before going live with long-term projections, perhaps in January  That concludes our  prepared remarks      4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will begin by referring to the draft  announcement language in table 1, included in the package labeled “Material for  FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  As Chairman Bernanke noted  yesterday, this version is only slightly revised from the version discussed in the  Bluebook  Rather than keep you in suspense, I will note now that the revision is  simply to strike the phrase “near-term” from alternative B, paragraph 4       Turning first to alternative A, the Committee would ease policy 25 basis points at   this meeting and would issue a statement similar to the one published after the April  FOMC meeting  The second paragraph would indicate that economic activity has  remained weak in recent months  It would recognize that consumer spending appears  to have firmed but would go on to mention other aspects of economic performance  that remain weak  The paragraph on inflation would cite the recent further increase in  energy prices but would also note the stability of core inflation  It would again  express the Committee’s expectation for inflation to moderate, partly reflecting a  leveling-off of energy prices, but would acknowledge that uncertainty about the  inflation outlook remains high  As in April, the final paragraph would be silent on  the balance of risks and on the likely path of policy     For most of you, your baseline outlook would seem to provide little support for   selection of alternative A at this meeting  As was noted yesterday, most of you  conditioned your projections on a path for policy that begins to tilt up either  immediately or sometime in the next few quarters  With such a policy path, the  central tendency of your projections points to a gradual pickup in economic growth  and a fairly prompt drop in total inflation as energy and other commodity prices level  out but only a gradual decline in core inflation, which reflects the moderate amount of  economic slack that you foresee over the next few years  As was illustrated in one of                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   June 24–25, 2008 99 of 253    the optimal control simulations presented in the Bluebook, a case can be made for  alternative A if you agree with the staff baseline outlook and favor aiming for  2 percent inflation over the longer term  One of the estimated policy rules presented  in the Bluebook also suggests modest further easing, but again that prescription relies  on the staff’s forecast rather than on your generally stronger near-term outlook  But  given the modal outlooks of most members of the Committee, any case for easing at  this meeting would seem to be best motivated by persisting concern about the  downside risks to growth that many of you again cited in your forecast submissions   The “recession” simulation in the Greenbook provided one plausible scenario for the  realization of such risks and suggested that the funds rate might need to be lowered to  1½ percent      Under alternative B, the Committee would leave the stance of policy unchanged   at this meeting  The statement would note that economic activity continues to expand  and, as in alternative A, would mention the firming of consumer spending  It would  cite the same factors that could restrain economic growth that were referenced in  April and would add the rise in energy prices to the list  The inflation paragraph  would again convey the Committee’s anticipation that inflation will moderate but  would elide the explanation for that expectation and would reference high uncertainty  about inflation prospects  The final paragraph would indicate that the downside risks  to growth appear to have diminished somewhat and that the upside risks to inflation  and inflation expectations have increased  As I noted previously, we have suggested  that the phrase “near-term” be struck as the Committee’s focus presumably is on  longer-term inflation  The references to risks to both growth and inflation would be  consistent with the concerns that you expressed in your forecast submissions  The  statement proposed for alternative B seems generally in line with market  expectations, and an announcement along these lines is unlikely to provoke much  market reaction  By pointing to reduced risks to growth and increased risks to  inflation while not explicitly stating that the inflation risks predominate, the  Committee would likely be seen as suggesting that its next policy move could be  toward firming but also that such a move probably was not imminent     A policy approach along the lines of alternative B seems generally consistent with   the projections that many of you provided for this round  Although most participants  conditioned their projections on a steeper policy path than the one in the Greenbook,  many also appeared to assume that the firming process would not commence until  later this year or in 2009  A decision to stand pat at this meeting might be motivated  importantly by your sense that the risks in both directions around your baseline  projections are substantial  While staying your hand today might risk a further  upcreep in inflation expectations, you might also be concerned that a policy firming  now, given that financial markets are still fragile, would risk having outsized market  effects with adverse implications for an economy that remains weak  As a result, you  may see benefits to allowing more time for financial markets to recuperate and more  time for information on the outlook to accumulate before taking policy action   Holding the funds rate at 2 percent at this meeting would be consistent with the   June 24–25, 2008 100 of 253    Committee’s past behavior as captured by the estimated outcome-based rule  presented in the Bluebook     Under alternative C, the final column, the Committee would firm policy 25 basis   points at this meeting  In the statement, the paragraph on real activity would be  identical to that for alternative B  However, the third paragraph would provide the  motivation for the action by emphasizing that overall inflation has been elevated, that  energy prices have risen further, and that inflation expectations have risen further   No assessment of the balance of risks would be provided in the final paragraph, thus  avoiding a suggestion that the firming signaled a sequence of further rate increases   Nonetheless, with market participants currently seeing only a small chance of a rate  increase at this meeting, an announcement along the lines of alternative C would  likely prompt a considerable jump in short- and intermediate-term market interest  rates     Although most of your forecasts appeared to assume that policy firming would   begin later this year or early next year, some of you explicitly assumed an earlier start  to policy tightening  Members might believe that firming at this meeting is warranted  partly by evidence of some reduction in downside risks to growth  Recent spending  data suggest that economic activity has a bit more forward momentum than  previously perceived, reducing the odds on recession; the modest improvement in  financial market conditions points to some reduction in downside risks; and the  Federal Reserve’s special liquidity facilities appear to have been successful in  reducing the odds of negative tail events and severe adverse feedback loops  Thus  members might see it as appropriate now to begin to reverse some of the Committee’s  past policy actions to the extent that those actions were seen as motivated by  downside risks that have now diminished  Also, near-term firming might be  motivated by the further increases in inflation pressures and risks resulting from the  continued upward march of energy and some other commodity prices  Finally, with  inflation expectations continuing to show some signs of moving up, a firming of  policy at this time might be viewed as a timely shot across the bow that could be  helpful in restraining such expectations     I thought that it might be helpful to conclude by reviewing two exhibits from the   medium-term strategies section of the Bluebook, starting with the optimal policy  simulations that are reproduced in exhibit 2  The simulations underlying these  exhibits are based on the FRB/US model after adjusting it to line up with the  Greenbook forecast and extension  As usual, these simulations assume that you aim  to minimize the sum of squared deviations of inflation from target, squared deviations  of the unemployment rate from the NAIRU, and squared changes in the nominal  funds rate  Two key points can be drawn from these simulations       First, whether policy firming should begin sooner or later may depend partly on   your longer-run inflation objective  As shown by the black line in the top right-hand  panel, if your objective for the longer run is to get back to a 2 percent inflation rate,  these simulations suggest that you can hold the funds rate steady or even ease slightly   June 24–25, 2008 101 of 253    further before beginning to firm in 2010  This policy path produces a somewhat  faster decline in the output gap and thus somewhat slower disinflation than in the  Greenbook and extension  In contrast, the simulations shown in the left-hand column  suggest that pursuit of a 1½ percent inflation objective would involve policy firming  beginning quite soon  In general, the policy paths described by many of you in your  forecast submissions seem to fall between these two scenarios, apparently reflecting  your sense that aggregate demand growth could be a bit stronger and inflation  pressures a bit more intense than projected by the staff as well as your dissatisfaction  with a path for inflation that is as shallow as that for the scenario with a 2 percent  inflation objective     The second point underscored by these simulations is that, even though the near-  term path for the unemployment rate is a bit lower than in April, reflecting the recent  indications of somewhat greater strength in aggregate demand, the medium-term  outlook involves larger and more persistent slack than foreseen in April under either  inflation goal  Despite that greater slack, as shown in the bottom two panels, core  inflation under both inflation objectives runs 01 to 03 percentage point higher over  the next four years than in the April simulations  That, of course, is the fundamental  nature of a negative supply shock  Policymakers are forced to accept some  combination of greater economic slack and higher inflation during a period of  transition to a lower output path and, presumably, to an unchanged long-run inflation  rate  That same point was made in a Bluebook box and in a staff paper on this  subject       Turning to your final exhibit, I would like to note that, in response to the   comments of some members at recent FOMC meetings, the r* exhibit in the  Bluebook has been augmented to include two additional measures of the real federal  funds rate  Line 11 in the table at the bottom shows a measure of the real federal  funds rate that uses lagged headline inflation as a proxy for expected inflation  By  contrast, our standard measure, shown on line 10, employs lagged core inflation as  the proxy  Line 12 shows a measure based on the staff’s projection of headline  inflation  Both of these new measures, at minus 13 percent, are considerably lower  than the current value of the standard measure, minus 02 percent       I want to emphasize, first, that these additional measures should not be compared   directly with the r* measures shown in lines 1 through 9 of the table because the  values of those measures are in part a function of the proxy used for expected  inflation  For example, the r* value that would be consistent with the Greenbook  projection and the actual real funds rate based on the lagged four-quarter average of  headline inflation is minus 07 percent  Moreover, even if we redefined the  Greenbook-consistent measure of r* to use lagged headline inflation, the implied  06 percentage point gap between the actual and the estimated equilibrium real rates  would not necessarily imply that you should quickly raise the nominal funds rate by  more than ½ percentage point  If, like the staff, you think it likely that headline  inflation will moderate substantially later this year, then it follows that a gradual  firming of policy in nominal terms would be consistent with a substantial rise in the   June 24–25, 2008 102 of 253    real funds rate on this measure over time  Indeed, in the staff’s view, the average  value of the real federal funds rate over the next few years on any measure is a bit  above the corresponding value of r*, and consequently the trajectory of the real funds  rate on any measure would be consistent with protracted slack and declining inflation  over the next several years  Of course, you may not agree with the staff about  underlying trends for prices and real activity and, hence, about the value of r*  Even  if you do agree, you may be dissatisfied with the projected trajectories for key  variables such as output, employment, and inflation  Such considerations illustrate  why no estimate of r* can be a complete guide to policy  That completes my  prepared remarks      Unfortunately, President Lacker, I haven’t made that computation, so I   can’t confirm that    Well, in any given quarter, it’s four quarters ahead    Yes    The actual real federal funds rate is above r* under any measures—so in   other words, our outlook is the same  These are just different yardsticks for assessing our basic   view of the stance of policy   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  If you prefer, in the interest of  time, I can cut back my remarks to focus just on the policy statement and not the  general background  I will be referring to the version of table 1 included in the  package labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”   This version incorporates some small revisions from the draft that was included in the  August Bluebook  The table presents two policy alternatives  Under alternative B,  the Committee would maintain its current policy stance at this meeting but in its  statement would underscore its concerns about inflation  Under alternative C, the  Committee would firm policy 25 basis points today and issue a statement indicating  that the action was taken to better balance the risks to growth and inflation; the  statement would be noncommittal about whether further rate increases were  imminent       The language proposed for paragraph 2 of alternative B has been modified a little   from that proposed in the Bluebook  Most important, the first clause is now in the  past tense, referring to economic growth in the second quarter, thus avoiding an  implication that the economy is continuing to expand in the current quarter  In a  change relative to the June statement, exports as well as consumer spending are cited  as factors that supported growth  Also, the sentence beginning with “over time” has  been moved up from the risk assessment paragraph  That shift is likely to be seen as  underscoring a view that policy is currently positioned to foster a gradual resumption  of moderate economic growth, suggesting that further easing is not likely to be  forthcoming  That sense may also be reinforced by the omission of the phrase “to  date” after “easing of monetary policy”  In paragraph 3, the inflation discussion for  alternative B gives slightly greater emphasis than in June to the Committee’s inflation                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   August 5, 2008 102 of 145    concerns, partly by starting with the flat statement that “inflation has been high” and  by giving less prominence to the expectation that inflation will moderate  The slight  change to the final clause in paragraph 3 is proposed for purely stylistic reasons  In  paragraph 4, the first sentence of the risk assessment states that “although downside  risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to  the Committee”  While this sentence does not provide any explicit weighting of the  two risks and does not suggest that policy firming is imminent, the statement as a  whole probably would be read as giving a bit more emphasis to inflation concerns and  a bit less to growth concerns than market participants now expect  Thus, even though  the absence of a rate action today would be consistent with market expectations, the  statement would likely be viewed by market participants as a bit more hawkish than  they anticipated, and market rates could rise modestly in response       Turning to alternative C, concerns about upside risks to inflation could motivate   the Committee to begin firming the stance of monetary policy at this meeting  The  first three sentences of alternative C, paragraph 2, are identical to those of alternative  B  However, the final sentence differs, partly by indicating explicitly that the  Committee sees the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative  Also, by  dropping the phrase “over time,” which appeared in paragraph 4 of the June version,  the Committee would suggest that it sees moderate economic growth as resuming  sooner rather than later  In paragraph 3, the Committee would still note that inflation  is expected to moderate but, in the last sentence of the paragraph, it would explicitly  cite the risk—and note its concern—that inflation might not fall as expected  Finally,  the risk assessment, paragraph 4, would indicate that the Committee firmed policy  today in order to better balance the upside risks to inflation and the downside risks to  growth  However, the statement would avoid an explicit judgment about whether the  risks were now balanced and would provide little information about whether further  tightening was imminent     Even though the wording of the statement for alternative C would not indicate   that policy was now on a steady firming march, market participants would likely  conclude that the firming process had been accelerated considerably relative to their  expectations  With the Committee having tightened amid bad news about financial  institutions and in the immediate wake of the implementation of a number of  additional Federal Reserve liquidity initiatives, investors would likely conclude that  the Committee did not see financial stability considerations as raising a barrier to  further policy tightening  They would view the Committee as adopting a more  aggressive posture toward inflation  Because it has been historically rare for the  Federal Reserve to implement a one-off tightening, investors would likely see fairly  steady rate hikes over the course of future meetings, and thus short- and intermediate- term interest rates would, in all likelihood, move up sharply after this action  Yields  on longer-term fixed-rate mortgages might rise particularly substantially, as  premiums for interest rate and prepayment uncertainty increased and as mortgage  investors hedged the increase in mortgage durations  Such a development could  adversely affect the prices of financial assets that are closely tied to housing markets  and mortgage performance  However, yields on long-term Treasuries could decline,   August 5, 2008 103 of 145    particularly if market participants marked down their expectations for economic  growth and inflation      I would say, President Fisher, that the substitution that you are   suggesting seems plausible to me, but I would also say that the first sentence of alternative B   already does suggest some pretty significant concerns about inflation     January 30    Yes, Mr Chairman  Everybody should have it  2  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for  FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives and Trial Run Survey Results”   The results of the survey are shown in exhibit 2  In the interest of time, I will not  cover them this morning  The Subcommittee on Communications plans to be in  touch with the Committee on this issue over the upcoming intermeeting period     The first page of the package reproduces the version of table 1 that you received   yesterday afternoon  This version includes three policy alternatives  As in the  Bluebook, alternative B would leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting,  and alternative C would involve a 25 basis point firming today  However, alternative  A now entails a 25 basis point policy easing rather than the unchanged funds rate that  was specified in the Bluebook version of this alternative       I will begin by discussing alternative C  The discussion at your last meeting   suggested that you generally saw the next move in policy as likely to be a firming, a  point that was explicit in the minutes of the meeting  Even though market volatility  and financial strains have increased notably in recent weeks, you might view those  developments as having only limited implications for the economic outlook and  hence see economic fundamentals as continuing to suggest that policy should soon be  firmed  Inflation has been well above the rates that Committee members judge as  appropriate for the longer run, and despite lower oil prices and greater slack in labor  markets, there remains considerable uncertainty about how soon and how much core  inflation will slow  In these circumstances, you may believe that a firming of policy  is appropriate       Under the version of alternative B distributed yesterday evening, the Committee   would hold the target funds rate constant at this meeting, and the statement would  suggest that the Committee sees the risks to growth and inflation as roughly balanced   You may believe that this combination is appropriate for this meeting if your modal  outlook for the economy has not changed much since the last meeting and if you  judge that the upside risks to inflation have diminished, given the sharp drop in  energy prices, the decline in indicators of inflation expectations, and the greater  economic slack implied by the recent unexpectedly sharp jump in the unemployment  rate  You might also believe that the downside risks to growth have increased as a  result of the recent increase in financial strains  But at the same time, you may want                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   September 16, 2008 25 of 108    to let the dust settle a bit before concluding that these developments warrant an  adjustment in your policy stance  In particular, you may think there is a good chance  that the latest enhancements to the Federal Reserve’s special liquidity facilities will  help keep markets functioning and mitigate the risks to growth      Relative to the Bluebook version, the language of alternative B has been revised   in three material ways  First, B2 now notes that “strains in financial markets have  intensified”  Second, the clause “some indicators of inflation expectations have been  elevated” has been dropped from B3 in view of the recent declines in inflation  compensation and survey measures of inflation expectations  Finally, the first  sentence of B4 has been revised to suggest that the Committee now sees the  significant risks to growth and inflation as roughly balanced  Given market  participants’ expectation that the funds rate could trade soft to the target for a time in  light of recent developments, gauging exactly what is built into markets for the  outcome of today’s meeting is difficult  But earlier this morning, market prices  appeared to incorporate high odds of at least a 25 basis point easing today or possibly  more  Thus markets might well see a decision to keep the funds rate constant and to  make no appreciable change to the language of the statement as signaling less  concern about financial developments than they anticipated       If you saw recent developments as significantly boosting the downside risks to   growth or noticeably lowering the modal outlook, you might consider easing the  federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting, as in alternative A  The rationale  language for this action would begin by noting that strains in financial markets have  increased significantly and would go on to indicate that the policy action should help  to promote moderate growth over time  The Committee would cite the recent decline  in energy and other commodity prices and the increased slack in resource utilization  as factors that are expected to foster a moderation of inflation  The risk assessment  would indicate that “the downside risks to growth have intensified, but the upside  risks to inflation remain a concern to the Committee”  With a policy easing largely  built into markets, shorter-term interest rates would likely decline modestly in  response to such an action, depending on how much is built in, or they might be little  changed  As the Chairman indicated earlier in the meeting, adjustments to the  statement could be considered in light of the further volatility in markets over the past  day  Thank you, Mr Chairman      I agree  The fact that the first sentence of the risk assessment has a   parallel treatment of the upside and downside risks may communicate a bit the sense that you are   not ready to ease immediately    That you are not particularly ready to change your stance of policy   September 16, 2008 81 of 108      Thanks, Mr Chairman  I’ll read a resolution regarding the swap lines    “The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to take   the following actions to amend the existing temporary swap arrangements with foreign central   banks as follows  with the Bank of Canada, to increase the aggregate amount to $30 billion; with   September 29, 2008 9 of 16    the Bank of England to increase the aggregate amount to $80 billion; with the Bank of Japan to   increase the aggregate amount to $120 billion; with the Danish National Bank to increase the   aggregate amount to $15 billion; with the European Central Bank to increase the aggregate amount   to $240 billion; with the Norges Bank to increase the aggregate amount to $15 billion; with the   Reserve Bank of Australia to increase the aggregate amount to $30 billion; with the Swedish   Riksbank to increase the aggregate amount to $30 billion; with the Swiss National Bank to increase   the aggregate amount to $60 billion  In each case the System Open Market Account Manager   would be authorized to determine appropriate liquidity buffers  The FOMC also extends the current   delegation of authority to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee until April 30, 2009”    Thanks, Mr Chairman  As the Chairman indicated, the TARP  legislation includes a provision that accelerates the effective date of the authority to pay  interest on reserves from October 1, 2011, to October 1, 2008  The Federal Reserve  staff believes that we’re ready to start paying interest on reserve balances beginning with  the reserve maintenance period that starts on October 9   Assuming that the legislation is  passed by the Congress and signed by the President later this week, we plan to  recommend shortly thereafter to the Board that the Board direct the Reserve Banks to  begin paying interest on reserves on October 9  Specifically, we plan to suggest that  required reserve balances be remunerated at a rate of the target federal funds rate less  10 basis points, and more significantly in current circumstances, that excess reserve  balances be remunerated initially at a rate of the target federal funds rate less 50 basis  points  We anticipate that the spread between the excess reserves rate and the target  federal funds rate may well need to be adjusted over time, but we’re suggesting a  50 basis point spread initially  We’re proposing no other significant changes to the   September 29, 2008 14 of 16    reserve maintenance framework at this time, although we’ll be recommending a few  relatively technical changes that are motivated by the ability to pay interest on reserves   In more normal circumstances, we’d think of the system that we’re recommending at  this time as being a type of a corridor system but with required reserves  The primary  credit rate should set the ceiling for the federal funds rate; the excess reserves rate  should set the floor     In the current circumstances, though, it may turn out that the system will operate   more like what we have been calling a floor system in which the gap between the target  federal funds rate and the excess reserves rate is narrow  This is because, as was  discussed earlier, our tools to absorb reserves provided by, again, various lending  operations could be constrained given the limited remaining capacity to sell securities  and possibly reluctance on the part of Treasury to expand further the supplementary  financing program  In any case, the interest rate on excess reserves should put a floor— possibly a soft floor, but a floor—under the funds rate and thereby allow the Federal  Reserve to conduct monetary policy appropriately while providing liquidity consistent  with financial stability  I would note that the overall reserve maintenance framework  will remain very complex, possibly overly complex  The staff plans to continue the  study that we presented to the Reserve Bank presidents and the Board members earlier  this year, and at some point, we expect to bring significant further changes to the  policymakers for consideration  But for now, we think that the changes that we’re  proposing will make effective use of the authority that we expect we’ll have beginning  on October 1  Thanks, Mr Chairman      President Lacker, I think we’re going to need to proceed somewhat   adaptively  We’ll be going from one type of system, in which there has been no remuneration on   excess reserves, to one with a rate that’s fairly close to—50 basis points under—the federal funds   rate  My guess is that it could attract a substantial increase in banks’ interest in holding excess   reserves, especially under current circumstances, when there’s a lot of concern about counterparty   September 29, 2008 15 of 16    credit risk  It may well be the case, as I mentioned, that we’ll be proposing a further narrowing of   the excess reserves rate as we get experience, and we may, indeed, have to do that if our ability to   drain reserves is otherwise constrained  We may need to use the excess reserves rate as the way to   effectively set the federal funds rate  But I think we’ll need to see how it goes and get some   experience     They do not     I would say that we may well be in a situation where the interest rate on   excess reserves is the effective tool for controlling the federal funds rate, and there may be a spread    As Bill said, we are in the process of learning how this works, and it may well be the case that we   need to push that interest rate on excess reserves very close to the federal funds rate   October 28–29, 2008 45 of 206     There’s not really a policy reason  I would say there’s a legal reason    The statute allows us to pay interest only on balances held by depository institutions  My own view   is that it would be a good thing if we were able to pay interest to the GSEs exactly for the reasons   that we’ve been discussing  It might be something we could seek authority for at some point in the   future    We would have to look at that  I think there are more than just the three   GSEs that we usually think of  But they’re the biggest institutions that participate in the federal   funds market  5  I will be referring to the separate package labeled “Material   for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Exhibit 1 shows the  central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2008; corresponding  information about the Committee’s most recent projections, those from June, is  shown in italics, and Greenbook projections are included as a memo item  Your June  projections regarding GDP growth and inflation for the first half of 2008 turned out to  be quite close to subsequent BEA data releases; therefore, the revisions in your                                                     5 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   October 28–29, 2008 54 of 206    projections for the year as a whole are almost entirely due to the changes in your  implicit projections for the second half of 2008       As shown in the right column of the top panel, your GDP growth forecasts for   2008H2 now range from minus 2½ percent to minus ¾ percent; compared with June,  each of you has marked down your projection for second-half growth by at least  2 percentage points  As shown in the second panel, your forecasts of the fourth- quarter average unemployment rate fall in a range of 63 to 66 percent, more than  ½ percentage point higher than in June  In accounting for the sharp deterioration in  the near-term outlook for activity, your narratives point to the intensification of the  financial crisis and its impact on credit conditions and stock market wealth as well as  the weakness of incoming data on consumer spending and labor market conditions       Your assessments of inflation in 2008 have also shifted significantly since June    The central tendency of your forecasts for overall PCE inflation during 2008H2 (the  right column of the third panel) is now about 1½ to 2¼ percent, a drop of about  2 percentage points from June  In this regard, a number of you noted the implications  of recent sharp declines in energy and commodity prices that were apparently  triggered by the worldwide slowdown in economic activity  In contrast, your  projections for core PCE inflation in 2008H2 (the right column of the bottom panel)  are a notch higher than in June     Exhibit 2 reports your projections for the next three calendar years  Most of you   anticipate little or no GDP growth during 2009; as with your implicit forecasts for the  second half of 2008, these projections are about 2 percentage points lower than in  June  A few of you are projecting even weaker outcomes, with output declining  about 1 percent, whereas a few others are projecting stronger economic growth of  about 1½ to 1¾ percent  The width of both the ranges and the central tendencies of  your projections for real GDP growth for 2009 and 2010 has increased noticeably   Still, all of you anticipate that economic expansion will resume by 2010, and most of  you expect a further pickup in growth during 2011  In the narratives accompanying  these projections, a number of you said that you expect the pace of recovery to be  damped by persistent credit market strains, ongoing adjustment in the housing  market, and economic weakness abroad  Apparently, only a few of you assumed that  additional fiscal stimulus would be enacted     Most of you project that the unemployment rate will peak at around 7 to   7½ percent in 2009 and decline gradually over the subsequent two years  However,  you generally expect that, even by the end of 2011, the unemployment rate will still  be at or above 5½ percent  Moreover, most of you anticipate that the unemployment  rate in 2011 will remain well above your own projections of the longer-run  unemployment rate that were provided in your trial-run submissions       The central tendency of your projections for overall PCE inflation is about 1¼ to   2 percent for 2009 and about 1½ to 1¾ percent for 2010 and 2011—roughly the same  as for your forecasts of core PCE inflation  About half of you projected inflation   October 28–29, 2008 55 of 206    rates in 2011 close or identical to your own individual assessments of the rate of  inflation consistent with Federal Reserve’s dual mandate for promoting price stability  and maximum employment, where we have again judged the latter from your longer- term trial-run submissions  But half of you are projecting that inflation in 2011 will  be below your own individual assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate by  about ¼ to ½ percentage point, and in one case, by more than 1 percentage point,  mainly reflecting the lagged effects of weak economic activity and the relatively  sluggish pace of recovery     In your forecast submissions, several of you indicated that the appropriate path of   monetary policy would involve less near-term easing than assumed in the Greenbook,  and more than half of you expressed the view that policy tightening would need to  occur several quarters earlier and at a substantially more rapid pace than in the  Greenbook       Exhibit 3 presents your views on the risks and uncertainties in the outlook  As   shown in the top left-hand panel, all of you now see uncertainty about growth as  elevated relative to historical norms  As shown to the right, most of you continue to  perceive the risks to growth as weighted to the downside even with the downward  revision in your modal projections  Several of you pointed to the possibility that  financial market turmoil might not subside as quickly as anticipated and to significant  risks of an increasingly negative feedback loop between credit markets and economic  activity  As shown in the bottom left-hand panel, most of you also continue to see an  elevated degree of uncertainty about inflation  In June, most of you judged the risks  to the inflation outlook as skewed to the upside, but as shown to the right, nearly all  of you now see the risks to the inflation outlook as either balanced or tilted to the  downside        Exhibit 4 summarizes the results of the trial run on longer-term projections    These projections were intended to represent values to which variables would  converge over time, say five to six years ahead, under the assumption of appropriate  monetary policy and in the absence of any further shocks  For real GDP growth,  your longer-term projections have a central tendency of 2½ to 2¾ percent and a range  of about 2 to 3 percent  For the unemployment rate, your longer-run projections have  a central tendency of 4¾ to 5 percent and a range of about 4½ to 5¾ percent  For  both variables, the central tendencies are very similar to those of the projections for  2010 that you made in October 2007, shown in the bottom panel, a point at which  many of you viewed the modal outlook for 2010 as being fairly close to the balanced  growth path of the economy  For PCE inflation, your longer-run projections have a  central tendency of about 1¾ percent and a range of 1½ to 2 percent  The range of  these projections is identical to the range of two-year-ahead inflation projections that  you made last October; the minutes from that meeting indicated that those projections  were influenced importantly by your judgments about the measured rates of inflation  consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of promoting price stability and  maximum employment        October 28–29, 2008 56 of 206    The request for the trial-run projections suggested that convergence might  typically occur over a period of five to six years  One of you noted that the  convergence process this time will likely occur over an even longer period because of  the severity of the economic crisis  However, apparently most of you thought that  convergence would occur sooner than that, suggesting that the configuration of this  trial run produces a good representation of FOMC participants’ views of the steady  state values of GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation     As usual, the staff will be preparing a summary of economic projections (SEP)   and will be circulating drafts to you over the next few weeks along with drafts of the  minutes  The published SEP, and hence the drafts, will not incorporate the longer- term projections from the trial run  The staff will provide to you separately a version  of the SEP that has been modified to incorporate the longer-term projections  generated by the trial run  The subcommittee will consult with the Chairman about  next steps  One possibility would be for the Committee to discuss experience with  the trial run at its December meeting and make a provisional decision at that time as  to whether to proceed in January with regular longer-term projections; a final decision  could be made in January  Thank you  That concludes our presentation      President Lacker, I would say that there are a number of strategies that   the Committee could think about if it were at the point that it felt it couldn’t lower the federal funds   rate any further, be that zero or some higher level  One would be communications that suggest to   market participants a willingness to hold short-term rates at very low levels for a very long period of   time  Of course, one could view the 2003 experience as implementing that strategy with the   “considerable period” language  But obviously the idea is to try to hold down the longer-term rates   that matter for spending to a larger degree than might be implied by market participants’ views that   you might instead begin to firm monetary policy sooner   There are a number of other possibilities  As you suggest, one would be simply to expand   the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet further—engage in a sort of quantitative easing  The   effectiveness of that could be debated  Another possibility that was discussed, at least in the period   in which the studies were done, would be to change the composition of the Federal Reserve’s   balance sheet  Of course, we’ve already done a lot of that with the various lending facilities, and so   the scope for additional expansion there would need to be thought through   October 28–29, 2008 58 of 206     That’s not how I would think about it  I would think about it as giving, if   it works, depository institutions increased incentives to expand their lending by providing them with   a great deal more funding than they actually need and thereby increasing spending propensities  I   would see this more as part of a package of various ways to stimulate spending by reducing real   interest rates but not as something that would feed through directly to inflation  Rather this would   more properly be viewed, at least in the way I think about things, as fighting deflation rather than   trying to cause a higher positive rate of inflation  7  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the version  of table 1 that was distributed to you on Monday  It is reproduced in the package  before you labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  Changes  in the language relative to the Bluebook version are shown in blue       Starting on the right-hand side of the table, even though members saw the   economic and financial information that became available over the intermeeting  period as worse than expected, they might be inclined to leave the stance of policy  unchanged at today’s meeting, as in alternative C  As noted yesterday, your                                                     7 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 7)   October 28–29, 2008 118 of 206    economic projections reveal that many of you anticipate that inflation pressures will  diminish less quickly than the staff anticipates, and several of you noted explicitly  that you thought less easing would be appropriate than was assumed in the  Greenbook forecast  Also, the Committee already reduced rates in early October,  responding to at least some of the adverse economic news  Moreover, the Federal  Reserve has put in place additional facilities to support credit intermediation, and the  Treasury and the FDIC are moving quickly with the implementation of other  programs that should, with time, help stabilize financial institutions and markets and  enhance the flow of credit to households and businesses  Finally, you might believe  that the Congress is likely to enact a second fiscal stimulus package, possibly  reducing the need for additional monetary policy accommodation       The rationale section of the statement suggested for alternative C would   acknowledge the intensification of financial turmoil and the weakening of the  economic outlook  However, it would also cite the range of policy actions taken in  recent weeks as factors that should help over time to improve credit conditions and  promote a return to moderate economic growth  The language on inflation would be  essentially identical to that used in the Committee’s statement earlier this month,  noting that the upside risks to inflation have been reduced  The risk assessment  would state explicitly that the Committee’s primary concern is the downside risks to  growth, suggesting a predilection for lowering rates  Nonetheless, with market  participants anticipating an easing today—a 50 basis point move is seen as most  likely—an announcement along the lines of alternative C would point to a much  higher trajectory for the federal funds rate over the next few months than investors  had expected  Short- and intermediate-term Treasury yields would likely jump, credit  spreads probably would increase further, and equity prices might decline sharply     If the Committee is of the view that further policy accommodation is appropriate   at this time but is also quite uncertain about the extent of rate reductions that will  ultimately be required, it might be attracted to the 25 basis point easing of alternative  B at this meeting  Members might have a less pessimistic outlook for the economy  than that presented as the baseline in the Greenbook or might at least be quite  uncertain as to the extent of the negative forces at work in the economy  At the same  time, you may view the incoming information as suggesting that the 50 basis point  easing earlier this month is unlikely to be sufficient to adequately balance the risks to  economic activity and inflation  Given these considerations, you might see modest  further easing today as appropriate and be prepared to cut rates again in coming  months should developments warrant       The statement proposed for alternative B would note that the pace of economic   activity appears to have slowed markedly, and it would repeat language from your  early October statement indicating that the financial market turmoil is likely to exert  additional restraint on spending  The announcement would also indicate that, in light  of the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities, the Committee expects  inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability  As  noted in a box in the Bluebook, we think that, in view of your previous policy   October 28–29, 2008 119 of 206    communications, outside analysts would interpret such a statement on the inflation  outlook as indicating that the Committee anticipates that overall inflation will drop to  around 1½ percent to 1¾ percent before long, a indication that would be consistent  with the central tendency of your inflation projections for 2009  The risk assessment  in alternative B, paragraph 4, would cite the same broad range of policy actions that  was proposed in alternative C, paragraph 2  It would indicate that the predominant  concern of the Committee is the downside risks to economic growth  Market  participants see a 25 basis point easing at this meeting as possible, but at this point  they seem to place significantly higher odds on a 50 basis point reduction  The  explicit citation of downside risks to growth would suggest that further easing could  be forthcoming after this meeting, but this announcement still would suggest a higher  path for the federal funds rate than they anticipate  Consequently, short- and  intermediate-term rates might tend to edge up after such an announcement, credit  spreads might widen somewhat further, and equity prices might decline     Under alternative A, the Committee would ease policy 50 basis points at this   meeting  An economic outlook along the lines of the Greenbook forecast would  provide one rationale for choosing this alternative  The Greenbook forecast for  aggregate demand has been slashed dramatically, importantly reflecting a sharp  decline in equity prices, a steep rise in credit risk premiums, and a considerable climb  in the foreign exchange value of the dollar  One metric for this revision is the  Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run equilibrium real interest rate, r*,  which has been cut nearly 3 percentage points since the September meeting to a level  of about minus 3 percent  That level is about 2 percentage points below the actual  real funds rate defined on a consistent basis  The staff outlook for a protracted period  of substantial economic slack, together with the recent plunge in energy prices, points  to a considerable diminution of inflation pressures, with overall inflation falling to  1½ percent next year in the Greenbook forecast—even with the Greenbook’s  assumption of 100 basis points of further easing by early next year  But even those  who are somewhat less pessimistic about the outlook than the Board staff might view  the modal outlook as having deteriorated enough, or the downside risks as having  increased enough, to warrant a 50 basis point rate cut today       The rationale language for alternative A in the revised version of table 1 is similar   to that for alternative B, but alternative A, paragraph 2, notes additional factors that  are restraining growth  The risk assessment, too, is similar to that for alternative B,  but it references the rate reduction that would be implemented today under this  alternative and notes that downside risks to growth remain, without saying that the  downside risks are the Committee’s predominant concern  An announcement along  these lines seems largely consistent with market participants’ expectations, and the  market reaction would likely be relatively small  Thank you, Mr Chairman       Thank you, Mr Chairman  As the Committee requested at your  last meeting, the staff has provided background for your discussion today of issues  related to the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates  Ten days ago, we sent you  21 notes covering lessons from the US and Japanese experiences in disinflationary  or deflationary environments; the possible costs to financial markets and institutions  of very low interest rates; the potential benefits of further rate reductions; and the  advantages and disadvantages of nonstandard approaches to providing  macroeconomic stimulus that could be employed when the federal funds rate cannot  be reduced further  Numerous staff members contributed to these notes—too many to  recognize individually right now  But I would nevertheless like to thank them  collectively for their intensive efforts on this project when many were already quite  busy with other important assignments  Steve Meyer will now summarize the key  conclusions from the staff work, and then I will review the suggested questions for  discussion that we sent to you last week  Steve    2  The staff provided eight questions to help frame your   discussion, and those questions are included in the package we have placed before  you—a single page with a blue cover sheet  I would like to comment briefly on each  of them     The first question deals with the issue of whether policy adjustments should be   accelerated when the zero bound looms, as the research literature indicates, or  whether the Committee should “keep its powder dry”—for example, if it believes that  the announcements of rate cuts have some special ability to buoy confidence  In  present circumstances, a key practical consideration is that the System’s liquidity  programs have already resulted in a very low effective federal funds rate  Absent a  very substantial unwinding of those facilities, the effective funds rate will remain  close to zero for the foreseeable future even if the Committee adopts a significantly  positive target for the federal funds rate  Still, the announcement of cuts in the target  rate probably would trigger further reductions in the prime rate and thus in rates paid  by a sizable fraction of debtors  Alternatively, the Committee might set a target rate  significantly above zero to convey its intentions for the stance of monetary policy  over a period longer than the intermeeting period     The second question concerns your views of the costs of very low interest rates    In the financial markets, very low short-term rates are likely to erode liquidity; fails  will increase, and the returns available on some short-term investments simply will  not overcome the transaction costs  The staff research concluded that certain  financial intermediaries, such as Treasury-only money market funds, will clearly be  adversely affected by very low interest rates, and those adverse effects could have  spillover effects into other markets, such as the repo market  But not all financial  institutions will be hurt by low rates; there will be winners and losers, depending  partly on their asset–liability mix  Moreover, our work suggested that financial  institutions in the aggregate tend to benefit from the macroeconomic stimulus of  monetary policy easing  Overall, judging the point at which the marginal costs of rate  reductions exceed the marginal benefits is quite difficult     The third question asks whether you see a net benefit from communicating your   intentions for inflation beyond the next few years or your views about the likely  stance of monetary policy over some period longer than the intermeeting period   Specifically, we suggested that you comment on the desirability of stating (1) that you  intend to hold the funds rate at very low levels until specified conditions prevail, (2)  that the Committee is concerned about the risks of excessive disinflation and will act  to mitigate that risk, or (3) that the Committee will be willing to temporarily accept  higher rates of inflation in the next few years in order to limit the economic downturn                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are attached to this transcript (appendix 2)   December 15–16, 2008 20 of 284    and encourage recovery  The draft statements presented in the “Policy Alternatives”  section of the Bluebook include language that you might consider if you decide to  pursue one or more of these possibilities       Questions 4 through 8 cover nonstandard policy tools  Question 4 asks your   views about the benefits of large open market operations in agency debt, agency  MBS, and Treasury securities  Such purchases are clearly within the authority of the  FOMC, and the staff research suggests that they have definite potential to stimulate  economic activity by lowering longer-term interest rates, although calibrating those  effects is difficult  However, members could be troubled by the fact that purchases of  agency debt and MBS could be regarded as steering funds to the GSEs and to  particular economic sectors  In your responses to this question, you may want to  comment on whether you are concerned by the credit-allocation aspects of such  purchases  You may also want to provide your views on the channels through which  purchases of Treasuries or agency securities would have a beneficial effect  In  particular, do you see the power of such tools as arising from their effects in reducing  long-term yields and spreads and supporting aggregate demand through those  channels?  Or would you emphasize the increase in excess reserves and the monetary  base that would accompany such purchases and the possible effects on bank lending?     Question 5 relates to liquidity facilities  As Steve noted, the creation of additional   lending facilities is another potentially powerful policy tool for the Federal Reserve— particularly in current circumstances, in which credit flows in some markets are  severely disrupted  Some of those facilities appear to have been successful in  supporting credit flows and thus economic activity  But even though further  additions or expansions could be helpful to credit intermediation, taking these steps  would involve a number of substantive issues  Also, the design, implementation, and  ongoing operation of such facilities pose real resource challenges to the System   Moreover, these programs raise governance issues  Because such programs generally  rely on the section 13(3) lending authority, authorization of these programs is the  responsibility of the Board, and the decision to lend is made by the Reserve Bank  At  the same time, these programs create reserves and thus potentially affect the FOMC’s  ability to influence the funds rate         Question 6 is open-ended  Do you see other nonstandard policy tools besides   open market purchases and liquidity facilities as likely to be particularly helpful in  current circumstances?  If so, what are those tools?     Question 7 returns to governance issues  Given that the Desk has begun to   purchase agency debt and MBS, how should the FOMC specify its directive to the  Desk?  If the Committee instructed the Desk to undertake purchases in order to attain  specific objectives for interest rate levels or rate spreads, serious practical issues  could arise  Longer-term yields are heavily affected by expectations of future policy  rates, which are in turn importantly driven by incoming economic news as well as by  various risk premiums  Experience indicates that our operations have an effect on  longer-term yields, but to have an effect that is economically significant, the   December 15–16, 2008 21 of 284    operations may need to be very large  Even then, given the substantial effects of the  other factors that affect yields, it might be very difficult or impossible to achieve  specified rate levels or spreads  As an alternative, the Committee could instruct the  Desk to purchase specific quantities of particular types of obligations  Such an  approach is clearly feasible, but its potential benefits may be harder to communicate  to the public except in qualitative terms  Another issue is whether the directive  should be conditional on market developments  The Bluebook provided drafts of  directives in which the basic approach is to specify quantities of purchases over  specified periods of time but with some allowance for qualitative judgments about  market conditions       Question 8 comes back to communication issues  If the Committee embarks on   the use of unconventional policy tools, clearly communicating the nature of the policy  and the intended objectives will be challenging  For example, once the Committee  has formally brought its target for the federal funds rate to around zero or otherwise  has signaled that further rate reductions will not be forthcoming, there will surely be  press stories asserting that the Committee has “run out of ammunition,” potentially  undermining the Committee’s message that monetary policy still can provide  considerable stimulus  Overcoming these communication challenges will be  somewhat easier if the Committee is able to agree on the substance of what it is trying  to accomplish and a broad approach to explaining it to the public  But achieving such  agreement is complicated by significant remaining uncertainties about the  effectiveness of the various unconventional policy tools, a very uncertain economic  outlook, and other factors  In your remarks, you may wish to provide your views of  the best practical means for the Committee to address these communication  challenges  Thank you  We would be happy to respond to your questions      I agree  4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  This  package includes the October policy statement, draft policy statements for this  meeting, and associated draft directives to the Desk  Alternatives A and B have been  revised somewhat relative to the versions that were distributed in the Bluebook, partly  reflecting yesterday’s discussion  In addition, as shown in bold in paragraph 1 of  alternative A, it seemed appropriate in current circumstances to incorporate a  sentence on financial conditions, as the Committee has done in its recent statements;  the same sentence has also been included in alternative B  We have presented a total  of four policy alternatives for your consideration  Given the unusual circumstances,                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   December 15–16, 2008 161 of 284    the statements associated with all four alternatives depart to some degree from the  statements that have typically been issued by the Committee in recent years     Alternative A represents the sharpest departure  Rather than starting with the   policy action, the statement would begin by describing the economic situation, noting  that the economic outlook has weakened further  It goes on to say that inflation  pressures have diminished quickly and that inflation could decline for a time below  the rates that best foster economic growth and price stability  Reflecting what seemed  to be a consensus yesterday, the sentence in brackets articulating a medium-term  inflation objective has been dropped  We have also bracketed the clause indicating  that inflation could drop for a time to very low levels, partly because some  Committee members might not yet be convinced that such an outcome is a serious  risk at this time and to avoid raising such concerns prematurely     The third paragraph would indicate that the Committee judges that it is not useful   to set a specific target for the funds rate  It would explain that judgment by noting  that, as a result of the large volume of reserves provided through liquidity programs,  the federal funds rate has already declined to very low levels  It would also note that  economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal  funds rate for some time, avoiding the use of the “near zero” phrase  The clause  “weak economic conditions are likely to warrant” implies some conditionality, but the  conditions under which rates would be raised are not spelled out       The fourth paragraph would set out a general plan for implementing   unconventional policy to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate  the economy  It reiterates that the Federal Reserve will be buying agency debt and  mortgage-backed securities and indicates that those purchases could be ramped up if  conditions warrant  It indicates further that the FOMC is evaluating the potential  benefits of buying longer-term Treasuries  It also indicates that the Federal Reserve  will be considering other ways of using its balance sheet to support credit markets and  economic activity  We suggested dropping the word “actively” to avoid a suggestion  that a new facility will be announced imminently     Over recent months, the discount rate has moved in lockstep with the target   federal funds rate, at a level ¼ percentage point above that rate, and very recently the  rates on required and excess reserves have been set essentially by formula equal to the  target federal funds rate  Because a target federal funds rate would not be established  under this alternative, those formulas could not be used  We have suggested that,  under this alternative, the Board act to lower the discount rate 75 basis points, to  ½ percent, and that the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances be  reduced to ¼ percent  The positive interest rates on reserves would maintain some  upward pressure, albeit perhaps modest, on the federal funds rate, consistent with a  view that there are some costs in terms of financial market performance of driving the  funds rate literally to zero  The discount rate of ½ percent would maintain a fairly  small penalty for borrowing at the window        December 15–16, 2008 162 of 284    In certain substantive respects, alternative B, the next page, is similar to  alternative A  Most important, federal funds would trade at about the same very low  rates as in alternative A, partly because the discount and reserves interest rates,  discussed in paragraph 5, would be set at the same levels as in alternative A  Also,  the wording of the rationale section of the statement—paragraphs 2 and 3—is  essentially identical to the corresponding paragraphs for alternative A  However,  alternative B differs from alternative A by explicitly setting a target range for the  federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent, as shown in paragraph 1  We have restructured  the introduction to the discussion of unconventional policy measures in paragraph 5  so that it is generally similar to the corresponding paragraph in alterative A  Also, the  final sentence of alternative A, paragraph 4, has been substituted as the last sentence  of alternative B, paragraph 5     Both alternatives A and B would put the Committee clearly in the realm of   unconventional policymaking going forward  The various policy interest rates would  be reduced to very low levels, several unconventional policy tools will already have  been implemented, and the statements would indicate clearly that further  unconventional tools could be deployed  The Committee might choose either of these  alternatives if members had an outlook similar to that of the Greenbook or if they  were especially concerned about the downside risks  Both alternatives would  constitute somewhat more vigorous policy action than market participants anticipate  for this meeting, and accordingly it is possible that financial markets would respond  favorably  On the other hand, there is some risk that confidence could be undermined  if the main message that comes through is that the Federal Reserve is out of  ammunition  As was noted yesterday, such alternatives place a premium on Fed  communications that convincingly indicate that the Federal Reserve can still provide  monetary stimulus     Under alternative C, on the next page, the Committee would reduce the federal   funds target rate 50 basis points today  The Committee might choose this option if it  agreed that further monetary stimulus is warranted by the evolving economic outlook  but was unsure that it would be necessary, or desirable, to reduce the target federal  funds rate to around zero  The rationale for the action presented in paragraphs 2 and  3 would be fairly similar to those of alternatives A and B  Paragraph 4 notes the  downside risks to the outlook and indicates that the Committee will use all available  tools to promote its dual objectives, suggesting that the Committee will consider  further reductions in the target federal funds rate and that further liquidity measures  could be forthcoming  You could fine-tune the message regarding the federal funds  rate by explicitly indicating that you are willing to or not willing to cut the funds rate  further  Under this alternative, we have assumed that the discount rate would be  lowered in line with the target federal funds rate to 75 basis points; the draft included  in the Bluebook erroneously indicated that the rate would be lowered to 50 basis  points  Because the FOMC would set a target rate under this alternative, we have  assumed that the reserves interest rates would continue to be set via the existing  formulas, so that those rates would move down to ½ percent absent further changes to  the target funds rate  As Bill noted yesterday, although these interest rates on   December 15–16, 2008 163 of 284    reserves would provide some upward pressure on the funds rate, that pressure is likely  to be more than offset by the large supply of reserves, and paragraph 7 notes that  federal funds are likely to trade below ½ percent  Although this approach provides a  straightforward expectation for the funds rate, it has an unappealing aspect in that the  Committee would be changing its target while simultaneously admitting that the  target will not be hit, implicitly raising the question of the meaning of the target   Nonetheless, this statement is likely consistent overall with market expectations, and  a pronounced market reaction one way or the other seems unlikely     Under alternative D, the Committee would keep the target federal funds rate at   1 percent  The rationale portion of the statement would acknowledge that the near- term outlook has deteriorated and that significant downside risks are present   However, the statement would note that the broad range of policy actions taken in  recent months should help, over time, to improve credit conditions and support a  return to moderate growth  The statement would recognize that the federal funds rate  would likely average significantly below the target for some time, but it would not  imply that a further reduction of the target rate is being contemplated  It thus  suggests that the Committee would seek to return the actual federal funds rate to  1 percent over time  Overall, this statement would surprise market participants  considerably, both in terms of the decision regarding the target funds rate and in  suggesting that further monetary policy stimulus, through conventional or  unconventional policy, is unlikely         The final two pages of the package provide draft directives to the Desk that   incorporate some changes relative to the versions that were included in the Bluebook   The directive for alternative A would provide some quantitative guidance for the  Desk’s open market operations while reserving some role for an assessment of  evolving market conditions, specifically the language that “the Committee directs the  Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS, with the aim of providing  support to the mortgage and housing markets  The timing and pace of these  purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a  broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing  sector  By the end of the second quarter of next year, the Desk is expected to  purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in  agency-guaranteed MBS”  The directive would not specify a target range for the  federal funds rate, while that for alternative B would  The directive for alternative A  would state explicitly that the Committee has suspended setting a target for the  federal funds rate and that it expects federal funds to trade at exceptionally low levels   The directive for B establishes the fed funds range of 0 to ¼ percent  In line with one  of the points raised yesterday, that the size and the composition of our entire balance  sheet affect the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, the final sentence of the  revised directives for alternatives A and B states an expectation that the SOMA  Manager and the Committee’s Secretary will keep the Committee informed of  ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the  attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and  price stability   December 15–16, 2008 164 of 284       The directive for alternative C, on the next page, is generally similar to that for   alternative B  But it would acknowledge that federal funds are likely to trade below  the ½ percent target rate set under this alternative  The directive for alternative D  would include a similar recognition but with a target federal funds rate of 1 percent   In addition, this alternative would not provide specific guidance on open market  purchases  Thank you, Mr Chairman      President Lacker, the forces that we were thinking would bring it   above ¼ were largely a risk premium—the difference between federal funds, which have some   amount of credit risk, and deposits at the Federal Reserve, which of course do not  I think we   would not anticipate that we would need to do anything very different from what we have been   doing—just continue to provide a very large amount of reserves, which is a byproduct of our   December 15–16, 2008 165 of 284    liquidity provisions  With the interest rate on balances set at ¼ percent, that configuration of   balances and rates would result in a federal funds rate somewhere in the range of 0 to ¼    Well, one reason might be that, if you gave some weight to the view   that very low interest rates do have costs in financial markets and you wanted to preserve some   rhetorical or substantive leeway, you would want to have a somewhat positive interest rate, to the   degree that you could achieve one, but still a low level     I do have that guideline here, and you are correct, President Lacker    The first paragraph of the guideline says that System open market operations in agency issues are   an integral part of open market operations, designed to influence bank reserves, money market   conditions, and monetary aggregates  The second paragraph says that open market operations in   those issues are not designed to support individual sectors of the market or to channel funds into   issues of particular agencies  As you remembered, in my briefing yesterday I did raise the   question as to Committee members’ views of the allocation of funds to particular firms or   December 15–16, 2008 166 of 284    sectors  It is possible that the Committee may want to modify, suspend, or repeal this guideline   at some point    I believe it is public    On the former, just a guess, I would think that without any target   federal funds rate—and given the well-known issues that we have been discussing about   pressures on banks—it is possible that the prime rate would not be reduced by the full extent of   the implicit reduction in the money market conditions that the FOMC would be targeting  But I   don’t really have a good sense as to what would happen quantitatively   December 15–16, 2008 167 of 284     Yes    “The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target   range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent  Since the Committee’s last meeting, labor market   conditions have deteriorated, and the available data indicate that consumer spending, business   investment, and industrial production have declined  Financial markets remain quite strained and   credit conditions tight  Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further   Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished appreciably  In light of the declines in   the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the   Committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters   The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of   sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability  In particular, the Committee   anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the   federal funds rate for some time   The focus of the Committee’s policy going forward will be to support the functioning of   financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures   that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high level  As previously   announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency   debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it   stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions   warrant  The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term   December 15–16, 2008 208 of 284    Treasuries securities  Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the term asset-  backed securities loan facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small   businesses  The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further   support credit markets and economic activity”    Mr Chairman    There is also the issue of the directive    The Board meeting, Mr Chairman   1  Thanks, Mr Chairman  You have made some of the points   that I was planning on making, so let me turn directly to the questions that the staff   circulated for discussion at this meeting  The first question is on the principal   benefits and costs of an explicit objective for inflation  One of the key issues in this   regard is the consistency of a numerical price objective with the Federal Reserve’s   dual mandate  Unlike some other central banks, the Federal Reserve is charged with   promoting maximum employment as well as price stability  Some FOMC members   have previously expressed concerns about this consistency  Thus, one of the   questions for your discussion is, Do you see any conflict with the dual mandate in   setting an inflation objective?    That question is posed in a somewhat abstract fashion, and your answer to it may   depend on how a numerical inflation objective would work in practice—a set of   issues that is teed up in question 2 In particular, how would the Committee’s   conduct of policy be affected by the quantification of its price objective?  For   example, would the specification of the price objective mean that the Committee   would put more weight than at present on deviations of inflation from its objective   and less weight on deviations of output and employment from their steady-state   values?  Or would you anticipate that a numerical price objective would be used   primarily as a device to make the Committee’s intentions clearer and, thus, to help   anchor inflation expectations so that the short-run conduct of policy would be little   affected?  A related question is the effect of a numerical price objective on the   Committee’s policy choices when it is concerned about the risks of financial   instability  For example, in circumstances in which inflation was projected to remain   near target but asset-price developments pointed to incipient financial instability,    1 The materials used by Mr Madigan are attached to this transcript (appendix 1)                            January 16, 2009 17 of 69  would the Federal Reserve be inappropriately constrained from using its monetary  policy tools to help address the emerging financial instability?  Or would you argue  that monetary policy tools should be used only in such cases to address the potential  effects of the financial instability on output or inflation and, thus, that there is no  conflict?   The third question goes further into the general framework for establishing an  inflation target In establishing an objective, do you think that the Federal Reserve  should set specific time frames for comparing realized inflation with its target?   Would it set timetables for the return of inflation to target following a deviation?   Question 4 raises the issue as to whether the Committee should establish an  inflation objective or an objective for a gradually increasing price level   Theoretically, a price-level objective has certain desirable properties  At a basic  level, a credible commitment to a price-level objective should ease households’ and  businesses’ long-term planning by eliminating the base drift that can occur under  inflation targeting Moreover, in potentially deflationary circumstances, it might be  helpful for the central bank to make clear that any undershoots of the desired price  path in the near future would be recouped down the road through above-average  inflation that would bring the level of prices back to the desired path  In principle,  building in this error correction would help keep medium-term inflation expectations  from falling excessively in response to inflation undershoots and thus would help  prevent inappropriate increases in real interest rates  However, a number of difficult  questions surround the possible establishment of a price-level target  Would the  public view such a target as credible?  Or would analysts be concerned that the Fed  might have difficulty meeting its price-level target or that it might eventually renege  on its commitment to permit higher rates of inflation in the future, if necessary to  offset temporarily low rates of inflation in the near term?  Indeed, you yourselves  might be uncomfortable with a policy that intentionally pursues relatively high rates  of inflation, even as an offset to previous undershoots  For example, you might be  concerned about the implications for economic and financial stability of those  temporarily higher rates of inflation partly because you might worry about your  ability to subsequently bring inflation back down to its optimal level   Questions 5, 6, and 7 focus on certain practical aspects of setting an inflation  target Should the objective be framed as a single number or a range?  What price  index should be used?  What inflation buffer, if any, is appropriate?  Has the current  episode of a very large negative demand shock led you to revise up your views of the  appropriate inflation buffer?  Alternatively, do you see the present downside risk to  output as sufficiently large as to warrant a temporarily higher objective for inflation?   The final question addresses the relationship of a quantitative inflation objective  to other aspects of the Committee’s communications  At the December meeting,  participants generally seemed to agree with the subcommittee’s recommendation to  collect and publish longer-term projections on a quarterly basis  The SEP (summary  of economic projections) questionnaire would ask each participate to “provide your                 January 16, 2009 18 of 69  best assessment of the rate to which each variable would converge over the longer  term (say, five to six years from now) in the absence of shocks and assuming  appropriate monetary policy” An important question for today’s discussion is how  such projections would relate to a medium-term inflation objective  There are at least  two possibilities In one view, the establishment of a medium-term inflation objective  would obviate longer-term projections In this view, longer-term projections are  useful solely because of the information they provide about the Committee’s inflation  objective Indeed, some participants may be concerned that publication of longer- term projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate could be interpreted  incorrectly as implying that the Committee has speed limits on growth and  employment  Under an alternative approach, the Committee would both establish a  numerical inflation objective and extend its current projections process to include  long-term projections for output growth, unemployment, and inflation  The  advantage of this approach is that it would allow the Committee to present, in its  summary of economic projections, a fully articulated picture of the economic outlook  and how the Committee’s conduct of policy was intended to be consistent with  closing any output and inflation gaps over time  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That  concludes my prepared remarks    Thank you The staff is recommending that the Board and the  FOMC act to extend the various liquidity facilities that are scheduled to expire on  April 30 The PDCF, the TSLF, the AMLF, the CPFF, the MMIFF, and the  temporary reciprocal foreign-currency arrangements are all currently scheduled to  expire at the end of April  As Trish noted, conditions in some financial markets have  improved somewhat in recent months, but those improvements have been limited   With the macroeconomic situation and the condition of financial institutions both  deteriorating significantly, the recent improvements would seem to be attributable not  to any strengthening of the fundamentals but rather to the range of actions taken by  the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the FDIC, the Congress, and foreign central banks  and governments to stabilize the financial system as well as to the passage of year- end As Spence has noted, even though the usage of some facilities has declined,  amounts outstanding under some programs, such as the CPFF, remain substantial   Moreover, the level of usage is by no means an adequate metric for assessing the  contributions of these programs to stabilizing markets  In many cases, market  participants continue to look to the facilities as important backstops for their funding   In these circumstances, it would seem premature to consider terminating any of the  existing liquidity facilities at this time   Although the facilities do not expire for three months, the staff believes that the  Board and the FOMC should act now to extend them  Absent an action to extend the  programs, market participants and analysts are likely to speculate increasingly about  the Federal Reserve’s intentions for the facilities, which probably would add  unhelpfully to market jitters  Also, lenders may increasingly become concerned that  borrowers will not have access to backup funding facilities to repay currently  extended loans when those credits mature in a few weeks and hence could become  more chary about lending now   The staff recommends that the Board and the FOMC extend the expiring facilities  through October 30 This six-month extension from April 30 should be sufficient for  now to assure market participants that the lending programs will be available for the  period of time relevant for money market transactions  A case could be made for an  even longer extension to take the programs over year-end—say through January 30,  2010—but you may be concerned that such a very long extension could signal a view  that the financial crisis will be quite protracted  Also, for the programs that depend  on the Board’s section 13(3) authority, the requirement to find that unusual and  exigent circumstances are present may be interpreted as making it difficult to extend  these programs for a full year from now  If you do extend the facilities through  October, as recommended, you may wish to plan informally on revisiting the  expiration dates of these programs around the time of your June or August meeting so  that you will be able to provide advance notice to market participants about whether  or not the programs will be extended beyond October   Some of the Federal Reserve’s special programs—for example, the TAF—do not  have a set expiration date and hence do not need to be extended  Also, the TALF is  not set to expire until year-end  Thus, under the staff proposal to extend the other                          January 27–28, 2009 23 of 267  expiring facilities through October 30, the TALF would not need to be extended at  this time   If the Board and the FOMC act at this meeting to extend the programs, the staff  anticipates that the extensions would be announced to the public on Thursday at  1000 am  Because the swap lines are among the items proposed for extension, part  of the press release would be joint with our foreign central bank counterparties  Draft  resolutions for consideration by the Board and the FOMC were included in the staff  memo on this matter  Trish will now continue our presentation   The TALF—December 31     Yes, and for the other ones that have a maturity date, the extension   would be through October 30   I think that general principle is right  In fact, in the open market area   we have wound down one program—the long-term RPs  But right now I think that simply   extending the facilities does not mean that they will necessarily be in place for the entire period   of time  The FOMC and the Board could evaluate, as time goes on, whether these programs are   needed I do think that closing down any of these programs at this time does run the risk of   sending a signal that you think you are pretty far along in this process and you are going to start   closing things down relatively quickly  So I think it carries a risk  3  I will be referring to the separate package labeled “Material  for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Exhibit 1 depicts the  central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2009 to 2011 and over the  longer run, following the integrated approach to the inclusion of longer-run  projections that was recommended by the Subcommittee on Communications and  discussed at the December FOMC meeting The likely severity of the current  recession is clearly evident in this exhibit  Nearly all of you expect real GDP to  shrink this year, the unemployment rate to climb to at least 8½ percent by the fourth  quarter, and total PCE inflation to be less than 1 percent on a fourth-quarter over  fourth-quarter basis This figure also highlights your expectations that a period of  three years is likely to be insufficient for the economy to return to a balanced-growth  path following the current economic shock  Indeed, although the benchmark horizon  for the longer-run projections was specified as about five to six years, several of you  noted that the convergence process might well take even longer than that   Exhibit 2 tabulates the central tendencies and ranges of your latest projections;  corresponding information about the Committee’s previous projections—those from  last October—is indicated in italics, and Greenbook projections are included as a  memo item  As shown in the left column of the top panel, your forecasts for real  GDP growth in 2009 have a central tendency of minus 1¼ to minus ½ percent, as  most of you expect output to contract further during the first half of this year—at an  annual rate of about 3 to 4 percent—before resuming positive growth, albeit at a low  rate, during the second half Moreover, you generally anticipate a relatively sluggish  recovery that reflects the gradual waning of financial stresses, continued weakness in  the housing sector, and poor growth prospects abroad  As a result, most of you see                         January 27–28, 2009 96 of 267  GDP growth as only gradually reaching a faster pace that eventually brings the  economy back to its balanced-growth path  Nearly all of you estimate that real GDP  will grow over the longer run (the right-hand column) at an annual rate of 2½ to  2¾ percent The central tendency of these longer-run growth projections is the same  as for the trial run that was conducted last October   As shown in the second panel, your forecasts of the unemployment rate in the  fourth quarter of 2009 fall in a range of 8 to 9¼ percent, more than a percentage point  higher than for the projections that you made last October  In explaining these  revisions to your near-term outlook, many of you pointed to the weakness of  incoming data on consumer spending and labor market conditions and to the rapid  slowdown in global economic activity  Your unemployment projections further  ahead also underscore the anticipated slow pace of recovery  Most of you expect  that, even in 2011, the unemployment rate will be about 6¾ to 7½ percent, well above  your estimates of about 4¾ to 5 percent for the unemployment rate that will prevail  over the longer run in the absence of further shocks  Your longer-run projections for  the unemployment rate have the same central tendency as in October   Your forecasts for inflation in 2009 have also shifted markedly since last October   Your forecasts for overall PCE inflation in 2009 (the first column of the third panel)  now have a central tendency of 03 to 1 percent, a full percentage point lower than the  central tendency of your October projections; and most of you now expect a core PCE  inflation rate of about 1 percent this year (the first column of the bottom panel),  compared with the central tendency of 1½ to 2 percent for your October projections   Looking further ahead, the width of the central tendencies and ranges of your  inflation projections has increased considerably  For example, the range of your  overall PCE inflation projections for 2011 spans an interval of nearly 2 percentage  points—about twice as wide as the range of your projections last October  From your  accompanying narratives, it is evident that these differences reflect the diversity of  your views about the pace of economic recovery, the sensitivity of inflation to  economic activity, the prevalence of downward nominal wage rigidity, and the degree  to which you see longer-run inflation expectations as likely to remain firmly anchored  over the next several years  Many of you anticipate that inflation in 2011 will still be  well below your individual assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate—that  is, the longer-run rate of inflation that each of you sees as most consistent with the  Federal Reserve’s dual mandate for promoting price stability and maximum  employment  Your assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate have a  central tendency of about 1¾ to 2 percent and a range of 1½ to 2 percent  This  central tendency is noticeably higher than in October; at that time, your assessments  were tightly clustered around a value of 1¾ percent, whereas 2 percent is now the  median and the mode of the distribution   In your forecast submissions, many of you indicated that your views regarding the  appropriate path of monetary policy are roughly similar to those of the Greenbook,  which assumes that the federal funds rate will remain close to the zero bound through                                  January 27–28, 2009 97 of 267  late 2012 However, a number of you noted that policy tightening would commence   somewhat sooner than that, and a couple of you expressed the view that the federal   funds rate will need to be raised substantially above current levels during the second   half of this year    Exhibit 3 presents your views on the risks and uncertainties in the outlook  As   shown in the top left-hand panel, all of you see uncertainty about growth as elevated   relative to historical norms; and as shown to the right, most of you continue to   perceive the risks to growth as weighted to the downside, even with the downward   revision in your modal projections  In the accompanying narratives, many of you   emphasized the uncertainties in gauging the evolution and implications of the global   financial turmoil, the effects of nontraditional monetary policy tools, and the size and   effect of the fiscal stimulus package    As shown in the bottom left-hand panel, nearly all of you see an elevated degree   of uncertainty about the inflation outlook As shown to the right, a majority view the   risks to that outlook as roughly balanced, whereas the rest of you see the risks as   tilted to the downside Some of you noted that the degree of uncertainty about the   inflation outlook reflects uncertainty about the evolution of resource slack and the   path of commodity prices, which are highly sensitive to global economic conditions   Others mentioned that the risks to the inflation outlook could eventually become tilted   to the upside if stimulative policy measures are not unwound in a timely fashion once   the economy begins to recover    As you know, your agenda reserves time for a decision tomorrow as to whether to   proceed with regular publication of longer-run projections  You may wish to indicate   your general views on that issue in the economic go-round As usual, the staff will be   preparing a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and will be circulating drafts to   you over the next few weeks along with drafts of the minutes  Should you decide to   proceed with longer-term projections, these projections from this cycle would be   included in the SEP to be released along with the minutes of this meeting in mid-  February Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, it could be that the Committee’s views have changed in the last   several months   Exactly   And one plausible reason for that is that the Committee is now   experiencing the actuality of a very large negative demand shock and maybe it now believes that   it needs a larger inflation buffer than it previously thought would be best  4  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for FOMC  Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  This package includes the revised  versions of the draft statements that were distributed on Monday  By lowering the  target federal funds rate essentially to zero at its last meeting, the Committee entered  the realm of unconventional monetary policy  Given our limited experience operating  in this regime, I thought it might be helpful to begin my remarks by reviewing the  various tools you might employ if you decide that further monetary policy stimulus is  appropriate   First, the Committee can communicate its intentions in ways designed to   influence the expectations of private-sector decisionmakers  For example, as   President Plosser noted, the Committee could provide additional information to the   market about its expectation for the path of the federal funds rate  In its December   statement, the Committee offered some information about its intentions by indicating   that it “anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally   low levels of the federal funds rate for some time”  The Committee’s action to lower   the federal funds rate target nearly to zero was greater than market participants   generally expected, and its message about short-term rates remaining low for some   time further conditioned expectations  Interest rates moved noticeably lower across   the entire yield curve, indicating that the combination of the action and the statement   provided additional monetary stimulus    The Committee could be more specific about the future path of the funds rate—   for example, by being more explicit about how long the target rate is likely to remain   close to zero or even by providing your expectations to the market for the trajectory   of rates after liftoff For example, just as you provide ranges and central tendencies   for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, you could likewise do for                    January 27–28, 2009 168 of 267  the fed funds rate However, given the enormous uncertainties about the financial  and economic outlook, you might be uncomfortable providing such specificity, and  you may be concerned about the implications for the Federal Reserve’s credibility if  those expectations proved to be far off the mark  Varying your qualitative  descriptions of the path of the funds rate in light of incoming data is another  possibility At some point you might also wish to consider articulating the conditions  that would prompt you to begin raising rates  At a minimum, though, as the  Chairman noted, the Committee could continue to reiterate that interest rates are  likely to remain low for some time  Unless the evolving economic outlook  strengthens considerably relative to your economic forecasts, delivering this message  continuously seems likely to be an essential component of the Committee’s  communications for a while The Committee could also communicate its views  regarding other policy tools For example, it could be explicit about the amounts of  open market purchases that it intends to undertake, the types of securities it intends to  buy, and the time frame for those purchases  The Committee’s December statement  followed this principle regarding mortgage-backed securities and agency debt   The Committee could also expand its communications about inflation  For  example, the Committee could make clear that any near-term declines in inflation  below its optimal level will be strongly resisted in the medium to long term  With  nominal short-term rates now pinned at zero, measures that support inflation  expectations may reduce the upward pressure on real interest rates that develops as  actual inflation declines, thus limiting the extent of restraint on aggregate demand that  emanates from that source  In this regard, you have several communication  approaches at your disposal For example, as discussed earlier this month, the  Committee could establish and publish a numerical longer-term inflation objective   Or the Committee could decide to proceed with collecting and publishing  participants’ longer-term projections for inflation, growth, and unemployment—an  approach that most of you evidently support  Of course, you could implement both  approaches, with the longer-term projections explaining how you envision that  inflation will approach your longer-run objective over time and how growth and  unemployment will converge toward their steady-state values  A decision on the  longer-term projections is included later in the agenda for today’s meeting  A third  possibility is that the Committee could use its statement to make clear that it  recognizes the risk that inflation could fall persistently below its optimal level  By  explicitly identifying that possibility, the Committee would suggest that it is prepared  to take actions to counteract such an outcome   The ability to further expand the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to apply  additional economic stimulus—or at least to offset some of the restraint coming from  developments in financial markets—offers another set of unconventional policy tools   In particular, the Federal Reserve can expand its use of what the Chairman has called  “credit policies” by implementing programs designed to facilitate flows of credit to  borrowers who normally obtain funds through markets that have become  dysfunctional To an important degree, the opportunities for exercising these tools  will be driven by ongoing market developments  Apart from expansions of existing                      January 27–28, 2009 169 of 267  facilities, either in terms of amounts or in terms of coverage, it is difficult to predict  exactly how such credit policies might be augmented—or even whether it would be  desirable to create new facilities—without advance knowledge of where market  conditions might deteriorate next  However, as discussed yesterday and today, the  Federal Reserve has already indicated the possibility of expanding the TALF to  include commercial-mortgage-backed securities  In assessing whether expansion of  such facilities is warranted, the Federal Reserve will need to take careful account not  only of the possible efficacy of the programs but also of a range of other  considerations, including moral hazard and the implications for the System’s exit  strategy in returning to a normal framework for conducting monetary policy    Other aspects of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, such as the reciprocal swap  arrangements and the System’s portfolio of Treasury and agency securities, offer a  third set of opportunities for providing greater stimulus  At the moment, there would  not seem to be much motivation for increasing the authorized amounts of swap lines,  as conditions in global interbank funding markets have generally improved somewhat  over recent months However, expanding the System’s purchases of agency debt and  mortgage-backed securities might represent a more compelling possibility for  applying further monetary stimulus  Purchases of longer-term Treasury securities are  another possibility The System’s MBS purchases have already had a notable effect  in lowering mortgage rates, and the Committee might see further action in this  direction as likely to be productive As discussed by the Committee yesterday,  purchases of Treasury securities might help improve conditions in private credit  markets, but engaging in such purchases would also have some disadvantages     Alternative A for this meeting, the draft statement for which is shown on the next  page of the exhibits, would exercise several of the options for applying more  stimulus  The decision to apply additional stimulus under this alternative would be  explained by the indication in the first sentence of paragraph 2 that the economy has  weakened somewhat more than anticipated  It would also be supported by the  statement in the last sentence of the paragraph that the downside risks to the outlook  are “significant”—an adjective that, as President Fisher noted, might be seen as less  alarming than “sizable” while still getting the point across  Paragraph 3 would  indicate that the Committee expects inflation pressures to remain subdued, and it  would reveal a concern that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best  foster economic growth and price stability in the longer run  As I noted previously,  identifying this risk explicitly could help reduce the extent to which market  participants lower their assessment of the FOMC’s inflation expectations in response  to near-term declines in inflation  Paragraph 4 reiterates the point made in December  that the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of  sustainable economic growth and again notes that these measures are likely to keep  the size of the balance sheet at a high level   The next two paragraphs provide language to explain the choice of an expanded  program of purchasing mortgage-backed securities or a new program to purchase  Treasury securities Alternative 1 would increase the planned purchases of MBS to                      January 27–28, 2009 170 of 267  $750 billion; the current pace of purchases would be maintained, and the additional  amounts would be purchased in the third quarter  Market participants have already  expressed some concern about what happens when the currently authorized program  concludes at midyear, and an announcement of additional purchases of MBS seems  likely to at least maintain, if not increase, the downward pressure on mortgage rates   Alternative 2 would entail the purchase of up to $250 billion in Treasury securities  this year The final paragraph of the statement for alternative A notes that the Federal  Reserve will soon implement the TALF  It also indicates that the Committee will be  monitoring the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and assessing whether expansion of  or modifications to the lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets  and economic activity and help to preserve price stability  All in all, alternative A  would be most consistent with a view that the economic outlook is unsatisfactory, that  the Committee has several tools that it can employ to improve that outlook, and that  the benefits entailed in using these tools outweigh the costs   Alternative B, shown on the next page, would also express the view that the  federal funds rate is likely to remain low for some time, but it differs in some notable  respects from alternative A  The first sentence in the second paragraph cites evidence  that the outlook remains weak but does not state that the economy has deteriorated  further  However, like alternative A, it notes that the downside risks to the outlook  are significant The inflation paragraph also points to subdued inflation pressures, but  it omits any indication of concern about the downside risks to inflation  The final  paragraph notes that the FOMC stands ready to expand the quantity of its MBS  purchases and the duration of the program as conditions warrant; this indication  would also help address market concerns about the end of the program at midyear   The draft indicates that the Committee is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury  securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be  particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets  This wording  is intended, first, to indicate that the Committee has reached a decision—it is not still  “evaluating” possible purchases; second, to suggest that the Committee does not see  such purchases as the most beneficial action the Federal Reserve can take in current  circumstances; and third, to note that conditions could change in a way that would  prompt the Committee to initiate purchases   Overall, alternative B does not entail additional action at this meeting  The  Committee would indicate a possible expansion of its MBS program without taking  such action now But the statement would suggest that the FOMC is unlikely to  purchase Treasury securities, at least absent a significant change in circumstances   With market participants evidently building in significant odds of Fed purchases, it  seems likely that such a statement could spur a noticeable backup in longer-term  Treasury yields—perhaps as much as 20 basis points or so  The Committee might be  inclined toward alternative B if it sees the economic outlook as not having  deteriorated materially since the last meeting  It might be encouraged by the tentative  signs of improvement in some financial markets and believe that further  improvements are possible as the TALF comes on line  It also might think that the  passage of a large fiscal stimulus package is likely and that further significant                   January 27–28, 2009 171 of 267  legislation to provide support to financial markets and institutions could be   forthcoming from the Congress  In these circumstances, and with the Federal   Reserve already having applied considerable monetary and financial stimulus, the   Committee might think it most reasonable at this time to monitor the effects of the   actions taken to date, assess the likely effects of further policy actions, and be   prepared to implement additional measures such as expanded purchases of mortgage-  backed securities, if needed    Alternative C, shown on the next page of the handout, also would express the   view that the federal funds rate is likely to remain low for some time  It would note   that the Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and   mortgage-backed securities and would note the imminent implementation of the   TALF However, this alternative would be silent on further Federal Reserve actions   to support credit markets and stimulate the economy  With no mention at all of   possible purchases of Treasury securities, market participants would likely conclude   that the Federal Reserve had dropped the idea, and Treasury note and bond yields   could jump appreciably  More generally, analysts would infer that the Federal   Reserve was unlikely to take further stimulative policy actions  Alternative C is most   consistent with a view that considerable monetary and financial stimulus has already   been applied and that the potential costs of further stimulative actions by the Federal   Reserve outweigh the potential benefits    The statement released after the December meeting is included as the last page for   your reference Thank you, Mr Chairman    Right              January 27–28, 2009 177 of 267  Another possibility might be just to say “soon”        January 27–28, 2009 202 of 267  I read this as saying that we don’t know how the circumstances will   evolve, but if they evolve in the way that indicates that this would be particularly helpful, then   we are prepared to purchase    As Spence Hilton noted, it could be very useful to have an  additional tool for draining substantial volumes of reserves from the banking system  and shrinking the monetary base  Either the issuance of Fed bills or an enhanced  supplementary financing program run by the Treasury on behalf of the Federal  Reserve could be particularly helpful The staff has drafted legislative language that  would authorize these tools  Because the Treasury would have a substantial interest  in such programs, and because we would need the Treasury’s support in advancing  such legislation, we have been discussing this subject with the Treasury  Our  presumption is that we would not seek legislation both for Fed bills and for an  enhanced SFP  Rather, we and the Treasury together would raise both possibilities  with the relevant congressional committees to discuss the substance and the political  prospects for each On the basis of those discussions, one approach or the other  would be advanced   To give adequate assurance to the Federal Reserve and to the markets that these  tools will provide the capability to tighten monetary policy as necessary and when  necessary, the tools would have to be effectively under the Federal Reserve’s control   Two possible constraints are of particular concern  the public debt ceiling, and  possible interference by a future Treasury To ensure that a binding debt ceiling does  not disrupt the conduct of monetary policy, Fed bills or Treasury bills issued under an  enhanced SFP program would have to be excluded from the debt ceiling  And to  ensure that a future Treasury could not block the implementation of appropriate  monetary policy, the Federal Reserve either will need to be able to issue its own  obligations as it sees fit to carry out its statutory mandate, or it will need to be able to  direct the Treasury to do so as its proxy    However, the Congress may see the exclusion of Fed bills or SFP obligations  from the debt ceiling as an unwarranted dilution of the congressional responsibility to  appropriate government monies and to authorize the issuance of federal debt  And we  recognize that the Treasury is concerned about the potential for issuance of such  securities to interfere with the Treasury’s responsibility for managing the public debt     Draft legislation prepared by the staff would assign the primary responsibility  within the Federal Reserve for the issuance of Fed bills or SFP bills to the Federal  Open Market Committee  This seems appropriate because the main purpose of the  tool, as we see it, is to ensure the capability of the FOMC to tighten monetary policy  when appropriate We see Fed bills as a tool on the liabilities side of the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet that would essentially be symmetric with our asset-side open  market operations   The legislation should also address several other key issues  In that regard, we  have included the following specific elements in the draft legislation we sent to the  Treasury    First, Fed bills would be full faith and credit obligations of the United States in  order to maximize their acceptability to investors, to make them as close                                                        March 17–18, 2009 21 of 266     substitutes as possible for Treasury securities, and to minimize the interest  expense of such obligations    Second, for similar reasons, Fed bills should not be subject to state and local  income taxes    Third, the Treasury has suggested a statutory maximum maturity of Fed bills in  order to limit interference with Treasury debt management  We have  recommended a maximum maturity of one year  Treasury staff members prefer  a shorter maximum term    Finally, we have recommended that the Fed not be required to notify the  Treasury a fixed number of days before issuing Fed bills or scheduling issuance  of SFP bills, but rather that the legislation indicate qualitatively that issuance of  Fed bills or SFP bills should minimize interference with the conduct of the  Treasury’s regular debt management responsibilities   As President Plosser and others have noted, there are pros and cons to the Fed  bills and expanded SFP proposals  And even with the support of the Administration,  the political prospects for such legislation are not clear at this stage It is possible that  the Federal Reserve may need to accept some changes to the draft legislation to  obtain passage One possible change that might help make the program acceptable to  all interested parties would be a sunset provision under which the authority to issue  such obligations expires after, say, five years   President Pianalto, the reason for doing this is because those markets,   like the other ABS markets are not functioning  5  As indicated by the Greenbook and by your discussion this  morning, the economic outlook has deteriorated markedly over the intermeeting  period At the same time, the options for applying additional stimulus quickly appear  limited  It now seems likely that the TALF will lift off only slowly  And prospects  for the enactment of additional fiscal stimulus, at least in the near term, appear dim  In these circumstances, consideration of further monetary stimulus through large- scale asset purchases would seem to be warranted  The Bluebook presented two  policy alternatives, A and B, that involved additional asset purchases and one,  alternative C, that would not involve further stimulative measures  I will focus my  remarks this morning on alternatives A and B  This morning, we have proposed  revisions to the draft statements; the revised statements are provided in the package  that was distributed to you earlier labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary  Policy Alternatives”   I will begin with alternative A, on page 2  Under this alternative, the rationale  section—paragraphs 1 and 2—would note that the economy is undergoing a severe  contraction and that the near-term economic outlook has worsened  It would point to  a number of indicators of the economic weakness  Paragraph 1 would end on a note  of some optimism by stating that the policy actions taken to stabilize financial  markets and institutions, together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute  to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth  Paragraph 2 would note the  Committee’s expectation that inflation will remain subdued, dropping the phrase “in  coming quarters” that was used in the January statement, consistent with a view that  inflation could be low for some time  Indeed, it would again cite “some risk that  inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and  price stability in the longer term”  As President Fisher noted, the rationale section  provides a rather downbeat reading on the economy, but perhaps one that is realistic   In the policy paragraph, alternative A would again indicate the Committee’s  intention to employ all available tools  It says that the Committee will hold the  federal funds rate range at 0 to ¼ percent and indicates an expectation that economic  conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate “for  an extended period” This phrase would suggest a longer interval than the phrase “for                           March 17–18, 2009 170 of 266  some time” used in January and suggested for alternative B  To provide additional  economic stimulus, the Committee would take three policy actions under alternative  A increasing the amount of its agency MBS purchases by $500 billion to a total of  $1 trillion this year; increasing the amount of its purchases of agency debt securities  by $100 billion to a total of $200 billion this year (the boost to agency debt purchases  is an addition relative to the alternative presented in the Bluebook); and initiating  purchases of longer-term Treasury securities that are to total $300 billion over the  next six months   This paragraph would also note that the TALF has been launched  The statement  would conclude by indicating that the Committee will be carefully monitoring the  System’s balance sheet and by suggesting some predilection toward stepping up its  balance sheet expansion by noting that “it will be assessing whether a faster pace of  asset purchases would be helpful in improving credit market conditions and  supporting economic activity”  A possible downside of including such language is  that it suggests a possible course of action that the Committee may end up not  pursuing   Alternative B, on the next page, begins with a rationale section, paragraphs 1 and  2, that is identical to that proposed for alternative A  However, under alternative B,  the Committee would not initiate purchases of Treasury securities  Rather, it would  more than double its purchases of agency MBS securities, to a total of $125 trillion  this year, and double its purchases of agency debt securities to $200 billion  This  alternative would not include anything comparable with the final clause of alternative  A indicating that the Committee was inclined to further step up its asset purchases   In summary, alternative A would constitute a somewhat more aggressive  expansion of the FOMC’s asset purchases than alternative B  The differences in  terms of total asset purchases are small  Alternative A would commit to an expansion  of your asset purchases by a total of $900 billion, whereas the increase under  alternative B would be just slightly less, at $850 billion  However, as I noted, the  language of alternative A would be more forward-leaning with respect to possible  future increases in asset purchases  And the initiation of Treasury purchases might  suggest to market participants that the Committee’s operations could be expanded  particularly in that direction in the future   The key difference between alternative A and alternative B really is whether or  not to purchase Treasury securities  To review the arguments for and against such  purchases, you might be inclined to proceed with purchases of longer-term Treasury  securities if you believe that the economic situation had deteriorated so substantially  that you did want to apply “all available tools” as indicated in your previous  statement; feel that it might be helpful to diversify the tools that you are applying to  the situation; believe that purchasing Treasury securities rather than private securities  is preferable to minimize the Federal Reserve’s involvement in credit allocation; or  think it might be easier to unwind in the future holdings of Treasury securities than                                 March 17–18, 2009 171 of 266  holdings of private securities such as MBS, which might be less liquid or might be  seen in the future as tied particularly to primary mortgage market conditions   On the other hand, you might be inclined not to purchase longer-term Treasury  securities if you think that purchases of private securities such as MBS would more  effectively improve conditions in private credit markets and thus provide better  support to private spending; or you are concerned that market participants might  believe that you are monetizing the federal debt, a perception that might lead to  adverse effects on term premiums or, perhaps, on inflation expectations   Under alternative C, page 4, the Committee would make no adjustment to the  policy tools that it is already implementing, and it would not reference any  modification to the Federal Reserve’s liquidity programs other than those that have  been previously announced  Instead, the statement would indicate that the Committee  decided to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and  indicate that it continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant  exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time  The second  paragraph would note that the near-term economic outlook is poor but indicate that  the Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin  later this year, subject to significant downside risks  The final paragraph of the  announcement would note the range of policy actions that are already in train   The Bluebook also presented an alternative structure for the FOMC statement,  based on a suggestion provided by President Bullard  Applying that structure to  alternative A, and incorporating this morning’s suggested revisions to the policy  actions, is shown on page 5 as alternative A′ A′ is substantively the same as A, but it  reorders the statement such that the Committee’s actions are presented first  In  particular, the first sentence of the statement indicates that “The Federal Open Market  Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  further by purchasing $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six  months and by acquiring an additional $500 billion of agency MBS and $100 billion  of agency debt securities this year” Obviously, this approach gives greater  prominence not only to the actions themselves but also to their effect on the  Committee’s balance sheet  Conversely, this approach gives less prominence to the  very downbeat summary of the economic situation in paragraphs 2 and 3, a possible  advantage of this approach However, the flow of the statement may be seen as a bit  less logical, in that it presents the Committee’s actions before discussing the  economic conditions that motivated them   Alternatives B′ and C′, pages 6 and 7, apply the same structure to alternatives B  and C   The final three sections of the package provide draft directives for the three basic  alternatives and their primed variants   You’re asking about how the markets would interpret this?   Judging by the simulations that were presented in the Bluebook, I   would say that this alternative A is roughly comparable to the green dash-dotted line on page 32,   if you happen to have that in front of you  It’s roughly the same size, with a slightly different   composition  So the effects on interest rates might be similar  Of course, that would not get the   Committee, on this analysis, to something comparable to the unconstrained policy   No, that’s not intentional  Thank you We should correct it   I think we consider it to be roughly the same  Our ability to   discriminate between effects on one market or another is pretty limited  There’s lots of   uncertainty around these estimates   That’s correct   I have a possible sentence, Mr Chairman  “The timing of these   purchases will be determined, in part, by conditions in primary and secondary mortgage   markets”   Part of the issue, Mr Chairman, is that we don’t know exactly when   the bulge in issuance is going to happen           March 17–18, 2009 218 of 266  Yes, I believe so   I think that may be actually difficult to work in here quickly in some   cases just as a grammatical issue   I can try [Laughter] From the top, “Information received since the   Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the economy continues to   contract”   So the third paragraph “In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve   will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability  The   Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and   anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal           March 17–18, 2009 220 of 266  funds rate for an extended period To provide greater support to mortgage lending and the   housing markets, the Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve’s   balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed   securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $125 trillion this year, and to   increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion to a total of up to $200   billion Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided   to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months”  Then   there is the TALF sentence  Then, “The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size   and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of evolving financial and   economic developments”   4  I will be referring to the separate package labeled “Material  for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Exhibit 1 tabulates the  central tendencies and ranges of your latest projections  Corresponding information  about your January projections is indicated in italics, and April Greenbook  projections are included as memo items  As shown in the top left portion of the table,  your forecasts for real GDP growth in 2009 have a central tendency of minus 2 to  minus 1¼ percent  That is a downward shift of about ¾ percentage point from               April 28–29, 2009 34 of 201  January, reflecting markdowns to your forecasts for both the first and the second  halves of this year Most of you now anticipate that output will contract at an annual  rate of 3½ to 4 percent during the first half of this year  Almost all of you see  positive growth during the second half, albeit generally at a low rate, reflecting slow  and uneven improvement in financial conditions, some stabilization in the housing  sector, and stimulative monetary and fiscal policies  Consistent with the downward  revision to near-term GDP growth, each of you revised up your projection of the  unemployment rate for late this year; the central tendency of your forecasts for  unemployment in the fourth quarter of 2009 is now 92 to 96 percent, an upward shift  of about ¾ percentage point from your January projections   Looking further ahead, all of you project a pickup in economic growth in 2010, as  financial conditions continue to normalize, and robust growth in 2011  Consequently,  you expect that the unemployment rate will be trending down during those years  But  each of you indicates that the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 is  likely to be well above your estimate of the long-run equilibrium unemployment rate   As shown in the exhibit, the central tendency of your projections for unemployment  in late 2011 is 7¾ to 8½ percent, whereas the central tendency for the longer-run  equilibrium unemployment rate, just to the right of the dotted line, is 4¾ to  5¼ percent   Turning to inflation, shown in the lower half of the table, all of you see slower  headline and core inflation this year than in recent years; the central tendency of your  projections for headline PCE inflation in 2009 is 06 to 09 percent  About three- quarters of you project that inflation will remain at or below your view of “mandate  consistent” inflation through 2011 But reflecting the diversity of models of inflation  dynamics in use among economists and central bankers, some of you see inflation  slowing through 2011 in response to a persistently high degree of economic slack,  whereas several of you see inflation rising above your estimate of “mandate  consistent” inflation in 2011 or even in 2010 as inflation expectations respond to  rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  The central tendency of your  projections for headline inflation in 2011 is 10 to 19 percent; the range, at 05 to  25 percent, is much wider   Your views on the outlook for this year and next are broadly similar to the staff’s  view Greenbook projections for real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation for  2009 and 2010 are all within the central tendencies of your projections  That  similarity breaks down in 2011  About two-thirds of you predict both higher  unemployment and noticeably higher inflation in that year than does the Greenbook   Indeed, several of you noted explicitly that you do not share the staff’s view of  inflation dynamics  That divergence in views may help explain why about half of  you anticipate that it will be necessary to begin moving the federal funds rate up in  2011 or even in 2010, appreciably earlier than envisioned by the Greenbook, which  assumes that the federal funds rate will remain close to the zero bound through 2012   None of you changed your views on the “mandate consistent” inflation rate in this  round The central tendency remains 1¾ to 2 percent, and the range remains 1½ to              April 28–29, 2009 35 of 201  2 percent Three of you are at 1½ percent, two are at 1¾ percent, and twelve are at  2 percent   As shown by exhibit 2, your views on the uncertainties and risks in your  projections have not changed appreciably since January  Almost all of you again see  greater-than-usual uncertainty in your projections of both growth and inflation,  reflecting the unusual nature of the shocks that triggered the current recession and our  limited experience with unconventional policy tools  Most of you continue to judge  that the risks to growth are tilted to the downside (and those to unemployment tilted  to the upside) but that risks to inflation are roughly balanced  Some of you note that  you see the near-term risks as tilted to the downside but see the risks to growth in  your outyear forecasts as roughly balanced, whereas several of you stated that the  rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet will shift inflation risks to the  upside going forward   In short, your current projections show a deeper recession in 2009 than did your   January projections but not a longer recession  Your projections continue to show a   recovery starting later this year  Most of you still expect the recovery to be sluggish   initially but to gain traction in 2010 and to pick up steam in 2011  Even so, none of   you thinks that the economy will have returned to full employment by the end of   2011 Most of you expect inflation to remain subdued, but the range of views on the   outlook for inflation in 2011 remains wide  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I think to some degree that would be true  The question is, to some   degree, where the Treasuries come from, at least in terms of focusing on your question about the   leverage ratio If they are coming predominantly from the banking sector, that may have the   effect you are talking about But if they are coming from outside the banking sector, where   capital ratios are less important, that won’t have the effect relative to the leverage ratio that you   mentioned   I don’t know what you mean by “push through”     I think the question is whether the banking system as a whole is acting   as though it’s constrained by capital and whether we expect that it will continue  Now, we   certainly think that that’s the case  Bank credit overall is contracting pretty markedly, and of   course, we all know about very low bank share prices and the difficulties in raising capital  So I   think the implicit assumption here is that, at least for some time going forward, the banking   sector as a whole will remain capital constrained  I agree that there is some scope for shifting        April 28–29, 2009 39 of 201  credit around among banks, but at least the current experience with the behavior of banks   strongly suggests that the system as a whole is constrained   No Most people are not wanting the assets   I agree It’s both demand and supply for bank credit, but we have   very strong experience that the supply of bank credit is contracting   I think the question is how much  Surely it goes in that direction  In   evaluating the risk–return tradeoff from holding reserves or making a commercial loan at LIBOR   plus 200 or some other basis, there’s a big difference between those returns  You wonder   whether lowering the relevant rate of either 25 basis points on excess reserves or the federal   funds rate from 15 basis points further down really is going to make a very big difference  One   of the costs you have to trade off in making that judgment is whether you are concerned at all   about the market effects that would surely come about on the federal funds rate amid all the   things we talked about previously regarding the possible impairment of market function  Now,   there are possible offsets to that  Trish already mentioned the change in the new fails penalty,   for instance, which might help deal with at least one of those issues  6  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package   labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  The April   Bluebook presented two basic policy alternatives for your consideration  Under   alternative A, the Committee would buy an additional $450 billion of Treasury   securities on top of its already announced plans to purchase up to $175 trillion of   Treasury, agency, and mortgage-backed securities  Under alternative B, the   Committee would maintain its previously announced plans  The Bluebook also   offered a variant of alternative B, dubbed B′, which translates the announced total   purchases of securities and time frames into monthly dollar amounts and monthly    6 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 6)                    April 28–29, 2009 105 of 201  growth rates of the System’s securities portfolio  Turning to page 2, this morning we  have proposed a change to the first paragraph of all the alternatives (shown in red) in  order to be more consistent with the economic data released this morning and with the  general sense that household spending could be leveling out That proposed change is  applied to all of the alternatives in the packet   The Committee might adopt the further expansion of its securities portfolio  proposed in alternative A if it thinks that the economic outlook under its current  policy path is unacceptably weak and believes that the advantages of providing  additional monetary policy stimulus through expanded large-scale asset purchases  would outweigh the disadvantages Under the staff’s analysis, the outlook is indeed  quite weak Although economic activity bottoms out around the middle of this year,  the recovery remains tepid until mid-2010  The staff sees the economy expanding at  a pace below that of potential GDP through the first quarter of next year—even  though potential growth is temporarily held down by financial strains and the need to  reallocate resources—so the unemployment rate rises to 9¼ percent by the end of this  year and only edges lower next year  In the extended Greenbook baseline forecast,  the Committee is assumed to hold the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound  until 2013 Those very low short-term interest rates, together with the lagged effects  of the Committee’s large-scale asset purchases and other policies to support financial  markets, strengthen financial institutions, and boost spending eventually produce  sufficient repair of balance sheets in the financial and household sectors and enough  aggregate demand to spur growth to 4½ percent in 2011 and tilt the trajectory of  unemployment down more noticeably  But the staff projects that, even with these  policies, the economy does not return to full employment until late 2013, four-and-a­ half years from now  In the staff forecast, core PCE prices rise at an average annual  rate of less than 1 percent over the next five years, well below the 2 percent rate that  the majority of you view as consistent with your dual mandate  While your own  forecasts generally point to somewhat higher inflation than foreseen by the staff, you  still anticipate inflation to be below 2 percent over the next three years    If you judge that the outlook for economic activity is excessively sluggish and  inflation is likely to be on the low side of its optimal level, you might be inclined to  provide additional monetary stimulus by expanding your large-scale asset purchases   Market participants appear to put only small odds on an expansion of your securities  purchases today, so the announcement of an additional $450 billion of Treasury  purchases might lower longer-term interest rates, including private rates, by 20 to  45 basis points Although these estimates are subject to great uncertainty, such a  reduction might raise the level of real GDP after three years by ¼ percent to 1 percent  relative to baseline and lower the unemployment rate 01 to 05 percentage point in  2011   The language proposed for alternative A does not differ markedly from that used  by the Committee in its March statement, but as I noted, the material shown in red is  less downbeat than both the March language and that proposed in the Bluebook   Also, relative to March, the reference to declining equity wealth has been dropped in                      April 28–29, 2009 106 of 201  view of the rebound in stock prices over the intermeeting period, and the sentence on  the slump in US exports and recession abroad has been omitted  However, to  explain the motivation for undertaking the additional policy action of alternative A,  the final sentence of the first paragraph would indicate the Committee’s anticipation  that economic activity will continue to contract in the near term and that the  subsequent recovery could be sluggish The second paragraph, on inflation, is  essentially the same as in March, but it uses a slight variant of the language to refer to  inflation rates that are “most consistent with sustainable economic growth”  That  revised wording is employed to avoid suggesting that inflation fosters economic  growth, but this improvement may not be worth the costs in terms of market analysts  wondering what subtle message the Committee is sending by making the change   The third paragraph of alternative A modifies the corresponding paragraph of the  March statement to indicate the expansion in the asset purchases but otherwise  explains the Committee’s intentions in essentially the same way, referring to a total  quantity of asset purchases spread out over specified time periods this year  Another  change in language is to note explicitly that asset purchases will be state contingent  by indicating that “the Committee is prepared to make further adjustments to the  timing and overall amounts of these purchases of Treasury, agency, and mortgage- backed securities as appropriate in view of the evolving economic outlook and  conditions in financial markets”  The penultimate sentence now references the Fed’s  liquidity programs generally rather than specifically citing the TALF, as in the most  recent three statements; this change might be desirable in view of the TALF’s slow  start   In considering whether to expand asset purchases, the Committee would need to  balance a number of factors, including the baseline outlook for both economic growth  and inflation, the risks around that outlook, and the benefits, costs, and uncertainties  of a further expansion In your forecast submissions, several of you indicated that  you were concerned that the Committee’s large-scale asset purchases and other  programs that expand the System’s balance sheet could unanchor inflation  expectations More generally, as I noted yesterday, many of you projected noticeably  higher inflation in 2011 than does the staff, even with somewhat less economic  growth   A sense that the risks to inflation relative to the Committee’s objectives were  more nearly balanced than suggested by the staff forecast might incline the  Committee to pause at this meeting, as under alternative B, on page 3  A decision to  stand pat might also be supported by a judgment that the Federal Reserve and the  government have now put in place a range of effective programs to support credit  flows and economic activity—programs whose effects on the real economy and  inflation will be evident only with a considerable lag  Finally, the Committee may be  encouraged by recent information suggesting that the deterioration in the economy  may be slowing                       April 28–29, 2009 107 of 201  Paragraph 1 for alternative B is largely the same as that for alternative A,  including the reference to some easing in financial conditions and the modified  passage shown in red, but the final sentences do not express an expectation that the  recovery will be sluggish As in March, the final clause refers to a gradual  resumption of sustainable economic growth The paragraph on inflation is identical  to that in the March statement  The third paragraph, on policy actions, is  substantively similar to that used in March; in particular, the Committee would make  no change to its program of large-scale asset purchases  The third sentence from the  end would note that the timing and overall amounts of its asset purchases may be  adjusted in view of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial  markets, as in alternative A  Unless that sentence is interpreted as suggesting that the  Committee is leaning toward expanding or contracting its asset purchases, an  announcement along the lines of alternative B seems unlikely to prompt much market  reaction   Alternative B′, page 4, is identical to alternative B except that, in response to  suggestions from Presidents Bullard and Plosser, we included text (highlighted in  yellow) that translates the dollar amounts and time frames of future asset purchases  into monthly average dollar amounts and monthly average growth rates of the  System’s securities portfolio  Some readers may find the additional information  helpful; others may find confusing the proliferation of numbers that results from  expressing the Committee’s unchanged plans for asset purchases in three different  ways   Also attached for your reference on pages 5 and 6 are alternatives B′′ and B′′′ as  proposed by Presidents Bullard and Plosser  These alternatives are, again,  substantively the same as B and B′ But they provide the material in a different order  by beginning with a paragraph on the Committee’s policy decision, then presenting  the two paragraphs on the rationale, and concluding with various points, including the  Committee’s intention to monitor the size and composition of the balance sheet  It is  worth noting that B′′ and B′′′ cover the federal funds rate target in this final paragraph  rather than in the introductory paragraph  A key difference from B and B′ is the way  that B′′ and B′′′ quantify the plans for asset purchases  Under alternative B′′, the  Committee would specify numerically only a monthly growth rate of 18 to 20 percent  for its security holdings, rather than the total dollar stock of planned purchases; the  announcement states that that the specified growth rate is consistent with the  Committee’s already announced plans  Alternative B′′′ would take a similar approach  but would articulate the growth of the securities portfolio in dollar terms rather than  percentage terms     Finally, let me note that we distributed to you this morning a corrected exhibit  from my briefing yesterday on your economic projections  No central tendencies or  ranges that I discussed were affected  Thank you, Mr Chairman        April 28–29, 2009 108 of 201  Well, of course, the Committee issues a directive to the Desk, and my   understanding of the directive—and Trish may want to comment on this—is that the Committee   has essentially instructed the Desk to carry out the purchases that are specified at rates that   roughly average the amounts specified by the Committee but that also potentially take into   account market conditions     April 28–29, 2009 109 of 201  Now, you are raising a separate issue, which relates to the questions that Presidents   Bullard and Plosser have raised  It is, What’s the longer-run path or the longer-run plan for the   Committee’s open market purchases?  I agree that, in an ideal world, the Committee would   articulate a fully blown plan for its monetary policy settings over the indefinite future  I think   that is difficult to do in practice  One way to look at this is that the world will surely turn out   differently, either better or worse, from the way we currently see it in terms of the baseline   projection, and eventually the Committee will need to adjust its plans for large-scale asset   purchases and other monetary policy settings like the federal funds rate  That could conceivably   mean that later this year, for instance, the Committee scales back its large-scale asset purchases   or expands them  So I do not think that the way that the Committee has already expressed its   statement or its directive to the Desk rules out those adjustments at some point in the future  It   just doesn’t make clear at this point what those will be in the absence of information about how   the economy and the outlook will progress   I would see this in the context of the overall set of materials that the   staff has provided to the Committee, especially at the last meeting and this meeting, and the   various attempts that we’ve made to calibrate the different amounts of asset purchases to   evolving economic conditions and their effects on the economy  We didn’t look carefully or   specifically at a whole range of options  Basically these would be viewed as linear, and if the   Committee were inclined to go with the smaller number, then the effects on the economy and   interest rates would be correspondingly smaller, and vice versa for larger purchases   5  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material   labeled “Material for Briefing on Staff Proposal Regarding Liquidity Facilities” A   number of the credit and liquidity facilities that the Board of Governors and the   Federal Open Market Committee have established are scheduled to expire later this   year The PDCF, the TSLF, the AMLF, the MMIFF, the CPFF, and the dollar   liquidity and foreign currency liquidity swap lines are scheduled to expire on   October 30 The TALF is scheduled to expire on December 31  However, the TAF   and the authorization for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend to Fannie   Mae and Freddie Mac have no fixed expiration date                                            June 23–24, 2009 23 of 261  As noted in the memorandum and in various staff briefing documents, the usage  of most of the liquidity facilities has declined in recent months as market conditions  have improved  Indeed, amounts outstanding under several of the facilities have  contracted noticeably further in the days since we completed our memorandum   In considering whether to modify, extend, suspend, or terminate the various  programs, policymakers will need to balance various considerations   First, to the extent possible, policymakers will want to avoid contributing to  market distortions by providing liquidity at terms that would be attractive in routine  circumstances  To an important degree, several of the programs were designed with  terms that become less attractive to borrowers as market conditions improve  The  decline in usage of the foreign swap lines, the CPFF, the PDCF, and the TSLF  reflects this factor   Second, in order to extend the 13(3) facilities, the Board must judge that  conditions remain “unusual and exigent,” and the lending Reserve Bank must  determine that “adequate credit accommodations” are not available from other  banking institutions The law does not define either of these terms, leaving  considerable room for policymakers’ judgment    Third, even though market conditions have improved notably over the past nine  months, they arguably remain fragile and dependent on government support  With  the economy in a severe recession, credit losses on commercial real estate and other  credits are likely to mount substantially, leading to erosion of bank capital and  continued uncertainty about the health of individual banks  In these circumstances, it  seems likely that markets could remain quite jittery for some time  In the absence of  backup liquidity facilities, concerns about counterparty credit risk could remain  substantial, and systemic risk could increase from its currently diminished level  As  is often the case, the period over year-end could also pose heightened risks   In view of these considerations, the staff has proposed that the Board and the  FOMC extend a number of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities to a point  distinctly after year-end—February 1, 2010  The staff also recommends, however,  that certain other facilities be suspended, terminated, or modified   As shown in the first row of the table, the staff recommends that, given the  continued strains on the banking system, the more liberal terms for primary credit—  the relatively low spread of the primary credit rate over the target federal funds rate  and the availability of primary credit loans with terms of up to 90 days—be  maintained for the time being  However, the staff believes that eventually, perhaps  early next year, it will be appropriate to gradually increase that spread and shorten the  maximum maturity                 June 23–24, 2009 24 of 261  As indicated in row 2, the staff recommends that the size of TAF auctions be  reduced at this time from their current $150 billion to $125 billion  Even that amount  would be well above recent bid amounts, and the staff believes that auction sizes  probably can gradually be reduced further later this year  However, in view of the  continued fragility of the banking system, the staff believes that it would not be  prudent to announce at this time a fixed or even notional schedule for winding down  the TAF With regard to the longer-term status of the TAF, as noted in the right-hand  column, the staff is currently leaning toward an eventual recommendation that in the  steady state the TAF be maintained but at a low level, to maintain the operational  readiness of the program for potential use in future periods of stress  Coming back to  the immediate proposal, an open issue is whether to accompany the reduction in TAF  size with an increase in the minimum bid rate, say, to IOER plus 10 basis points   Such a spread over the IOER rate would discourage institutions from using TAF as an  essentially free means of securing a large liquidity buffer  It would also move in the  direction of pricing TAF at a penalty so that institutions would not rely on the facility  when market sources of funds are available  An argument against charging a penalty  is that the program is an auction facility and not a standing facility  Moreover,  charging banks a penalty rate conceivably might stigmatize the facility   With regard to the foreign swap lines, row 3, the staff recommends extension  through February 1 The major foreign central banks have priced their dollar  provision at appreciable spreads over OIS, and usage has accordingly declined  substantially as market conditions have improved  Maintaining the swap lines into  early February would help contribute to financial stability, while the penalty pricing  should continue to discourage unnecessary reliance on foreign central banks’ dollar  liquidity programs  Consultation with our 14 central bank counterparties indicates  that all are willing to extend the facilities, and some of them are eager to do so  The  staff plans to conduct a study beginning later this year on the desirability of  maintaining some swap lines on a permanent basis   Moving to the dealer facilities, the staff proposes that authorization for the PDCF  and the TSLF, rows 4 and 5, be extended to February 1 The PDCF is an important  backstop for maintaining dealers’ liquidity during a period of potentially continued  market stress  However, to increase the Federal Reserve’s credit protection and to  discourage unnecessary use of the facility, the staff proposes to increase the haircuts  being charged on most types of investment-grade and noninvestment-grade collateral   For investment-grade collateral, these revisions will utilize the work recently done for  discount window haircuts by the Subcommittee on Risk Management   With regard to the TSLF, the staff recommends that the program be extended  through February 1, but it believes that operation of this program can now be scaled  down significantly In view of the improvements in the functioning of the repo  markets for collateral eligible for open market operations and declining usage, the  staff proposes to suspend both schedule 1 TSLF operations and auctions under the  TSLF Options Program (TOP)  Operations under these programs could be resumed if  warranted by market conditions, after consultation with the Board and FOMC if                       June 23–24, 2009 25 of 261  possible The repo market for non-OMO-eligible collateral has not improved to the  same degree as that for schedule 1 collateral, and dealers continue to employ the  program, albeit at a low and declining level  Accordingly, the staff believes that  schedule 2 auctions should continue, but that the amount and frequency of such  auctions can be reduced to one auction of $75 billion every four weeks, and that the  Desk could seek to scale back amounts further over time as market conditions allow   Lines 6 through 8 cover the facilities related to the commercial paper market and  money market funds  The staff believes that the situation with respect to money  market mutual funds remains somewhat fragile  The experience last fall  demonstrated that money funds, which are close cousins of banks, are exposed to runs  that can threaten the stability of the entire financial system  Moreover, the Treasury  believes that it does not have the statutory authority to extend its money fund  guarantee program, which expires on September 18  In these circumstances, the staff  thinks that continued Federal Reserve liquidity support for money funds is warranted  and recommends that two of the facilities be extended through early next year   Unfortunately, various legal and practical constraints have resulted in somewhat  awkward designs for these three facilities     To be sure, the AMLF, line 6, has been an effective vehicle for helping to  stabilize money market mutual funds  However, it also has design features that make  the program difficult to operate solely as a backup liquidity facility  In particular,  under the AMLF the Federal Reserve lends through depository institutions and other  intermediaries rather than directly to money funds, and money funds are required to  sell the ABCP to the depository institutions at amortized cost in order to limit the risk  of breaking the buck As a result of these features, simply raising the interest rate  charged to the depository institution above the currently charged primary credit rate  in an effort to make the facility less attractive would not work, or at least it would not  work well Depository institutions would only be willing to purchase ABCP with  yields that are above the new interest rate, and there is not much eligible ABCP held  by money funds with yields much above the primary credit rate  On the other hand,  altering the amortized cost requirement may also be problematic because it would  increase the likelihood that funds using the AMLF would break the buck, thus  reducing the effectiveness of the facility  Accordingly, the staff has proposed a  different approach to the AMLF establishing redemption thresholds that would have  to be exceeded before a money fund could use the program  These redemption  thresholds should ensure that the facility is used to help meet money funds’ liquidity  needs and thus prevent runs, rather than purely as a credit backstop that money funds  can use to shed paper at risk of downgrade   The CPFF, line 7, has facilitated continued issuance of commercial paper   Moreover, it has been priced at rates that increasingly appear to represent penalties  for most borrowers as market conditions have improved, and amounts outstanding  have declined steadily In order to help ensure that the commercial paper market is  not disrupted between now and year-end, the staff proposes that the facility be  extended through February 1 without change  If market conditions continue to                                June 23–24, 2009 26 of 261  improve but some borrowers keep relying on the CPFF, the New York Fed might  counsel CPFF borrowers to seek alternative sources of financing   When it was designed, the MMIFF, line 8, was regarded as a useful liquidity   backup for money funds However, the decline in interest rates over the intervening   period implies that money funds now hold very little paper that meets the   requirements of the facility  Therefore, the MMIFF is no longer likely to be an   effective means of supporting money funds in the event of a run  Moreover, money   funds are concerned that usage of the facility would entail some stigma  And, finally,   the facility is costly to maintain  As a result of these considerations, the staff   recommends that the authorization for the MMIFF not be extended    Currently, the TALF, line 9, is scheduled to expire at year-end  Because the   TALF does not provide short-term funding, it does not seem necessary to extend the   TALF over year-end simply to align its expiration with the other facilities  However,   market participants have noted that it can take many months to assemble some of the   deals to be financed by the TALF and, from that perspective, the year-end deadline   might soon bind undesirably  After further analysis of this issue, the staff might bring   to the Board a separate proposal for a modest extension of the TALF    Finally, the authorization to lend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, line 10,   remains in effect  With the Treasury now authorized to lend to the GSEs, the staff   suggested that the Board consider rescinding this authority immediately  However,   the staff subsequently learned that the Treasury is concerned about possible adverse   effects of a rescission of the authority at this time; a legislative proposal for   restructuring the GSEs has not yet been put forward, and in these circumstances a   rescission could prompt questions about the strength of government support for the   GSEs and hence be destabilizing The Board might consider it prudent to defer action   on this recommendation for the time being    Drafts of Board and FOMC resolutions to implement these proposals were   provided to you last week    That concludes the staff presentation  We would be happy to respond to your   questions    Very much so, I would say   Well, not so much the politics, but the economics  It’s not just the   11th District I think there has been a fairly broad-based increase in terms of usage of primary   credit by small institutions because they find the rate attractive  The question is whether that’s a   good thing or a bad thing I think from the point of view of central banking, our general   perspective in redesigning the discount window facility some years ago was to set up the primary   credit program as a Lombard facility that institutions wouldn’t find attractive in routine   circumstances but would turn to only as a backup  Pricing the primary credit rate at a level that   is consistent with that was one of the challenges in designing the primary credit program   initially It surely seems to be the case that as that spread narrows, exactly as you would expect,   banks increasingly tend to use that as an ongoing source of funding, and that is, I think, the   consideration that needs to be balanced   Possibly increasing the penalty I think that is open for discussion at   this point   It’s used by some large domestic US banks as well as by foreign   branches   My assumption is that the TAF would largely be wound down over   roughly the same period of time  The Federal Reserve might ultimately choose to maintain a   TAF in the steady state, but at a very low level  It wouldn’t be a significant source of funding for   large banks, foreign banks, or anybody   President Lacker, I think we subscribe to pretty much all of the points   you’ve made, but our ability to quantify the elasticities that you’re talking about, I think, is   essentially nil This is a good area for research and further thought, but this is what we could do   in the limited time we had available   The experience last fall, though, gives you some reason to think that   the fed funds rate is relevant The fact that the substantial spread between the interest rate on   excess reserves and the fed funds rate seems to be reflected in other market interest rates like   LIBOR, CP, and so on, suggests that it’s not solely the IOER rate that’s the relevant margin   I don’t think that’s clear  I mean, there’s nothing that says necessarily   that a central bank can’t operate with negative capital   I think it is, unfortunately, a fairly complicated situation, so it’s   difficult to give a simple answer to your question  For one thing, we have both standing facilities   and auction facilities, and they’re really very different in terms of their philosophy and what you   might think their purpose is and how to unwind them  An auction facility, pretty much by   construction, can be unwound primarily just by reducing the amounts offered, whereas to make a   standing facility less attractive, obviously you’d increase the interest rates or otherwise make the   terms less attractive  To some degree what we’ve proposed here has included elements of both   of those—for instance, making the terms less attractive in the case of the AMLF by requiring the   redemption threshold, and reducing the auction amounts in the case of the TAF  They’re just   two very different facilities that require different approaches  As we noted in the memo, it’s not   really feasible to scale back the AMLF by raising the interest rate on that particular program   On the timing, that’s a difficult question  I think one consideration is that, as we get   closer to the termination dates of programs, market participants will be deciding whether or not              June 23–24, 2009 56 of 261  to lend to particular counterparties, depending on whether that counterparty is going to have the   option of turning to the Federal Reserve to repay the investor or the lender  That argues at least   for a significant lead time in notifying the market as to when these facilities are likely to go   away   Right It is very much a matter of judgment, I think, including how   aggressive you think is appropriate at this point, given circumstances that arguably remain very   fragile, with the banking system still under a lot of strain   First of all, it is complicated, and I think it will take a while for people   to understand all of the elements, assuming the Board and the FOMC follow the staff   recommendation  A second point, though, is that it will be read very much in the context of the   announcement tomorrow and what that says about your intentions with respect to the federal   funds rate, the asset purchases, and so on  In some sense that will really very much condition the   reaction, because, among other things, that will give the economic backdrop, the rationale, for   how the Committee is approaching monetary policy at this stage   Mr Chairman, could I recommend one change to the recommended   resolutions?  The draft that was circulated indicated that the New York Fed is directed “to   suspend operations of” the TSLF options program  I recommend substituting “to suspend   auctions under” the TSLF options program  The reason for the change is that there are options   outstanding, and I don’t think the intent would be to prevent those options from being exercised   Just one additional point On the tightening of the collateral   restrictions, it’s likely that that will not be implemented immediately but some time in the next   several months  7  I will be referring to the separate package labeled “Material  for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”     Exhibit 1 tabulates the central tendencies and ranges of your latest projections   Corresponding information about your April projections is indicated in italics, and  June Greenbook projections are included as memo items     As shown in the upper left portion of the table, your forecasts for real GDP  growth in 2009 have a central tendency of -15 to -1 percent  That is an upward shift  of about ¼ to ½ percentage point from April, reflecting increases to your projections  for both halves of this year You indicated that the upward revision was in response  to the better tone of the data releases and improvements in financial conditions over  the intermeeting period  Your growth forecasts for 2010 and 2011 are similar to  those you provided in April     Even though you project higher real GDP growth over the near term, all of you  raised your forecasts of the unemployment rate  The central tendency in the fourth  quarter of 2009 is now 98 to 101 percent, about ½ percentage point above your April  projections You still expect that the unemployment rate will trend down during 2010  and 2011, but the levels remain about ½ percentage point above your April  projections Many of you cited recent higher-than-expected unemployment data as  the reason for the revisions Moreover, each of you indicated that the unemployment   rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 is likely to be well above your estimate of the long- run equilibrium unemployment rate     As shown in the lower half of the table, recent information has led you to raise  your forecasts for headline and core inflation from those in April  The central  tendency of your projections for headline PCE inflation in 2009 is 10 to 14 percent,  about ½ percentage point above that of April, and you made small upward revisions  in 2010 and 2011 Many of you noted that these upward revisions reflect the  influence of higher-than-expected core inflation data and higher energy prices, and  some pointed to higher inflation expectations  Most of you still project that inflation  will stay around or below your view of “mandate-consistent” inflation through 2011,  but your expectations for inflation continue to span a wide range  Some see inflation  slowing through 2011 in response to persistently high economic slack, while others  see inflation rising above “mandate-consistent” inflation because of the influence of  the rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet on inflation expectations     Over the near term, your views on the outlook are broadly similar to those of the  staff Greenbook projections for real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation for                     June 23–24, 2009 110 of 261  2009 are within the central tendencies of your projections  However, by 2011   noticeable differences are evident  The Greenbook’s real GDP growth forecast for   that year is above the central tendency of your projections, while the staff forecasts   for the unemployment rate and core inflation are below the central tendencies    Several of you again noted explicitly that you do not share the staff’s view of   inflation dynamics    That divergence in views helps explain why more than half of you anticipate that   it will be necessary to begin moving the fed funds rate up appreciably earlier than   envisioned by the Greenbook, which assumes that the federal funds rate will remain   close to the zero bound through 2011    As shown by the left panels of exhibit 2, your views on the degree of uncertainty  surrounding your projections have not changed appreciably since April  Almost all of  you see greater-than-usual uncertainty regarding your projections of both economic  growth and inflation, reflecting the unusual nature of the shocks that triggered the  current recession and our limited experience with nontraditional policy tools   However, as shown in the right-hand panels, more of you now judge that the risks to  growth and inflation are roughly balanced  For economic growth, many of you see  the recent economic and financial developments as having reduced downside risks   Fewer of you now judge that inflation risks are skewed to the downside, and a large  majority of you see inflation risks as balanced overall   Mr Chairman, that concludes our presentation  But while I have the floor, could I  note that I misspoke earlier when I said that the timing of the PDCF haircuts would be  announced in the press release on Thursday Those haircuts aren’t published, so it  wouldn’t make sense to put them in the press release  But the Desk will inform the  dealers at the appropriate time   I don’t know the answer to your question, President Evans, but it is, as   I noted in my remarks, fairly striking   Thank you, Mr Chairman Before I begin, let me note that   Carol Low has available a corrected version of the chart from yesterday that had the   date axis labeled incorrectly9    The Bluebook presented three monetary policy alternatives for your  consideration—alternatives A, B, and C—as well as a variant of alternative B, labeled  B´ On Monday, we provided revised drafts of the accompanying statements  Those  drafts, along with the Committee’s April statement, are included in the package  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”10   A choice of alternative A, page 2, could be motivated by a view that the current  settings of policy instruments—a near zero fed funds rate for an extended period, the  current specification of the Committee’s large-scale asset purchases, and the terms  and conditions of the Federal Reserve’s credit and liquidity programs—are unlikely  to produce an outcome consistent with the dual mandate, especially given the recent  backup in long rates Your projections indicate that many of you anticipate economic  weakness persisting for several years; the central tendency of your unemployment  projections at the end of 2011 is 8½ to 8¾ percent, and most of you see inflation in  2011 below rates that you consider to be consistent with price stability  Moreover,  many of you see very slow convergence beyond that, with at least five Committee  participants anticipating that it will take the economy more than five to six years to  return to a balanced growth path Furthermore, a substantial minority consider the  risks to economic growth to be skewed to the downside     With both a modal outlook for weak growth and low inflation, and downside risks  around the outlook for activity, macroeconomic considerations would seem to argue  for providing additional monetary policy stimulus at this juncture  However, with the  federal funds rate at the zero bound, the Committee has limited policy options at its  disposal One of those options is to step up its large-scale asset purchases  But as  discussed yesterday, the Committee’s scope for increasing its large-scale asset  purchases is also somewhat constrained  The Desk judges that purchases of agency  debt securities, if anything, should be cut back from the currently specified amount of  up to $200 billion And the Committee could encounter increasing difficulties in  buying agency mortgage-backed securities without distorting interest rate spreads,  particularly if the recent backup in long rates persists and reduces the volume of  mortgage refinancing and gross MBS issuance     In these circumstances, the Committee might be left with Treasury securities as   the only asset readily available for increased purchase  Alternative A specifies that   the Committee would increase its purchases of Treasury securities by $450 billion                     June 23–24, 2009 166 of 261  With market participants, according to the Desk’s primary dealer survey, putting only  small odds on an increase in purchases, staff estimates suggest that such an  announcement might reduce longer-term interest rates by ¼ to ½ percentage point   The staff further estimates that, by the end of 2011, a reduction in long-term rates by  this amount could be sufficient to lower the unemployment rate by 02 to  04 percentage point   However, in its consideration of expanded asset purchases, the Committee would  need to weigh certain other factors First, despite the staff’s estimates, you might be  skeptical about the effects of asset purchases Or you may simply be quite uncertain  about those effects and prefer to wait for further evidence  Also, market perceptions  of debt monetization and risks to inflation expectations that could accompany such an  expansion are a worry If the projections made by many of you turn out to be correct,  inflation will remain quite subdued and any inflation scare should subside; but at this  point, with the economic outlook improved, you may see appropriate risk  management as calling for waiting before considering further action  A related  concern is that you yourselves might not be completely confident that the Federal  Reserve will have the technical tools to execute an exit strategy at the appropriate  time, particularly with an even larger balance sheet than is expected under the current  program of asset purchases  In addition, as noted yesterday, the Federal Reserve  could also experience reduced income and diminished remittances to the Treasury or  capital losses even with currently planned asset purchases, and an expansion of these  purchases could amplify such losses   Alternative A incorporates another option for providing additional policy  stimulus  The Committee could be more explicit about the period of time over which  it expects to hold short-term interest rates at exceptionally low levels; this might be an  alternative means of putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and  spurring aggregate demand that would not involve further asset purchases  In  particular, the bracketed language in paragraph 3 notes that, rather than simply  reiterating the April indication that the Committee “anticipates that economic  conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for  an extended period,” you could instead indicate that “economic conditions are likely  to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through  mid-2010”  This more specific formulation might help limit the extent to which  markets price in an earlier start to firming than the Committee currently sees as likely   Such a statement would take the Committee in a direction that several other central  banks—the Bank of Canada, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and the Riksbank—  have already taken Two notes provided to the Committee by the International  Finance Division explored the experience of those central banks with these more  explicitly contingent commitments  The staff concluded that, at least on balance in  these three cases, the commitments seemed to have had limited effects on market  pricing, in part because they were perceived as providing little new information to the  market                       June 23–24, 2009 167 of 261  The first and second paragraphs of the statement language for alternative A would  set forth the motivation for further action at this meeting, particularly by citing the  recent backup in bond yields  The first paragraph would note that “Although  conditions in financial markets have generally improved, the Committee judges that  further monetary policy stimulus is warranted to help ensure that the sharp rise in  some longer-term interest rates over recent months does not undermine a recovery in  overall economic activity”  And the second paragraph would indicate that “the  Committee still sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that  best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term,” repeating  language used in its last three policy statements    However, if you see the current stance of policy as suitably balancing the various  risks facing the Committee, you instead might be inclined to issue a statement along  the lines of alternative B, page 3 Under this alternative, the Committee would  continue to indicate that it expects the fed funds rate to remain exceptionally low for  an extended period, and it would retain the existing limits on its large-scale asset  purchases The language in the first paragraph would be somewhat more upbeat than  in April, noting that the pace of economic contraction is slowing, that financial  market conditions have improved, that sentiment has risen, and that the inventory  correction is proceeding  However, the Committee would temper that optimism by  noting that “economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time”  The second  paragraph would reiterate the Committee’s expectation that inflation will remain  subdued, but it would omit the sentence citing the risk that inflation could persist at  suboptimally low rates   The third paragraph of the revised version of alternative B is mostly similar to the  corresponding paragraph in the April statement  However, the second sentence  indicates that the Committee “continues to” anticipate exceptionally low levels of the  federal funds rate, thus pushing back slightly on the expectation among some market  participants of an early increase in the fed funds rate target  Toward the end of the  paragraph, the statement no longer includes the indication that “The Federal Reserve  is facilitating the extension of credit to households and businesses and supporting the  functioning of financial markets through a range of liquidity programs;” repeating  that point no longer seems necessary  The statement continues to note that  policymakers are monitoring the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet, but it adds the thought that the Federal Reserve “will make adjustments  to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted,” consistent with tomorrow’s  announcement of extensions and modifications to various liquidity programs   The final sentence, in brackets, would signal that the Committee is factoring exit  issues into its current policy decisions by noting that “The Committee will take  careful account of the necessity of assuring that policy accommodation can ultimately  be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time”      Market participants reportedly expect little change in today’s FOMC statement,  apart from a somewhat more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook than in                         June 23–24, 2009 168 of 261  April In most respects, the draft statement for alternative B is consistent with those  expectations However, analysts will take note that the sentence expressing concern  about downside inflation risks has been dropped  Moreover, even with the emphasis  in the third paragraph that the Committee “continues to” expect the fed funds rate to  remain exceptionally low, the bracketed final sentence, if included, could give the  impression that the Committee is preparing to remove policy accommodation sooner  than markets currently expect, and it is possible that this sentence in particular could  prompt a noticeable backup in interest rates  You may want to express your  judgments about the desirability of including this point in the upcoming go-round   With the revisions to the language of alternative B since the Bluebook was  published, the message of alternative B has become closer to that in the Bluebook’s  alternative B´ And if the bracketed sentence in the revised version of alternative B  were dropped, that alternative and alternative B´ would be substantively similar, so  we have dropped alternative B´ as a separate option  The version of alternative B  without the bracketed sentence seems unlikely to prompt much market reaction   Should you believe that the Committee ought to prepare to reduce the degree of  monetary accommodation before long, you might see selection of alternative C, page  4, as appropriate Of course, that view would be difficult to motivate under either the  Greenbook forecast or the central tendency of your projections, but you might see the  economy as likely to be more resilient than implied by these forecasts  Even more  pertinently, some of you have expressed concerns that the System’s enlarged balance  sheet, its purchases of Treasury securities, and the extremely low federal funds rate  might unmoor inflation expectations; the increase in inflation compensation and in  survey measures of inflation expectations over the intermeeting period might be  viewed as worrisome in this regard  Against this backdrop, you might see a relatively  near-term exit from the very accommodative policy stance as appropriate     Under this alternative, the end of paragraph 1 would note explicitly the  Committee’s expectation that a gradual recovery in economic activity is likely to  begin later this year The inflation paragraph would indicate a view that inflation will  remain subdued but would leave out the phrase “for some time”  As in the current  draft of alternative B, this alternative would drop the recent reference to downside  inflation risk Importantly, in paragraph 3, the Committee’s expectation of the likely  time frame for “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate” would be changed  to “until late this year”  This language would suggest that the Committee anticipates  raising the federal funds rate beginning around year-end  Moreover, further down in  paragraph 3, the statement would now indicate that “The Committee anticipates that  the pace of purchases of securities will taper off gradually by the end of the year”   This sentence would convey a clear sense that the Committee does not intend to  increase its asset purchases and, in fact, will begin to wind down its purchases of  Treasury securities before long All in all, such an announcement would be quite  surprising to market participants, and in all likelihood it would prompt a considerable  backup in interest rates and substantial market volatility             June 23–24, 2009 169 of 261  A table that compares the three statements is included on the final page for your  reference     Two other points may be worth making  One is that, of course, credit   intermediation through the banking sector seemingly remains still quite impaired, judging by   actual credit flows and by responses to things like the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey    Also, as Brian mentioned in his briefing, there’s still a tremendous range of support that’s being   provided to financial markets and institutions  It is difficult to know exactly how to factor that   in, but surely that is still providing support   I think at this stage we view all of them as potentially productive to   work on further They are at somewhat different stages of development, but I think that they all   have significant plausibility as methods of dealing with reserve issues  I think we wouldn’t   recommend at this stage deciding definitely to use one in favor of another one   A question, President Lacker, is whether it would persist at just   15 basis points, 10 basis points, or so as the level of rates goes up  And we just don’t know that  2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package  labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which includes the  same set of statements that was distributed earlier this week  Although the economic  outlook has changed only gradually on balance, the economic and financial situation  has improved significantly since early spring  The economic downturn has abated  considerably, with activity apparently now in the process of leveling off; financial  markets display fewer strains and have become much more supportive of growth; and  downside risks to the economy seem to have diminished appreciably  Still, the  outlook continues to be weak, with the staff, many private forecasters, and Committee  participants projecting a subpar recovery and slow progress in reducing  unemployment  Meanwhile, inflation has been subdued, but not as low as might have  been expected given the substantial resource slack that has developed  Moreover,  concerns persist about the possible effects of unprecedented monetary and fiscal  stimulus on inflation  Depending on your assessment and weighting of the risks, you  might consider a substantial range of policy adjustments to be appropriate   In addition to this broad economic backdrop, the calendar itself may be a factor in  the Committee’s consideration of its options today  The Treasury purchase program  is scheduled to come to an end in September, and the agency and MBS programs are  due to expire at year-end Given these impending expirations, the Committee would  seem to have reached a key decision point at this meeting  In particular, an important  part of your deliberations today and presumably at your September meeting will be  whether to allow the existing programs to expire, to let them reach their existing  limits, or to extend and expand them  Against that background, the Bluebook  presented four policy alternatives A, B, C, and a variant of alternative B, labeled B′  In addition, on Monday we provided another version of alternative B, labeled  alternative B (revised), for your consideration     The staff forecast and the analytical approaches summarized in the “Monetary  Policy Strategies” section of the Bluebook continue to suggest that a near-zero federal  funds rate will remain appropriate for some time  Consistent with that view, each of  the alternatives maintains the existing 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds  rate The alternatives differ primarily in their options for large-scale asset purchases  and in their guidance about the federal funds rate going forward     Under alternative A, page 2, the Committee would expand its purchases of   Treasury securities to $450 billion  The Committee would also indicate its   expectation that it will purchase the full $125 trillion of agency mortgage-backed   securities while continuing to state that purchases of agency debt will total “up to”                     August 11–12, 2009 118 of 165  $200 billion, thus implicitly allowing for a likely shortfall in this program  The time  frame for Treasury purchases would be extended by three months to year-end   The Committee might be motivated to adopt alternative A if, like the staff, it  continues to expect a comparatively slow economic recovery, with high levels of  resource slack persisting for several years and inflation falling to rates below those  that Committee participants see as most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual  mandate  Based on our reading of market reactions to previous announcements of  changes to LSAP quantities, we estimate that the $150 billion expansion in Treasury  purchases would likely reduce longer-term interest rates by 10 to 20 basis points  In  turn, we estimate that a reduction in longer-term rates of this magnitude would lower  the unemployment rate two years ahead by 01 to 02 percentage point  However,  these estimates are subject to considerable error, in part because it is difficult to tell  whether worries among some market participants about monetization of the debt  could be exacerbated by the expansion in Treasury purchases   If members are also concerned that market participants may be pricing in a much  earlier shift toward monetary policy tightening than currently seems likely and that  these expectations are resulting in financial conditions that are tighter than  appropriate, the Committee could consider sending a more explicit signal about its  expectations for the path of policy In particular, as shown at the end of the third  paragraph of alternative A, the Committee could indicate that “economic conditions  are likely to warrant maintaining the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds  rate at least through mid-2010”  This statement would provide a more specific time  frame than indicated by the current “extended period” phrase, and it would also be  more explicit about the trajectory of rates than the current “exceptionally low levels  of the federal funds rate”   If the Committee broadly concurs with the staff forecast but judges that the costs  of expanding LSAPs—such as potential difficulties in tightening policy down the  road or possible adverse effects on inflation expectations—would likely exceed the  benefits, it might opt for one of the versions of alternative B  Under the Bluebook  version of alternative B, page 3, the Committee would essentially maintain the current  limits of its large-scale asset purchases  However, the statement would indicate that  the Committee will gradually slow its purchases of Treasuries in order “to promote a  smooth transition in markets” and, to allow time for that transition, will extend the  period for completing these purchases through October     Under alternative B, the Committee would not specify its plans today for exiting  from its MBS and agency debt programs  Although Desk and Board staff members  recommend tapering those purchases as they are brought to a close, the MBS and  agency debt programs are not scheduled to expire until year-end  Thus the  Committee might conclude that it is not yet necessary to spell out its exit strategy for  these programs and may see silence on this point as helping to preserve optionality  over coming weeks to increase these purchases if economic or financial conditions  unexpectedly deteriorate However, the Committee would probably wish to decide                       August 11–12, 2009 119 of 165  and announce no later than its September 22-23 meeting whether and how to wind  down its MBS and agency programs  If it were so inclined, the Committee could  announce at its September meeting that it was tapering the current program of MBS  and agency purchases into the first quarter of next year  Such an approach would be  consistent with the recommendations in the Desk’s memo   The language of alternative B would suggest that the Committee was unlikely to  resume purchases of Treasury securities absent very unexpected developments   Should the Committee instead wish to preserve significantly greater scope for  restarting Treasury purchases in coming months, it might choose instead to adopt the  language of alternative B′, page 4 Under this variant, the statement would note  explicitly that the Committee “is prepared to consider resuming its purchases of  Treasury securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in  financial markets”  Like B, alternative B′ would preserve flexibility with respect to  possible changes in the agency debt and MBS programs   Alternative B (revised), on page 5, incorporates several changes from the draft of  B in the Bluebook First, to avoid a possible implication that the inventory correction  is close to completion, the third sentence has been revised to indicate that businesses  “are making progress” in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales,  rather than “have made progress”  Second, on further consideration it seemed  appropriate to characterize financial market conditions as having improved “further”  rather than just “somewhat further”  Finally, changes to the third paragraph would  preserve the option of resuming Treasury purchases but use language that is less  explicit than that in B′  In particular, the penultimate sentence would indicate that the  Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases  of securities generally, not just those of agency debt and MBS  Overall, alternative B  (revised) would maintain significant flexibility for the Committee to change its  purchase strategy in either direction   Market participants generally appear to expect an announcement along the lines  of the various versions of Alternative B, and any market reaction seems likely to be  relatively modest If anything, market rates might move up a little as investors would  be confronted with the reality that the Committee’s asset purchases were now being  wound down   Under alternative C, page 6, the Committee would begin to lower the degree of  monetary policy stimulus, partly by reducing its large-scale asset purchases and partly  by revising its forward rate guidance Members might be attracted to this alternative  if they were more optimistic than the staff about the likely strength of the recovery or  if they were otherwise concerned that inflationary pressures could be greater or build  more quickly than expected by the staff The latter concerns could reflect a view that  the influence of slack on price pressures is likely to be smaller than the staff  anticipates, perhaps because you judge that financial turmoil is restraining the  economy’s potential by more than allowed for in the Greenbook projection   Alternatively, you may worry that the high current degree of monetary                       August 11–12, 2009 120 of 165  accommodation, if sustained much longer, could spur inflation through any of a   variety of channels—for example, by leading to an unmooring of inflation   expectations Such concerns might have been amplified, for instance, by the recent   nearly ½ percentage point increase in five-year-forward inflation compensation     Under alternative C, the Committee would state that “in view of the improved  economic outlook,” it “now expects that its purchases of agency mortgage-backed  securities (MBS) and agency debt will cumulate to about $1 trillion and about  $150 billion, respectively, somewhat less than the previously announced maximum  amounts”  The Committee would also indicate that, with its purchases of Treasuries  well along toward completion, it anticipates buying the full amount of $300 billion   As in the B alternatives, the Treasury purchases would be extended through October,  thus encompassing a tapering strategy, and the reduced purchases of agency debt and  MBS would permit those transactions to be tapered over the balance of the year  The  announcement would also note that the Committee now expected that it would  maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent range “at least through the end of this year” rather  than “for an extended period,” which would likely be seen as a weaker policy  commitment   Overall, the combination of reduced asset purchases and a signal that policy  tightening might begin soon after the turn of the year would represent a considerable  surprise to investors and probably would cause quite a sizable market reaction  A  reduction in total asset purchases—apart perhaps from a small undershoot in the  agency debt program—is not expected by the market, and thus the announcement of  these reductions would likely prompt a noticeable backup in market interest rates—  perhaps 20 to 25 basis points on MBS rates and 10 to 15 basis points on Treasuries  from the supply effects alone  Those increases would be reinforced by the revision to  the Committee’s forward rate guidance, as that change would probably be seen as a  signal that the Committee now anticipates that it might begin tightening policy early  next year Although market participants currently see some chance of such an  outcome, most appear to expect policy tightening to commence no sooner than mid­ 2010 and probably later The decision to combine the revised expectations for the  funds rate with the reduced size of asset purchases might be seen as reinforcing the  message that the Committee clearly wants to move away from its accommodative  policy stance, and hence this announcement would probably lead to a significant  increase in yields on instruments with terms of six months or more   Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes, Mr Chairman  I wanted to note two things for the Committee on   the directive for B, which is on page 60 of the Bluebook  First of all, of course, the directive   would indicate now that the Desk is expected to purchase about $300 billion of Treasury   securities rather than “up to,” and it includes language indicating that the Desk is to gradually   slow the pace of purchases The other point I want to make is that the following sentence is a   little modified from the corresponding version in the previous directive  The previous directive   and the past few directives have indicated that the Committee anticipates that the combination of   outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of the Fed’s   balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months  With the liquidity facilities coming   down pretty significantly, I think that it doesn’t make sense to continue to describe them as   causing an increase in the balance sheet  So we have suggested deleting the reference in that   sentence to the liquidity facilities   Well, certainly we expect the purchases to continue to add to the   balance sheet That is laid out in our projections in the Bluebook   This is the monetary base that I am referring to, but as shown on   page 51 of the Bluebook, our baseline projections show growth of 97 percent in August, 116   percent in September, and 60 percent in October  So there is still pretty significant growth   overall   3  Thank you I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material  for Briefing on Proposed TAF and TSLF Schedules”  As noted in Brian Sack’s  briefing, conditions in short-term funding markets have improved somewhat further                         September 22–23, 2009 27 of 212  over the intermeeting period  As a result, the relative attractiveness of the Federal  Reserve’s lending facilities has declined, given the penalty-rate pricing of most of  those programs, and so usage of the facilities has continued to diminish  However,  the Federal Reserve still needs to make explicit decisions about the amounts of credit  offered under the two main auction-based liquidity programs, the TAF and the TSLF   As announced on June 25, the Federal Reserve has suspended schedule 1 TSLF and  TSLF Option Program operations and has reduced the size and frequency of TSLF  schedule 2 operations to one offering of $75 billion per month  The Federal Reserve  also has reduced the offered amounts under the TAF in three steps so far, from a peak  of $150 billion per auction to $75 billion per auction in September  Those reductions  in TAF auctions have been determined and announced one month at a time, based on  observation of auction results and assessments of market conditions   However, the staff believes that it would be desirable at this stage to formulate  and publish plans for the auction schedules and amounts to be offered over the period  through January These plans would incorporate a further reduction in liquidity  support over that period while still providing assurance to market participants that the  Federal Reserve will provide sufficient liquidity over year-end  By making its plans  explicit, the Federal Reserve would help reduce market uncertainty and would  provide market participants with sufficient time to arrange other sources of short-term  funding   The announced schedules should be designed to mesh with the Federal Reserve’s  overall plans for winding down its liquidity programs  As you know, most Federal  Reserve liquidity programs are set to expire on February 1  However, the TAF does  not have a fixed expiration date Indeed, when the TAF was first announced in  December 2007, the Federal Reserve suggested that consideration would be given to  making the facility permanent and indicated that public comment would be obtained  before any decision was made regarding the establishment of a permanent facility   The staff recommends initiating soon the process of seeking public comment on a  proposal for a permanent TAF  Subject to your comments and approval by the Board,  we would describe several possible TAF structures in the request for public comment   Those possible structures could range from a deactivated facility that was on the shelf  but ready for use if circumstances warranted to regular TAF auctions of a substantial  volume of funds  Several intermediate alternatives could also be described  The  notice would probably be published for a forty-five- or sixty-day public comment  period The staff anticipates that the Board would also seek input from Reserve Bank  Boards of Directors Based on the comments received, the Board would decide late  this year or early next year whether to establish a permanent TAF   Regardless of whether the TAF will become permanent, the near-term path of  TAF operations has to be decided The staff has developed proposed schedules for  TAF and TSLF auctions for the next four months; they are shown on the last page of  the package Both of these schedules involve considerable reductions in offered  amounts into January  As I’ll explain, the TAF schedule could be part of a transition                         September 22–23, 2009 28 of 212  to zero, low, or still sizable auctioned amounts  The proposed TSLF schedule is  designed to allow TSLF auctioned amounts to move down to zero by February,  consistent with the current expiration date for that program   As shown in the upper panel, the staff proposes that TAF auctions in the 28-day  cycle, the unshaded rows, be held steady at their current level of $75 billion each  through mid-January  The purpose of leaving those auction amounts unchanged for  the next few months is to provide substantial assurance of the availability of adequate  liquidity over year-end The current cycle of auctions of 84-day funds, the shaded  rows, would be modified in two ways  First, the terms would be reduced initially to  70 days and then to 42 days The purpose of shortening the terms is to align the  maturity dates with those of the 28-day auctions  And, second, the amounts of these  longer-term auctions would be reduced from the current level of $75 billion to  $25 billion in November, before those auctions are discontinued late this year   Beginning in December, the System would conduct only one auction per month, for  28-day funds By mid-January, a maximum of $75 billion of TAF funds would be  outstanding; TAF credit outstanding currently stands at just under $200 billion   Depending on the decision regarding a permanent TAF, that amount could  subsequently be brought down to zero or phased into the schedule for permanent TAF  operations   Some policymakers have expressed a view that the minimum bid rate for TAF  auctions should be increased from its current level of 25 basis points, equal to the  interest rate on excess reserves, in order to provide a penalty for using the facility  In  the staff’s view, a significant penalty is inconsistent with an auction facility, and it  would be incompatible with the effective operation of a permanent TAF  And with  bid amounts in TAF declining steadily and below amounts being offered in the  auctions, it is not clear that a penalty rate is currently necessary to discourage usage   Moreover, once offering amounts are reduced sufficiently, the auction rate should rise  above its minimum   The proposed TSLF schedule, shown in the lower panel, specifies that monthly  auctions will be reduced in two steps from the current level of $75 billion to  $25 billion by November  The offered amount would be held steady at $25 billion in  December and January  The term to maturity of the December 3 operation is planned  for 35 days so that the loans do not mature right at the beginning of January  TSLF  operations would cease in early February with the maturation of the January 7  auction, consistent with the facility’s already-announced expiration on February 1   A draft press release is included in your package  That document sets out the  proposed schedules and states that the Federal Reserve will soon request public  comment on a permanent TAF  It also indicates that the Federal Reserve would be  prepared to temporarily increase the sizes of TAF and TSLF operations or conduct  additional off-cycle operations with terms that span year-end if needed to address  transitory market strains                     September 22–23, 2009 29 of 212  Finally, I should note that we will need to coordinate adjustments to the TAF with   possible changes to the swap arrangements with foreign central banks  Brian Sack’s   and Nathan’s staffs will confer with foreign central banks to formulate plans for the   eventual elimination of exposures under the current swap arrangements  A related   issue, which we plan to raise for your consideration at the November meeting,   involves the advisability of establishing a set of permanent swap lines    That concludes the staff presentation We would be pleased to respond to your  questions   Well, I think the basic distinction that we see is the difference between a   standing facility and an auction facility  I’m defining a standing facility as one where the borrowing   institution comes to us seeking funds  We want to provide incentives for that bank or firm to find funds   in the open market before they come to us, and so we charge a penalty rate for that, which is consistent   with traditional central banking theory  By contrast, in the TAF and the TSLF, we’re trying, at least   conceptually, to place fixed amounts of dollars into the system, that is, make fixed amounts of dollars   available to the system and let the market set the price  If we set any significant penalty, we’d simply be   undercutting that attempt to provide the dollars into the market in fixed quantities  We’d be driving off   the borrowers                            September 22–23, 2009 37 of 212  Well, I think it’s fundamentally starting from a view that an auction   mechanism simply is not consistent with the penalty price   If I could just break in for a minute, Brian’s estimates are consistent   with our previous staff estimates, which were based on an event study methodology  That, by its   nature, should abstract from any effect due to changes in our financing of the securities  We   simply look at how much yields change during a narrow window of time in which   announcements of our purchases were made, and we got estimates very similar to those that   Brian did   That’s correct   It’s early next year  It’s in Bill’s chart   On further reflection, we thought it might make more sense just to   assume that the level was held up, because it is a possible tool for absorbing reserves in the   future   Just one additional comment, Mr Chairman  I think it would be   helpful, and I wasn’t sure what exactly President Lockhart’s question was directed at in the   following sense I think it’s useful to distinguish between the transition phase, where there will   be a very high level of reserve balances—and that may be over a matter of years—and the   subsequent long-run steady state for monetary policy implementation  They may involve two   fairly different approaches to implementing monetary policy  For instance, it may be the case   that the excess reserves rate does serve as the floor, or at least a soft floor, during the transition   phase, as the quantity of reserves is going down  But the Committee would have it at its   disposal, and the staff would come back to report to the Committee at some point on the   possibility of a number of different operating frameworks further in the future   Yes   I believe that’s correct, Mr Chairman  4  Thanks, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package   labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  This package   includes alternatives A and C as they were presented in the Bluebook and the revised   version of alternative B that was distributed on Monday    As was noted in the staff briefings and in your discussion so far, the economic  outlook has improved further  Data on business investment have been stronger than  expected, and incoming information on home prices, home sales, and housing starts  points to a recovery in this sector  Also, financial market conditions have continued  to become more supportive of growth  Over the intermeeting period, interest rates  have moved lower, stock prices have climbed, and the exchange value of the dollar  has depreciated further, providing additional impetus to aggregate demand   Moreover, indicators of market functioning have either held steady or improved  further The stronger outlook for economic activity has been reflected in substantial  upward revisions to all of the staff estimates of short-run r*, including a ¾ percentage  point increase in the Greenbook-consistent measure derived from the FRB/US model    Still, these r* measures remain negative, and despite the positive economic   developments, the forecasted trajectory of economic activity and employment   remains quite weak  In the staff forecast, which is conditioned on an unchanged   federal funds target range through the projection period, the unemployment rate               September 22–23, 2009 136 of 212  declines only to 9¼ percent by the end of next year and to about 8 percent by the end  of 2011 The output gap remains correspondingly wide, with real GDP still  3½ percent below its potential in the fourth quarter of 2011  Although fairly stable  inflation expectations are expected to restrain movements in inflation, the substantial  output gap is still projected to push PCE inflation down to 1 percent in 2011, below  the inflation objectives implied by FOMC participants’ longer-run projections  Given  this outlook, the counterfactual optimal control simulation in the Bluebook that does  not impose the zero lower bound constraint would call for a reduction in the federal  funds rate to minus 4 percent, if that were possible  With the funds rate constrained at  zero, the optimal control simulations suggest that the funds rate should remain at zero  until 2012 Similarly, simulations of the FRB/US model using the outcome-based  policy rule prescribe holding the funds rate at zero for nearly two full years before  policy firming begins    Of course, significant risks—both to the upside and the downside—attend the  forecast, as your comments so far have underscored  On the one hand, the Greenbook  noted that the very low current levels of household and business investment suggest  the risk of a greater-than-anticipated rebound in spending  On the other hand, the  Greenbook pointed to the possibility of a further increase in the personal saving rate  as well as to the risk of greater financial headwinds  Certainly, the incoming  information from the banking sector, with exceedingly weak growth in bank credit  and evidence that banks continue to tighten lending terms, suggests persistent  restraint for the foreseeable future on spending by households and firms that are  dependent on bank credit   Against this background, the Bluebook once again presented a set of alternatives  that provided a wide range of choices for policymakers  Under alternative A, the  Committee would increase its large-scale asset purchases; under alternative B, the  Committee would maintain the existing maximum sizes of its purchases; and under  alternative C, the Committee would trim back its purchases  The alternatives also  differ somewhat in the language of the statement   The Committee might be inclined to adopt alternative A, page 2 in the package, if  it judged that, despite the improved outlook, the expected outcomes for output and  employment were not satisfactory or that the downside risks to that outlook were  unacceptably large The Committee’s statement would again indicate that economic  activity is leveling out and would note that conditions in financial markets have  improved somewhat further  However, the language in the first paragraph would cite  factors that could restrain economic growth and indicate that, absent further policy  action, the recovery could be relatively weak, with slack in resource utilization  diminishing quite slowly  To promote a sustained economic recovery and higher  resource utilization, the Committee would increase its planned purchases of agency  mortgage-backed securities by $250 billion to $15 trillion and extend these purchases  through the second quarter of 2010 Staff estimates suggest that this action might  lower longer-term interest rates by 15 to 30 basis points and reduce the  unemployment rate two years ahead by as much as ¼ percentage point below a                       September 22–23, 2009 137 of 212  baseline outlook The statement would continue to express the view that economic  conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for  an extended period As shown by the red text toward the end of alternative A, this  draft incorporates the suggestion that the more explicit phrase “low levels of resource  utilization and subdued inflation” be substituted for the vaguer “economic conditions”  in explaining the Committee’s expectation that the federal funds rate will remain very  low for a protracted period   If the Committee instead judged that the current maximum amounts of its large- scale asset purchases reasonably balanced the various risks confronting the economy,  it might be inclined toward alternative B, page 3  Under this alternative, the  Committee would also maintain its forward guidance regarding the funds rate  With  these policy choices largely expected by the market, an announcement of alternative  B seems unlikely to have much effect on market prices   The first paragraph of alternative B would present a somewhat more upbeat  picture of economic developments than that of alternative A It would note, for  example, that economic activity has picked up, albeit from a severe downturn, and  would attribute part of that improvement to the housing sector  However, as in  August, the Committee would also say that household spending remains constrained  by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight  credit The statement would note that business investment and employment are still  declining, but at a slower pace  The statement would indicate that past policy actions  and market forces will support a “strengthening,” rather than a “resumption,” of  economic growth, thus suggesting that the Committee now sees a recovery as having  begun, and would note that these factors would contribute to higher levels of resource  utilization   Paragraph 2 of alternative B would state that substantial resource slack and stable  inflation expectations should help keep inflation subdued for some time  We  suggested the revised language shown in blue in place of language included in the  Bluebook, because, upon further reflection, it seemed best not to implicitly suggest  uncertainty about whether or not inflation expectations are well anchored by using the  word “apparently,” which was included in the Bluebook draft   Under alternative B, the Committee would maintain the existing maximum  amounts for its large-scale asset purchases, but it would shift back the completion  date for these transactions either to the end of the first quarter or to sometime in the  second quarter If the Committee wanted maximum optionality regarding its  purchases, it might retain the current “up to” language shown in blue brackets and  extend the period of purchases into the second quarter  The longer time period for  these purchases, along with the “up to” language, would provide the Committee more  time to decide to scale back or end these purchases before the full $125 trillion were  purchased The Committee might find this flexibility valuable if it saw a significant  chance that economic conditions ultimately would not warrant buying the full  amounts  Alternatively, members might see this flexibility as useful if they saw                            September 22–23, 2009 138 of 212  significant risks regarding the Committee’s capacity to eventually execute an exit  strategy with very high reserve balances  Arguably, extending the completion date  into the second quarter would also allow the Committee more flexibility to increase  purchases in the second quarter in order to provide more stimulus in the event that the  economic recovery flags; that is, it might be easier to ramp up purchases in the second  quarter from a low level rather than from a program that had come to an end   The cost of this flexibility would be less certainty in the markets about the  ultimate size and duration of Committee’s asset purchases and so somewhat higher  mortgage and other long-term interest rates than if you committed to the maximum  purchase size If instead you fully expect to purchase the current maximum amounts  and want to give market participants confidence that your MBS purchases will not  fall short of their expectations in order to maximize the effectiveness of your  purchases, you could drop the two words in brackets  As a memo from Brian Sack  and his colleagues indicated, the Desk recommends tapering through the end of the  first quarter, given the current maximum amount of MBS purchases of $125 trillion   I should note that, in the sentence on tapering and timing, we recommended changing  “its purchases” to “these purchases” to make clear that the specified completion date  of either the first quarter or the second quarter applies only to the current purchase  programs, not to some possible future program   A relatively small issue  The first sentence of paragraph 3 recognizes that various  Federal Reserve liquidity programs have been closed or are being wound down by no  longer referring to “all available tools”  The Committee may wish to consider  whether the adjective “wide” should be used to describe the range of tools being used  to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability  There is some chance that  a change to just “a range of tools” might be read by observers as signaling that the  Federal Reserve was pulling back more sharply from its support programs than the  revision in language was intended to suggest   But the Committee might see the recent stronger-than-expected economic data as  indicating that buying less than the full $125 trillion of MBS is desirable and thus see  alternative C, page 4, as appropriate Alternatively, members might be inclined  toward alternative C if they were particularly concerned about the possible  implications of very high reserve balances for inflation expectations or for actual  monetary stimulus In that vein, a decision to purchase less than the previously  specified maximum amounts might also be motivated by concern that the Treasury  will not rapidly rebuild balances in the SFP even after the debt ceiling is lifted, thus  injecting more reserves into the banking system than the Committee had anticipated   In comparison with alternative B, the first paragraph of alternative C would give  less emphasis to remaining economic weaknesses and downside risks  The statement  would also put less stress on resource utilization and suggest less of a role for slack in  restraining inflation  Under this alternative, the Committee would indicate its  intention to purchase about $1 trillion of mortgage-backed securities and about  $150 billion of agency debt, less than the current $125 trillion and $200 billion             September 22–23, 2009 139 of 212  maximum amounts  These purchases would be tapered and completed by the end of   this year The Committee would also revise its forward rate guidance to indicate that   the funds rate would be kept at its current exceptionally low level only so long as   inflation remains well contained and only until the Committee has greater assurance   that the economic recovery will be sustained  With investors apparently coming to   the conclusion recently that exceptional policy accommodation will indeed be   maintained for a protracted period, market participants would be quite surprised by a   statement along the lines of alternative C, and, as discussed yesterday, interest rates   would likely jump noticeably    For your reference, the table on the next page summarizes the alternatives, and  draft directives are provided on the final pages  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I have some suggested wording for that   But before we get to that, could I ask about paragraph 2?   Are we taking that as it is here or not?        September 22–23, 2009 184 of 212  Mr Chairman, perhaps I could refer everybody to page 3 of my   briefing materials and make sure that everybody agrees on what’s being changed  No change to   paragraph 1 No change to paragraph 2 In paragraph 3  inclusion of the word “wide;” several   lines down, deletion of the phrase “up to;” a few more lines down, substitution of the word   “executed” for “completed” just before the bracket, and inclusion of the phrase “by the end of   the first quarter” No other changes, I believe, to the statement   Mr Chairman, on the directive   I’m on page 8 of my handout, directive 4, alternative B  To reflect the   use of the word “execute” in the statement, in the middle of the paragraph I’d suggest that we   break the sentence beginning “the Desk is expected” into two sentences so that the first sentence   would end at “after the end of October”  That is, “The Desk is expected to complete purchases   of about $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of October,” period  “It is   also expected to execute purchases of up to $200 billion in housing-related agency debt and   about $125 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first quarter”  That applies “execute” to   both debt and MBS, but I don’t think that’s a problem    Yes   President Lockhart, I think our view is that the primary tool will be the   interest on reserves rate But the experience to date leads us to have some doubts as to whether   that will put a hard floor on the federal funds rate  So we’re presuming that we will, in order to   harden that floor, need to take at least some reserves out of the system  Whether or not we will   have to take a whole lot out at this point isn’t clear, but it is possible we might have to  That is   why we have been working on a number of tools   That’s possible Well, of course, pre-crisis, obviously, we didn’t have   interest on reserves And so we have only very limited experience as to what the parameters will   need to be in terms of the excess reserves rate and draining reserves to hit a particular fed funds   rate target  2  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for  Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Exhibit 1 depicts the broad  contours of your projections for 2009 to 2012 and over the longer run  Most of you  continue to project a protracted economic recovery, with the unemployment rate  declining slowly and inflation remaining subdued over the next few years  Based on  your accompanying narratives, most of you anticipate that about five to six years will  be needed for the economy to converge fully to its longer-run path  However, some   of you stated that the convergence process might well require seven or eight years,  while a few of you expect inflation to reach its longer-run rate in just a few years but  anticipate that the convergence process for the real economy could take somewhat  longer   Exhibit 2 reports summary statistics regarding your projections for 2009  Your  previous projections—collected in conjunction with the June FOMC meeting—are  provided in italics, and Greenbook forecasts are included as a memo item  Your  current projections for real GDP growth this year have a central tendency of about  minus ½ percent to zero, around a percentage point higher than in June  The GDP  decline during the first half was a bit sharper than most of you expected at the time of  the June meeting, which took place a few weeks before the BEA’s publication of its  preliminary second quarter release and its substantial downward revision for first  quarter Regarding the second half, most of you now anticipate 3 to 3½ percent real  GDP growth, a couple of percentage points higher than the central tendency of your  projections last June Some of you noted that the recent pickup in economic activity  was importantly influenced by transitory government programs such as “cash-for­ clunkers” and the first-time-homebuyer tax credit                   November 3–4, 2009 63 of 201  Your projections for the fourth-quarter average unemployment rate are about the  same as those made in June, and your forecasts for inflation for the year as a whole  are also little changed However, for the first half of 2009, overall and core inflation  came in somewhat lower than most of you had anticipated  For the second half, most  of you revised up your forecasts for overall inflation, probably reflecting at least in  part the recent increase in energy prices, and many of you shaded up your forecasts  for core inflation   Exhibit 3 tabulates the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for  calendar years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run  The broad contours of  these projections are much the same as in June  Most of you anticipate that real GDP  will increase 2½ to 3½ percent in 2010 and then accelerate by about a percentage  point to about 3½ to 4½ percent in 2011, with growth remaining brisk in 2012  A few  of you made modest revisions to your estimates regarding the longer-run sustainable  rate of GDP growth, but the central tendency of longer-run growth projections is  virtually unchanged at 2½ to 2¾ percent   Most of your unemployment rate projections for 2010 and 2011 moved down a  notch since June, perhaps reflecting stronger near-term growth, but nearly all of you  still expect the unemployment rate to remain above 8 percent in the fourth quarter of  2011 Moreover, nearly half of you made upward revisions to your projections  regarding the rate of unemployment that is sustainable over the longer run; the central  tendency for these projections now stands at 5 to 5¼ percent, roughly ¼ percentage  point higher than in June   As in June, most of you see the outlook for inflation as subdued over the next  several years Your projections for total PCE inflation next year have a central  tendency of about 1¼ to 1½ percent, a bit above the central tendency of your core  inflation forecasts, perhaps reflecting lingering effects of increased energy prices   Most of you see total and core inflation next year running noticeably below the 1¾ to  2 percent central tendency of your longer-run inflation projections, shown to the right  for total inflation Over 2011 and 2012, your inflation projections exhibit  considerable dispersion, with a central tendency of roughly 1 to 2 percent and, by  2012, a range of about ¼ to 2¼ percent This dispersion apparently reflects  substantial differences in your views of the determinants of inflation and, to a degree,  differences in your estimates of economic slack  Perhaps the staff briefing on  inflation dynamics at the December meeting and the subsequent Committee  discussion will further elucidate the reasons for these divergences   The left panels of exhibit 4 indicate that nearly all of you continue to view the  degree of uncertainty surrounding your projections of both output growth and  inflation as high compared with historical norms  In your narratives, some of you cite  continuing vulnerabilities in the financial sector as reasons for this elevated  uncertainty, while others highlight the uncertainties associated with fiscal stimulus  and persistent budget deficits As shown in the right-hand panels, nearly all of you  now judge that the risks to output growth are roughly balanced, with a sharp drop           November 3–4, 2009 64 of 201  since June in the number who see the risks tilted to the downside  Most of you also   continue to view the risks to the inflation outlook, the lower right-hand panel, as   roughly balanced However, a few of you see the prospect of protracted economic   slack as tilting the inflation risks to the downside, while a few others point to the   challenges in managing the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, and possible adverse   effects of fiscal policy on inflation expectations, as skewing those risks to the upside    That concludes our presentation, Mr Chairman      Yes, Mr Chairman  Yesterday we reported that TALF loans declined   10 percent over the intermeeting period because of repayments of TALF loans  That decline   actually applied to TALF loans backed by ABS  We want to note that the decline in TALF loans   backed by ABS was offset by an increase in TALF loans backed by CMBS  So, on balance, over   the intermeeting period, TALF loans were flat  3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package  labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  This package  includes the revised versions of the draft policy statements that were distributed on  Monday, with one small further change to alternative B shown in blue, and a  correspondingly updated version of the sequence of policy statements and actions that  was discussed in the Bluebook   As I noted yesterday, the forecasts that you provided for this round indicate that  most of you anticipate the economic recovery over the next several years to be  protracted, even more so than in the Greenbook  The central tendencies of your  projections of real GDP growth for 2010, 2011, and 2012 are on the low side of the  corresponding Greenbook forecasts  As a result, you generally see even slower  progress than the staff in reducing unemployment over the next several years; 12 of  you see the unemployment rate remaining at or above 7 percent three years ahead,  above the forecast in the Greenbook extension of 61 percent  Although many of you  edged up your estimate of the sustainable rate of unemployment, nearly all of you  estimate that rate to be no more than 5¼ percent, suggesting that you see considerable  slack persisting for years   While some policymakers again noted in their forecast narratives that they view   the linkage between slack and inflation as weak, others anticipate that the                    November 3–4, 2009 125 of 201  underutilization of resources will put further downward pressure on inflation  In any  case, the central tendency of your inflation forecasts remains within a range of 1 to  2 percent over the next several years  Most of you again indicated a view that, with  appropriate monetary policy, inflation would be about 1¾ to 2 percent in the longer  run Thus, most of you continue to expect that inflation over the next several years  will be on the low side of what you see as the mandate-consistent rate of inflation   The Committee might see this combination of substantial, persistent resource  slack and very low inflation as motivation for adopting alternative A, page 2 of your  package, at this meeting  Under this alternative, the Committee would apply  additional monetary policy stimulus by increasing its purchases of agency mortgage- backed securities to $15 trillion, and it would retain the existing maximum of  $200 billion for its agency debt purchases In order to accomplish the increased MBS  purchases and the substantial agency debt transactions without placing undue  pressures on the associated markets, these programs would be extended through the  second quarter Staff estimates suggest that the increase in MBS purchases might  lower longer-term rates 15 to 30 basis points—although, admittedly, these estimates  are subject to considerable uncertainty  Such a decline in yields might provide  sufficient stimulus to aggregate demand to reduce the unemployment rate two years  ahead by as much as ¼ percentage point relative to the rate that would otherwise  prevail   The Committee’s statement would explain the decision to provide additional  stimulus by noting that restraints on consumer spending and business spending  suggest that the economic recovery will be relatively weak and that slack in resource  utilization will diminish quite slowly absent further policy action and by highlighting  that inflation has already fallen considerably over the past year  To make very clear  that the Committee did not anticipate raising rates at all for quite some time, the  statement would indicate that “the Committee will maintain the target range for the  federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that low rates of  resource utilization, subdued inflation, and stable inflation expectations are likely to  warrant this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate for an extended  period”   If the Committee instead saw its current policy stance as appropriately balancing  the risks to growth and inflation and, in particular, as balancing the costs and benefits  of large-scale asset purchases, it might be inclined toward adoption at this meeting of  alternative B, shown on page 3 Even though policymakers generally anticipate a  slow and protracted economic recovery, appreciable and persistent resource slack,  and low inflation, the Committee might believe that continuing to stay its hand at this  meeting is appropriate  According to your economic forecasts, many of you no  longer see the risks to economic growth as skewed significantly to the downside   And although you generally also see the risks to inflation as balanced, many of you  are still quite uncertain about the inflation outlook  Even with an assessment that the  risks to the inflation outlook are balanced, at this stage you might see the potential  costs of providing additional stimulus—including possible adverse effects on                      November 3–4, 2009 126 of 201  inflation expectations and incrementally greater challenges in implementing an exit  strategy—as outweighing the potential benefits in terms of a reduction in economic  slack and an inflation rate closer to your objective   Under alternative B, you would leave the settings on your policy instruments  essentially unchanged, making no adjustments to your federal funds rate target range  or your MBS purchase amounts and no major modifications to your forward guidance  or agency debt purchases The first two paragraphs of the statement would largely  repeat the language used in September  The statement would indicate that economic  activity continues to pick up and that conditions in financial markets have been  roughly unchanged over the intermeeting period  The Committee would again  mention that various factors are likely to continue to restrain household and business  spending and that, consequently, economic activity would probably be weak for a  time, but the statement would still note that past policy actions and market forces are  likely to support a strengthening of economic growth  In paragraph 2, the Committee  would once more note that resource slack and stable inflation expectations were likely  to keep inflation subdued for some time   The Committee would continue to indicate in the third paragraph that economic  conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for  an extended period However, using new language, the Committee would specify  that those economic conditions include low rates of resource utilization, subdued  inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations  By referring to economic  conditions generally and by citing three factors that are included in the set of  conditions, the Committee would make clear that these three factors would not  necessarily be the sole triggers for changes in the Committee’s policy stance  Also,  by referring to “subdued inflation trends,” this version would avoid implying that the  Committee would necessarily respond to short-term changes in realized inflation  rates, which could be driven by factors such as transitory fluctuations in energy price  inflation   Under alternative B, the Committee would indicate that it decided to purchase  about $175 billion of agency debt securities, somewhat less than the previously  announced maximum of $200 billion  The Committee might believe that it was  unlikely to purchase the full $200 billion maximum amount; after allowing for some  tapering, the Desk’s current pace of purchases is consistent with total purchases of  around $175 billion between now and the end of the first quarter of next year   Relative to the language circulated on Monday, we suggested a small additional  revision to help clarify that this was the Committee’s motivation for making the  change Although market participants generally do not anticipate that the Committee  will alter its plans for agency debt purchases, the contemplated adjustment is small   Moreover, the overall announcement appears to be broadly in line with market  expectations and thus seems unlikely to prompt a sizable market reaction   Under alternative C, page 4, the Committee would reduce the degree of monetary  accommodation by scaling back its large-scale asset purchases at this meeting  The                   November 3–4, 2009 127 of 201  Committee might be inclined to adopt this alternative if it saw the recovery as now  reasonably well established and was not especially concerned that slack might push  inflation to excessively low levels The Committee might also be motivated to adopt  this approach if were concerned that it might have difficulty reversing its  accommodative policy stance at the appropriate time or, possibly, if it were worried  that very substantial amounts of liquidity in the financial system might already be in  the process of causing significant distortions in asset prices   In the first paragraph of the announcement for alternative C, the Committee  would indicate that an economic recovery appears to be under way  The statement  would note that household spending appears to be expanding, without citing the list of  possible restraints that are referenced in alternative B, and would mention that  businesses appear to have made additional progress in bringing inventories into better  alignment with sales  The second paragraph would express the expectation that, with  appropriate monetary policy adjustments, inflation will remain at levels consistent  with price stability, thereby acknowledging an active role for policymakers in  influencing the inflation outlook In the third paragraph, the Committee would note  that it anticipates maintaining “low,” rather than “exceptionally low,” levels of the  funds rate and “for some time,” rather than “for an extended period”  Clearly, these  two changes would be read by market participants as suggesting that the Committee  was beginning to think seriously about raising short-term interest rates  The  Committee would back up those changes in words with action—reductions in its  large-scale asset purchases, to $11 trillion of MBS and $160 billion of agency debt   It would also indicate an intention to complete those purchases by January rather than  March These changes would directly reduce support for those asset classes and their  close substitutes, and it would also significantly reduce the accumulation of reserves  in the banking system relative to that of alternative B  With market participants not  anticipating any significant change in policy settings at this meeting, the combination  of the change in wording and the reduction in asset purchases under this alternative  would likely trigger an appreciable backup in market interest rates   The Bluebook also provided for your consideration an illustrative sequence of  policy language and actions going forward That sequence, modified slightly to  reflect the changes we have made to the draft policy alternatives, is included on the  next couple of pages of the package Key portions of the policy alternatives for  today’s meeting are shown in step 2 Depending on how conditions unfold, language  similar to that in step 2 for either alternative A or alternative B could be repeated for  several meetings  If the Committee were to adopt alternative A or alternative B  today, at some future meeting, once the economic recovery is viewed as sufficiently  established, the Committee might consider modifying its guidance to refer to the  maintenance of either “low” or “exceptionally low” levels of the federal funds rate  and “for some time,” rather than “for an extended period,” as in step 3  If the  Committee instead selects alternative C at this meeting, it would have already  adopted the “for some time” language proposed for step 3                      November 3–4, 2009 128 of 201  Once the situation has progressed to the point that the Committee has concluded  that policy firming would soon be appropriate, it might consider a number of changes  to its policy language and forward guidance  For example, as shown in step 4, the  Committee might want to indicate that “some” or “a gradual” “reduction in the  exceptionally large degree of monetary accommodation will be appropriate before  long” The following sentence could note that such tightening would be conditioned  on economic and financial circumstances but still provide somewhat more specificity  about the Committee’s sense of when that reduction might be initiated—for example,  by narrowing it down to a half-year interval  The remainder of the paragraph would  discuss the tools that the Federal Reserve anticipated using to accomplish this  reduction, including increases in the rate of interest on reserves, reverse repos, and  term deposits for banks  It could also indicate that, although the Federal Reserve  currently does not have plans to sell assets from its portfolio, it retains the option of  such sales   An example of the language that could accompany a decision to commence policy  firming is shown as the fifth step  Here we have assumed that the Committee retains  a target range for the federal funds rate, at least initially  We have further assumed  that the discount rate and the interest rate on reserves would be raised  commensurately with the increase in the federal funds rate target  In the example, the  Committee would direct the Desk to use reverse repos to reduce the quantity of  excess reserves in the banking system to reinforce the upward pressure on short-term  interest rates; however, it is also possible that the Committee might decide to drain  reserves from the banking system before it raised its target range for the federal funds  rate The Committee could indicate its intention to “further” or “gradually” reduce  the still-exceptional degree of monetary accommodation in subsequent months  The  statement could again indicate the tools that might be employed to execute this  reduction and reiterate that asset sales could also be employed   Of course, the Committee’s exit strategy potentially has many moving parts, and  at this stage the exact combination and sequence in which these tools would be used  is not entirely clear Thus, we emphasized in the Bluebook that these drafts should be  viewed only as illustrative Nonetheless, they might be helpful to the Committee in  considering how its near-term policy decisions might fit into a broader plan for  ultimately removing policy accommodation  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Yes That certainly seems as though it is worth further thought and   discussion And I don’t have a definite answer for you at this point  One disadvantage of   proceeding in that direction might be that market participants would wonder what happened to   the target funds rate range and why the Committee didn’t set one  And it would seem that we   would need to explain why we didn’t set one   Yes, President Lockhart, that was our thought—that by referencing   primarily economic conditions and then including a subordinate set of phrases, these specific   items, those would not be necessarily the only factors that could lead to a change in the target   range   That was our thought   And we do continue that work   Well, that was the distinction  Alternative A just pins it down more   tightly than B does, but it may not be an important—   Well, just as an example, and this may or may not be a good example,   the value of the dollar was mentioned earlier as a possible consideration in making monetary   policy The revised language was intended just to loosen things up a bit so that it was not solely   these three factors that would necessarily drive policy decisions   Well, it is not an absolute commitment  It is an expectation But apart   from that distinction—yes              November 3–4, 2009 132 of 201  Well, I don’t certainly see it as referencing a secret  Clearly, these   three factors that we list explicitly are very important factors in governing the stance in policy    But, again, this is simply intended to allow for the possibility that something else might incline   the Committee to adjust its policy even without a significant change in these three items   Go ahead, Brian   I agree I think our sense is that overall the statement is not likely to   have much of a market impact    But our view is that this is obviously a sensitive topic, so it might be   better to hold off on that for several weeks   Right No, I’m sorry, I’m talking about discussions with the boards of   directors   Indeed, the TDFs would be less liquid, because they can’t be sold  3  Thanks, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package   labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  This package   includes the draft policy statements for alternatives A, B, and C as they appeared in   the Bluebook    Your policy decision today takes place against a backdrop of a gradual but fairly   steady improvement in financial conditions and in the economic outlook  As David   noted yesterday, the staff’s forecast for economic growth in the fourth quarter has   been revised up noticeably And the staff sees the rate of expansion picking up steam                    December 15–16, 2009 101 of 247  over the next couple of years, reaching 4½ percent in 2011  Moreover, as noted  yesterday, some of you see the downside risks to the forecast as continuing to ebb,  extending a trend evident in your most recent quarterly forecasts  Nonetheless,  resource slack seems likely to remain substantial for some time  In the Greenbook  forecast, that slack, together with stable inflation expectations, pushes inflation down  to about 1 percent by the end of the forecast period     With output seen as tracking well below its potential over the next few years and  inflation projected to be edging further below the level that policymakers prefer over  the intermediate term, the Committee might be dissatisfied with the outlook and  believe that it could improve economic outcomes by providing additional policy  stimulus  The Committee might also see additional stimulus as warranted in order to  guard against the lingering risk that spending, output, and employment could fall well  short of the baseline outlook—for example, because financial market conditions  could relapse as a range of government support programs are withdrawn over the next  few months  Under alternative A, page 2 of the package, the Committee would  provide additional stimulus by boosting its purchases of agency mortgage-backed  securities from the currently planned amount of $125 trillion to $15 trillion  In order  to accomplish the increase in purchases without putting undue strain on the MBS  market, the Committee would extend the time frame for these transactions through  the end of the second quarter Planned purchases of agency debt securities would  stay at $175 billion The Committee would also leave its target range for the federal  funds rate unchanged at 0 to ¼ percent  But it would alter its forward guidance  slightly to indicate that it anticipated that economic conditions would warrant this  exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate—that is, 0 to ¼ percent—for an  extended period of time, thus underscoring the “low for long” message  Market  participants appear to see little likelihood of an increase in asset purchases, and thus  staff estimates suggest that a $250 billion increase in MBS purchases might lower  longer-term rates by 10 to 25 basis points and, through that channel, reduce the  unemployment rate two years ahead by a tenth or two of a percentage point relative to  the rate that would otherwise prevail     If the Committee instead believes that, in current circumstances, additional  monetary policy stimulus would not be helpful on balance, it might prefer to adopt  the policy actions and language of alternative B, page 3  For example, even though  the outlook for real activity and employment may be unsatisfactory, policymakers  might also believe they cannot take for granted that inflation expectations are tightly  moored and worry that expanding asset purchases further could push inflation  expectations upward Also, despite significant strides in developing reserve  management tools, the Committee still might be unsure about their likely  effectiveness  If so, the Committee might think that the risks entailed in a further  increase of asset purchases and the associated expansion of the balance sheet and  reserves could outweigh the potential benefits   Under alternative B, the Committee would leave unchanged at this meeting the  amounts and timing of its large-scale asset purchases as well as its target range for the           December 15–16, 2009 102 of 247  federal funds rate The first paragraph of the announcement would set the stage for  this decision by again noting that economic activity is picking up and by adding that  the deterioration in labor markets is abating  In view of the continued advance in  equity prices over the intermeeting period and further declines in various private  borrowing rates, the paragraph would note that financial markets have become more  supportive of economic growth  The inflation paragraph would continue to mention  that the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time  And the  third paragraph would again indicate that the Committee continues to anticipate that  economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation  trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels  of the federal funds rate for an extended period   The most significant change relative to the November statement would be the  inclusion of the last paragraph  In September and November, your statements noted  that “the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote  economic recovery and price stability”  That followed your indications, expressed  since last December, that the Federal Reserve would be using “all available tools”   With the LSAPs scheduled to wind down over the next few months, usage of many of  the liquidity facilities dwindling or already at zero, and authorizations for many of the  facilities currently extending only through February 1 and apparently likely to expire  at that time, the Committee will soon need to make some adjustment to the “wide  range” sentence Under alternative B, that sentence would be dropped today, and the  Committee and the Board would indicate their anticipation that most of the Federal  Reserve’s liquidity facilities will expire on February 1  This statement would  reference the June announcement that indicated that “should the recent improvements  in market conditions continue, the Board and the FOMC currently anticipate that a  number of these facilities may not need to be extended beyond February 1”  The  paragraph would indicate specifically that the AMLF, the CPFF, the PDCF, and the  TSLF were likely to be closed on February 1  It would also note that the Federal  Reserve would be working with its foreign central bank counterparties to wind down  the temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1  It would further indicate  that the Federal Reserve expected to scale back amounts provided under the TAF, and  it would indicate that the anticipated expiration dates for the TALF remain  unchanged Importantly, the final sentence would note that the Federal Reserve is  prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and  economic growth   Market participants generally appear to expect that today’s statement will  encompass relatively few changes from November’s, more or less along the lines of  the first three paragraphs of this alternative  The inclusion of the fourth paragraph  would probably come as a modest surprise, and, if anything, it might suggest a  slightly greater inclination to initiate policy firming than market participants expect   However, given that most market participants appear to expect the facilities to close  on February 1, given the retention of the key “extended period” language, and given  the maintenance of the existing LSAP amounts, it seems unlikely that the fourth                            December 15–16, 2009 103 of 247  paragraph would cause the statement to prompt any significant market reaction on  net   Another option, perhaps, would be to separate the fourth paragraph from the  Committee’s monetary policy statement and publish it on a standalone basis  sometime in the next few days  Indeed, over the past two years, the Federal Reserve  has generally issued announcements related to liquidity facilities separately from  FOMC statements  However, that practice was driven importantly by the timing of  decisions on liquidity facilities, which did not necessarily align with FOMC meetings   It was also driven by the need to coordinate statements with foreign central banks,  which generally made it impossible to release these announcements along with the  FOMC’s policy statement  In the current situation, we understand that foreign central  banks do not feel the need to coordinate with a statement referencing the likely  termination of the swap lines on February 1, so there would seem to be little need for  delay on that score Perhaps also arguing for inclusion in today’s statement is the  point that, if the paragraph were to be released separately sometime in the next few  days, the announcement today would still need to be modified somehow to  foreshadow that possibility and so not blindside market participants  That  modification obviously would be noticed and suggest that something was afoot   The Committee could also couple this paragraph with alternative C, page 4   Under this alternative, the Committee would begin to reduce the degree of monetary  policy stimulus at this meeting  The Committee might be motivated to take this  action now if it did not anticipate that economic slack would be providing much  restraint on inflation and was concerned that a large amount of stimulus is in train and  risks eventually driving inflation upward, perhaps in part because of an effect on  inflation expectations of the very large and growing Federal Reserve balance sheet   In providing the background for this action, the first paragraph of the statement for  alternative C would generally be similar to that for alternative B, but it would not cite  the list of factors restraining household spending or the continued cutback in business  fixed investment  The second paragraph would note the Committee’s expectation that  inflation will remain at levels consistent with price stability, but it would base that  expectation primarily on appropriate monetary policy adjustments rather than the  substantial resource slack that is cited as an important factor under alternative B  The  Committee would retain for now its target range of 0 to ¼ percent for the federal  funds rate, but it would indicate an expectation that economic conditions are likely to  warrant “low levels,” rather than “exceptionally low levels,” of the federal funds rate  for some time, rather than for an extended period  Moreover, in view of continued  improvements in financial markets and the economic outlook, the Committee would  indicate that it decided to cap its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities at  $11 trillion and its purchases of agency debt at $160 billion   Of course, market participants do not appear to anticipate a statement along the  lines of alternative C Even without the final paragraph, the adjustment of the  forward guidance and the reduction in asset purchases would come as a considerable  surprise to market participants and would suggest that the Committee was preparing              December 15–16, 2009 104 of 247  to begin to firm its policy stance relatively soon  As Brian Sack noted yesterday, a   Desk survey indicated that most primary dealers believe that the Committee will   remove the “extended period” reference at least three meetings before commencing   tightening So quite possibly market participants might see a shift to an expectation   that rates would remain low only “for some time” as suggesting that the Committee   might begin to raise its target for the funds rate in the spring, say, at the March   meeting  Interest rates would likely jump markedly in response to this information,   prompting an increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a drop in equity   prices The inclusion of the fourth paragraph on closing the facilities would amplify   the message that the Federal Reserve was now moving quickly toward a significant   tightening of policy Thank you, Mr Chairman    I think that presumably would be interpreted simply as “the Federal   Reserve has nothing new to report for the TALF”              December 15–16, 2009 140 of 247  There’s just one change, Mr Chairman  My understanding is that   we’re adding to the fourth sentence at the end of the first clause another clause, so after the   words “slower pace” we add, comma, “and remain reluctant to add to payrolls” and then semi­  colon There are no other changes to alternative B as it appears on page 3  Also, the   Committee’s vote will be covering the directive on page 8 of the handout     Or it would involve adjusting the quantity of reserves sufficiently   January 26–27, 2010 21 of 260     There has been at least some evidence in the financial crisis that   50 basis points could be enough to achieve the goals  You may remember a little chart in the   January 26–27, 2010 26 of 260    memo that illustrated that it was only when the spread was reduced to 25 basis points that   borrowing really began to move up a lot    Governor Duke, I think we see that primarily as a consequence of the   very large level of reserves in the system and the fact that they have IOER as an outlet for their   funds or a place where they can leave their funds and earn interest because bank borrowing from   January 26–27, 2010 28 of 260    the discount window is relatively infrequent  And we have assumed it will become even more   infrequent  I think at the margin that does not have much effect on their willingness to lend to   one another because it is set at a penalty  So it is not a source of funds to lend to other banks     If I could add something, directionally I think we would agree with   you that clearly we are putting upward pressure on rates by doing this  But I am presuming that   the Committee would not want to use these tools to push the fed funds rate above the upper limit   of its existing 0 to 25 basis point range, for instance, at least initially; that its purpose might be to   push it up to the vicinity of the upper end of the range, and that is only something on the order of   15 basis points or less  So at least as viewed through the lens of overnight rates, the magnitude   of the increase would likely not be very much initially    Overnight rates would presumably be limited to something like 12 to   15 basis points because you wouldn’t be trying to push the fed funds rate above your currently   existing target of 0 to 25 basis points, I’m assuming    I don’t think we would disagree with that  In recent months as the fed   funds rate has ticked down, even as the Committee has kept its target range for the fed funds rate   January 26–27, 2010 48 of 260    the same, in some sense that’s been a slight easing of monetary policy  So it’s the mirror image   of that  4  I will be referring to the separate package labeled “Material   for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Exhibit 1 depicts the   broad contours of your projections for 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run    These contours are little changed from those based on your most recent projections,   those you submitted in conjunction with the November 2009 FOMC meeting  Most   of you continue to project a gradual economic recovery, with the unemployment rate   slowly trending lower and inflation remaining subdued over the next few years   Exhibit 2 reports the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for   calendar years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run; the corresponding   information about your November projections is indicated in italics, and Greenbook   projections are included as a memo item  As shown in the top panel, most of you   anticipate that real GDP will increase 2¾ to 3½ percent in 2010  The lower limits of   the central tendency and range of your growth projections for this year are both   slightly higher than in November  You see economic growth stepping up by almost a   full percentage point in 2011, with a central tendency of about 3½ to 4½ percent, and   then staying at about that rate in 2012  Both the range and the central tendency of   your estimates of the longer-run sustainable rate of GDP growth, the right-hand   column, are the same as in November                                                      January 26–27, 2010 107 of 260                   The broad contours of your unemployment rate projections, the second panel, are   also much the same as in November  Your forecasts of the unemployment rate in the   fourth quarter of 2010 lie in the range of 8½ to 10 percent, and the central tendency is   narrow at 9½ to 9¾ percent  Underscoring your expectations of a gradual economic   recovery, almost all of you expect the unemployment rate to remain above 8 percent   at the end of 2011  Indeed, most of you project that the unemployment rate will be   about 6½ to 7½ percent even in 2012, a central tendency that is well above your   estimates, shown in the right-hand column, of the 5 to 5¼ percent unemployment rate   you anticipate to prevail over the longer run  Your longer-run projections for the   unemployment rate have the same central tendency as in November   As shown in the bottom half of the exhibit, the central tendency of your   projections for headline PCE inflation in 2010 is 14 to 17 percent, not much   different from your projections in November  Nearly all of you project that both total   and core inflation through 2012 will stay at or below your view of “mandate   consistent” inflation of 1¾ to 2 percent  A number of you see inflation slowing   through 2012, but others see inflation remaining in the vicinity of 1½ to 2 percent    As a result, the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for core and   headline inflation in 2011 and 2012 are generally wide   As can be seen in the top panel, your views on the outlook for economic growth   over the next several years differ somewhat from the staff’s outlook  Greenbook   projections for real GDP growth are at or slightly above the upper end of the central   tendency of your projections through 2012  In contrast, the staff’s estimate of longer-  run GDP growth—at 2½ percent—is at the lower end of the central tendency of your   longer-run growth projections of 2½ to 2¾ percent  Consistent with the staff’s   slightly brisker projection of output growth over the next three years, the Greenbook   forecast of the unemployment rate is at or below the lower end of the central tendency   range of your projections through 2012  Most of you see the rate of unemployment   that is sustainable over the longer run as close to or just a touch above that projected   by the staff  Even though most of you envision a slower recovery and higher   unemployment than anticipated by the staff, your inflation forecasts are generally   above the staff’s  This helps to explain why a sizable majority of you anticipate that   it will be necessary to begin moving the funds rate up earlier than envisioned in the   Greenbook   As shown by exhibit 3, your views of the uncertainties and risks in your   projections have not changed appreciably since November  Almost all of you   continue to see greater-than-usual uncertainty regarding your projections for growth   and inflation, the solid bars in the two left-hand panels  As shown in the top right   panel, nearly all of you judge that the risks to output growth are roughly balanced    Most of you also continue to view the risks to the inflation outlook, the bottom right   panel, as roughly balanced  That concludes our presentation  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   January 26–27, 2010 108 of 260    4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package   labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  This package   includes the draft policy statements as they appeared in the Bluebook, with the   addition to alternatives C and C′ of alternative language suggested by President   Hoenig, in brackets  Also included are a revised version of Bluebook Table 1,   summarizing the alternatives, and draft directives            4 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   Your policy decision today takes place against a backdrop of continued   improvement in financial market conditions overall, evidence that a moderate   economic recovery is on track, and signs that inflation pressures remain subdued and   inflation expectations contained  Still, the staff anticipates a relatively slow recovery,   with the unemployment rate still at 8¼ percent late next year  And with considerable   resource slack expected to prevail over the projection period and inflation   expectations steady, the staff sees core inflation this year as edging down to a   1 percent rate and holding at that level next year  Your remarks this morning suggest   that many of you have a similar outlook, and, as the Chairman noted, Committee   participants may see the forecast as somewhat unsatisfactory   In these circumstances, it would seem that one question facing the Committee is   whether additional monetary stimulus would be appropriate to help reduce downside   risks and spur the recovery to a brisker pace that would result in a steeper decline in   resource slack and, eventually, inflation at rates closer to desirable levels over the   longer run  Under alternative A, page 2, the Committee would provide such stimulus   by extending and increasing modestly its purchases of mortgage-backed securities    The description of the economic backdrop in paragraphs 1 and 2 would generally be   similar to that in the January statement, but it would note that unemployment is high   and that housing activity continues to be sluggish  It would state that, “in light of the   weakness in labor markets and prospects for a subpar economic recovery, the   Committee judges that further monetary stimulus is warranted”  With the federal   funds rate at its effective lower bound, the Committee would apply additional   stimulus by increasing its MBS purchases by $150 billion to $14 trillion and   extending them through the end of the second quarter  That modification to the   program would entail a continuation of MBS transactions at approximately the   $10 billion average weekly pace that the Desk has maintained recently   Market participants are not expecting any change to the LSAP program, and the   staff estimates that increasing MBS purchases by $150 billion would lower mortgage   rates and other long-term rates by 5 to 15 basis points  This announcement could also   prompt market analysts to push off the date at which they expect policy firming to   commence and more generally lead to a somewhat flatter path for market   expectations of short-term interest rates  All in all, the staff estimates that this policy                                                      March 16, 2010 86 of 146    would provide modest additional stimulus to the real economy that could lower the   unemployment rate relative to baseline by perhaps one-tenth percentage point two   years ahead               However, some significant uncertainties would attend this policy  For example,   with mortgage spreads already very tight, the actual extent of the effects of additional   purchases on mortgage rates is unclear  And the possible effects on inflation   expectations are difficult to gauge  In view of such considerations, the Committee   might believe that its existing degree of policy stimulus appropriately balances the   costs and benefits, and so it might favor the language presented in alternative B, page   3  As in alternative A, this alternative would note that unemployment is still high and   is one of the factors constraining household spending  It would mention that business   spending on equipment and software has picked up significantly but that housing   starts have been flat at a depressed level  The statement would again indicate that the   Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a   context of price stability   In paragraph 2, the Committee would repeat the view that with substantial   resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation   expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time  The Committee   could add the bracketed sentence, which in effect notes that monetary policy is   responsible for controlling inflation over time  Although the wording does not say so   explicitly, the sentence could also be read as indicating that the Committee anticipates   that inflation would edge up over time from “subdued” rates to somewhat higher rates   that are consistent with price stability and thus that excessive disinflation should not   be a concern   In paragraph 3, the Committee would indicate that it is retaining the existing 0 to   ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate and would reiterate that it sees   economic conditions as likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds   rate for an extended period  The Committee would also note that its large-scale asset   purchases are coming to an end  In place of the indication in January that “the   Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities,” the statement would   make the more general indication that “the Committee will continue to monitor the   economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as   necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability,” thus finessing the   purchases versus holdings issue that the Committee has previously discussed  This   statement would be silent about the Committee’s exit strategy, pending further   discussion at the April meeting   In paragraph 4, the Committee would note that the Federal Reserve has been   closing most of the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets in the   crisis and would indicate that the TALF is still expected to close down on the   previously specified schedule  The statement at the end of the January statement that   the Federal Reserve is prepared to modify its plans to close its lending programs   March 16, 2010 87 of 146                   would be dropped  Our sense is that market participants already see essentially no   likelihood that the TALF will be extended   The Desk’s survey suggests that investors generally do not anticipate any changes   in the Committee’s forward policy guidance at this meeting  Overall, the statement   for this alternative seems to be about in line with market expectations, and it would   likely prompt little market reaction     By contrast, alternative C, page 4, and its variant C′ would summarize plans for   exit and would suggest that the Committee was moving more quickly toward   reducing monetary policy accommodation  In paragraph 1, the statement would note   various positive economic developments and indicate that a sustainable economic   recovery is now under way  Paragraph 2 would recognize that energy prices have   recently boosted inflation modestly but would observe that underlying inflation   pressures remain muted  It would also say that “the Committee will adjust the stance   of monetary policy as necessary over time to ensure that longer-term inflation   expectations remain well anchored and that inflation outcomes are consistent with   price stability”   In paragraph 3, the Committee would indicate that its fed funds target range   would remain unchanged for now but would modify its conditional expectation for   exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate such that it now extends only “for   some time” rather than “for an extended period”  If it wished, the Committee could   provide more specific guidance by indicating that exceptionally low rates were likely   “at least through the end of the second quarter”  Changing “extended period” to “for   some time” alone would likely cause market participants to advance sharply the time   at which they expect policy firming to commence; adding “at least through the end of   the second quarter” might help moderate that shift a little  But even that language   would probably lead investors to believe that policy firming beginning in the third   quarter was quite possible and perhaps even likely   The first sentence of paragraph 4 would provide more information on the   Committee’s rationale for modifying its forward guidance  In the Bluebook version   of the language—the phrase shown in red and bracketed—the motivation is solely to   prevent the development of inflationary pressures  In language suggested by   President Hoenig, shown in blue and bracketed, the motivation would be to prevent   the buildup of financial imbalances as well as inflationary pressures  In this regard,   one issue for consideration might be whether the Committee would see an express   indication that adjustments to monetary policy were undertaken to prevent incipient   financial imbalances as consistent with the dual mandate established by the Congress   With the Committee preparing to firm policy under alternative C, paragraph 4   would also provide some indication of how the Federal Reserve intended to use the   various tools at its disposal to effect the tightening  Although the Committee plans to   discuss these issues in detail at the April meeting, I will comment briefly now on the   exit strategy language that was prepared for alternatives C and C′  Alternative C   March 16, 2010 88 of 146    would note plans to continue to test tools for draining reserves, for subsequently   scaling up those operations to drain more reserves, and for then increasing IOER rate   and the target federal funds rate  The Committee would indicate an expectation that   “any sales of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings would be gradual and would   not occur until after policy tightening is under way and the economic recovery is   sufficiently advanced”               Alternative C′, page 5, is identical to alternative C except for its description of   some key aspects of the exit strategy  In particular, under this variant, the Committee   would indicate that it would let all maturing securities run off beginning on April 1    It would also note that the Committee “will also be assessing the possibility of   gradual sales of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings to accomplish further   reductions in the size of its portfolio”  Although both of these changes are presented   in C′, they do not necessarily have to be paired   Market participants do not expect a statement along the lines of alternative C or   C′  Depending to some extent on whether the Committee included the bracketed   phrase in paragraph 3, investors would revise sharply the time at which they   anticipate policy firming to begin and possibly steepen their expected path of   tightening  The message they took from the shift from “extended period” to “some   time” would be reinforced by the Committee’s discussion of its exit strategy in   paragraph 4  Because this would be the first time that the Committee covered such   ground in a policy statement, it would likely bolster the sense that the Committee had   now set in motion a process that would lead to policy tightening   Finally, I should note that the directives for alternatives B, C, and C′ incorporate   significant changes from recent directives, partly to reflect the imminent termination   of the large-scale asset purchases  I might note particularly that for alternative B, the   directive, which is shown in the second page from the end of the handout, would   delete the sentences that provide qualitative guidance to the Desk for asset purchases   and that indicate the Committee’s expectation that asset purchases will cause a   significant increase in the balance sheet, again because these purchases are nearing   their completion  Thank you, Mr Chairman    We did discuss whether or not to include those, President   Kocherlakota  Our rationale simply was that it was not very clear at this point what sort of   assumptions to employ for all of the variables that the Committee now faces as policy   instruments—redemptions, asset sales, the various reserve-draining tools, and so on  We’d be   happy to include them in the future, obviously, but we felt that our decision to include them   would be better informed by further Committee discussion of these issues    That’s true    Just one quick point, Mr Chairman  I’d note that in January we did   have three labor market references    Or just picking up the final clause and adding that to the end of the   existing sentence in B    Thank you  Brian and I would like to update the Committee on   the progress the staff has made developing reserve management tools, first covering   the term deposit facility and then reverse repurchase agreements  Last week, the   Board approved revisions to Regulation D that will allow Reserve Banks to issue   term deposits and that will also allow policymakers flexibility about the details of a   TDF and how it may be used  We anticipate that the Board will issue a press release   later this week announcing the changes to Regulation D and indicating that the   Federal Reserve will provide additional information at a later date   In the next few days, the staff plans to recommend that the Board formally   approve an initial structure for a TDF that will be nearly identical to the one described   April 27–28, 2010 9 of 206                   in the memo distributed to Reserve Bank presidents and Board members in advance   of the March FOMC meeting  As envisioned, the Federal Reserve will offer term   deposits primarily through single-price auctions  Term deposits would be simple   fixed-rate instruments, similar to most other money market instruments               Initially, the maximum bid rate at each auction would be set equal to the primary   credit rate, so that institutions that are eligible to hold term deposits have no   opportunity to arbitrage the discount window and so that, consistent with a statutory   requirement, the auction stop-out rate does not exceed the general level of short-term   interest rates  Early withdrawals would not be allowed, but term deposits could be   pledged as collateral at the discount window  In response to public comments, the   TDF would allow correspondents to bid on behalf of respondents  In addition, the   TDF would incorporate a noncompetitive tender feature that will ensure access to   term deposits for small institutions  Moreover, the minimum bid amount in the   competitive auction would be set at a very low level so as to enable participation by   institutions of all sizes     The staff plans to propose that the Board authorize small-value offerings of term   deposits beginning in June  These operations would allow the Federal Reserve to test   all aspects of TDF operations and would let depository institutions gain familiarity   with the TDF  The staff also plans to recommend that the Board delegate to the   Chairman the authority to determine the schedule and amounts for the small-value   TDF operations  Once the Board approves the TDF structure, perhaps next week, it   would issue a press release outlining the general structure of the program and   announcing plans to conduct small-value offerings  The press release would include   a link to a newly developed TDF website that contains all the information that   depository institutions will need to register as TDF participants   If policymakers decide to utilize the TDF in the future to drain significant   quantities of reserve balances, an appropriate governance structure will be needed    The staff, with input from policymakers, expects to propose a governance structure   that will provide for appropriate review and policy input by the FOMC regarding   TDF operations  For example, in view of the function of the TDF as a tool   facilitating the implementation of monetary policy, the staff could propose that the   Manager of the Open Market Desk and the Director of the Division of Monetary   Affairs jointly develop a plan for TDF operations over each intermeeting period that   is coordinated with all other aspects of short-run monetary policy implementation,   including any use of reverse repo agreements  These plans would be reviewed by the   Board and the FOMC at each FOMC meeting and revised as appropriate based on the   input of policymakers  The Board would then formally approve the plans for TDF   operations over the intermeeting period  The Board might wish to provide some   latitude to the Chairman to adjust amounts to be auctioned and other auction   parameters over the intermeeting period  We are happy to receive input on these   matters, but we are not asking the Board or the FOMC for any decisions at this time   April 27–28, 2010 10 of 206                   The second topic for this briefing is reverse repurchase agreements  Staff at the   New York Fed continue to develop the reverse repo program  The Trading Desk has   finalized the process for using agency MBS as collateral in those operations  Once   the legal documents related to custodial arrangements are in place, the Desk will   conduct small-scale operations to ensure its ability to use MBS collateral  We expect   those operations to take place in May                  The Desk continues to work on adding counterparties for reverse repurchase   agreements  The Desk received applications representing 28 individual money   market mutual funds following the publication of criteria for eligibility in March  Of   these funds, 26 were invited to submit the more detailed second part of the   application  The Desk expects to complete the review of the applications and to   announce the accepted counterparties by the end of June   Progress has also been made on the operational requirements for transacting with   an expanded counterparty list  Arrangements have been made with the clearing banks   to support the transactions, and an Internet version of FedTrade, the Desk’s   proprietary trading platform, has been developed to accommodate a larger set of   counterparties  The Desk expects to conduct small-scale transactions with the wider   set of counterparties in June or July   The Desk’s tentative plan for the next step in expanding the set of counterparties   for reverse repo operations is to include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  Under this   plan, we would not focus on a wider set of housing-related agencies for now, partly   because none of the other agencies currently participates to a significant extent in the   triparty repo market  As for the subsequent step for adding counterparties, the Desk   is considering including a broader set of money market mutual funds   That concludes our prepared remarks  Brian and I would be happy to address   your questions    Brian, do you want to take that?   April 27–28, 2010 12 of 206                    Generally, probably no more than several months—28 days might be a   typical maturity, and as much as 84 days  2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package   labeled “Material for Briefing on Strategies for Asset Sales and Redemptions”  Last   week the staff provided you with three memos that analyzed five possible approaches   for normalizing the balance sheet over time  The options are summarized in Table 1    At one end of the spectrum, under option 1, you would continue to allow agency debt   and mortgage-backed securities to run off as they mature or prepay, but you would   not redeem Treasury securities and you would not engage in asset sales  At the other                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   April 27–28, 2010 15 of 206                   end, under option 5, you would redeem all maturing securities, including Treasuries,   and you would begin to sell agency-related securities soon; this strategy would return   the System Open Market Account (SOMA) to an all-Treasuries composition after   three years               Under options 2, 3, and 4, the Committee would redeem all securities starting   soon and would sell agency-related securities over periods of approximately five   years, but the options differ with respect to when sales would begin and the extent to   which the starting date and pace of sales would depend on economic and financial   market developments  Under option 2, sales would commence some time after you   had begun increasing your target for the federal funds rate and would proceed along a   schedule that could be varied to some extent in response to economic and financial   developments  Under option 3, asset holdings would be highly state-dependent    Gradual sales would begin when economic conditions warranted a reduction in   monetary policy accommodation but before an increase in the target funds rate  The   pace at which assets were sold subsequently would be determined largely by evolving   conditions in financial markets and the economy, and if the outlook weakened   sufficiently, asset purchases could even be resumed  Under option 4, sales would   follow a “reverse taper,” under which sales would start at a date that was announced   in advance and would be conducted more or less according to a fixed schedule, with   significant deviations only in response to major unexpected events   By increasing the supply of longer-term debt in private hands more quickly than   anticipated by market participants, all the strategies that entail asset sales and   Treasury redemptions would put upward pressure on longer-term interest rates  The   staff estimates that an announcement of option 2, 3, or 4, which sell the agency-  related securities over five years, would increase yields on longer-term Treasury   securities by 25 to 35 basis points, while the announcement of option 5, with more   rapid sales over three years, would push rates up 35 to 50 basis points  For a variety   of reasons, all of these estimates are very uncertain  One particular concern is that   rapid sales could be relatively disruptive and at least temporarily drive up interest   rates more than predicted   The staff estimates that, relative to option 1, the higher interest rates associated   with the rapid sales in option 5 would result in annual GDP growth that would be   about ½ percentage point slower in 2011 and 2012, leaving the unemployment rate   close to ½ percentage point higher by the end of 2013  While the estimated   macroeconomic consequences are relatively modest, given either the Blue Chip or the   Greenbook economic baseline they would tend to move unemployment and inflation   further from the levels that most FOMC participants view as consistent with the dual   mandate   Moreover, these modest consequences depend importantly on the FOMC   compensating for the upward pressure on longer-term rates by firming short-term   rates more gradually than in option 1, and also on investors understanding that the   FOMC will do so  If market participants did not understand that policy would be   April 27–28, 2010 16 of 206                   more accommodative, then the market reaction would be larger and would create   more risk that the economic recovery would falter; conditions would be weaker yet if   the FOMC did not, in fact, adjust the stance of conventional monetary policy  These   risks from rapid asset sales could be magnified in circumstances in which the   economic recovery proves more anemic than currently anticipated  On the other   hand, under Greenbook and Blue Chip economic conditions, in principle the FOMC   could achieve macroeconomic results close to those of option 1 by credibly indicating   an intention to follow a more accommodative policy than would be indicated by the   Taylor rule               Another macroeconomic risk that concerns some of you is that the elevated size   of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet might cause inflation expectations to become   unmoored  If there is a link between inflation expectations and the size of the Federal   Reserve’s balance sheet, the macroeconomic outcomes in the middle of the decade   might be best under option 5, in which the FOMC engages in rapid asset sales,   thereby helping to keep inflation expectations well-anchored   The different asset management strategies have consequences for the Federal   Reserve’s income and balance sheet  If, as expected by the staff and by market   participants, longer-term interest rates rise over the next several years, there will be   mark-to-market losses on the FOMC’s portfolio  Strategies that entail asset sales or   redemptions would likely push rates up further, adding to those losses, and sales of   the assets would cause the Federal Reserve to realize the losses, reducing its income   and remittances to Treasury  However, the extent of realized losses depends   importantly on the path of long-term interest rates  Losses would be considerably   lower under the Greenbook outlook for the real economy, a scenario in which long-  term rates rise relatively gradually, than under the Blue Chip outlook for the real   economy, in which rates rise more rapidly and to a higher level  Under the   Greenbook outlook and the moderate sales options, that is, options 2 through 4,   remittances remain high this year and next but fall below their recent annual averages   several years ahead  Under the Blue Chip-based path for interest rates, remittances   drop more steeply over the next several years  Under the rapid sales option,   remittances are very low or even zero while the sales occur   A potential disadvantage of holding on to the securities, as under option 1, is the   possibility of large, albeit unrealized, mark-to-market losses  The staff estimates that   if the economy evolves along the lines of the Blue Chip scenario, under option 1 the   Federal Reserve would have unrealized capital losses in its portfolio of about   $190 billion at the end of 2013  By contrast, under the rapid sales option, the Federal   Reserve would have sold all of its agency-related securities by that time and would   have an unrealized loss of less than $30 billion on its Treasury securities   At least from an ex ante perspective, the three options that entail sales over five   years would have broadly similar consequences for the economy and for the Federal   Reserve’s balance sheet and income, so you might choose among them based on   considerations other than expected outcomes  You may see as an advantage of   April 27–28, 2010 17 of 206                   option 2 that, while committing the FOMC to returning to an all-Treasuries portfolio   in the intermediate term, sales of agency debt and MBS would begin only after the   FOMC first raises its target for the funds rate, at a point when the economic recovery   was well established  By contrast, some of you might consider it an advantage of   option 3 that asset sales would precede any interest rate hikes, because you would   prefer to unwind at least part of the unconventional policy stimulus before   commencing conventional policy firming  Some might also view the responsiveness   of the pace of asset sales to economic and financial conditions in option 3 to be an   advantage, while recognizing that it might simultaneously pose the greatest   communication challenges  By contrast, others might prefer the firm commitment to   sales at a pre-announced date and pace under option 4, because it could reduce market   uncertainty and keep inflation expectations well-anchored               In addition to your choice among asset management strategies, you will also have   to decide when and how to communicate any decision  One possible approach would   be to describe the strategy in the statement released following an FOMC meeting    You may see such a communication strategy as providing a relatively high degree of   transparency about the FOMC’s plans for managing its asset holdings over time and   as offering the public a relatively clear commitment to the identified approach  The   minutes could then provide a more complete discussion of the strategy as well as the   range of participants’ views and the reasons for them  If participants wished to   convey the broad outlines of a strategy but judged it to be premature to make and   announce a decision about a specific asset management plan, a general description of   an approach could be included in the statement or minutes, with additional details   provided over time as they are agreed upon and implemented   Obviously, the Committee faces a potentially complex, multidimensional problem   in designing a strategy for managing its assets and eventually withdrawing   conventional policy accommodation  To keep our analysis manageable, the staff   compressed the dimensionality of the problem in several respects, but, as President   Lacker suggested in his memo last week, the Committee, of course, could choose any   of a large set of combinations of ways to use its policy tools  Among other   possibilities, the Committee could decouple a decision to redeem Treasury securities   from a decision to sell assets   For example, if the Committee intended to sell mortgage-backed securities, it   might decide that it is appropriate to roll over its holdings of Treasury securities; such   an approach would limit the increase in duration that the market needed to absorb and   would help make progress toward a balance sheet consisting solely of Treasury   securities  On the other hand, this approach would not reduce the size of the   System’s balance sheet and the quantity of reserve balances as quickly as a strategy   also employing redemptions, and thus would increase the probability that the System   would need to rely on reserve management tools, such as reverse repos and term   deposits, when it comes time to engage in conventional policy firming   April 27–28, 2010 18 of 206                   Conversely, the Committee might decide not to sell assets in the near term but to   redeem all Treasury securities and continue not to reinvest principal and interest   payments from agency-related securities  The Committee might judge that, by   avoiding outright sales, this approach is less likely to be disruptive to markets but   would still make greater progress than option 1 in reducing the size of the System’s   balance sheet and the quantity of reserves  Such a strategy was not analyzed in the   memos we sent you last week, but projections under such a redemptions-only   approach are provided in the final two exhibits  These projections were prepared   under the Greenbook-consistent baseline                  As shown by the solid black line in the top left panel of exhibit 2, full   redemptions without any sales—labeled here as option 6—would return the size of   the SOMA portfolio to its trend level around the end of 2014, nearly three years   sooner than under option 1, but at least a year later than under options 2 through 4    However, as illustrated in the upper right-hand panel, the SOMA portfolio would   continue to include mortgage-backed securities for many years, since such securities   would not be sold  As shown in the lower right-hand panel, the trajectory of reserve   balances under option 6 is quite close to that under options 2 through 4 over the next   few years, but slightly less steep in 2013, when those options entail significant asset   sales as well as redemptions   As plotted in the upper right-hand panel of exhibit 3, under the staff’s   assumptions regarding the effects of changes in the SOMA portfolio, the   announcement of full Treasury redemptions would cause an immediate increase in the   10-year Treasury yield of 10 to 15 basis points relative to option 1—a smaller effect   than under options 2 through 4 (of those, only option 2 is plotted here)  As shown in   the lower left-hand panel, the result would be an unemployment rate about 15 basis   points higher than under option 1 by 2013   Because under option 6 the Federal Reserve would have no realized capital losses   on asset sales, Federal Reserve income and remittances to the Treasury over the next   few years would be broadly similar to those under option 1     A final word on the timing of Treasury redemptions  In the memos we provided   last week, and in the Bluebook as well, we assumed that, if the Committee so chose,   redemptions would begin on May 3  However, it seems likely that the Federal   Reserve would want to allow some time for consultation with the Treasury and to   give the Treasury and market participants some time to adjust to the change, perhaps   suggesting a somewhat later date for the start of Treasury redemptions, say, by   several weeks  Thank you, Mr Chairman  3  Thank you  I’ll be referring to the package labeled “Material   for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Exhibit 1 depicts the   broad contours of your current projections for 2010 through 2012 and over the longer   run  Almost all of you continue to project a gradual economic recovery, with the   unemployment rate, the second panel, slowly trending lower and inflation, the third   and fourth panels, remaining subdued over the next few years   Exhibit 2 reports the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for   calendar years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run; the corresponding   information about your January projections is indicated in italics, and Greenbook   projections are included as a memo item  As shown in the top panel, most of you   anticipate that real GDP will increase about 3½ percent in 2010  The central   tendency and the lower limit of the range of your growth projections for this year are   both slightly higher than in January  You see economic growth stepping up in 2011,   with a central tendency of 3½ to 4½ percent and then staying at about that rate in   2012  Both the range and the central tendency of your estimates of the longer-run   sustainable rate of GDP growth, the right-hand column, are the same as in January                                                      April 27–28, 2010 69 of 206                   Your unemployment rate projections are summarized in the second panel  The   central tendency for the average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year   is 9 to 9½ percent, a bit lower than in January  But, underscoring your expectations   of a gradual economic recovery, all but one of you expect that the unemployment rate   will remain above 8 percent at the end of next year  Moreover, most of you project   that the unemployment rate will be about 6½ to 7½ percent even in late 2012—well   above your estimates, shown in the right-hand column, of the 5 to 5¼ percent   unemployment rate that most of you anticipate to prevail over the longer run in the   absence of further shocks               As shown in the third panel, the central tendencies of your projections for   headline PCE inflation over 2010 to 2012 are just a bit lower than the projections you   gave in January  In contrast, the central tendencies of your projections for core PCE   inflation over that horizon, the fourth panel, have shifted down more notably, and the   dispersion of those projections has narrowed  The deviations in your projections for   overall inflation compared with core inflation generally suggest that a number of you   anticipate persistent upward movements in the relative prices of food and energy over   the next few years  Nonetheless, nearly all of you project that through 2012 headline   inflation will stay at or below your judgments of 1¾ to 2 percent for the “mandate-  consistent” inflation rate, the right-hand column   Your views on the outlook for inflation continue to differ somewhat from the   staff’s  Across the three years, the Greenbook forecasts for total and core inflation   are around the lower limits of the central tendency ranges of your projections  This   pattern helps explain why a sizable majority of you anticipate that it will be necessary   to begin moving the federal funds rate up earlier than envisioned in the Greenbook   As shown in exhibit 3, about two-thirds of you continue to see greater-than-usual   uncertainty regarding your projections for economic growth and inflation, the solid   bars in the two left-hand panels  As shown in the top right panel, most of you judge   that the risks to output growth are roughly balanced, but a few of you now see those   risks as tilted to the upside  Most of you continue to view the risks to the inflation   outlook, the bottom right panel, as roughly balanced  Thank you  That concludes our   prepared remarks       The Committee would be asked to vote on the following resolution    The Committee authorizes the Chairman to agree to establish swap lines with the European   Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of   Canada, as discussed by the Committee today   6  Thanks, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package   labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  This package   includes draft policy statements as they appeared in the Tealbook, the Tealbook table   that summarizes the alternatives, and draft directives         As Bill English noted yesterday, your projections for this round indicate that you   generally see the economic expansion as likely to be a bit weaker and inflation a bit   lower than you anticipated in April, a point reiterated by a number of you in the   economic go-round  In these circumstances, you might be inclined to provide more   monetary accommodation to boost growth, limit the extent to which inflation moves   further below levels that would be consistent with your dual mandate over the longer   term, and trim the downside risks to growth and inflation  Of course, with the federal   funds rate at zero, the Committee cannot provide further stimulus through   conventional channels  However, as in alternative A, page 3, the Committee might   wish to use the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and policy communications to   increase stimulus  Under this alternative, the Committee would use the prepayments   of principal received on the System Account’s holdings of mortgage-backed   securities to purchase additional MBS rather than continuing to allow the MBS to run   off  This new practice, in combination with the Committee’s current practice of   rolling over maturing Treasury securities, would keep the System’s holdings of   Treasuries and MBS essentially flat  As a consequence, the market would be left   holding less duration and convexity risk than if the Committee maintained its existing   MBS policy   Market participants appear not to expect any such change in the Committee’s   portfolio management practices, and thus some immediate decline in longer-term   interest rates would be likely, as investors took account of the reduction in MBS   supply to be held by the market  As drafted, the announcement would not specify   how long the Committee planned to maintain the new policy under this alternative    The final sentence of the announcement would indicate only that “The Committee   will continue to evaluate its holdings of securities in light of the evolving economic   outlook and conditions in financial markets and will employ its policy tools as   necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability”  Market participants   would presumably recognize that the new policy would not be maintained   permanently  If they judged that it would be in place for about two years, we estimate   that longer-term yields might fall about 10 basis points immediately, reflecting the                                                     6 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 6)   June 22–23, 2010 129 of 213             direct effects of the anticipated lower trajectory of market holdings of longer-term   securities                    To reinforce the decline in longer-term rates, under alternative A the Committee   would also amplify its forward guidance for the federal funds rate  In the first   sentence of paragraph 3, the Committee would indicate that it anticipates the   specified conditions “will,” rather than “are likely to,” warrant exceptionally low   levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period, and it would further state that   it “expects to maintain the current range for the federal funds rate until resource   utilization and underlying inflation are clearly moving toward rates consistent with   the dual mandate”  This language would likely be interpreted by market participants   as pointing to a longer period of very low short-term rates, which presumably would   be reflected in some decline in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates beyond   that attributable to the change in MBS reinvestment policy   As a rationale for this policy choice, paragraph 1 of alternative A would note that   economic activity has continued to strengthen, but only gradually, and that the labor   market is improving, but only slowly  It would note that financial conditions have   become less supportive of economic growth on balance, and it would also indicate   explicitly that the near-term growth outlook has weakened somewhat  Finally, it   would observe that underlying inflation has trended lower, and that inflation was   likely to be quite subdued—below mandate-consistent levels—for some time  It does   not refer to downside risks to economic growth or inflation   The language in alternative B, page 4, is somewhat more upbeat  Paragraph 1   would indicate that the labor market is improving gradually  Like A, it would note   that financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance,   but it would not explicitly state that the growth outlook has weakened  In the   inflation paragraph, the Committee would note that prices of energy and other   commodities have declined somewhat in recent months and that underlying inflation   has trended lower  It would reiterate essentially the same outlook for inflation that   the Committee has put forth since last fall  The Committee would retain its existing   forward guidance for the federal funds rate, paragraph 3, and would make no change   to its portfolio management practices   Even though you now see somewhat slower growth and greater downside risks   than you did in April, you still might not be inclined to change your forward guidance   or resume securities purchases  You might believe that the current language suitably   expresses the conditionality in the Committee’s expectations for the federal funds rate   and judge that the downward revision in investors’ policy expectations over the   intermeeting period has appropriately reflected expected changes in the conditioning   factors  Indeed, the declines in Treasury rates that have accompanied the lower   anticipated trajectory for the federal funds rate should cushion the effects on the   economy of the tightening of financial conditions resulting from lower equity prices   and higher credit spreads   June 22–23, 2010 130 of 213             And you might feel that a resumption of asset purchases is not warranted by   recent developments  Even though the growth outlook has softened a little, almost all   of you still see a gradual strengthening of the economic expansion and do not expect   significant further disinflation  Moreover, with mortgage rates already very low and   housing activity constrained by a range of non-interest-rate factors, you might be   skeptical that a resumption of MBS purchases would have a significant stimulative   effect  And you may be worried about the sorts of uncertainties that the Chairman   cited—for example, adverse effects on inflation expectations that could be prompted   by renewed MBS purchases  Indeed, you may believe that taking additional steps to   reduce holdings of longer-term securities will be warranted at some point, but believe   that the downside risks have increased sufficiently of late that the Committee should   take no action today that would tighten financial conditions  And you may think, as   discussed by the Committee yesterday, that it would be appropriate to defer any   announcement of a possible change in portfolio management practices until this   possibility has been explained more thoroughly to the public, for example, through   the Chairman’s upcoming monetary policy testimony  Such views might incline you   to issue a statement like that in alternative B at this meeting            Investors appear to anticipate a statement along the lines of alternative B, and,   hence, an announcement of this approach by the Committee seems unlikely to prompt   much market reaction   If you are now convinced that a sustainable economic recovery is under way and   are especially concerned about the potential adverse effects of sustaining   extraordinary monetary policy stimulus for much longer, you might believe that the   Committee should begin moving soon to a less accommodative posture and   accordingly modify its language now  Under alternative C, page 5, the Committee   would revise its forward guidance for the federal funds rate to suggest an earlier-than-  anticipated increase in short-term interest rates  In particular, the statement would   indicate that the Committee now anticipates that economic conditions would warrant   a “low,” rather than “exceptionally low,” target range for the federal funds rate for   “some time” rather than for “an extended period”  In the first line of the paragraph,   the statement would also change “will maintain” to “decided to maintain” to   underscore that the Committee’s decision to retain the current low target funds rate   range applied only to this meeting   In addition to modifying its language regarding the funds rate, under alternative C   the Committee would begin to run off its holdings of Treasury securities as they   mature  As noted in the memorandum that Brian Sack discussed yesterday, this   change in portfolio management would reduce the size of the System’s Treasury   portfolio by nearly $300 billion over the next three years  Market participants do not   anticipate that the Committee will begin redeeming Treasury securities anytime soon,   and an announcement of this decision might raise longer-term Treasury rates by 10 to   20 basis points, reflecting the higher yields necessary to make investors willing to   hold a larger stock of long-term assets  The response might be appreciably larger if   June 22–23, 2010 131 of 213             market participants were to infer that the FOMC is more inclined to exit from its   current policy stance than previously anticipated            I should note that the language proposed for paragraph 1 of alternative C is   structured differently from the Committee’s recent statements; among other things,   the proposed language combines the background on real activity and inflation into   one paragraph, and it alters the order of the thoughts  One possible advantage of this   structure is that it treats economic activity and inflation in a somewhat parallel   manner by not explicitly discussing the causal factors influencing the outlook for   each  Another is that this formulation does not suggest that recent inflation   developments and the near-term outlook for inflation were part of the motivation for   the change in forward policy guidance and portfolio management policy under this   alternative   Draft directives for the three alternatives are presented on pages 7 through 9  In   addition to language to implement the main policy decisions under each of the   alternatives, all of the drafts include language that would instruct the Desk to use   coupon swaps to help settle MBS purchases, as discussed by the Committee   yesterday, in addition to the dollar roll transactions that the Desk is already using    Thank you, Mr Chairman    With the minutes, Mr Chairman    Thank you very much   [Extended applause]    Thank you     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  It has been a privilege to serve   on the Board staff and on the Committee staff for a number of years, especially for the past two   years when the Federal Reserve has played such a critical role  I want to thank you again for all   the support and help you have given me and, again, for the privilege of being able to serve the   Committee  Thanks again
