1114,1979-07-19," Mr Chairman, this is Murray Altmann When this is concluded if you hang up and we disconnect the telephonic system, I can get you back on just by calling the San Francisco line   I think the question is whether the Presidents should stand by We can get back to you after the Board has consulted I don't know how long that will take, perhaps not too long   So if the Presidents will stand by in their conference rooms, I can call you back Do you want to say something, Steve?

Last time the directive said ""about"" We could say ""about"" and I suppose that would be good enough   About 7-3/4 percent and then 13 to 20 percent on the federal funds rate range   Chairman Volcker Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes  -46-    3/18/80  Governor Teeters Yes First Vice President Timlen Yes Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes  Ten for, one against   There is a housekeeping amendment in one paragraph   There is just one housekeeping amendment In line with the changes in organization that the Committee approved last August, in effect changing the titles of the Managers, in paragraph 6 of the foreign currency authorization where the word ""Manager"" appears, we would simply change it to ""Manager for Foreign Operations""  SPEAKER(?)

1429,1980-05-20," Yes It should be included in the Selected List of Actions that would be available for inspection [this coming Friday] We don't need to make a public announcement as such It would also be in the Policy Record, and any conditions attached to the increase in the line would presumably appear in the Policy Record, which might be somewhat counterproductive from their point of view May I just add simply that the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations require that there be advance approval by the Subcommittee of any drawing up to a certain amount and by the full Committee beyond that amount So [approval of a drawing] is not automatic under our procedures   We have in the past had some reference [in the Policy Record] to the notion of a consultation but I think if [the understanding] were so specific as to be a checkpoint, it probably ought to be in the Policy Record   We didn't have a figure in the last--   Yes  SPEAKER(?) We did it differently   That has been the practice I think if it gets to be regular, it probably should be a vote   It was April 29th, wasn't it?

1475,1980-07-09," It would be for the period through the 12th of August   That's correct   I can answer that perhaps by telling you what we said at this time last year After citing the ranges for 1979, the directive said ""The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest bearing transaction accounts"" That language was in the directive adopted [in July 1979] and was repeated each month   That's right   That was the decision made at the time that the Committee considered it   Now [the question is] whether we put it in the directive   It's August 12, in five weeks   From May 20  -67-    7/9/80   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich Yes President Winn Yes President Balles Yes  Unanimous, Mr Chairman   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes President Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes President Balles Yes  -71-    7/9/80   It's not the first time This is a reversion to what was the regular practice until the last meeting   No   It was changed at the last meeting because there were no numbers in the directive at the last meeting We simply have reverted to what has been the practice "
1521,1980-08-12," We need approval for the minutes of March 7 and May 6 and for the regular July 9 meeting   Yes, they were telephone conferences   On June to September?   Voting members, please Five   That's for June to September   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich Yes President Winn Yes President Balles Yes  SPEAKER(?)

1584,1980-10-21," No, not on these issues   No, the authorization says that the Committee should consider and approve changes in terms What we've done in the past is to have the Committee vote to authorize the Manager to conduct the negotiations toward that particular end   What we've done each year, usually in November, is to approve the renewal of the swap agreements as far as the individual currencies, central banks, the amounts, and the 12-month terms But any other changes in terms have been in the form of an authorization to the Manager to negotiate terms without our being very specific in the Minutes of Actions as to what those terms and conditions were   I'm only saying that there has been a vote   It's $1 billion in any one currency and $1-1/2 billion overall excluding the yen   And his [leeway] recommendation   And ""about""?  -52-    10/21/80   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes  -55-    10/21/80  Governor Gramley Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris No Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos No Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich No President Winn No  It's 8 for and 4 against "

1653,1980-12-05," Yes   Well, if there is an objection to this procedure, there really is no way to register a dissent apart from having a vote on the issue of whether to maintain the current directive or modify it in some way, which either raises the limit or provides for a temporary exception   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes President Solomon Yes Governor Teeters No Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes  SPEAKER(?)

1690,1980-12-18," With respect to the minutes for the meeting of November 18, we've put in front of you today the revised minutes I just wanted to call to your attention that there is an addition in the form of a Secretary's note At the November meeting, if you recall, the Committee approved renewal of the swap arrangements subject to final approval of the specific terms by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee The Secretary's note merely states that on December 1 and December 17 the Foreign Currency Subcommittee approved the provisions so that the swap agreements are, in effect, renewed Scott may want to say something about that   We are talking about minutes for three meetings November 26, December 5, and December 12   That's fine; I'll take it as--   Fine   We have the report on operations first   No, they're in the authorization and the procedural instructions   No, they have not been formal votes and thus not recorded   I don't think so   February 6th would be the day, as of now, if we have our regularly scheduled meeting If we call a meeting in between, it's not a regularly scheduled one, and I suppose we can hold this until February 6th   I have reason to believe that we couldn't have [the policy record] prepared in three weeks   February 3rd  -74-    12/18-19/80   It says weekly average   There's about a 3-week lag between when this will be published and your testimony   It's eight, not counting you   That thought could be in the policy record without being in the directive   On this Monday we will publish the directive, which had a range of 13 to 17 percent, along with the subsequent actions which raised the upper end to 18 percent and then allowed in effect for it to be exceeded   That's seven days in the weekly average   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters No Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes   Hold a minute Let's see whether we have any objections to [publishing the 1975 Memoranda of Discussion] "
