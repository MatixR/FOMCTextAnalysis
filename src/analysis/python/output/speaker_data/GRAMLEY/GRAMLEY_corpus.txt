  Mr Chairman, suppose one took a very cold, hard, objective look at the  RPD experiment and said there never was one  The Committee was fooling itself from the  beginning, that any significant realistic experiment would have required much larger variations  in the federal funds rate than the Committee was ever willing to tolerate--     I would be inclined to suggest a minimal kind of explanation  I think  the explanation that you’re suggesting would be too revealing if it were written in up in a fairly  honest, candid fashion     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mr Zeisel will [begin] our comments this  morning with a review of recent economic developments     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]       If I remember the numbers right, the index of industrial production on a  quarterly average basis did go up more than 7-1/2 percent [unintelligible]  What is puzzling, and  you are right in this connection, is that the rate of increase of industrial production slowed from  the fourth quarter to the first, whereas the rate of increase in real GNP increased from 5 to  7-1/2 percent  My best guess is that we may be suffering from some potential revision in the  industrial production numbers for March     There is a real possibility that, when we get the April employment  figures in, we will find that the March decline in the average length of the work week was a  statistical aberration, and this may then in turn [unintelligible] with revision in the March  production index  It is a puzzle, and these puzzles do occur on a quarterly basis not infrequently,  and it sometimes takes some time for them to be resolved     But that March estimate that we put up would be heavily based on the  man-hour figure     Governor, I think what you need to look at is the level of real GNP by  the end of the projection period because, while the rates of growth are quite different by the end  of this period, that is true just in the final part of the projection period  The level of real GNP  with the alternatives is not as large as the growth rate might suggest--that’s less than 1 percent  difference in real GNP by the end of this projection period     4/20/76 - 7 -             The model has no direct expectational effect built into it  I am inclined  to the view that, if we are talking about policy alternatives which differ by these amounts, we  might reasonably neglect expectational effects and reckon that this would be a probable  alternative course of rates that would emerge  I think that that assumption would become much  more questionable if we were talking about more divergent policy alternatives     That is correct     That’s correct     That’s the way we would wish it to be interpreted, particularly in view  of the considerable uncertainty we face as to the amount of money that is needed to finance any  given increase in gross national product  That makes an exercise of this sort all the more  difficult       4/20/76 - 8 -             And we don’t know that they are not, Governor Partee  That’s where  the source of the uncertainty lies     I’d be happy to, President Mayo  The impression has been gained  [from] the statistics in the newspaper that final sales rose relatively weakly in the first quarter  In  fact, that reflects the decline in net exports  If you take a look at private final sales excluding net  exports, they went up at a 79 percent annual rate in the first quarter, which is a very strong  increase  If you put in the government [purchases], the increase is not so large--on the order of  6 percent, but that’s still a good increase  I would not interpret these first-quarter results as  implying the necessity of radical changes in our forecast, but this is certainly not a weak report       I think that is the major lesson     I think that is the major thing that led to a stronger forecast, a stronger  first quarter than we had anticipated  But I would want to stress the fact that this would by no  means be suggestive of involuntary accumulation of inventories  We did not see a weak final  sales picture in the first quarter, and I would remind the Committee also that this is an estimate  based on two months of inventory, and not all the price data that are needed to evaluate the  inventory [unintelligible], so I think we ought to wait just a bit    I would also note in this connection that the thing that would concern me most in terms of  potential underestimation of expansive forces would be evidence that business attitudes toward  inventory accumulation have changed in a significant way  We are now [unintelligible] to build  up stocks to high levels, and in this connection the Redbook tells a very different story  It tells a  story of a business community that is still being very cautious       4/20/76 - 9 -             Let me say one thing about internal sources  As I interpret business  loan figures, I think we are still getting a very substantial improvement of corporate profits going  there  The fourth quarter numbers don’t show anything in that regard; they show profits leveling  out  But if you look at the statistics for the fourth quarter, what you find is that we had an  enormous shift in the statistical discrepancy in the GNP accounts, from a minus 3 to a plus 5   That means that product went up more than income did, and it may well be that subsequent  revisions of the numbers will indicate that we have had more growth [unintelligible] than we  know about     4/20/76 - 11 -             I would have to go back and look at the statistics much more closely   The weakness in business loan demand through the fourth quarter didn’t surprise us all that much  because inventories were still declining at that time  The weakness in the first quarter gets more  puzzling, but I don’t know whether or not this is an exception which is so outstanding as to be  without parallel     Yes, no question about that     Right     I have not studied their results in comparison with ours closely enough  to give you a good answer on that  Perhaps we ought to put out a memo on it and send it around  to the Committee     My guess is that the results of [money growth] alternatives on other  models would show less difference in nominal GNP  We tend to have quite high money  multipliers in our model relative to other models  So I think what you would find is that a  1 percent increase in M1 or a 1 percent decrease would have less effect on nominal GNP on, say,  the DRI model or the Chase econometrics model than it would on ours  But I would want to  look to be sure about that     We will be happy to send a memo around     After the first quarter, we are assuming an increase of productivity of  around 3 percent, 29 percent  Our first quarter number was quite low, and this is one reason  why we feel more comfortable that the numbers that Commerce has come up with in GNP are  now beginning to make more sense given the figures we have been looking at in terms of man- hours     But a 3 percent increase in productivity is about what you would expect, I think, if the rate  of real expansion is 5 to 5-1/4 percent  If we are in the process of revising up [the] rate of real  expansion, as I think we will be, this will have more optimistic implications for productivity   But I think one can’t discount the fact that the economy is stronger  You really can’t anticipate  that this improvement in productivity will work through to a lower rate of increase in prices   And I think you have to figure that shortage problems will begin to develop in particular  industries, and you will get particular price increases, which will mean a more rapid rate of  increase in the average price level     There’s an element of truth to the argument      If payroll taxes are not raised, that is one less [thing] pushing  [unintelligible] on the price level  But if you are talking about a more expansive fiscal policy  generally, other than that element, I don’t think you can argue it is going to be less inflationary      4/20/76 - 14 -             In a similar fashion, yes     Yes, it’s growing very rapidly     Thank you, Mr Chairman     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     It should be out this afternoon     5/18/76 - 17 -           I think we underestimated in 1972--       That was put out only after we recognized the fact that our overall  index of capacity utilization in manufacturing was seriously misleading us  I was building up to  that  I think there were three elements in the picture  I think we tended to underestimate the  strength of domestic expansive forces in 1972-73  I think we underestimated seriously the  significance of the worldwide boom in economic activity in our own economy  And I think,  third, that we were not at all aware of the serious deficiencies in our index of capacity utilization  in manufacturing  We were led, as a consequence of the resulting shortages that developed and  our failure to perceive them, to [revise] our index--     Well, things were beginning to--     The overall index reached its peak rate of utilization in the second and  third quarter  In the second quarter, for major materials the index was at 934 percent, for the     5/18/76 - 19 -         third quarter about the same, 935  So we were moving into that area looking for signs of  shortages at a time when the index was very close to its peak      I [and] the research staff here would be very happy for any assistance  we could get from the Reserve Banks  We do have a paper in process which is designed to  assess what is likely to happen to rates of capacity utilization in the major materials industries if  roughly the consensus forecast is realized  I’m aware also that studies for other countries are  being undertaken under the auspices of the OECD, so we may get some better information from  that source     One thing I would point out, President Morris, is that the expansion that we are forecasting  as a staff, and our forecast is reasonably close to the consensus, is a lot weaker than the  expansion we had in 1972  In 1972 we had the strongest expansion for the second year of  recovery of any postwar upswing  Real GNP in the four quarters ending in the fourth quarter of  1972 rose by 73 percent  That’s an extraordinarily strong expansion  Of course, it did occur  after a relatively weak first year     What we are forecasting now is an increase in the second four quarters--that is, the four  quarters beginning with the second quarter of this year, ending with the second quarter of  1977--of around 5-1/4 percent  If in fact, our forecast underestimates significantly the expansive  forces in the economy, and we get up into the 7 percent range, then I think we are going to have  to reassess the meaning of the capacity constraint problem that we may face     Quite     That’s right  Well, we would hope that within a few months we will be  able to put out an expanded index of capacity utilization in the materials industry so we will not  only have measures of capacity utilization for major materials but for all materials       We are working and we hope to have, in the not too distant future, a  new and completely overhauled index through all of manufacturing  I think whether that index is  useful in telling us about problems of capacity utilization, I’ll [wait for] some experience with it  Mr  Chairman, I--     I would hope so     No, on the materials within a few months  Within six months, possibly,  we may have a--     Well, it’s quite possible     We have a good bit more industrial detail, too, than what is in the  published index that we look at--     I would certainly support it wholeheartedly, Mr Chairman  I think  qualitative input of the sort that you’re talking about is very valuable, and I would encourage the  Reserve Banks to submit to us whatever they can obtain by way of information from their  contacts      I think an appropriate place for that to be taken up might be in the  System Research Advisory Committee  We are not meeting today, but we will a month from  now, and perhaps we can get some thinking stimulated between now and then so that--     5/18/76 - 22 -           Indeed it is  We had major revisions of the inventory statistics coming  out in July 1974     What we are concerned about, as I indicated in my briefing, President  Balles, is that price pressures will begin to develop a little more strongly than we had anticipated   I don’t look for the serious problem to come from the agricultural side  I think the run-up in  farm and food prices is  a rebound from very low levels in agricultural prices  That’s not likely  to continue unless we get very unfavorable weather  The crop situation looks quite favorable,  generally speaking, and we think that, at the retail level, the trend of food prices is more likely to  be determined this year by wage costs than by what happens to the prices of raw agricultural  commodities     On the industrial side, the increase in wholesale commodity prices in April still looks  reasonably moderate  And we’re worried about the announced increases we’ve seen in the  metals area, particularly recently, but we think that if wage costs continue to rise at a rate which  boosts the unit cost of labor--it’s somewhere around the 5-1/2 percent annual rate--then an  increase in the general price level much above that would not be particularly likely  You will see  [greater increases in] individual commodities, but probably not in the overall indexes  So  something in the range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent still looks to us like the reasonable estimate of the  general rate of inflation between now and mid-1977      5/18/76 - 24 -           What we are assuming is a strong pickup [unintelligible] in  manufacturers  The projection we have at this point is for an increase, year over year, of  10-1/2 percent in spending for 1976  And by the middle of 1976, we figure that total business  fixed investment would be rising in a general range of 12 to 15 percent at annual rates in real  terms  [We see a] quite widespread increase in plant and equipment spending, and a particularly  large [increase] in manufacturing     At annual rates, yes  That’s not an unprecedented kind of expansion in  business fixed investment     By mid-’77  By mid-’77     It’s going to take some time to generate a head of steam  So that the  year-over-year increase we’re projecting--     Well, I think there are two things in our mind that will keep the rate of  general price advance relatively close to the increase in unit labor cost  One is the fact that we  think the outlook for food prices at the retail level is such that, on balance, retail food prices will  increase a little less than the rate of increase in prices generally  The other thing is that profit  margins already have improved rather substantially  And this is a stage of the cycle where we  often see profit margins begin to be trimmed And what we have worked out in terms of a  projection of corporate profits for the next four quarters, given an increase of overall prices only  a little above the rate of increase in unit labor cost, is a further increase in corporate profits  It’s  something like 20 to 25 percent  So it seems to fit as a consistent overall package, and we are led  to believe therefore, that this is a reasonable price projection     Now, I would say that, in looking at the staff’s record of price projections in the past, if I  were to make a claim that we are fairly accurate in this area, everybody in the room would know  it’s pure fantasy  But I would also remind you that the business community has been saying  since early last year that, as soon as the economy gets back into recovery, we’re very likely to get  right back into double-digit inflation  I don’t think the business community is a particularly good  forecaster of prices either     So far this year the performance on the wage side has been far better  than our expectations  And I’m a little hesitant to cite any numbers now, at the moment, because  the Teamsters settlement hasn’t got into the index yet In March and April, the rate of increase of  average hourly earnings was only 4 percent at annual rates  Now that’s way, way under what I  think is a likely expectation for the rest of the year  What we’ve been forecasting for the year as  a whole is an increase in average hourly earnings of around 7-3/4 percent  The experience so far  is much lower than that, but we think it will bounce back up again once the Teamsters  settlement--and the rubber settlement and the others to come in--get into the averages       I think that’s a fair comment  However, it’s difficult to tell exactly how  to take it into account when businesses thus far have given almost no evidence that, with regard  to either inventory policy or commitments in the fixed investment area, they’re acting in line  with an expectation of wildly increasing prices  All the reports we get are that businesses are  still playing their inventory policy very, very close to their chest, very cautiously     I know, but they picked up strongly in an environment of large  increases in consumer spending, and they’ve done so much later than they do in a cyclical  recovery     We’ve got the [unintelligible] of inventory accumulation     We have heard nothing here about 60-month terms; we’ve heard a good  bit about the move from 36 to 48 [months]     The proportion of over-36-month maturities is rising  There’s no  question about that      That’s Mr Fisher’s section     Oh yes, we’ll get this under way       Right, we did have two years of very strong increases in capacity in the  major materials industries relative to expansion of capacity elsewhere  These were in both ’73  and ’74  The projections for ’76 don’t show any unusual increase in [capacity in] the major     5/18/76 - 29 -         materials area relative to other industries, except a fairly broad-based kind of thing  So I think  that has alleviated the problem  But I think a greater factor tending to alleviate that problem of  shortages of industrial materials is the fact that we do not have the synchronous, tremendous  worldwide boom that we had then  If that should develop again, there is, I think, a serious  question relative to the adequacy of capacity--     It could, yes      I’m not a student of the economies of other countries, but I have the  feeling, from what I have generally understood, that economic policies being pursued by most of  the major industrial countries are much more conservative now than they were [earlier] And that  I think would tend to constitute--     Well, I think product markets are improving quite nicely, now, and [if]  our projection is realized, products are going to continue to improve  We are projecting a  continuing strong increase in consumer expenditures, around 5 percent, which is historically a  very good rate of increase in consumer spending  We are forecasting a substantial rise in  business fixed investment  A movement of inventory investment up to something like 1-1/4  percent of gross national product  If those kinds of markets materialize, I would think it would  be relatively easy for businesses to pass on their cost increases     I guess I would not interpret our projections quite the same way you do  Governor Wallich  I think if one looks back one finds historical precedent for the sort of  projection we’re making, that is, in the second year of recovery, normally speaking, the rate of  real GNP expansion slows substantially  A typical postwar recovery has something like a 7  percent [rise] in the first year--using very broad numbers--and drops back to the 3 to 4 percent  range in the second  Yet the second year is the year in which you have the biggest thrust from  business fixed investment    What we’re looking at now is a projection in which true business fixed investment is a  strong element, but we still have a very large expansion of personal consumption expenditures     5/18/76 - 32 -         going on  A rise of around 4-3/4 to 5 percent in real terms, the decline in the saving rate to  around 6-3/4 percent by the end of the projection period, and we have a good rate of inventory  investment continuing  The rate of inventory accumulation rises further, up to about 1-1/4  percent of GNP, as I mentioned earlier     The only sectors from which we are not getting a significant thrust are government, which  you mentioned; and we may still be underestimating state and local expenditures; we may have  misjudged fiscal policy; the housing sector, where I think a strong case can be made that the  further rise is likely to be moderate; and the net export picture  In this latter connection, I would  note that we have quite a strong increase in real exports plugged into our projections  I  remember that the real increase is on the order of something like 8 to 9 percent  But an  expanding economy also generates rising imports and that takes away the expansive thrust   [unintelligible]  I think this is a fairly typical--     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     I have not heard any such comment  I mentioned one thing in  connection with this weakness in retail sales, which is that if you believe the weekly figures, we  do now seem to be coming out of that  The weekly figures have been untrustworthy in the past,  and I don’t want to make too much of it, but since about the middle of May, the weekly figures  have suggested a general upward course, and the auto sales figures have also improved  There  could be all sorts of reasons for that, including what President Baughman and I think, which is  that there just isn’t any evidence at this point that this is anything other than a very temporary  pause     Press reports in Washington have it that the level of its tourism in  Washington is actually below last year’s     Hotel occupancy is below last year’s     I think that’s a pretty good question, President Black  My own feeling  is that we could be on the high side in our estimated increase in plant and equipment  expenditures  Our estimated increase for the calendar year 1976 exceeds by a considerable  margin what is projected in the Commerce anticipation survey  We have felt justified in [that  estimate] for several reasons     One, our model suggests that the sort of accelerator effect we should be getting from past  increases in real consumer spending ought to be carrying through to the investment level in a  rather vigorous way  Two, business profits have been very good and are still moving up, and it  should induce some changes in planning  Third, new order figures have been unusually strong in  the past five months--a 16 percent increase since the first of this year     There are some signs of hesitancy  The expectations figures do not look all that strong in  the first quarter  The Commerce survey does not show a particularly [large] improvement in  spending plans from February to May  The construction contractors’ work figures are weak   And we are concerned also about this problem of potential divestiture in the oil industry     For the time being, I would want to stick with this kind of forecast on the general grounds  that past cyclical experience rather strongly indicates that once you get a process of strongly  advancing consumer spending under way, it does feed back to the investment level  But the next  few months of information on plant and equipment spending could cause us to change our minds     Well, what I said was, I don’t think we can realistically expect any  slowdown in the underlying rate of inflation--[although] I don’t think it’s impossible  What we  have been projecting is an increase in compensation per man-hour in the range of 8-1/2 percent  at annual rates  And an improvement in productivity of close to 3 percent, which would give us  about a 5-1/2 percent increase in unit labor costs     I think favorable surprises could come from several sources  For one thing, we have,  generally speaking, been overestimating the rate of increase in wage rates this year  The rate of  increase in wages has slowed more than we anticipated, and I think that the relatively favorable  price developments have been importantly responsible  But the light collective bargaining  schedule thus far has also been a factor, and maybe we are going to get better performance than  we had thought     But I think we would want to be conservative  I don’t think we can offer much hope for a  better wage rate performance than 8-1/2 percent in terms of compensation  We may get better  increases in productivity, but here again, our estimates seem to us realistic  A 3 percent rise is a  half  percent above the long-term increase in productivity  A third source, of course, could be  bumper crops, and again we can’t forecast that  It could happen, but I don’t think one can  realistically hold out much hope for them     Gee, I would have a hard time imagining that all foreign countries  taken together are going to do better than we do in terms of rate of inflation  Some perhaps  will--Germany might  I wouldn’t think that the world from which we import generally will show  lower increases in prices than we do       Well, I don’t think we have data relating specifically to GAF stores  If  you were to look at apparel prices, though, I don’t think you would see any significant evidence  of a longer-term slowdown in prices  The increase in apparel commodities during May was half  of 1 percent  And it [was] running about 2 or 3 tenths in previous months       I haven’t looked at that recently, Mr Chairman, and I haven’t--     From what we have heard--     From qualitative reports about the situation in retail stores, we could  see some price cutting  We’ve understood that nondurable goods inventories are sufficiently  high at the retail level as to generate some concern, and we have been told that there may be  some price concessions to help move some of this merchandise  They would presumably show  up in the June CPI     That’s a possibility, but from our discussions with people in the retail  industry, there just isn’t any doubt that sales overall slumped in April and stayed at relatively low  levels in May  They were quite discouraged, and they were looking at increases in inventories  that they found unacceptable     Yes, I would  The increase in starts in May was only a little over  2 percent  The permits figure was up around 5  What we are seeing is a smaller rate of rise in  the multifamily area than we had hoped for  The problems there are proving to be more deep- seated and more intransigent than we had hoped for  And we have trimmed down somewhat our  increase in projected housing starts over the remainder of this year, mainly in the multifamily  area       6/22/76 - 22 -           In the single-family area, I think we can look forward to some further gradual  improvement  But here the discouraging factor is that sales seem to have leveled out  We just  are not getting any further increases in sales in either new or existing homes through April,  which is as far as the data go, and we did check qualitatively to see what May changes might  have been  And generally speaking, the market doesn’t seem to have shown any further  improvement other than the normal seasonal rise     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Well, those are quite a few questions all wrapped up in one, Governor  Wallich  Let me try to answer in [unintelligible]  Obviously, we don’t really expect the rate of  real GNP to be 5 percent every quarter  And if it were to come out that way, no one would be  more amazed than the staff  It just doesn’t happen  I do think, though, that the situation we face  now could easily develop into a prolonged period of relatively steady expansion in real output    I have been struck by the similarities in many respects that this expansion [bears to] the  expansion of 1960-61  Let me recite for you what happened during that period  After the first  year of recovery, real GNP growth in the second year of recovery rose 6-1/2 percent; in the third  year of recovery, 3-1/4 percent; in the fourth year, 6 percent; the fifth year of recovery was 5  [percent]  Now that sort of pattern is one that I think would be unlikely to develop in the current  recovery if we have the continuation of relatively balanced expansion which seems to be going  on now     I do not regard a 5 percent growth rate after the first year of recovery as low  On the  contrary, if you look back at [unintelligible] experience, what you find is that the second year of  recovery typically finds the real GNP growth rate falling by about half, about 8 [percent] to 4  [percent]  Once you lose that tremendous thrust from the turnaround in inventory  investment--from deep liquidation to accumulation--it’s quite common for the growth rate to be  slow     Whether or not the potential for overrun is greater than the potential for an underrun of this  projection, I’m not at this juncture sure  We have projected a very sizable expansion of business  fixed investment for the period immediately ahead  For example, the projection we’re making  on plant and equipment expenditure year over year for 1977 is a little over 20 percent  That’s a  fairly heroic projection at this stage of the game, and I can easily see possibilities that plant and  equipment spending did not build up that kind of steam, so I think there are real possibilities for  an undershoot as well as for an overshoot     I would regard the 4-1/2 percent estimate that came up today and our  5 percent estimate as equivalent  We can’t come anything like that close to approximating what  is happening in the economy  I would remind you also that these figures are still preliminary   SPEAKER(?)  Oh sure     We do not have June inventory figures yet  The basic difference  between the actual figures and our projection is that inventory investment went down a little in  the second quarter rather than up a little as we had projected  I wouldn’t consider that as being  anything which would require a modification in any way     We’ve made only very, very minor adjustments in our projection of  business fixed investment  The news as I interpret it has been relatively neutral over the past  months  We had the new orders [data] a month ago, and I reported that, too, as I recall  I don’t  know that anything very decisive is coming one way or another, and it was not our intention to  make any significant modification of the business fixed investment projection     I think that the Greenbook statement had to do generally with the  improvement in the outlook over a longer period rather than the outlook over this past month     As I remember, Mr Chairman, the revision in our projection is very  minor     Pardon me?      7/19-20/76 - 27 -     The business fixed investment figures from the second quarter of 1972  through the first quarter of 1975 show increases this time of about a half a billion a quarter, at an  annual rate, lower than before  The [reason for the] downward revision there was basically that  the shipment figures that were coming in during the second quarter were slightly lower but  [unintelligible] off a bit     We did add more into business fixed investment in the second quarter of 1977, and then  continued fairly strong expansion in the latter half of that year  I don’t regard this as at all a  significant alteration  It still implies an increase in business fixed investment plant and  equipment expenditures year over year considerably exceeding that projected in the last  Commerce survey  I believe the figure we have is between 9 and 9-1/2 percent  And then a  year-over-year increase on a survey basis next year [unintelligible]     Well, I would repeat, Mr Chairman, that this is such a minor  adjustment in the projection of business fixed investment that I don’t consider it significant  I  think our projection for business fixed investment is in the same ball park it was last time     Now, as to why we use shipments  We have been looking very carefully at shipment  figures recently because the shipment figures in the fourth quarter and again in the first quarter of  this year were telling us things about business fixed investment which were in no other figures at  all  And I think in part this reflects the fact that the downturn this time was much sharper, and  we didn’t get the cancellations that I would have anticipated, given that retrenchment  [unintelligible]  But when these shipments began coming back again, we began recording this in  the business fixed investment projection     7/19-20/76 - 28 -     Well, the one thing that has disturbed us in our price projection is  whether or not it’s consistent with what’s been happening to individual materials prices  The  increases in industrial prices that I’m using here, the BLS [unintelligible] industrial price index,  and the movements of these industrial prices are just all over the lot, so [unintelligible] we’ve  seen increases much bigger in some previous upswings than we’ve seen recently     But I would say that the increases are beginning to be worrisomely large  Our view is that  these increases will be accompanied by a picture for unit labor costs which reflects what’s been  happening to compensation per man-hour as well as productivity and will keep unit labor costs  rising in a range of around 5 percent  Now, if you project a much larger increase in general price  levels than we have, and if unit labor costs stay in that range, what you get is a rise in corporate  profits [the size of] which we can’t believe  It’s much larger than is characteristic of the second  quarter of recovery  And that was a principal factor leading us to the judgment that prices would  stay about in line with the rise in labor costs       Yes, yes  We do think that the rate of wage increase so far this year  probably understates what will be going on for the year as a whole because this has been a period  in which we have had a relatively light calendar of collective bargaining settlements  And also  the timing of deferred adjustments under existing contracts is such that they tend to bunch in the  second half     It’s based heavily on past typical experience, [which is] that when you  have a strong run-up in final sales, particularly consumer expenses, it does induce businesses to  become more optimistic as time goes on  It’s based on a strong profit performance, which we  expect will continue; the results of our model point in this direction  We also think that the  Commerce survey, because of the way bias [unintelligible] to me, understated what has been  happening to business planning  The bias adjustment this time is negative--     Yes, the Commerce Department adjusts its raw figures on anticipated  plant and equipment spending for what they consider to be systematic biases that they see in the  data  This bias adjustment has a history to it, a very large movement over the course of the  years  In the early years of the 1970s, Commerce was adding several billion dollars to its  projected expenditures for plant and equipment to correct systematic bias  This year they’re  subtracting several million dollars     If they find certain industries underestimating their expenditures  regularly over a period of years, they will tend to adjust those expenditures upward  If they find  other industries systematically overestimating, their expenditures, they adjust those expenditures  downward     Yes, sir  That’s right  In this particular year, the bias is reducing  anticipated expenditures by a couple of percentage points  If you leave out that bias adjustment,  what you get is an anticipated increase of around 9 percent  And we think that--     I am not aware that they publish the unadjusted figures  I don’t think  the information is confidential, it is available to the public, but we get it over the telephone     They try to make no allowance for cyclical [unintelligible]  A  deliberate effort is made to avoid adjustment for the position of the cycle     I wouldn’t wish to say that a downward revision in our projection of  business fixed investment would lead to an abortion of the recovery  It certainly would weaken  it a great deal  And [it] would get [us] into several [other] areas  Our inventory projection is  conditioned on the hypothesis that once you get a buildup in business fixed investment going for  quite some time, it generates a rather large increase in materials and supplies in the durable  goods industries  Second, the induced consumption increase from the employment created by  rising business fixed investment is also an important element in keeping the growth of  [unintelligible] strong  So you’d have weakening in all three of these areas, but depending on  how much you adjusted the projections downward, [it] might or might not lead to an abortion of  the recovery     Well, President Kimbrel, I guess if I had to express my concern about  our overall projection of business fixed investment at this point, I would say that my concern lies  in the direction, as President Eastburn suggested, that maybe there really isn’t enough evidence  at this point to justify as strong a projection as we have     We are basing it very heavily on the fact that past experience indicates that once [you get]  a good increase in final sales capacity, utilization rates, and business profits under way, it does  carry through to a strengthening of business fixed investment--     I think that--     Well, my thought here, Mr Chairman, is that we’ve got strong order  figures for the first five months of the year; the figures on construction contract awards have  been notably weak, and we see no really significant [unintelligible] up there; and rising new  orders will carry you through for a couple of quarters but not much beyond that  We really have  to see some more basic signs of strengthening in the nonresidential construction area to be sure  that we are going to get this emerging pattern we have projected     No, no, our projections of federal expenditures for quite some time  have been well above the Administration projections  We have a federal outlays figure for fiscal  1977 of $410 billion; that compares with the congressional figure of $413 billion; and as I  remember, the official Administration figure is $394 billion  So, we have been well above the  Administration figures     It is a very moderate increase     That’s what it would seem ought to be implied     We don’t have an orders figure yet for June  The price increases in this  field have not yet been reflected in the new orders that we have at this point  The only way I can  think that the price factor would have gotten into this new orders figure is some anticipatory  volume we have heard of that would have raised new orders for primary metals somewhat  Now  so far as the weight is concerned, in durable goods industries, primary metals is about 9 billion  [unintelligible]      Yeah     We have had a good run-off in the primary metals industry, in part the  consequence of the fact that inventories of durable materials generally were run down, and now  we are at the stage of this cycle where that’s in the process of being reversed  Some of this is a  genuine increase [unintelligible]     7/19-20/76 - 34 -     It’s in the projection     Well, productivity estimates by the econometric model have been  considerably off for a long period  That is, if the model suggests that we ought to have a more  rapid [unintelligible] productivity, then we judgmentally believe it will occur  But it’s been off  for so long that even the modelers themselves don’t trust it     One of the long-standing characteristics of the FTC centers is that they  never performed any [unintelligible] to dig out of the banking data  Now the weekly reporting  banks are a long ways from the all-commercial-banking materials that we get  [Unintelligible]  estimates of what’s going on is banks from which we do not get recent reports and indeed from  which we don’t actually have good loan data except for Call Report dates  In general, what  happens is that the larger banks show much larger cyclical slants in business loans than do the  smaller banks  The smaller banks can have a more steady rise and are often experiencing very  substantial loan expansions when loan demands [elsewhere] are quite weak     7/19-20/76 - 35 -     Mr Chairman, may I just point out that in our own staff projection, we  have allowed some moderate increases in the multifamily starts area  I think that the Committee  should be aware that there are some negative considerations in the single-family area also  The  sales of existing houses have not risen since late last year  Sales of new houses, if anything, are  declining now  [Unintelligible]  We don’t have the underlying demand for single-family homes,  [that] I think [is needed] to send the single-family starts up to a very high level     Well, they are a relatively new series  I don’t know that we have any  basis for evaluating this series     That I don’t know  I don’t have any information on that     In our areas, community pressures of the quasi-governmental kind  operated on rent increases  That’s true in the Washington area--we’ll try to [obtain] as much  qualitative information as possible     I certainly would agree with the Chairman that the movement in the  surplus is small  The projected figure that we had for the second quarter--and I don’t know how  much revision will be necessary because of the statistics that came out this morning--but we had  a high projection of $5 billion, and we had a projected move to about a $4 billion surplus for the  fourth quarter of 1977  Now that’s not a large move  It’s in the right direction in the period in  which business activity is expanding       7/19-20/76 - 38 -   To turn to President Baughman’s question, I confess to being a traditionalist  That is, I  believe that, at this stage of the cycle, a larger deficit would have a stimulating effect on  economic activity  And I believe it would have an adverse effect on inflationary problems, that  is, it would tend to increase prices     That’s correct  And continuing that path beyond the second quarter of  next year     I would acknowledge that comment also, Mr Chairman  And I would  say that one of the chief problems we have had in developing our judgmental forecast is that we   have not been able to come to grips with the kinds of financial restraints that past experience  suggests should be developing with the growth rate of M1 at 5-3/4 percent  Now we have to  make some judgment as to how much further downward movement in the money demand  function will occur  And we take that number right off the wall; it’s that subjective  And I think  forecasters looking as far ahead as late 1977 can come to markedly different conclusions about  the economic [environment] that will emerge from maintaining a 5-3/4 percent growth rate in  M1     Pardon me?     Yeah, right, that is, the rate of increase in velocity tapers off just a trifle  because towards the latter part of the period both the rate of price increase and the rate of real  GNP growth are just a trifle less, but basically it’s a very large and continuing increase in income  velocity of M1 in the projections     Yes, they are     Yes, indeed  You see over the last year the rest of the increase in  income velocity on the order of 92 to 80 percent, but it’s not just a question of the extent to  which the income velocity of money goes [unintelligible] like that  What sort of financial  restraints have developed?  What does this mean for the future?  And I think that what you are  suggesting is that the kind of pressure on interest rates that we’re forecasting is much too  moderate--[you would] expect a much larger rise in interest rates, much more tightness to  develop in financial markets, a weaker pattern to housing, and so on  And that’s a possibility   But you see, that’s the sort of thing we’ve been forecasting repeatedly since the middle of 1975,  and we’ve been wrong     It's hard to say because the other forecasts of GNP that we have rarely  explicitly forecast M1  There are three forecasts that I've looked at for which we have statistics  all the way in terms of both M1 and real GNP  In general, the other two besides ours had a  slower increase in velocity than we did and somewhat higher increases in M1 than we had  projected     Yes, we are maintaining our traditional definition of M1 [unintelligible]  demand deposits  We are aware of the fact that a variety of changes are going on in the  economic system which are leading to economization of money balances so defined  We are  also aware, however, that merely redefining the stock of money to include the time and savings  deposits at commercial banks other than large denomination CDs does not solve the problem   There is economization of that concept of money going on, also, and what we are projecting in  terms of an increase in the income velocity of M2 is also high in terms of experience  We're  projecting a rise of somewhere around a 2-3/4 to 3 percent annual rate over the next six quarters,  whereas the trend rate of increase, as President Balles has suggested, would be close to zero  We  know no way to merely redefine money to get around this problem  Presumably there is a way,  if we only knew what it was, but we don't have the answer     We have a four-week average     Not to the best of my knowledge     I would remind you, Mr Chairman, that if you publish a 13-week  centered moving average, the centering of that period will be 6-1/2 weeks prior to the current  date, and I would be willing to bet my bottom dollar that market reaction to that would be one  huge yawn     The centering in terms of the location on the page, but anybody familiar  with statistics would know that that’s a 13-week moving average  The center of that is 6-1/2  weeks ago     [Statement--see Appendix]     Well, I was going to say, President Winn, you got up on an awfully  bearish side of the bed this morning  I think you have put your finger on a lot of different  problems that affect the economy  I think these problems are more numerous now than they  have been in many past periods of cyclical expansion  But I believe I could recite every bit as  long a list of positive factors as you have a series of negative ones       8/17/76 - 6 -     Take the profitability of business investment, which I think is critical in this outlook, and  let me focus my comments there  We have had, over the past four quarters, a very substantial  improvement in business profits  That’s still going on, and that’s what I think is involved in the  price increases we’re seeing in the metals area and elsewhere--efforts to make sure that rising  costs do not prevent a further substantial increase in profits as the economy recovers     These profit increases have been large enough now, I think, so that a lot of businesses are  convinced that they can go ahead with their capital spending programs and finance them more  heavily internally than they could for many years  This is beginning to show up, I think, in the  indicators of business fixed investment  This string of six increases in new orders for nondefense  capital goods is the longest string in the history of that series, which goes back to 1968 as  presently defined  And it’s solid  It’s a 25 percent annual rate of increase in real terms  If you  crank that into our economic model, that model shows a larger increase in real business fixed  investment than what we are projecting judgmentally for the next several quarters     We’re also seeing now for the first time what I think is rather solid evidence of a pickup in  construction contract awards for commercial and industrial buildings  They’re up about  25 percent on average in the second quarter over the first quarter, albeit from a quite low level   So I think business fixed investment is going to move forward     I don’t think we’re in for a big boom  What we’re forecasting is not a big boom in overall  economic activity  It’s a moderate rate of economic expansion consistent with, I think, the sorts  of uncertainties and problems that you enumerated as well as the underlying strength which we  see there     Well, we perhaps are guilty of over-optimism on our projections of  compensation per man-hour, but over the past year the record has been that we have been  forecasting increases which generally speaking have been too high  The actual increases have  come in less than what we have been forecasting since the recovery began     There is, I acknowledge, an element of circularity in our projections, in the sense that past  price increases tend to be very important in future wage bargains  If exogenous forces such as  those affecting food and fuel were to come in much stronger than we have allowed for in our  projections, then our wage forecast would probably also be wrong  We’ve projected an increase  over the next six quarters roughly at about 4 percent for food prices  And I think that’s a  reasonable forecast given the supply outlook in the agricultural area  If something should  happen to prove that wrong, then I think the wage forecast could turn out to be too low     8/17/76 - 7 -       Reassurance that our projection of rising interest rates is correct?  Well,  I wouldn’t want to try to offer you too much assurance on that  Perhaps Mr Axilrod will want to  amplify, but as you know, the pattern of interest rate movements in this recovery has not been at  all typical  And one reason has been a very substantial improvement in corporate profits, which  has held down the need for external financing  Now that external financing gap has begun to  grow and is projected to increase further  We anticipate that normal cyclical patterns of interest  rate movement are going to reemerge  And as much as we’ve been wrong for the past five  quarters, it is not entirely inconceivable that we might be wrong again  Mr Axilrod may wish to  amplify     May I pass?     This is a one-month increase  I wouldn’t assign any significance to a  one-month increase, particularly when you can’t associate it with something like improving job     8/17/76 - 8 -    opportunity, which might encourage more people to go into the labor force  What we’re  assuming is a return to a more normal rate of increase in the civilian labor force     What we have over the latter half of the year as a whole--well, let me project the third  quarter to the first quarter of next year, which will be the next half year  We [have] just a half  million increase from the high third-quarter average level  But if you take a longer-range period,  so that you can see what the trend rate of projection is, we’re projecting an increase at roughly a  1-3/4 million annual rate  Have I answered your question?     That has been a definite factor  We have reported on that repeatedly as  a factor influencing labor force growth over the period since the recession began  The labor  force developments during the recession and recovery have been quite abnormal  We’ve had  much larger increases in the labor force than we would have anticipated  And this inflation  factor is clearly one of them  But that certainly does not explain what happened in July     That has been an even longer-range trend, and it continues, and the  recent increases in the labor force over the past several months have been heavily in the adult  female component     Yeah, well, not over the balance of the year  The fact that we have had  this big jump means that the average from the third quarter to the fourth probably will be small   But what we project for the projection period as a whole is a continuation of fairly high rates of  growth of the labor force relative to long-term trends  A long-term trend would be something  like a million and a half at an annual rate  We are projecting a million and three quarters  So the  participation rate continues to rise     We noted that in your District’s response in the Redbook this time  I  think the other responses in the Redbook are not closely correlated with that  That is, generally  speaking, I think the tone [in the Redbook] is that the degree of confidence in the future is about  the same as it was a month or two ago  Although there are some more question marks  Now if  in fact the slowdown in consumer spending were to continue through August and on into  September, then I think there would be some serious question as to whether confidence would  not deteriorate  But my feeling is that we are going to see an improvement in consumer  spending, so these concerns which are building, which are obvious factors in businessmen’s  thinking, are going to be allayed     The autos are not in the new orders for nondefense capital spending     8/17/76 - 10 -       I have never been a fan of leading indicators generally  I think one  does much better to look over all the leading indicators individually to try to assess their meaning  for what’s going on in the various sectors of the economy  And if the leading indicators give  confirming evidence of what you come up with, well, fine  If they don’t, I would be more  inclined to toss out the leading indicators than analysis in depth  I do think the leading indicators  are all still pointing upward, and that gives me reasonable confidence that the judgments we’ve  arrived at with a more thorough study of the economy are right       8/17/76 - 13 -     I would like to add one point, if I might, Mr Chairman, in regard to Mr Partee’s comment   And that is that though personal income growth did slow in June, it slowed because we had both  a decline in employment and a slow rate of increase in average hourly earnings  The average  hourly earnings index went up quite slowly that month  In July we’ve had both a large increase  in employment and a larger rise in average hourly earnings  In addition, we’re looking at a  quarter in which we’re getting Social Security disbursements increased  And those factors  should act to increase spendable income in the third quarter and help to sustain consumer  purchases in the short run      Right     Well, I would say they’re entirely unrelated and coincidental and I  would base that judgment on two sorts of evidence  One is that, if you expect a slower rate of  growth of M1 to feed through to the nonfinancial economy, you would anticipate that it would  take place through such signs as rising interest rates  That’s the way increasing tightness in  financial markets initially evidences itself  That has not happened  Secondly, I would have a  hard time understanding how slow growth of the money supply could have the sorts of  distributional effects we see in the data  The slowdown has been almost entirely in nondurable  goods production  The rate of durable goods production increased from last fall to this spring   That’s not the sort of thing you connect with an increase in monetary tightness     The conclusion I would draw, Governor Wallich, is, first, our measures  of capacity utilization are poor and need improvement, and we are working on that  We hope to  have some revised indexes out this fall on the capacity in all of manufacturing     More generally, I would say my conclusion would be that except for isolated cases, we’re  not now in a situation in which bottlenecks or shortages are likely to impede the rate of  expansion, nor are we likely to find ourselves in that situation over the next six months to a year,  assuming the rate of economic expansion follows the path we’re projecting  But it is, I think,  evident that in a number of industries, particularly in the materials area, the rate of capacity  utilization has increased sufficiently to make businesses think about their expansion plans   For example, in the nondurable goods materials industry, where we’ve been at an  86 percent rate of capacity utilization throughout 1976, compared with a peak of 94--admittedly  considerably higher, but that was a period of extreme shortages--and a trough of 70  Now that’s  a very significant increase in the rate of capacity utilization in those industries  The bounceback  in the durable goods industries has been smaller and slower, in line with the fact that durable  goods production has not gone up as much  But in the first six months of this year in the steel  industry, to cite one example, we have had a very slow, significant rise in production and in the  rate of capacity utilization  And in that instance, I would think that the industry would be  thinking about expansion of capacity as time goes on  The utilization index for raw steel is now  at 91-1/2 percent, compared with a cyclical trough of about 73  So that’s a very substantial  bounceback     Well, we have a memo under way to evaluate that  It’s a new index  that’s been out for several years     We do have a study of that under way, and we’ll report to the  Committee     Be happy to     Well, my feeling is that the evidence we have on consumer confidence  is a little bit out of date  The latest statistics we have are based on surveys taken in May and  June, and things may have happened since then  They don’t show an appreciable change from  early in the year  One of the indexes shows a slight improvement in confidence; the other shows  a slight deterioration but, at the same time, an improvement in buying intentions     As far as the rate of inflation is concerned, my feeling is that consumers are not likely to  react to one or two months’ change in the CPI or to what they see in the grocery store but rather  to longer-term trends  And I think that what they have been seeing in terms of longer-term  trends is a general improvement in the performance of consumer prices during most of ’75 and  relative stability since then  So I see nothing--     Well, I think our consumers have gotten sophisticated enough now so  that, though they don’t sit down and make calculations on a calculator and compute annual rates  of change compounded monthly, they are reacting at this point to rates of change rather than  levels  They expect general increases in prices to take place  They see it all the time  And I  think that view is consistent with the way the consumer surveys have behaved  As the rate of  inflation slows, consumer surveys begin to report an increase in consumer confidence  They  began to report that consumers think it is a better time to buy, they are less worried about  inflationary pressures     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Right  We estimated that the auto strike reduced industrial production  by 1/2 percent in September  And there was a 2/10 offset because of the settlement of the rubber  strike and the bituminous coal strike     The implicit price deflator is lower than we had estimated, and this  accounts principally, in the mechanical sense, for the difference in real GNP estimates for the  third quarter  The nominal increase in gross national product published this morning is almost  identical to what we had estimated as a staff  But the GNP deflator, according to these figures,  went down from 52 percent in the second quarter to 44 percent in the third     The fixed-weight deflator also was lower than we had estimated  I just  got that number a moment ago  Their figure is 44 percent also for the gross business product  fixed-weight deflator     In nominal terms, it’s quite close to ours  In nominal terms,  nonresidential investment goes up from 1579 to 1625  So that’s 46, if my arithmetic is right      10/19/76 - 10 -   In real terms, it goes up from 1149 to 1170  Those figures are very close to what our staff has  been using     Something like that     All I can say in response to that question, President MacLaury, is that I  have heard that story only very recently  We have begun to look into it, and we will plan to  report back to the Committee as soon as we ascertain anything definite     I believe it’s fair to say, President MacLaury, that the lag is quite  widespread  It is not primarily concentrated in purchases, it’s in other things besides purchases   But it’s quite widespread  We do think it’s had something to do with a slowdown in economic  activity in terms of the impact on disposable income much more than through its impact on  purchases  As to why it’s happening, we are at a loss to give any definite answer     The best explanation that I have heard, but it’s a hypothesis for which I have no support, is  that government agencies generally did not take into account the decline in the rate of inflation  on their expenditures  But I don’t know that that’s the case  If that’s the case, we might well see  some continuing shortfall from expectations go on  Now, we have reduced our projected level of  unified budget outlays for fiscal 1977 by $2 billion  But that would mean some rebound in the  rate of spending over the remainder of the fiscal year, and that may prove to be inaccurate     I object to that interpretation, President Mayo  I do think one needs to  distinguish between one’s best-guess forecast and what probability he attaches to it and the  probability distribution that you’ve had with various forecasts  Our best-guess forecast is what’s  in the Greenbook now  If we thought that the best guess at this point was that the economy  would be weaker than that, we would have weakened our forecast more than we did  This is our  best guess at the present time     We have no probability     If I interpret your statements correctly, yes, I think the answer is yes, it  is     It wouldn’t be easy for us to forecast it that way     The latest figure we have is for the week of October 9  We have two  [weekly] figures referring to the month of October  One [is for] the week ending [October]  second, which showed an increase of 14 percent, and that was heavily in the durable goods area   And the next week relative to the previous week showed a decline of 11, so that for the two  weeks as a whole now, the latest figure would be up just a little bit     Governor Wallich, I would say that the inventory situation would  predispose towards avoiding a recession, but inventory-sales ratios are not extraordinarily low at  the present time, particularly after you deflate them  I would say that [unintelligible] has  sufficient weakening of final sales, particularly in business fixed investment  It often happens  that inventories which look relatively low given the current basis of sales would look relatively  high a few months later, when expectations of final sales are deteriorating  So I think in the  situation [unintelligible] is not conducive to the production of recession, but it certainly doesn’t  make us recession proof     Mr Chairman, may I take the opportunity to correct one remark that I  made earlier  I said our mean probability--this is our best mean forecast  What I meant is the  modal probability is still the one--the highest modal probability is the one we attach to the  present forecast, not the mean  The one with the highest probability is the mode not the mean     In a technical sense, yes     Governor Wallich, I believe the reason that banks are using their  increased deposits to buy securities rather than loans reflects two things  First, the fact that  businesses have wanted to [conduct their] external financing in longer-term markets   Three things, I guess; three reasons     Second, because their external financing needs have been small given what has been  happening to internally generated funds and the rate of investment  Third, that banks have been  unwilling to make the concession on the prime rate necessary to generate larger business loan  demands  That latter point is the only element which would lead one to suggest, I think, that the  degree of monetary expansion we have had may have been in some sense less expansive than if  the banks had put their prime rate down and gotten additional loans  But my guess would be that  if the banks had done this, the principal difference would have been in terms of the distribution  of funds used by businesses--they would have borrowed more at banks and less in the open  market  I don’t really think that’s an element which would be suggestive of monetary restraint     Well, six months ago we weren’t projecting out through the end of  1977  We made our first projection through 1977 in July  You are quite correct  At that time  our projection for the third quarter and for, I believe, the fourth quarter, too, was higher than it is  now  And indeed our projection for the four quarters of 1977 is a shade lower  No question that  real GNP by the end of 1977 is lower than we were projecting in July     That’s correct       I’ll be happy to  I’d first like to make certain that you understand that  my statement of my position was a good deal more moderate than the way you put it  That is, I     10/19/76 - 23 -   think monetary policy would have some positive effect on economic activity in the near term, but  that its effect in the near term would be less than a similar dose of monetary expansion would  have produced in the comparable stage of earlier cycles     I think the housing industry is not one that is likely to respond much to easing monetary  policy  That is the area that, normally speaking, we expect the most stimulus to come from  I  think the stock market would be less likely now to respond to a decline in interest rates than it  would have in the past four or five years  I don’t see the evidence of credit restraint in the  availability sense that one could counter by easing monetary policy  I don’t see a lot of thrust in  the short term     I want to make sure you understand that my comments about the inflationary impact are  over the longer term, not in the short term  I don’t know of any way that money can affect prices  without affecting economic activity     Turning to your second point, if I had the responsibility for moving over to the levers of  fiscal policy, I would be inclined to move on the fiscal front  And the direction in which I would  move would be tax cuts  Tax cuts which could be possibly of a temporary kind, perhaps a $50  tax cut for each dependent  Each taxpayer  Something that would provide a stimulus, get this  thing going again, get consumption moving without undercutting the tax base for the longer run  and without leading to the sorts of increases in expenditures which continue on and on and on  because they’re very difficult to stop  I do think fiscal policy would be very helpful       Yes  That certainly has been a factor, particularly last month, and in  August also  If you look at personal income in real terms, though, the slowdown goes back quite  a ways  The rates of growth of real personal income begin slowing about April  We’ve had only  a moderate rate of expansion from April on  Prior to that, personal income was going up at quite  a good clip  I think the basic reason for the slowdown in real personal income is traced to the  slowdown in production  That’s the most important factor       No  Particularly not given the source of the difference between our  projected growth of real GNP and that by the Commerce Department  The difference between  our projected figure for real GNP growth and that put out by the Commerce Department this  morning lies primarily in the estimate of increase in consumer service expenditures  Now that  doesn’t have any implications for the future at all, so we would end up with the same projections       They have a bigger increase than we do  We have a moderate increase,  ours could be too small  I just don’t know       I believe I said not readily      I’ll be happy to try  I certainly would not wish to argue that additional  monetary stimulus now would have no effect at all  I do think it would have some effect  I think  it would have an effect that is small relative to what would have been produced by an equivalent  amount of monetary stimulus in earlier postwar cycles at this same stage of the expansion  I  think it is, at this juncture, an inferior way of trying to get stimulus  I, too, had some simulation  runs done on the model to assess what the model has to say about this problem  The runs that I  looked at seemed to me, as I would interpret them, to be less optimistic in terms of the amount of  stimulus to real activity  What they said, in effect, was that, four quarters down the road, an  additional 1 percentage point growth of M1 would give you about 06 percentage point in real  GNP     The point of my argument, however, is that the model is based on average conditions in the  past; that I do not think the conditions prevailing at the present time are like those in the past;  and that therefore you’re just not going to get that much monetary stimulus  Now if you say very  well, but what harm is there from adding more money now--if it doesn’t do any good, it just lies  around idle  The point I would make is that if you can take that money out later on, then you’ve  got no problems, but I think the experience is that once that additional money gets into the  system, it’s very difficult to retract later  So I do think you add to your potential problems of  inflation later on       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would agree with Governor Partee that the  recent economic news has not been particularly encouraging, but it certainly hasn’t been all bad   I suppose the most discouraging news we received was last Friday’s report on labor market  developments in October  In manufacturing, there were widespread declines in employment in  aggregate man-hours, but the severity of those declines was partly due to strikes     As a very rough guess, we think industrial output last month may have declined by several  tenths of a percent, possibly as much as 1/2 percent  This continuing weakness in the industrial  sector suggests continued efforts on the part of businesses to pare unwanted inventories  That  interpretation, I think, is consistent with the figures we received for manufacturers’ inventories in  December, which showed a higher rate of accumulation than earlier in the summer and  [unintelligible] inventory-sales ratios     For the month of September  Manufacturing inventory for the month of  September  On the positive side, there is some evidence that retail sales except for autos  strengthened in October  The weekly retail sales figures have been moving up, and we received  qualitative reports from a number of retailers indicating that they’re relatively happy with their  present inventory positions, and that sales of apparel have been quite good in October  We also  had a good increase in September in new orders for nondefense capital goods     I do think that we’re probably looking at a smaller rise of real GNP in the fourth quarter  than we had been projecting and possibly even a smaller increase than in the third  But if retail  sales continue to improve and the outlook for capital goods continues to strengthen--if the  indicators continue to show improvement--then I don’t think this recent news of weakness need  have significant implications for the longer-term outlook     That’s correct  There were two things that were big elements in the  wholesale price index in October  One was the rise of natural gas prices and other was the     11/16/76 - 23 -           inclusion in the index of the increased prices of new cars  I have a figure, if I can find it quickly   The increase in wholesale prices of industrial commodities, take out the energy items, in October  was 7/10  Whereas the total was 10  A fairly large part of that increase was for energy items,  and in particular, natural gas     Right  This is an annual revision of the retail inventory numbers that  takes into account principally the annual census survey of retailers, and the revisions went all the  way back to ’74  But the ’74 numbers were not materially different  They were affected mainly  by some changes in seasonal adjustments, which they do at the same time  But beginning in ’75,  the new estimates indicate the progressively larger level of inventories than earlier had been     11/16/76 - 25 -           indicated in the data, such that by March, and still today, the level of inventories is about 3  percent higher than indicated in the earlier statistics     The stock-sales ratios have all been increased by that     Not to my knowledge, Mr Chairman, no  We have certainly looked at  the recent release of the current services budget figures, but I don’t think we have talked  explicitly with them about probabilities for fiscal 1978     That’s correct     I think that’s a real possibility, yes, that the new Administration will be  moving toward higher budget expenditures     No, not at all  The only thing [worse] that I know are the inventories     11/16/76 - 29 -             We make our estimates taking the aggregate growth of the midpoint at  the longer-term range  I have presented, on various occasions, estimates of the impact of moving  from one end of the range to the other  We did not do that at the time of the last long-term  projection meeting because my feeling is that, given the uncertainties about what’s happening to  velocity and what’s likely to happen to it in the future, and given the effects that traditionally are  associated with 1 percentage point more or less money growth, that we’re not giving the  Committee information that’s particularly valuable  That is, the uncertainties are sufficiently  large that these tiny differences in GNP growth that we get adding 1 percentage point more  money growth, 1 percentage point less, are insignificant     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     President Black, I think that is a possibility  We have been impressed,  however, by the fact that this inventory problem has been a very difficult one for businesses  since last spring  We think they are going to be very, very cautious about adding to their  inventories until they see rather certain signs that consumer spending is picking up  An  extremely strong Christmas, stronger than we have allowed for, a continuation of stronger  consumer spending in the first quarter, [those] certainly could do it  I think we would have to  wait and see those results, however, before we became more optimistic on our inventory  projections     It implies some drop in December, yes     I have not made that calculation for the December figure  It does imply  a drop  We had been expecting--     Oh no, they wouldn’t drop below the [permit] level     I’d have to check that calculation, President Black; I’m not certain     We think our projection of housing generally, looking into 1977, is  reasonably optimistic  It does imply a movement of single-family housing starts to levels that  are near the highs of the 1950s  It doesn’t exceed the highs, but--     In response to your first question, the reason that you don’t see more  effect on the unemployment rate is because we looked over our projections of labor force growth  and decided that our projections were simply much too conservative, that we needed to project a  larger increase in the labor force, and we did so quite independently of the additional fiscal  stimulus  The fiscal stimulus package adds, roughly speaking, 1 percent to the level of real GNP  by the end of the year and reduces unemployment by about 1/2 percent, so there is a significant  effect there     We didn’t try alternative packages  My feeling would be that a rebate program of the same  dollar size would have significantly less impact on economic activity because it would lead to a  significantly larger increase in the saving rate  We do put the saving rate up--it rises from an  estimated 6 percent in this quarter to 63 in the fourth  And it would surely go considerably  higher than that if the rebate technique were used     Those are about the right dimensions, President Mayo  We would have  weakened very slightly our projection from a month ago without adding any fiscal stimulus     Largely based on the grounds that, first, we anticipated and built into  our last projection the sort of improvement in final sales and reduction in the rate of inventory  accumulation which we think we’re seeing in the fourth quarter  What impressed us particularly  about the outlook was the weakening of the near-term anticipation for business capital spending  in the first half of the year  We also thought we saw some reasons for thinking that housing     12/20-21/76 - 40 -         looks stronger over the course of 1977 than we had built into our last projection  So we would  have ended up with a little bit less growth in 1977 without the fiscal stimulus     We had the year improving last time  It improves much more now   The principal part of that is due to fiscal stimulus, but we would have had the economy coming  out of the slump and beginning to improve in 1977 in any event     Most of it is  I’m thinking not just in terms of the particular growth  rates for the first quarter and fourth quarter as I am thinking also of what the level of real GNP in  the fourth quarter would have looked like  You get a somewhat different pattern with fiscal  stimulus than without  And it’s hard to say what exactly we would have come up with had we  made a judgmental projection without the stimulus  But roughly speaking, we added a little  more than 1 percent to real GNP, very slightly more, because of fiscal stimulus  And we would  have had a real GNP level two- to three-tenths, perhaps, below that without the fiscal stimulus     That is correct--$15 billion annual rate     We have not done anything formally with that  No, my feeling would  be that, roughly speaking, if you cut the fiscal stimulus by a third, you would be inclined to cut  the impact on real GNP by roughly a proportionate amount  So that, instead of getting 1  percentage point increase in real GNP in terms of level by the fourth quarter, you’d get maybe  7/10  We have not formally tried to assess what the effect of a lower OPEC price increase would  be  We have looked at some model runs, but it is a very complex problem, and much is going to  depend upon the reaction of prices of competing energy items like coal and natural gas  You  have to work it all the way through, figure out how the control program is going to respond, and  we just don’t know yet how much impact that is likely to have     Mr Chairman, may I report to the Committee--I have just received the  CPI numbers, and they indicate that there was another moderate increase in consumer prices for  November  The size of the increase was 3/10 [percentage point], the same as October     Food was down  A little  The commodities less food, however, went  up 4/10, as they did a month ago     My recollection is about two-thirds     I may be thinking of the major cities     I think you’re right, Mr Chairman  There is under way in the BLS a  major improvement project for the wholesale price index  I believe the emphasis there, however,  is in getting better-quality statistics and better industry detail  In the process, they may have  improved the extent to which they get transactions prices instead of list prices  But that is a very  elusive objective     No, that is not necessarily the case  I think in the past six months I  have expressed several times the feeling that the probabilities were greater that our projections  would be too high than that they would be too low  Today, I don’t have any strong feelings in  one direction or another  I think we could be too high on some grounds, too low on others  I  think our projection is reasonably optimistic on housing, reasonably optimistic on consumer  spending; we have a fairly low saving rate  I think in view of the [Department of] Commerce  survey on business fixed investment, you have to call our projection in that area reasonably  optimistic  I think it is probably conservative in the inventory area, may also be conservative in  state and local expenditures     We have the state and local budgets excluding the operational budget moving into  surplus--to the tune of about $6 billion by the end of the period  This is largely because we have  increased grants  But it may be that there will be more state and local spending coming along  than we’ve allowed for  Of course the big thing is how much confidence improves as the  economy picks up, that’s the big unknown  Confidence has been swinging an awful lot, and if  we’re wrong on any grounds, I suppose that would be it     I think Steve may want to comment on that  He’s probably closer to  that area     The level of housing starts does level out; the level of short-term  interest rates does move up enough so that inflows to the mortgage lenders begin to slow in the  latter half of the year  So that, by the first half of 1978, some downward movement in housing  starts would be beginning     Well, I would just like to add, we have not tried to do any simulations,  and for good reason, I think, to see how big a fiscal package you would need, or something of  that sort, to get to a 6 percent growth rate on average for the four quarters and the 6-1/2 percent  unemployment rate by the end of the year  If our outlook on economic activity is correct, you  would be talking about very, very large amounts of fiscal stimulus--so large as to be alarming to  the business community and to the public generally  Much larger than what we have talked  about as an assumption underlying our projection  Now, if our assumption about confidence in  spending plans are quite wrong, and things are building up much faster now than we realize, then  of course it might take no more than what we have assumed     I think that’s a real question, Mr Chairman  And I would answer by  saying you might, but it certainly wouldn’t be of any duration     Well, I don’t think you could possibly get down to--     That would be quite an addition     12/20-21/76 - 48 -           Mr Peret yesterday was adding into our Greenbook projections some  personal judgmental assessment of what the effect of a 5 percent OPEC oil price rise would be     No, and--     We have not made any formal projections into 1978  But let me start  first by saying that I would [not] consider a 6 to 6-1/2 percent real growth rate, even at this stage  of the cycle, alarming  When unemployment is still above 7 percent, when capacity utilization in  manufacturing is still projected to be below 85 percent, I think we could have a growth rate of  that magnitude for three or four quarters with no problem  I do think that this projection implies  a good year for 1978  But I would think that there would be elements in the outlook for 1977  which would be inclined to weaken in 1978--housing would be one, along the lines that  Governor Partee was indicating  In 1977, we are projecting a significant further expansion of  housing; I would think housing probably would be turning down in ’78  The outlook for the  thrust of inventory investment would also be less in 1978, I would imagine, than we have  projected for ’77     And then, if our assumptions about the tax package are taken literally, what they mean is a  reduction in withholding rates beginning in the second quarter to achieve a $10 billion annual  rate of reduction in tax liability for calendar 1977  And that would imply some slight increase in  withholding rates to the beginning of ’78  So all of those things would mean, I think, an  economy which would not get to still higher growth rates but possibly to somewhat lower  growth rates in 1978     Labor force increase?  Yes, we have projected an increase, fourth  quarter to fourth quarter, of 19 million     Oh, it’s much higher than that, for the last four quarters     As I remember, our fourth-quarter increase is around a 27 million rate     That’s right     The public service employment program we put in would end up  adding about 200,000, reducing the unemployed by about 200,000, so that a couple of tenths of  the declining unemployment rate is due to that factor  The rest is due to the improvement in  economic activity  If the economy grows at between 5 and 6 percent, as we projected, it’s going  to have a significant effect on labor demand  It’s going to be a year in which, unless we have  another extraordinary expansion of the labor force, we should make some progress in reducing  [the unemployment rate]     It’s quite a high rate of increase by historical standards, but it is  certainly well below the extraordinary increases we have had in the past year     I think it’s reasonable, but it’s like our interest rate projections   Though it’s reasonable, experience has proved that we are rather bad forecasters in this area     It would be 8-1/4 percent, yes, that’s correct     I am sorry, my mind wandered; I didn’t hear the comment     That was, I believe, in the Redbook, was it not?     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Yes, I have the figures  I just got them a few minutes after I came  down this morning  Real final sales are precisely the figures that we had projected--768, up 48  percent     Yes, it is, to the best of my recollection     I believe that in the short run, a larger increase in wage rates would  tend to have a larger stimulative effect on consumption than an adverse effect on business fixed  investment  But I think the longer-run implications would more likely be adverse  If you have  in mind a time period of two years--a horizon that long--then I am inclined to think a larger  increase in wage rates would [have] an adverse implication for economic activity     For the second year also; this is a two-year package  As I understand, it  is roughly 9 percent in each of the two years and no cost of living adjustment     We have a projection of a fairly moderate increase in real state and  local expenditures for 1977  I think most forecasters anticipate that the state and local sector will  not be showing much strength  Well, I think Governor Lilly is talking about business fixed  capital, and that is independent in the way we look at the statistics  But that is segregated in the     1/17-18/77 - 25 -           national income  There is an offsetting consideration to be taken into account  I think Governor  Lilly’s point is one that needs to be kept in mind--that is the implication of the remarks that I  made at the end of my prepared statement     But again, I would remind you, Governor Lilly, that that’s the sort of thing that we  anticipated last year, and it did not happen  I would remind you also that the [Department of]  Commerce December survey of plant and equipment outlays for the year, which doesn’t have a  long history--we’ve had the record now for about six years--generally speaking does not tend to  underestimate capital outlays  Now it could happen this year  That is the sort of thing we need  to keep in mind and keep watching for over the next few months     I don’t have any feeling for that  Generally, though, my feeling would  be that retailers were disappointed in the pace of sales during the late spring and the summer  months     That could be     Well, I think it is a question of whether or not the rate of accumulation  was too high in the minds of retailers  And since their sales were not performing as they had  thought--since they were gloomy about them--they took actions to try to get rid of those excess  inventories  And the pattern fits in that respect, but it still could be true that retailers had  unrealistic expectations     Yes, by all means     I think there’s some possibility of a downside risk in the first quarter   We had a little better inventory clean-up than we had anticipated, and as I look at both our  figures and those of the Commerce Department today, their figures are not a lot different than  ours  I really think that the revised GNP figures for the fourth quarter are likely to show a yet  lower rate of inventory accumulation  And so I think that would imply some pickup in the rate  of inventory accumulation, perhaps early in the year  But we have the rate going up to $19  billion--1 percent of GNP--by the fourth quarter, and that seems to me to be in the right ball park  if our estimates of final sales are right     Yes, I think that’s a point well taken     May I make one comment, Mr Chairman  A fact which I think the  Committee should keep in mind in thinking about Governor Partee’s comments--and that is, this  $26 billion includes a $10 billion rebate-type payment  If it would be your judgment that rebate- type payments don’t have much effect on economic activity, then you ought to mentally subtract  that as you think about the size of the full employment deficit  That part would be gone the next  year  On those grounds alone, the full employment deficit would revert to $16 billion in ’78     No, I don’t either     Governor Wallich, I think that’s a genuine concern  I think, in  answering that question, one should start by noting that, while we’re in a fairly advanced stage of  the recovery, we still have an ample amount of underemployed resources, both on the labor side  and on the industrial capacity side  I would note also that in terms of the--     Well, it’s less true of skilled labor, Mr Chairman, but if you look at the  unemployment rates for adult men, I’ve always tended to use the rule of thumb that, when the  adult male unemployment rate gets down to about 3 percent or somewhere around there, we’ve  got tight labor markets  It’s now above 5, 5 to 5-1/2  I think there are particular skills which are  in short supply--there always are except in massive depressions--but, generally speaking, we  have an adequate supply of labor and of capacity to move up significantly further  Governor  Partee has noted that the real potential GNP level has been moved down by almost 4 percentage  points  Well, what that does is to move down the gap between actual GNP and potential GNP  from 11 percentage points to 73 percentage points  There’s still an awfully long ways to go yet,  an awfully long ways to go     We have run some simulations, and I put them out without assigning a great deal of  credibility to what the model can produce in this respect  What we did was to take the  judgmental staff projection and then extend it through 1978 by keeping the same monetary  policy and then making the fiscal package for 1978 as close as we could to the spirit of the new     1/17-18/77 - 30 -           Administration’s recommendation, in the sense that we add some more for expenditures and we  don’t repeat the rebate  And what happens when you do this is that you get a growth rate of real  GNP which stays fairly high--it stays in the 5 to 5-1/2 to 6 percent range, somewhere around  there, but it does not lead to any buildup of inflationary pressures  Actually, the rate of increases  in the fixed-weight index goes up somewhat less for 1978 than it does for 1977  It does give--     Recently it’s done quite well  But not over the longer term     During those periods we had most unusual influences affecting the  price--     Pardon me?     Well, it’s a very large factor, but I don’t think one can evaluate a  comment of that kind without recognizing that we went into 1972 with price controls  And the  model was not running on its own  We were making adjustments to the model to try to take that  into account     I’d have to go back and look  The model’s price performance has been  one of its weaker elements  As I said in the beginning, I don’t know how much credibility to  assign to these comments that I’m making about the model’s results       We have thought about that question, President Kimbrel, and our view  would be that, based on what businesses have seen in the past when tax incentives have been put  in place--and I mean by that the tendency for new bills to be retroactive to the first time big  business was beginning to think about this, perhaps the first time they were suggested seriously   So this would not likely be a significant factor in holding up capital spending  We think that the  hold-up in capital spending has been more an aggravation of the uncertainties with which  businesses were looking at the economic and financial climate during 1976--an additional  uncertainty generated by the pause [and] generated also perhaps to some degree by concerns  about where the new Administration might be going     November and early December  And that could be still, you see, quite  a bit out of date in terms of where thinking has gone since then     I think maybe Mr Axilrod is better prepared to answer that  We’ve  been thinking about that in terms of financial market projections     I would want to talk mainly about what I think might be in store for the  unemployment rate in the immediate future  Last year, during the spring season, the  unemployment rate was going down rapidly, in part because GNP was going rapidly in the first  quarter, but also in part because the seasonals were probably out of whack  The reported  unemployment rate was really going down faster than the actual unemployment rate--if we knew  what that really was  I think some of that seasonal maladjustment is showing up in the fourth  quarter of 1976 figures  I think the actual, true seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate is  probably a tenth or two lower than what we have recorded in November     They normally come in February     I have not heard that yet  But that would not surprise me  That’s the  direction we would have expected  Now I think also that when you see a pickup in activity as  we have seen in the last couple of months, you have to anticipate that it’s not going to affect the  unemployment rate in a substantial way for a few months  Initially what tends to happen is that  businesses work their existing employees a little harder to get more productivity, then hours  begin to lengthen a little bit, and then the new hirings begin  So I would anticipate that if this  pickup has some durability, as I think it will have, we will see some better unemployment  statistics in the fourth quarter     The labor force is a very erratically moving series, and it could be  growing substantially next year  We have allowed in our projections for a sizable increase, an  increase of around 2 million, in the labor force  That’s less than what we have had over this past  year  But it’s far above what we used to think of as the longer-term trend  But you’re quite right  that an erratic movement in the labor force during the first quarter, a large increase, could hold  the unemployment rate up     Mr Axilrod, I think, is the person that would have the answers for that     I thought so too     Yes it is, but it is certainly not unprecedented     It’s not unlike, as I remember the numbers, what happened in 1963,  although I believe the pickup there, after the pause of ’61, was even a little more rapid than what  we have had     Yes, they both could  We have expected some decline in housing  starts, largely on technical grounds, in December  I haven’t seen the figures yet, but judging by  the Chairman’s earlier comment, it doesn’t sound as though we made a very accurate decision in  that regard  But I commented earlier, in response to President Eastburn’s question, that I do  think our inventory number for the first quarter may be too low  We put this together and froze  it before we got the November figures on inventories, and they were really quite a surprising  development  If it turns out that December inventories are also negative in real terms, as I think  the November figures indicate was the case for that month, well, then, the prospects for a real  pickup in industrial production and employment and inventory accumulation in the first quarter  are quite substantial     I think it’s a very real possibility, yes     It might, yes  We are going to be contacting the Reserve Banks right  after this meeting this weekend to ask them to help us ascertain what the weather may mean for  production  But I heard on the radio this morning that there are at least four states that are quite  worried  Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania  And we have no experience in terms of  trying to estimate how we are to adjust estimates for industrial production, and I don’t think it  would be wise for us to try  But that’s certainly going to be a negative factor     It’s been going up  I don’t have a figure in my head as to the precise  ratio     It is, it is     You are correct, yes    Mr Chairman, I would associate myself with Henry Wallich I think we are looking at a very steeply declining economy I don't think, however, that a further drop in interest rates is likely to be very helpful in turning the economy around I think what we need is mainly a consolidation of declines in interest rates on things like mortgages and the prime rate to catch up with what has already happened to short-term market interest rates And I would prefer not to be overly impressed with this drop in M1 I remember that Steve in his presentation at the FOMC meeting indicated that some of that drop might well be a consequence of another downward shift in the money demand function So I would rather hang on to the 9-1/2 percent consultation level for as long as we can   Thank you very much   Seconded   Wasn't there another factor going on during that period, though, that affected all of these variables on both compensation and prices? The wage-price control program [affected] 1974 There was an enormous catch-up increase, which inflated the rates of increase; and when that was over, everything settled down again That was an important part of the improvement that took place   Is that really true? If you had a higher productivity growth plugged into your forecast, unless you had a change in the monetary and fiscal policy, wouldn't the main effect of that simply be a lower rise of employment with the same increase in real GNP and hence the same increase in real disposable income? If you look back at the charts, the biggest increase in real disposable income was in '77, when by no means did we have highly favorable productivity developments   If you removed policy constraints and found that policy were more expansive, then you would have a larger rise in real GNP   If it's the official one, it's 51 percent   I have one detail question and then two substantive questions This Administration forecast [that you show] is not yet published, is it?   This is the one coming out in July?   The first substantive question I'd like to ask Jerry On the compensation per hour projection, you noted that one element of optimism isn't in the line shown here--the fact that it includes an increase in compensation due to payroll taxes in 1981 So, in fact, in order to get this performance, private compensation  -18-    7/9/80  would have to improve still more than the line indicates But isn't there yet another element in it in the sense that this year we are looking at a rise in wage rates of roughly 1 percentage point faster than we had in 1979? And that's not showing up in the compensation per hour figures because we're getting a shift in mix, for cyclical reasons, that is going in the other direction In 1981 that shift in mix will not be taking place; on the contrary, it will be reversed   To get the kind of performance in compensation that's shown here we're going to have to have a very significant slowdown in the rate of increase in average hourly earnings adjusted for overtime and mix   The second question I'd like to direct to Mr Kichline In the discussion of the assumptions on the first page, you've noted that M-1A goes up by 4-1/2 percent But the Bluebook says something else is involved that I think we need to be aware of, namely that the assumptions about interest rates that are plugged into the forecast include an assumption that the money demand function drops by 3 percentage points both this year and next So if the demand function had been unchanged, M-1A growth of 7-1/2 percent would be required to give us the same amount of monetary stimulus Isn't that correct?   Thank you   Let me start with the tax issue first I agree with Frank that we ought to encourage the Congress not to consider this until after the general election I think the chances of getting a well-structured tax cut would be much better if it could be considered later this year rather than in the heat of election politics I would like to see a significant part of the tax reduction go to a reduction in payroll taxes, but not all of it We ought to strongly encourage the Congress to allocate a substantial share of the overall tax reduction to business investment incentives because I think that's critically needed for the future On wage-price policy, the way wages and prices behave in a complex modern economy leaves really no alternative but to try to use voluntary guidelines to supplement monetary and fiscal policies I wish I could agree with Governor Wallich that a TIP would work, but I don't see any kind of TIP that is feasible  -38-    7/9/80  So far as the targets are concerned, I want to start with 1981 and work backwards If I have understood correctly, the staff is saying that if we want to keep the unemployment rate from going up further, from roughly 9 percent at the end of 1980, we are going to have to provide for an increase in Ml, however defined--not worrying for the moment about NOW accounts and so on--of roughly 7 percent unless we have a very favorable shift in money demand And Steve is saying that the chances of not getting that favorable shift in money demand are not trivial I would say that, indeed, they are not trivial; it may not happen at all So I think it would be a serious mistake for us to decide at this juncture that we ought to lower the target growth rates for the narrow monetary aggregates for next year I'm more pessimistic than the staff on the outlook for inflation next year But we can't possibly run a viable long-run monetary strategy to reduce inflation if we follow a strategy that pushes the unemployment rate well above 9 percent I just don't think that's viable Now, the logic of my position for 1980 and my interpretation of what has been happening recently says we ought to lower the growth ranges; substantively I agree with Governor Wallich completely But I don't think we can lower them now for the rest of 1980 and then raise them for 1981 So, I would be inclined to leave the targets where they are for 1980; but I would be entirely happy, unless we have a reverse shift of the money demand function, to see the actual growth rate of the narrow monetary targets fall below the targets for this year I would be quite prepared to explain to the Congress that when we have a shift in money demand to pump out enough money supply to stay within those ranges is murder It would just ruin any chances we have for getting inflation under control over the long run So far as M2 is concerned, my feeling is that we have a range that looks inconsistent with the M-1A range and that we ought to be prepared to raise that And if we are reluctant to raise the whole M2 range, then I'd raise the upper end It is a new kind of aggregate   1980 What I would do for 1981 is simply say that at this juncture we have no basis for changing our views on the appropriate growth rates and for now I'd leave them where they are   I would be inclined to raise the range for M2 for 1980 One way to do it would be simply to raise the upper end and say 6 to 10 percent   Yes   I'd be prepared to [accept] that, too   I'm not sure I would want that first sentence   Suppose M-1A comes in at 355 percent for 1980, just within the lower end of the band Would we really want to say that for 1981 our objective is to get a lower figure?   M-1A would come in better only because of what happens to NOW accounts   Mr Chairman, don't the facts indicate that the Committee has not equivocated in that respect? If I remember the numbers right, in 1977 the growth rate of M-1A was 77 percent; in 1978 it was 74 percent; in 1979 it was 51 percent; and in 1980 it will undoubtedly be less yet The problem is, Larry, that money and prices do not track closely together And while that deceleration in monetary growth was taking place, the rate of increase in prices accelerated That's what we have to live with, whether we like it or not   I could certainly agree with your waffle Your waffle I like   What would this mean if the Board staff's projections on M-1A in July turned out to be correct? They're now projecting 87 percent   We'd accept it?   That doesn't bother me when we're looking at an unstable money demand function For a month or two, or maybe for the whole quarter, we may have to do that until we see how this goes   Could we have some more explicit comment by the proponents of this proposal as to what we would do if in fact the aggregates exceed these amounts by 1 percentage point, 2 percentage points, [etcetera] I don't want to see the funds rate go below 8-1/2 percent, but I certainly wouldn't want to see it go to 14 percent between now and [our next meeting]   In this 7, 8, and 8 percent, with 8 percent for M2, is the M2 going to mean anything or is it going to be a throw-in as I--   Would we give these about equal weight?   Well, if money market funds were going up instead of people holding demand balances, I'm not at all sure the implications of that are bad   One thing we want to remember about giving M1 and M2 50/50 weight is that if M2 consists about half of M1, a 50/50 weight means we're giving independent components of M2 a 25 percent weight   Well, I'm using very rounded numbers   I really thought we had enough agreement in substance to leave the drafting of the words to you and the staff, Mr Chairman   Couldn't we put out a statement which said that it's the consensus of this Committee that policy in 1981 is going to aim toward contributing further to a reduction in inflation With that in mind, the Federal Reserve will adopt its specific targets for the aggregates at the beginning of next year, but the objective will be to follow a policy which extends money and credit at rates that are consistent with a further reduction of inflation We could all agree [on that] and make the specific decision later on I think that [squares] with what everybody is saying   I agree, but I think maybe we can get away with that   Well, then he can talk about the technicalities of M-1A and M-1B and so on during periods of--   Couldn't we adopt Governor Schultz's earlier suggestion? Could we agree on that--that we all want aggregate targets for 1981 at or below the 1980 ranges?   If in fact we're going to give M2 some weight in the decisionmaking process, then I think Tony's suggestion ought to be considered Maybe we ought to put it in the body of the operational paragraph instead of hanging it on the end   What about the forecasts?   The public projection that goes up to Congress has an interest rate forecast now that's purely fictitious That is, they are using a rule of thumb which says that for interest rate projections we will adopt the rule that real interest rates are unchanged That [procedure] was adopted two years ago when they had to discontinue using the old rule, which was that nominal interest rates were unchanged So to keep from having to forecast interest rates they said Let's switch to a rule of real interest rate assumptions And that's all that this monetary policy assumption means It isn't a real assumption; it's just a plug   I would hope that would be done just in the [summary], because I wouldn't like to lose that District [by District information]   I would be reluctant to see that I think we do have to make some change, but I am very worried that if we lower our targets too far, we may have to [let money growth] run above them next year Therefore, I'd rather keep the reduction in the range as low as we can get away with So I like the [proposed] range as it stands  SPEAKER(?) We were unable to hear the first discussion   Mr Chairman, I was wondering if we shouldn't talk a little about the way we respond to changes in the demand for excess reserves in terms of the implementation of open market policy It isn't just a matter of letting interest rates move up in response to an increase in demand for excess reserves If we do not treat that as though it were a change in the multiplier and adjust the target for  -5-    8/12/80  nonborrowed reserves accordingly, then we're implicitly changing both our targets for growth of the monetary aggregates as well as the level of interest rates we consider acceptable We wouldn't do that if we thought this was going to be a change of [some] duration for, say, a six-month period We'd obviously make some adjustments And I wonder if we ought to think about the possibility of doing that in the short run, recognizing of course that we'll have to reverse that once it goes the other way I'm curious what your comments would be   Well, we know what required reserves are because required reserves depend upon deposits for a prior period We know what actual reserves are on a day-to-day basis So, as operations are going on, we know what level of excess reserves is building up and we would have to interpret this as an increase in demand for excess reserves Then the question would be Couldn't we respond to this with a recognition that we don't want to have changes in the demand for excess reserves affect either the growth rates for the monetary aggregates or the level of interest rates? There would be no real reason for doing so   I agree, but we wouldn't use that approach for leaving our target for nonborrowed reserves the same irrespective of what happened to other factors affecting the multiplier That's the safety valve we always want there for any basic changes in demand for money that come about   My thought would be that we really don't have to forecast excess reserves What we want to do is to deal with the change in demand for excess reserves as it occurs And as it occurs, we can measure it   You're responding to what you observe as the change in demand for excess reserves on a day-to-day basis You have to be at least one day behind   My thought is that this is really like a change in the multiplier It's a shift in the demand for excess reserves which we do not want to carry through to a change in the growth rate of the monetary aggregates or a change in the level of interest rates So if we see excess reserves building up over the course of a week--to be sure, we're always one day behind--we can make some allowance for it as the week goes on    8/12/80   I don't have any answers off the top of my head But this seems to me something we ought to be exploring as a possibility   Well, Ed's argument is a very persuasive one if what has happened on a day-to-day basis in the reserve period up to a particular point can in no way forecast what is going to happen over the rest of the period or what the average for the whole week is [going to be] That's a persuasive argument for not, in effect, chasing our tail   I think there would be if we didn't take them back out after the demand went down That's only possible if in fact we can use what's happening over the first three days of the reserve period, let's say, as a reasonable approximation for what's likely to happen over the period as a whole What we need to look at isn't just what is going to happen in the last couple of days of the reserve period but what is going to happen over the period as whole Maybe we could take a look at this to see whether or not your hypothesis is correct If it is, then my suggestion has no merit whatever   Is it necessary to think of tying the discount rate just to the federal funds rate? If one is worried about the ratchet possibilities, another way to go is to tie it to some market rate of interest or to a combination of market rates If looked at in that way, it would still be a penalty rate in some sense   Well, I was thinking of tying it perhaps to something other than the bill rate--to a combination of bill rates and other things--precisely because the bill rate is so sensitive to things like foreign demand and technical scarcities in the market   Mr Chairman, another point that Mr Corrigan mentioned, which I think is worth remembering, is that we've had a very marked upswing in the stock market this time in contrast to a very very weak stock market in late '74 and in '75 We were massively destroying consumer wealth in that earlier recession and this time I think we're creating it It would make a big difference if we took that into account, too   I don't think they held up particularly They didn't go down as fast as they did this time, but my recollection is that interest rates started declining about September or October '74 and continued on down into the spring of '75 In terms of timing there has not been a lot of difference, but the speed of movement is certainly [different]   I'd just like to add a few comments I am very much in agreement with the staff's forecast for real activity All the signs are now pointing to a fairly near-term bottoming out of the recession and to the recovery beginning in the monthly statistics before the end of the year, although it may well be that the real GNP figure would be negative for the fourth quarter To comment further on what Governor Wallich was saying, I think the business community learns something a little different from each recession In the recession of 1974-75 what the business community learned was that by Jove they better not have excess inventories They didn't forget that So they are reacting very strongly in this recession, as they did throughout the whole recovery In this recession what I think they will have learned is that they better not borrow at the prime plus 2 percentage points because the interest rate risks they face are ferocious, given the kind of inflation that we have and given the policies that the Federal Reserve is now following That is going to have a very, very sobering influence on planning in the business community in the next several years  I am more pessimistic than the staff on the price outlook for next year I think compensation is not going to moderate as much as the staff indicates More of a rise in prices relative to compensation than the staff has forecast is likely also I think  -21-    8/12/80  that's what the stock market is saying That businesses are going to raise prices to get profit margins up as soon as activity begins to improve That's exactly what Chrysler is doing in pricing its K cars But the price situation for next year poses for us a very profound problem The staff has a weak outlook for economic growth and a very weak outlook by historical standards for a recovery period, despite the fact that they're assuming--with no good basis for it, really, and they know that--that the money demand function is going to shift down again If it doesn't and if prices go up still more than the staff is forecasting, then holding to the kind of targets that we have is going to produce a very, very sick economy It's something we don't have to face as a Committee now, but it's something that is going to give us agony as the next 18 months unwind   First, I'd like to compliment Ed on some perceptive remarks on the interpretation of these numbers This is the kind of thing we always need to watch very carefully to see if we can analyze the particular factors that are influencing the growth rates of these numbers None of them is perfect and we need to try to make some judgments about what is influencing their behavior I guess I don't really understand, Ed, the comments that you made on ATS deposits Let me ask a question first and then ask you to elaborate a bit Do you have hard information on the ATS deposits? Or is this an estimated number based on an assumption that so much of the growth of savings deposits must be in ATS accounts?   Could you make that point again that you were making about ATS deposits?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, I probably am as optimistic as almost anybody around the table about the prospects for the end of the recession in the near term, but it is still a forecast And there is absolutely nothing in the statistics yet that suggests that a turn has occurred We all agree, I think, that the recovery next year is going to be quite weak I don't see any reason at all, therefore, to let interest rates go up at the present time I don't mind staying where we are I don't know if interest rates need to go down to shorten the recession but I certainly don't think we need to knock the [economy] in the head once more and make sure we have killed inflationary expectations I just don't think that's a feasible course We have to remember that the staff is forecasting a recovery so weak that unemployment does not go down at all I think that's as weak a recovery as we need I agree with Governor Schultz completely in that respect But if the recovery is so weak that unemployment continues to rise, then I don't think we're following a policy that we can stick with over the long run That's the only way we can deal with this problem To look at it as a very, very long-run problem and a long- term commitment [on our part] to try to bring inflation down So, I am quite prepared to go with your suggestion of alternative A I would wonder, if we go in that direction, if we shouldn't do something about taking M2 out [as an operational variable] because if M2 keeps going up as rapidly as it has been, we might end up having to turn the screws to push interest rates up And that may not be what we want to do   In the directive we have targets for M2 along with M-1A and M-1B and we're giving the same weight to the three; all three are mentioned in the directive as such So if M2 were to exceed its target level, then we would begin to tighten up again, even if M-1A and M-1B did not  -33-    8/12/80   They will probably also see that M-1A is at the lower end of that chart   What goes with this--"A" or "A minus"?   What's the alternative?   We're giving the Chairman unlimited power!   May I make just one comment? This is Governor Gramley speaking Am I heard out there?  SPEAKER(?) No  SPEAKER(?) Take the chair, the hot seat    8/22/80   Well, one thing that seems to me evident-- unless we have had a major error in our forecast of real activity or prices in the third quarter and I don't think we have--is that velocity has dropped substantially in the quarter I don't see any reasons for doubting the staff's view that real GNP is going down at an annual rate of about 4 percent or so, and therefore we've got only a very small increase in nominal GNP If that view is right, then given the pattern of interest rates, we've had a tremendous drop in velocity in the third quarter Given that fact, we have to ask ourselves whether or not what we're seeing is a reversal, or a partial reversal at least, of the movement in the money demand function that we couldn't understand in the second quarter And if we didn't understand it in the second quarter, we also may never understand its partial move back in the third So I believe we ought to take that into account in our thinking about how to handle this I certainly wouldn't want to send any signals to the market that we regard this as a need for tightening up now And I would want to use every opportunity to keep market rates from moving up too rapidly As the figures on the table indicate, we're looking at an M-1A number for September that is still barely over the low end of the target range   Mr Chairman, if we do that, we ought to be sure we understand what our long-run objective is As I view it, it is not to make the money supply grow by a steady amount quarter by quarter but to achieve a longer-run path of monetary and credit expansion that is conducive both to healthy economic growth and a reduction of inflation I don't see the system as working out unfavorably just because the quarterly pattern is so erratic   Mr Chairman, I'm basically in agreement with the staff's view on where the economy is going In the near term I might be even a bit more optimistic than the staff I've felt for some time that the recession is likely to be short and I think when we look back a couple of months from now we may find that July was the trough of the recession and we were starting to come out of it in August But the long-run growth prospects that the staff sees are not good And certainly the growth of 2 percent is far, far below what we have typically seen for the first four quarters of a recovery I believe we need slow growth, and I'd be happy with 2 percent real growth I do think Ernie is right that we're going to be struggling over the next year I think we will struggle not just over the next year but over the next 5 to 10 years with the question of how we trade off real growth against fighting inflation We're going to have to try to find a policy that will let us stick with the long-run battle against inflation and not try to get it done right away  Now, I want to call attention to the fact that I can agree with the staff's forecast for next year only if the kind of policy assumptions that underlie it [are realized] They include a substantial tax cut at the first of the year and a monetary policy that I don't think is properly characterized as simply saying that M1 grows at the midpoint of the range we've been setting [The reason is that] the staff's forecast hypothesizes a substantial reduction in demand for money I'd like to have Jim expound just a little on his best judgment as to what the outlook for next year would be if in fact that drop in the demand function for money doesn't occur   Why are they hard to believe?   But it persists unless the economy has an even worse performance than that or unless the political pressures on us to give up are so substantial that we cannot persist   This is not a velocity increase; it's a downward shift in the money demand function This takes into account the cyclical movement in velocity that accompanies rising interest rates This series is one that says What would the demand for money be, given both nominal income and interest rates?  -19-    9/16/80   It would be hard to fit that for the whole period and get [meaningful equations] because the co-efficients would be moving You would be averaging through them and you'd get a result that would be neither fish nor fowl It wouldn't pertain to the pre- 1974 period or the post-1974 period   The point that I want to make is that since we're uncertain about this shift--and I agree with you, Mr Chairman, that we just don't know enough to put a lot of faith in these equations--what we're looking at is a policy course that we really ought to be assessing in terms of a potential for real growth at something between 0 and 2 percent We really don't know where [potential] falls in that interval It may fall toward the lower end or it may fall toward the upper end So we're looking at a forecast for economic activity which will produce an unemployment rate that may hold steady or may rise very substantially next year And that is the way we need to assess what we're doing, I think   Mr Chairman, all of us are deeply concerned about the inflation problem; I don't think any of us is more concerned than the others about it And we are trying to find a way to deal with it But we just have to recognize that if we turn this economy around again and promote another decline in economic activity once the bottom has been reached, this country and the Congress may not have the tolerance to let us continue I don't think it will Now, the financial conditions that would emerge under "B" are no longer consistent with the staff forecast The staff's forecast has mortgage rates reaching 13-1/4 percent by the middle of 1981 and [under alternative B] we are talking about a mortgage rate of 14 to 14-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter I just think we ought to move slower than this We will be in real trouble if we push so hard that we  -37-    9/16/80  choke off any possibility of recovery I want a slow recovery; I think we all do But I don't want one that is so slow that the economy ends up turning back down again So, I'm with Governor Teeters I would support alternative A   Well, I think I said something a bit different   May I ask, Mr Chairman, to what specific periods Mr Solomon's and Governor Partee's numbers refer? I wasn't quite sure August-December?  -43-    9/16/80  SPEAKER(?) August-December   No, Governor Partee says his was September to December   What aggregates would you associate with this?   If you start out with "A" and then go halfway between that and "B," that's $700 million on borrowing To go a little further to $750 million--another $50 million in borrowing-- means it's so close to "B" that I am getting very uncomfortable I'm not at all sure that we might not end up with 14-1/2 percent mortgage interest rates on average in the fourth quarter And that just seems to me to be too big a wrench   I'd agree with you if we could just get the sense of it and split it right down the middle between "A" and "B," recognizing that we really don't know whether the recent level of adjustment borrowing has been unusually high and will stay high or whether it will come back down again If we had that general sense without [being precise]--if we took a range for adjustment borrowing of $600 to $800 million and gave the Desk and Steve Axilrod some flexibility to deal with it depending on what actually happens--I could live with that   Do we understand this as halfway between "A" and "B" but with the numbers just rounded to 4 percent and so on?   Can we again have some interpretation of this? This is almost "B," and I thought we were starting out with some sort of compromise between "A" and "B" Plus you were almost willing to increase the lower end of the funds rate range and that's even further toward "B" And I'm just getting uncomfortable   Okay, thank you That helps me   Is it likely to be enough to last us until next month?   Maybe we can get some understanding from the Treasury on warehousing It would be to our advantage to encourage the Germans to continue to follow a more relaxed policy, as Tony has been talking about Given the developments in the world economy, we can't afford to have Germany go back to a very tough monetary policy   What about an arrangement whereby we grant up to $1-1/2 billion, but the extra $1 billion is not used unless we feel fairly certain that arrangements can be worked out with the Treasury, however we work it up That would give us the additional freedom and still meet Governor Partee's concerns   It isn't just a matter of lags It's also a matter of the size of the elasticities and what's happening to transactions demand for money as a consequence of changes in GNP The worst possible implication of thinking through this lag business is that if we have both significant lags and a very low interest elasticity of demand for money, when we try to push the money stock in the direction that's counter to the direction in which transactions demand is going, we don't get a response right away It may push interest rates to a point where the response comes through the effect on the economy later on, in which case we could end up chasing our tail more or less perpetually And that's a possibility I think we have to look at very carefully I've asked the staff to begin looking at this, but it's much more [than lags]; it's a complicated process   Right   They could get worse, yes   You characterized the staff forecast as a gloomy one, Mr Chairman, and I think that's right Indeed, I think the outlook is probably even a little gloomier in the sense that the risks in the forecast are mainly on the down side The staff's forecast assumes a shift in the money demand function, which may or may not happen I have my doubts about it It assumes that the saving rate is going to decline by half a percentage point; that may happen, but I have some doubts as to whether consumers are going to spend that aggressively It assumes that businesses are going to want to increase the ratio of inventories to sales moderately in a period in which final sales growth is extremely weak--and in fact declining outside the personal consumption area--and interest rates are very very high indeed I conclude from this that if interest rates go up significantly further from what the staff has forecast, that we're going to convert growth of 1/2 percent into a recession I think 1/2 percent growth--to respond to Governor Wallich's comments--is appropriate; I don't find that an unacceptable outcome In my view a recession is not going to give us any help in our fight against inflation I don't think the first recession, the recession of '80, did any good I doubt that another sharp recession would do any good I think you are quite correct, Mr Chairman, insofar as the fourth quarter of the year is concerned, that we're probably going to see more real growth this quarter than was forecast That doesn't give me any comfort On the contrary it gives me additional worries, because I think we may find that the demand for money is growing even more strongly than the staff has forecast and that interest rates will have to go up a long, long way to get [growth of the aggregates] within the ranges of either alternative A or B And then we will set the stage for another downturn What I want to do at this point is not to overreact because I believe there is a very real possibility that what you say is correct That we may be caught in a cycle in which the very way we're trying to operate is producing these fluctuations in both money and interest rates and [thus] in the economy  I want to call to the Committee's attention, too, what has been happening to the components of M2 that are not in M-1A or M-1B It's quite dramatic We had an M2 growth rate in the third quarter overall of 15-1/2 percent; that's the quarterly average But during the course of the quarter, these deposits have shown an annual growth rate of 22-1/2 percent in July, 13 percent in August, and 7 percent in September and October There has been a dramatic deceleration; and those deposits are four times the size of the deposits that are in M-1A and M-1B And that's something we ought to take into account in thinking about how hard we try to achieve those targets for M-1A and M-1B in the near future So, I'm leaning toward the easier alternative   I agree with Chuck I don't think we can solve this problem by just picking the level of borrowing If we pick aggregates targets that are likely to be exceeded and the borrowing begins to rise above the level [we chose], then interest rates are going to go way up And then I think we will be in very great danger of precisely the circumstances Chuck is talking about--generating another recession   Yes But your guess is that it probably will come up to the level of "B" and maybe run over   That's what worries me, too And I think what we ought to try to do is find a strategy I don't mind if we don't  -44-    10/21/80  react on the down side If the money supply falls a bit short, that's all right I wouldn't want to react in a downward direction on interest rates But I certainly don't want to react strongly in the direction of much higher interest rates, if in fact the aggregates run over for a 2-month period And I think they might   It seems to me, though, that the issue we're talking about on monetary control is not whether it can be done but over what time period When one looks at what has been happening to the narrow money supply, it went up 19 percent in August, 12 percent in September, and is projected to rise 4 percent in October And the two alternatives we have [in the Bluebook] range from growth of minus 1/4 of 1 percent to 3 percent How dramatic a slowdown could you possibly want? Why do we want to try to force all of the adjustments to what has gone wrong over the whole year 1980 to date into these last two months? It seems to me that we would want to start a course of policy that will bring us moderate growth rates over the next year, the next 18 months, the next two years I just can't see trying to make up for past mistakes in a two-month period   But, Larry, if you remember back just six months ago, the shoe was on the other foot The money supply was dropping like a rock and you weren't saying let's not worry about it We're always too much concerned about interest rates being too high and having negative effects on the economy You were saying let's see how much reserves we can dump in to get money growth this quarter in the immediate future I think that's one of the reasons we're paying for it now We just let interest rates drop too far last spring We got the economy turned around too fast We should have thought then that we needed to play for the longer pull not for next month or the next quarter And that's the advice we need now   It's not just the initial funds rate It's the funds rate [unintelligible]   There isn't any real likelihood that [M-1B] fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter is going to exceed the stated range   How would the Desk react if in fact we get growth in the monetary aggregates a little above the alternative B path or clearly above the alternative A minus that we're talking about here?   I think Governor Partee's and Governor Teeter's point is well taken What Governor Partee is really asking is What underlies our intervention policy? What are our objectives? Should we be using intervention policy to impede progress on the inflation front by [not] letting the dollar appreciate? What are we doing? So, I think some more analysis of the broader context would be helpful   But if we publish seasonally unadjusted numbers, they will be even more erratic And it's true that there will be a lot of seasonal adjustment factors floating around the market But the official numbers put out by the Fed will be even more erratic than what we put out now It doesn't seem to me that we can ever correct the problem that is bothering the market except by not reacting to the weekly numbers the way we do We are [now] causing a problem by reacting to them   Those numbers were around there for a long, long time, John, before we got onto the policy that generated these erratic movements in interest rates It is not the market's fault It is our fault If we want more stability in rates, we know how to get it   We could take the incoming deposit reports, which are on a micro basis, and calculate reserve requirements which are not based on the same concept of deposits that goes into the money supply Then we could if we wished, as we used to do many years ago, just calculate the money supply on the last day of the month   Mr Chairman, I find myself in the unusual position of being sympathetic with some, though not all, of the remarks of Governor Wallich I haven't been with him since last spring, so--   I was, too I don't think we ought to try to prevent a decline in economic activity in the first quarter It's too late for that I think the staff is right that it is in the cards But I believe the staff may be underestimating the severity of the decline that could occur early next year for two reasons One is that when the staff put its forecast together last week, it was able to write "Our forecast assumes a further rise in interest rates" That no longer is true The rise in interest rates which the staff assumed is already here; it has happened So interest rates are going to have  -26-    11/18/80  to decline somewhat from present levels if the staff's forecast is going to hold The second reason is that the staff has built into its forecast for next year, and has continuously done so since early 1980, an assumption that the money demand function is going to shift down That assumed shift, when they first put it in, was a year away But now it is right ahead; it is six weeks ahead If that shift doesn't happen, then interest rates not only are not going to stay at current levels or go down a bit, but as the staff indicates, they will have to go up 3-1/2 percentage points further in the first quarter If we get bill rates in the 16 to 17 percent range and the prime rate in the range of 19 to 20 percent for the quarter as a whole, then peak rates will probably exceed their levels of last spring And then I am not at all sure that we would not be in for a decline in economic activity every bit as severe as the one we had in the second quarter of 1980  Now, we are facing a very difficult long-run inflation problem I don't see any reason for thinking that any improvement has occurred at all yet But it would be extremely counterproductive to follow a course of policy which pushed the economy over the cliff once more I think interest rates are high enough now I don't want to see them decline much; on that I agree with Governor Wallich entirely I think they should stay about where they are but not come down much from here We have recently seen performance in the money measures along the lines that we wanted We're starting to see the slowdown we have been trying to get In the past four weeks, as you indicated, the M1 numbers show rough stability if we balance off M-1A and M-1B I could go with either of Steve's suggestions Either narrowing the federal funds range or setting some upper limit to the growth rate of the monetary aggregates and accepting a shortfall, provided the numbers come out right If I were going to select the federal funds range that suited my predilections, it would be something like 12 to 15 percent Or if I wanted to go in the other direction, I would take the specs of "A" and accept any shortfall in money growth from that   How much lower?  -41-    11/18/80   Mr Chairman, what would happen under these specifications if, in fact, we came out from now to the end of the year with what I would consider to be a very fine performance of the monetary aggregates, ie, no change in M-1A If M-1A were completely flat and let us suppose that in fact $15 billion in borrowing were consistent with the specs of "B," then what we would end up doing I think--if I'm wrong, maybe Steve or Peter could enlighten me--would be taking actions deliberately to push interest rates up further And instead of a federal funds rate of 15 percent we would end up with 17 percent   Should we instruct the staff to calculate the nonborrowed reserve path accordingly?  -48-    11/18/80   Well, it isn't going to happen You have no worries, Henry, between now and the middle of December on how low interest rates are going to go The worry is in the first or second quarter of next year And I think the higher we put interest rates now, the greater the danger is that by the second quarter economic activity is going to be in a nice steep decline and interest rates are going to be falling like a stone We're going to be chasing the money supply The way to keep out of this is, as the Chairman says, to not whack it too much now, to let things settle down We've gone a long way And we have gone a long, long way just since October We've increased short-term interest rates by something like 2-1/2 to 3 percentage points in a month In a month! We've increased long-term interest rates by a percentage point or so, a bit less for mortgage rates Those are enormous increases by historical standards We are really resisting money growth I think the Chairman is quite right in that We're showing our determination And we have let interest rates move through swings since the summer, since recovery began, that are just totally unprecedented Let's wait and see what happens   [Unintelligible]   Mr Chairman, could we get Jim Kichline to interpret for us those [new orders] figures for durable goods? What do you make of those?   I would associate myself with Frank's remarks and Jerry's and Tony's too I don't think there is much that we can do, given the fact that the funds rate is already up at 17 percent or over If we try to push it back down again, in light of these money stock numbers [that would] look rather strange But I do think we have interest rates as high as we need to have them I'm going to believe the [weaker] figures [for the week of the] 19th will [show] up, and I'm going to pray between now and then   This is Lyle Gramley I have said nothing yet, and I am with you I think it's a good way to handle the problem now   What are the numbers for the 26th and the 3rd, Steve?   Mr Chairman, if we raise the limit on D-marks by $1 billion, if we decide to [acquire] that whole amount, we have to raise the limit on total balances, excluding yen, do we not?   The [informal limit relating to the] overall total currently is $2 billion excluding yen   Mr Chairman, I, too, see signs that the economy is catching on to the fact that interest rates are awfully, awfully high and that there's a lot of pain out there And we are getting some weakening I don't see signs of an imminent recession in the numbers, but I agree with the staff that we are going to get a moderate drop in economic activity in the first quarter and probably in the second quarter, too And the outlook for growth in real terms over the whole year is very, very poor The reason it's poor, I think, is basically because we have adopted targets for growth of the monetary aggregates that in a world with 10 percent or so inflation, just don't provide any room for real growth And I don't think we ought to back away from that That's what we've been trying to achieve with our policy this past year I'm not at all convinced that we should be sure the efforts of the new Administration are, on balance, going to be anti-inflationary in 1981 They may be or they may not be I'm prepared to accept a weak economy Like several other people, I want very much to avoid the kind of volatility we had in 1980 I don't think we can absolve ourselves from some responsibility for what happened It wasn't entirely the Fed's fault by any means, but I do think we went way too far in pushing up interest rates last spring We would have been much better off if we had tried to hit our monetary targets over a somewhat longer period If you think about monetary targetry generally, I think you have to come to the conclusion that monetary targetry works best when the demand for money is stable During the postwar period there hasn't been any period in which we have had greater instability of money demand than the years since 1974 And next year, at least with respect to two of the aggregates, M-1A and M-1B, we simply do not have enough information about the demand for money to know where [to set the targets for] those two aggregates If, for example, one were to take the range we had for M-1A in '80 and subtract 1/2 percentage point from it and then take the staff's estimate that the growth of M- 1A will be reduced next year by from 1-1/2 to 6-1/2 percentage points, the range for next year that is consistent with that uncertainty would be -3-1/2 to +4 percent And we have a reasonable chance of--   About the same chance as we had for hitting the range in 1980  -49-    12/18-19/80   For M-1B the same exercise would give us a range of 4-1/2 to 9 percent I think ranges like that are ridiculous And I think the public would so regard them Yet if we put out the kind of ranges we have been putting out in the past couple years, there is almost no hope of hitting them So if we are going to continue to play the game of monetary targetry for 1981, we have to find a monetary aggregate that is not going to be moved around so much by shifts in ATS and NOW accounts Now, I see some thinking going in the other direction in the comments of Governor Wallich, President Guffey, and President Corrigan; and if the whole Committee wants to go in that direction, I would certainly strongly support it But if we want to stay with monetary targeting, I think the way to go is with either M2 or Governor Teeters' suggestion of M-1B plus savings deposits And if you don't like the fact that savings deposits have been very volatile, then what you could do to counterbalance that would be to add all small time deposits Then the aggregate would be M-1B plus savings deposits plus small time deposits The logic there would be that this year when we have seen very steep declines in savings deposits, we have seen accelerated growth in small time deposits And, conversely, when saving deposits have picked up, growth of small time has ceased   Well, it leaves out of M2 money market mutual funds, RPs, overnight RPs, and Euro-dollars   I'm not sure we should But if the argument is that we need something against which reserves are held, this would at least be a start in that direction And I would hope as we go into this year that we take carefully into account Henry's suggestion that we think about what real interest rates are And I hope we try to shoot for monetary targets over a longer period in recognition of the fact that if we try to chase the money supply too closely in the short run, we may end up pushing interest rates much further than we want and much further than is consistent with a fairly stable pattern of growth in economic activity And, finally, I by all means do not want to correct for base drift We ought to start from where we are rather than try to make up early on for mistakes that may have been made in the past   Mr Chairman, what is it that is going to tell the Manager that he is supposed to keep the funds rate closer to the upper end of this 16 to 20 percent range or the lower end? I have problems similar to the ones that Frank has on the corn-hog cycle And if I can be assured as to what is going to lead the Manager to lean toward the lower end-- But this language is so general that I have no idea what it is that's going to prompt a movement of the funds rate toward the lower end   Well, let me ask my question more concretely You're going to make up a reserve path which is consistent with this language Will this reserve path be basically the numbers that appear under alternative B on page 11? I presume it would be If that's the case, my question is Why is it that we are considering changing the federal funds range from 13 to 19 percent to 16 to 20 percent?   Well, I would be quite disturbed about a shortfall, if the shortfall were not coming from a shift in the amount of funds going out of demand deposits into ATS but a slowdown in the economy and if the funds rate were staying up at 20 percent Given the degree of uncertainty about what may be happening, I don't know how this Committee can make a decision without giving the Manager a  -73-    12/18-19/80  lot more instructions about what he's to do with the federal funds rate When the numbers we're looking for--   It could back off from 20 to 19-1/2 percent   The problem, though, is the numbers that are going to be used to make up the reserve aggregates and what the reserve aggregates are going to look like The M-1A number, depending on whether or not one takes into account the staff's estimate of NOW accounts in January, is from -21 to 40 percent The number for M-1B is 46 to 75 percent And I think this--   But that's my whole point My whole point is--  I would be prepared to do that, although I don't think the Committee would But the essence of the arguments that were going around the table was that we have to give more weight to broader aggregates And I think we have to start now If we don't start now, we'll be working with this element of uncertainty--which is going to prevail all year long--until such time as we make our longer- run decision And one way to deal with this operationally would be to say that particular emphasis will be given to M2 in light of the uncertainty in M-1A and M-1B   Can we instruct the Manager to read 10 percent where the 7 percent is?   Does that mean you are going to set the borrowing figure to achieve 20 percent or so?   What was his borrowing number again?   I could vote for 15 percent just as easily   I like Chuck's "days" I'd like to be a bit more specific on what we mean I'd hate to give instructions to the Manager that are so general that no one has the foggiest notion of what anybody means   Which way did the cause and effect run?   First, Mr Chairman, I'd like to add my compliments to those of Presidents Balles and Winn on the quality of this staff study I think it is excellent--perhaps the best that I have seen in 25 years of association with the Federal Reserve   A very good study indeed   I have two questions First, back in the days when policy was run with the federal funds target, staff studies here at the Board indicated that if we switched from a fed funds target to a reserves target, there wasn't really any reason for thinking that we would improve our precision of monetary control There wasn't anything in the law of economics on how financial markets operate and how financial institutions operate that would improve the precision of monetary control by going to a reserve target And I take it from this staff study that that conclusion still holds   Second, I recognize that it certainly would have been difficult, perhaps even impossible, to ascertain whether or not these short-run fluctuations--week-to-week and month-to-month--in long-term rates such as mortgage rates and so on affected adversely the volume of investment That empirically would have been hard to pin down But there isn't any real doubt as to the direction of influence, I would think Wouldn't you expect that to increase the cost of doing business? It would increase the riskiness of investment and, therefore, would tend to have a negative effect   That's not my point My point is that at a given level of long-term interest rates, rates are fluctuating more; so an investor cannot know what his cost will be at the time he's going to finance, and that will tend to have an adverse affect I don't know how big, but it can't be helpful   I'd like to argue the case for going back to the federal funds target, not because I think the Committee is likely to agree with me or go in that direction but because I think the value of using that technique needs to be kept in mind when we ask ourselves what we are doing with the present technique or how we are going to improve it First, we have to recognize that the way we communicate our [policy actions] to economic activity today is through movements of interest rates Interest rates are the cutting edge of policy We have eliminated almost completely the changes in credit availability that were so important in years past And I think one could argue that it's unconscionable for the central bank not to be concerned about the cost of credit, the cost of money, when that is what is communicating its effects to the real economy  Second, I would argue that increasingly over time in recent years we have found that instability of money demand has become a  -31-    2/2-3/81  very, very large problem in an operating technique of this kind I'm not at all sure that that is going to go away It may well be a characteristic that's endemic in a system in which there is so much inflation that interest rates get to a point where people are moving assets from one area of the financial markets to another and where financial institutions are innovating to make this possible We may find that five years from now we have problems every bit as large as we face prospectively in 1981 in trying to interpret what is happening to the narrow money measures  Third, as I mentioned, I think under present institutional arrangements we can operate to control the growth of money quite as precisely with the federal funds target procedure as we can with reserve targets Finally, I think it is important that this technique we adopted does indeed communicate a lot more of the variability in interest rates in the short-term end to the long-term end And, although we can't measure it, it does have some adverse effects on investment proceedings Even if people could hedge this interest rate risk, they are going to pay to engage in this hedging transaction Mr Chairman, I think you are right--and this is what we need to keep in mind--that there really is only one reason why we should have abandoned the federal funds target procedure to go to the reserve target And that is because if we operate on federal funds, we explicitly take responsibility for what is happening to interest rates and then this becomes a very, very difficult world to live in But we need to keep that in mind If that's the reason we are on this new strategy and no other, then we can go about conditioning how we apply the new strategy in ways to take advantage of the economic aspects of operating on a federal funds target   The one thing to keep in mind about any significant change in the administration of the discount window or the arrangements by which banks and other institutions can come to borrow is that if we want more monetary control precision, we're much better off to stay where we are than to introduce a system that is going to take six months to a year to figure out   I want to reformulate one of these [questions], if I may On the question of whether we should make an adjustment to the nonborrowed reserve path in a different way than we've done before, I think that could be addressed most fruitfully by saying What sorts of responses should we try to incorporate into the operating procedures that push the money supply back toward the target level when it drifts off? I say it this way because I think one can conceive of this as being done in two different ways One is to adjust the nonborrowed reserves between meetings more; and the other is to have the Committee focus on where we are at each meeting and where we want to be And the latter will give us greater Committee involvement, I think   We can address this in 1 or 2 percent--   We're obviously going to word this to make it available for public use as soon as possible There's a great deal of interest in it; there's a lot of good material I think it does credit to the staff and to the Board I think it really goes a long way in answering many of the criticisms   I think the fact that the Committee has to get together once we run into the upper or lower end of the range is a useful procedure, even if the Committee decides ultimately to raise or lower [the band] It requires careful thought and another round of decisions, and that's the sort of thought [process on] interest rates that I think is important The Committee ought not absolve itself of responsibility for what is happening in the credit markets Though I think probably lowering the ranges would not be a good idea in terms of public--   Narrowing the range, I'm sorry I wouldn't want to lower interest rates at this time, as a matter of fact I don't think narrowing the range is a good idea, but I wouldn't want to widen the range because I do think that Committee review is a useful function   I'm not quite sure how plus or minus 300 basis points from the current level differs from the range of 600 basis points around the current level   It seems to me, however, that the market is going to interpret your suggestion in a very different way If the fed funds rate on the day of the Committee meeting is 1742 percent and we say 300 basis points on either side, the newspapers would say that they have figured out that the Fed's range is 1442 to 2042 percent It makes a lot more sense to say it's 14 to 20 percent I think that's what they're going to do Then if we start playing games and say we're going to narrow the range down to 200 basis points on either side because we don't want rates to go up too far, they're surely going to say we are playing the rates instead of the money supply   Instead of lurking in the background, they have lurked in the foreground   Milton Friedman would argue that we should impose the least cost on the private sector, too, except in this case   What Henry is saying, I think, is that for any given degree of precision of monetary control, we will have less variability of interest rates Or, for any degree of variability of interest rates, we get more precision of monetary control In other words, what is going to happen to the demand for reserves is that under present circumstances the demand for reserves has elasticity which depends only on the elasticity of demand for excess reserves What this is going to do is to introduce into the overall demand for reserves an elasticity which comes from the demand for money So overall demand for reserves will be a little more elastic with respect to interest rates than it was before   We were setting fed funds rates then and [experienced] no problems   On the basis of cost to banks alone   What do we gain in terms of what you want for monetary control? That's why we're doing this   If we go ahead and lag it all over the place with carry-forward and carry-back, the whole purpose of considering reserve requirements--   It seems to me, as a minimum, that we need to ask the staff to take out the components of M2 that are not in M-1B and subject them to some analysis of their cyclical pattern What does it look like? How sensitive are those components to rates of interest and so on? There are some things that go in opposite directions   We cannot create one internally without also making it available under the Freedom of Information Act   Well, that's fine But then we probably will have to go to Frank's procedure of targeting on M2 because we won't have anything that is a weekly number   I don't have any basic disagreement with the staff projection But if you look at what is likely to happen over the course of the four quarters this year and to fiscal policy in the latter half of the year, it seems to me that we face the real possibility that aggregate demand in the latter half of the year will be considerably stronger than the staff anticipates, at least in nominal terms And that will put considerably more pressure on prices and considerably more pressure on interest rates I say that because if you look at the staff projection of the high employment surplus or deficit, it switches from a $19 billion surplus in the first and second quarters to a $22 billion deficit in the third and a $14  -93-    2/2-3/81  billion deficit in the fourth In other words, virtually all of the effect of that fiscal policy on the tax side goes in immediately but the effect of the budget restraint is much delayed Of course, what will be happening at that point is that no one will really know whether these intentions on the expenditure side are in fact being realized if the tax cut goes through So, I could be one of those outliers at this table on the price side I think we're going to be looking at a GNP deflator that has not shown any signs of deceleration during the course of 1981 and a CPI which might well be accelerating again as a consequence of the effects of both rising interest rates and some pickup in economic activity At some point during the course of 1981, we're going to have to ask ourselves how long we can stick with a policy posture that is simply not doing any good whatsoever in bringing down the underlying rate of inflation because the fact of the matter is that what we have done so far has done no good at all I'm not saying we ought to quit, but I think we as a Committee are going to be facing a very, very grim set of economic statistics with no real hope that the underlying inflation rate is going to improve   No, I would certainly agree with that It has prevented the underlying inflation from accelerating It would be somewhat higher today--not much, but somewhat It moves glacially, not in large amounts And if we like, we can take credit five years from now for preventing the underlying inflation rate from having gone up to 15 percent instead of 12-1/2 percent But if the unemployment rate at that point is 10 percent or more, I'm not sure how long we can persist   I wonder if it wouldn't be helpful also, to reduce the confusion as much as possible, to focus exclusively on M-1B as the number for narrow money and to think about dropping M-1A altogether   The reasons aren't entirely extraneous If we put on monetary restraint--   Mr Chairman, I'd like to pick up on the thought that Ed Boehne laid out That we ought to focus very, very carefully not just on the original perceptions that the public has of whether or not we've lowered our targets and your problems--and you're going to have plenty explaining this to the Banking Committees--but also on the perception of policy as the year develops If we think we faced a credibility problem in 1980, we have seen nothing yet It's going to be potentially 10 times as large in 1981 Consider, if you will, what will happen if we publish a range of 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-1B The first month of the year we had growth of 16 percent It was 16 percent the first month! Furthermore, our expectation is that if we hit the midpoint of that range, the fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter increase will be 6-3/4 percent If Ed Boehne is right--and I  -123-    2/2-3/81  strongly agree with him--we're much more likely to end up at the upper end than the lower end of that range So the public is going to look month after month after month at an M-1B number that is growing, let us say, at 8 to 8-1/2 percent on average, while the upper end of the target range is 6 percent I just don't think that's viable The same argument in reverse is true with regard to M-1A  So, if we're going to put out ranges, we really have to go for the bottom line We have to tell the public these ranges are enormously uncertain but are our best guess of what we think actually will happen this year This isn't just a matter of public perception It is, as you indicated, a fact that we are going to be terribly uncertain ourselves as to what these numbers mean And how the heck we can conduct monetary policy sensibly with monetary aggregates, when the monetary aggregates are just literally off the wall, I do not know But it seems to me that Frank Morris has a good suggestion As a minimum, we should put principal emphasis on the monetary aggregate that is least disturbed by these transitional phenomena that we're dealing with, which would be M2 I don't think we can drop M-lA and M-1B I wouldn't go that far; I think we have to have some narrow money figures But I would go for using M2, announced as our principal target I think we ought to go with the staff range for that on page 6, and I would go for alternative I rather than alternative II Looking at history, we find that broad money as presently defined in M2 has a rate of increase that tends to be 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent on average above the narrow money numbers So I think we can justify that upward movement in the range for that reason Additionally, when we're going into a period in which the attractiveness to the public of one element of M2--NOW accounts--is increased, that is going to attract some funds from elsewhere into M2, so we can justify it on that grounds, too So, I would go with an M2 range of 7 to 10 percent, using that as the principal one, and using the ranges for M-1A and M-1B in alternative I with a statement at the bottom of the page instead of in the middle of the page And I would use the left-hand side rather than the right   May I take up on that point? The staff forecast with the 7 to 10 percent range for M2 is for an increase in nominal GNP of 96 percent and a decline in real GNP of 8 percent Now, I think it's a question of whether we want to aim as our central point for -08 percent, or essentially -18 percent, for real GNP growth in 1981 Both of those imply restraint The question is not whether we have restraint but how much I too think, as Nancy said, that inevitably we're going to be leaning more on M2 as the year goes on to guide ourselves and to explain to the public what we're doing because M2 is the one aggregate that's going to be most robust under the kinds of institutional changes we're looking at If we can get away with the presentational problem initially, I think we should go up to 7 to 10 percent as a more meaningful number for M2 if we lower the narrow aggregate ranges 1/2 point We'll regret it later on if we don't   But that is assuming essentially no rise in velocity We could have a decline in M2 velocity for the year because of what is happening to the MMCs and the money market mutual funds-- the increased attractiveness of this particular aggregate relative to market securities because of NOW accounts There are all sorts of reasons for thinking that might happen   If you take the past 10 years, the average annual growth rate of narrow money is 6 percent; the average annual growth rate of M2 is 9-3/4 percent   Not every year, no It's awfully hard to argue that this year we ought to see a substantially narrower range of growth between M2 and the adjusted M1s   He said half to two-thirds will be saved We've got to accommodate that   If we get a tax cut for business and it's retroactive to the first of the year, it's going to provide businesses with funds to finance their capital investment, and the mix of borrowing will shift toward government   The easiest time to do it is right now in expectation of that tax cut and to do it accompanied by a reduction in the narrow money ranges   I think Mr Mayo's argument is an excellent one It's a really good excuse It's the best one, or the only one, I can think of It's a stroke of genius We have a tax cut coming along and it's expected to add to savings; and we've made allowance for it   Certainly that's not inflationary, is it? More savings? We're all for it   M2 has not received much focus   Over time it will But I think we can sneak in an increase in the M2 range now if we lean on the savings argument   Better than what?   There really isn't a lot of usefulness in having an M3 target that's higher than M2   If the staff forecast is half right, over the next year the growth of business loans is going to be held down severely by the lack of inventory investment That's in the approximate sense the most important thing that affects business loans Without the business loans, the banks aren't going to borrow  -143-    2/2-3/81  unless there's a very big difference between the prime rate and market rates, and that's not very likely   It seems to me that you could state your point on M2 a little differently and say that if in fact we get a significant volume of savings coming out of the tax reduction, it may well be that M2 would go up   I have a poem [about] what could easily make it all wrong  Let's rely on the broader definitions While eyeballing the level of rates And pray that the economy does not suffer The worst of all possible fates   If I understand correctly what is in the Bluebook on page 14, both "B" and "C" could likely result in some upward pressure on interest rates, though "C" more so than "B" And I don't see why we would want to adopt an alternative at this point that would result in upward pressure on interest rates, given the anticipation that the monthly pattern of economic activity will be weakening in the course of the first quarter   I'm not certain about it, but it's close to my own prior view of where the economy is going to go in the first quarter   When people say between "B" and "C," there is such a large gap between them--   I would go with "B" I would be willing to live with some shading on the down side of "B," if that's the way others vote I wouldn't push interest rates down deliberately to get numbers as high as "B," if they came in below that But I wouldn't like to see interest rates go up in an effort to try to squeeze the growth rate down much below "B"   The 15 to 21 percent range is all right   It seems to me that in the world of uncertainty in which we are living--with this very, very rapid transition from demand deposits and other accounts to NOWs--the worst thing in the world we can do is to tell the Manager and other staff to speed up this adjustment process to uncertain numbers Let's wait until the end of the month and take a look at it   I think you'd be better send him up to testify!   Well, I certainly would go along with a level of borrowing that's lower   It's pretty hard to guess We're talking about $250 million from borrowing None of us knows the accuracy of our forecast of borrowing so we don't know who is going to be right   That's a good compromise   I think it would make good sense to--   Henry, I've compromised my principles on M-1A, M-1B, M2, and M3 You ought to be able to compromise yours on the base   Well, I haven't talked yet, Mr Chairman This is Gramley I support your approach I think it's important to recognize that either we're looking at very, very artificial statistics or we're looking at a very, very substantial drop in the money demand function And in either of those cases, that means not reacting in ways that could generate problems for the future, I think, [in terms of] letting interest rates go down a lot further than they already have So, I would say Yes, let's go your direction Let's meet fairly promptly again, however, if in fact this approach leads to further declines in interest rates   I have no strong opinion; I can go either way   Mr Chairman, one way of handling Governor Partee's point is to talk about uncertainty in interpreting the M1s   Mr Chairman, Lyle Gramley I would support that We have a piece of information coming out this week on Friday-- the employment report for April--that will be quite useful in finding out whether our judgments on the second quarter are right or wrong In general, I think the economy this year has been a lot stronger than anybody had expected The first quarter may get revised but, if it does, it could just as well get revised up as down The inventory figures assumed for March look funny And I have come to the conclusion that interest rates are not high enough yet to control either economic growth generally or money supply growth in line with the Committee's desires So, I think it is time to move now on the nonborrowed reserve path Then, if on Friday we see figures on employment that indicate that the economy is still going like gangbusters in the second quarter, we can take the next action that is, to change the fed funds rate range   Mr Chairman, Lyle Gramley I think you have a stronger case for the way you want to do this We've been trying to argue that these are not ranges that imply a constraint; they are a checkpoint And what we have done, if we go this route, is that we have demonstrated in effect that this is not a binding range but a checkpoint By implication, we have consulted with one another and have agreed to let the Manager continue to operate in ways that are based on reserve growth and not on interest rates   Lyle Gramley again I was sitting here trying to think of some wording that would be more amenable to the group Perhaps we could say something like "Recognizing that market rates may stay near the levels of recent days and that the federal funds rate may be somewhat above the upper end of the range set at the last FOMC meeting"   The range "adopted"?   I deliberately stayed out of the talking stage and in the listening mode because it seems to me that it's more difficult than I can ever remember to know what is happening by looking at the statistics from here in Washington and by using the typical technology of forecasting, either models or judgmental  -7-    5/18/81  forecasts The economy just isn't behaving the way it used to I think the staff is basically right, however, that we're looking at an economy that is quite strong The areas of weakness that we do see-- and we are seeing some weakness in the housing industry and the auto industry, which is being reflected in the employment statistics and to some degree in industrial production--are in credit-sensitive sectors To the extent the economy is being restrained at all, it's being restrained by monetary restraint, by very high interest rates What the staff is saying, in effect, is that interest rates will simply rise however far they have to rise to get nominal growth of GNP down to the 8 to 9 to 10 percent range or somewhere around there And I think the only issue is whether or not the staff's forecast of interest rates is right The staff's forecast of interest rates, in comparison with the major outside forecasters, leaves no doubt that outside forecasters aren't anywhere close to being correct if the staff has the basics [right] on where the economy is going The staff has interest rates on Treasury bills continuing to move up through the last three quarters of 1982, hitting a peak of around 17 percent; they are moving up gently but continue to move up The mean of other forecasters has the peak of interest rates in the first quarter of 1981 and coming down to about 11-1/2 percent by the end of 1982 That's why I think we're seeing a major difference in what forecasters see for the outlook from now until the end of next year The economy is very strong, and I don't think we are likely to make a mistake at this point of overrestraining it unless we take very drastic action on top of what has already been done   Well, Mr Chairman, I think the mood of the Committee is becoming very clear This is a Committee that follows a tough policy It's only a question of how far we go I share the general view that I believe prevails here that we're dealing with a very strong economy and that our problem this year in terms of the  -32-    5/18/81  monetary aggregates is primarily making sure that we don't overrun the upper ends [of our ranges] rather than the other way around But I want to call the Committee's attention to the fact that we have essentially one alternative that implies no change in money market conditions and that's "A" The other two are both tougher And if my sense of relationships is correct, the borrowing numbers we're associating with "B" and "C" are not by any means associated with the midpoints of the federal funds ranges that we're talking about here The present level of borrowing is less than $2 billion Under "C" that would go all the way up to $3 billion And if we go that far, I think we're going to end up having a telephone consultation by next Monday, if not earlier We have done a lot of tightening recently, and I think we ought to try to keep that degree of tightness and perhaps go somewhat further But I wouldn't want us to get into a situation in which if some temporary weakness in the aggregates does develop, as Governor Partee suggests it might, we would end up running interest rates back down again That would be quite unproductive, if the Committee's diagnosis of the economic problem is a correct one So, I think the better alternative would be to stick with "B" and then come back a month from now at the next meeting and go further if we need to   What is the purpose of putting the rest of the language in there? If we say 3 percent or lower, what function does the rest of this language serve?   To get [a growth rate of] 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less for March to June, we are going to have less than 13 percent for April to June That bothers me; it seems to me that we are putting in figures that are really not consistent with one another   But that first "lower"--the phrase "an annual rate of 3 percent or lower"--connotes that I wouldn't have judged that the Committee's view is that [M-1B growth of] 1 percent or less is what we are really shooting at And 13 percent or less is what we'd have to get if we are going to get 5-1/2 percent or less from April to June   I don't have any objection to that, but what that postulates is that we hope to have another downward shift in the demand function for money And if we do, that is fine and the money numbers will look better Unless we get a very marked turnaround in the behavior of the economy in the near term, what that would imply is that the money demand function is not behaving as the staff has assumed I don't know why we would want to wish for something like that That really doesn't do any good; it just makes the numbers look better   If we are going to say "or lower," that second sentence is already implied, it seems to me   What would you guess that would be?   I have a suggestion, which incorporates Governor Schultz's thoughts and I think gets around the points that both you and Governor Partee raised It reads as follows "The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with the federal funds rate persistently outside a range of __ to __ percent"   Well, I don't think we ought to deny the Chairman the opportunity to make a decision on his own   Exactly the same, but it leaves in the reserve path and the monetary aggregates, it lets the Manager for Domestic Operations make the technical decision, and it says the Chairman "may" call a consultation   "The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of _ to _ percent"   And I think it's a clear statement of what we're trying to accomplish and what is available presently   It's just a matter of wording, really   But this is supposed to be the operating paragraph of the directive   Have we ever had a 6-point range before?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  SPEAKER(?) Yes, we have   Mr Chairman, may I call your attention to the second line of the general paragraphs, which I think is not entirely consistent with the views of the Committee on what is happening in the economy It says "suggested that real GNP will probably grow little in the current quarter" That sounds like an awfully flat economy   This is a fairly optimistic group I would say "suggested that GNP will grow more slowly in the current quarter"   It's in the second line of the general paragraphs   Or even, if you like, "will grow slowly" "Grow little" sounds as if the economy--   I don't think one ought to look at the fact that American industries are becoming less competitive as an altogether undesirable thing in the sense that this is one of the ways in which the incidence of monetary policy shifts and gets moved around from those industries that are heavily dependent upon credit to others The problem as I see it--and this is where I would agree with Tony--is that the lags in this whole process are very different What may well happen is that two years from now we will be looking at a current account deficit of enormous magnitude [that is] slowing the economy down a lot, and we will be driving interest rates down because we're trying to keep our own domestic economy going, thereby aggravating our inflation problem because of what is happening to the exchange rate It would be a lot better if we could smooth this process out a little through intervention policy   Mr Chairman, does it make any difference what we think?   I would be very happy to go back to the old way of doing things, if it could be done without a fight with the Administration I can't think of grounds on which I would less want to do battle than this one   Unfortunately, if we wait that long we could figure, as Tony indicated earlier, that we wouldn't have the foreign central banks on our side any more It's going to be a lonely battle to fight I think the die is cast; there's not much else we can do   It's plotted wrong It's plotted in the middle of the period; it should be plotted at the final period   Do you really mean a decline or a reduction in the rate of increase?   But there are possible adaptations to this forecast, setting apart the collapse of the thrift industry--or assuming that the thrift industry is handled by merging three-fourths of them into banks or something like that You could make this forecast work by pushing up the deflator somewhat so the real interest rates don't look quite that fierce and by shifting the mix of GNP If, for example, we got a substantial consumer anticipatory response to a 3-year tax cut and less housing and less business fixed investment, we might get 1 percent [real] GNP and a somewhat higher deflator; the overall outlines might work But then we'd still have to worry about how to handle the collapse of the thrifts and what sort of additional structural damage would be happening I agree that we are looking at a situation in which very, very substantial structural damage is probably ahead if this is--   What kind of increase in velocity are you talking about, then? Well over 10 percent?   If you figure out how to make that work, it would be great It's the kind of thing in which you've not looked at the specific [unintelligible] about the implications for money demand How is it that you get this sort of money demand relationship with interest rates declining? If you have a big shift in the money demand function, then it will work Otherwise, you're sort of out in limbo   I put down numbers for 1982 that are not a lot different from what the staff is forecasting My real growth number was 1 percent; my implicit deflator number was, as I remember, 8-1/2 percent or somewhere around there But I put those numbers down with a lot more foreboding than has been expressed in some of the comments around the table, because I think those numbers are realizable only if we get very, very lucky and have a big shift in money demand or if we have a sequence of developments in which we get more consumption than the staff is talking about and a lot less investment, with all that means for potential problems for the future Particularly, I want to call the Committee's attention to what I think could be a degree of self-deception That is, we have to be awfully careful about what we're accomplishing, if in fact we live within our targets of money growth but get a lot more effective increase in money because we've had big downward shifts in money demand I don't buy the argument, for example, that because nominal money growth is actually falling we can get declining inflation but because we're getting such a big drop in money demand we can also get real growth That in effect says somehow that the inflation rate is some mystical property of expectations and has nothing to do with what is really going on in the economy I don't think it's going to happen that way Inflation is going to come down if, and only if, we're awfully lucky and at the same time have very, very constrained growth in real economic activity We'd be very lucky indeed to get the kind of improvement on the inflation front that the staff is forecasting We will get it only if real growth is constrained to somewhere around where we're talking about I worry a lot about the implications of interest rate levels that persist at where they are now for another 18 months I think we're really looking at major, major problems ahead   Foul ball!  SPEAKER(?) It sounds like you're getting [unintelligible]   I'd like to say a few words first about how I get to where I am It's useful for thinking about ranges in the future to remember that we are dealing in a world now in which the money demand function has been shifting all over the lot And I agree with Tony that one can't make interest rate forecasts from the money growth ranges under these circumstances without having a great deal of uncertainty But I wouldn't express it the way he does I don't think we ought to take these interest rate forecasts with a grain of salt I think we ought to look very, very carefully at the possibility that they may be right and at what that means for the selection of ranges It seems to me we are looking at an economy with some very strong increases We have a lot of expansive forces going on, but the economy is being held in check by very, very tight monetary policy High interest rates have slowed economic growth essentially to nothing And if interest rates went down a lot, the economy would bounce right back again On the other hand, I also think we have real interest rates where we want them now because we are making progress on inflation If one believes the staff is correct that we are going to make more progress over the next 18  -42-    7/6-7/81  months, we are going to have a rather dramatic shift in expectations about inflation That means that unless nominal interest rates come down as inflation subsides, we are going to have real interest rates increasing substantially We are going to have a lot tighter monetary policy than we really want If nominal interest rates come down, then the downward shifts in money demand that we have been experiencing in the past several years are much less likely to occur I'd like to remind you of how much this has meant for the course of the economy this year If you look on page 6 of the Bluebook, you find that over the fourth quarter of '80 through the second quarter of '81 shift adjusted M-1B went up 22 percent at an annual rate But if you add the 5 percentage point shift in the money demand function that took place, that number converts to 72 percent The point is that we may not be anywhere near that lucky in getting downward shifts in money demand in the future  So, I think Chuck Partee is right We may be sitting on a situation in which, in order to keep interest rates from going up like gangbusters, we have to permit a lot faster money growth than we have had in the first half of this year That means to me that we should stick for '81 with the same ranges we have If we are fortunate and money demand continues to move down, growth will come in near the lower end of the ranges If we are not so fortunate, we may end up with growth over the four quarters more like the midpoint of the range I would leave M2 alone; I don't think we need to change the M2 range And I would be inclined to abandon altogether the actual M1 range along the lines that Steve suggested For '82, I would be leaning in the direction of something like a 3 to 7 percent range for M-1B and maybe even 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 because I think we have seen somewhat of a change in the relationship between the two-- although heaven knows, developments may come along that would alter those relationships between now and then I'm wondering, in light of the uncertainty with which we've been looking at these M-1B numbers, if we ought to be thinking over the long run of leaning more heavily on a broader aggregate such as M2 and perhaps indicate in our announcement this July that we are thinking along those lines   I find it very persuasive You ought keep on   Well, Mr Chairman, I think we as members of the Committee are indulging ourselves a bit in picking and choosing from these various alternatives in trying to get a package here I'd like the monetary aggregates to come in low and interest rates to be a little lower and the economy to keep going where it is I don't know if we can get there from here   I would suggest something along the following lines Using the aggregates of "B," a federal funds rate range of 15 to 21 percent, a borrowing figure of $1-1/2 to $1-3/4 billion, and an understanding that if the aggregates fall short and that does not  -63-    7/6-7/81  happen in the context of a weakening economy, we let them I am prepared to see actual money growth well below where we are targeted so long as it reflects a downward shift in money demand And that's, in effect, what I'm saying If we get a continuation of the downward shift in money demand and, therefore, low growth in the aggregates, I would not fight it But I would like to see us arrive at some agreement that if in fact the staff is right and we get a reversion of money demand to what normal relationships would suggest, we won't let interest rates go up a long way   I can look it up Six months this year over last year's is plus 63 percent The second quarter of this year relative to last year is [plus] 74 percent   Then the year-over-year will be--   Let me ask for a staff interpretation of the consistency of a borrowing number of $1-1/2 billion with a midpoint of 19 percent on the funds range I thought when we last talked about a funds rate in the 19 to 20 percent area we were talking about borrowings of about $2-1/4 billion I think we're talking about numbers here that are just inconsistent with one another   I don't   One thing that I think would [address] the concerns of a number of people is [to agree that it] would be a signal for a consultation also if we were to see some significant weakness in incoming economic statistics and at the same time a weak M-1B number   I think your earlier suggestion of perhaps putting something about the quarterly average in the operating paragraph would be very useful   I much prefer language that would suggest something below the upper end of the range   May I just ask what the logic of this is? Is this just an empirical result or is it an argument that the income elasticity of demand for household deposits--   This would mean you are moving the midpoint of the range down by roughly 1 percentage point and possibly more   And the movement down from the present figure is just 3/4 of a percentage point   I would be much more comfortable with 3 to 6 percent I think we're building trouble for ourselves You're right, Mr Chairman We'll probably not [unintelligible] today when the relation between money growth and GNP is going to revert to something more nearly normal, given the reduction of inflation But that isn't going to happen all at once; it's going to happen progressively If the rate of inflation comes down and nominal interest rates fall and we keep real interest rates where they are, the target next year--even the same target--will be more binding in terms of its meaning for economic activity than it was this year And that's going to be increasingly the case, if one takes into account the fact that it's--   But that ignores the shift adjustment that has been taking place This year we will be adding roughly if we haven't already--if the staff is right and we have no further shift in money demand--about 2-1/2 percentage points of money growth, effectively, that doesn't show up in the numbers And one needs to take that into account There is just as much effect on the economy from a 1 percentage point drop in money demand, given the money supply, as there is by adding 1 percent to money supply, holding demand constant It has no different effects on output, employment, prices, or anything And we just can't count on this concealed money growth; sometimes we don't even want to recognize it ourselves, but it is happening It's not going to continue to happen unless this process of innovation develops new steam   To some degree, yes But the staff has pointed out that this process of innovation is stimulated by the move of interest rates to new peaks Following new peaks we have this burst of innovations which then settles down We had it last year in the second quarter; we had it in 1975-76; we had it again in the first half of this year And while it will continue, it will be at a much slower rate   It is It's about 75 by most estimates   Oh, for velocity, sure It's only a question of the rate of increase in velocity There's a trend factor that  -84-    7/6-7/81  would take place even if there were no innovations because the income elasticity of money with respect to real income is less than 1   3 to 6 percent would be a reduction of 1/2 percentage point   But you could also argue that M-1B doesn't make any difference Whether our money supply comes in at 2 or 3 percentage points above what is otherwise stated, what difference does it make if we have more money or more velocity? It all accomplishes the same objective   Well, you slip into that sort of argument that somehow the economy will always manage with whatever money we put out If M-1B is that elusive in terms of its relationship with GNP, then the proper interpretation is that we ought not to be targeting M-1B We ought to be looking at what we think is relevant   It's only the upper limit that is really binding   We gain so little by lowering the lower end of the target [M-1B is] running below the lower end of the target and everybody is saying right now "Gee, the Fed is doing great" If it ended up the year below 3-1/2 percent, I doubt that anybody would be seriously concerned about it as long as the economy--   Well, I would wonder about the wisdom of making an immediate adjustment in nonborrowed reserves given just a couple of weeks' numbers My own reading of the economic numbers that have been coming in since the last meeting suggests that the situation, if anything, is a little weaker than we were looking at We've had car sales continuing very low We had a pretty good increase in inventories in May and the inventory/sales ratio is rising Industrial production is down; it now looks as though we're going to have a decline in industrial production in the third quarter rather than an increase I would hope we might wait another week and see what the figures show before we jump too fast   Governor Wallich, I'm not sure at all that one ought to accept the view that a looser relationship between the fed funds rate and other rates of interest is desirable If one could argue that what we're trying to do in the short run is make reserve demand and reserve supply come into balance and one can do that with the federal funds rate alone, then I would perceive the wisdom of your argument But I doubt that that's the case, because very  -6-    8/18/81  fundamentally the demand for reserves depends on the demand for deposits And the demand for deposits will depend on a whole spectrum of short-term interest rates other than just the federal funds rate So, I'm a little concerned about our ability to get where we want to go, not just in the longer term but even in the shorter run, in regard to control of the monetary aggregates if the relationship gets too loose   How long has it been going on?   Even the corn-hog cycle is supposed to be damped!   I'd like to ask a question of either Steve or Jerry, or both, relating to what interest rates are implied by the forecast not just for the next few months but on into 1982 How do they relate to the interest rates assumed a month ago, particularly if we're looking at a situation in which our projections of real interest rates are continuing to get higher and higher and higher?   It's $106 billion That's fiscal year?   Mr Chairman, you invited some comments about the economy and I just asked a question earlier I would like to say a few things about where the economy is going Basically, the staff has the right handle on the immediate future I'm not so sure about the longer-term future, but then I really don't see how the kinds of real interest rates we're projecting can be tolerated for that long a period of time But quite clearly, there is not a recession under way We have an economy that is quite flat, with a lot of mixed signals coming in from different sectors and a lot of geographical diversity I see evidence of substantial improvement on the inflation front, a good deal more than I had expected over the course of this past year I don't think we can say anymore that we don't have any signs of improvement in the underlying rate We are seeing significant signs of wage moderation I'm going to reserve judgment until I see the employment cost index for the second quarter before I decide how much, but there is quite clearly improvement under way And I think expectations about inflation are changing; I just don't think one can look at what has been happening or talk to the business community and say that they aren't changing I don't get the same impression from talking to businessmen now that I did six months ago And when you put those--   Well, that may be I put this evidence together and I don't come to the conclusion that Governor Wallich does That because bond rates got high, we shouldn't worry too much about that because that means expectations of inflation are still strong If expectations of inflation are improving and our operations are keeping short-term rates at historic peaks, then one has to expect that long-term rates will stay there too, until such time as short- term interest rates begin to come down So I think we ought to be looking more carefully now at what is happening to interest rates than perhaps we have needed to up to this point because the behavior of the money aggregates is becoming increasingly difficult to interpret And when we have difficulty interpreting the aggregates, I think it's incumbent upon us to see what signals interest rates suggest about the impact of monetary policy on the economy   I bet our staff's estimates of total credit flows for the last half of this year as a proportion of GNP are nowhere near the peaks that we have seen in past years Isn't that right? These numbers look big because we have a huge deficit in the  -19-    8/18/81  federal budget And one of the major reasons, though not the only reason, we have a huge deficit in the federal budget is because the economy has been very sluggish and revenue growth has been slow I can recall the same sort of argumentation going on in the first part of 1975 when people said it was impossible to bring interest rates down because the federal deficit was so big The federal deficit is not the only factor that affects the interest rate It's one of them But a major reason why interest rates are high is because we have had a monetary policy that has been very, very tight in the context of an economy that has been relatively strong But it's an economy that is showing a lot more signs of weakness, an economy that is looking--   Well, you work on the supply side; that's the answer   I don't agree with that What I believe has happened in the past that has led people to that thought is that when we've had very, very large increases in the stock of money, it has primarily come from the demand side And the markets have reckoned with the fact that they know we are going to lean hard against that and, therefore, that interest rates will begin to move up   Alternative A has 10-1/2 percent for M2   But we wouldn't know whether what was happening in August is going to make that much difference in the Q4-over-Q4 increase   But we would presumably be looking at an M-1B that is equally below the lower end of its bound Your projection for August is what--$424 or $4245 billion or something like that for shift adjusted M-1B?   That's still $45 billion below the lower end   If M2 crept up above or up to the upper band from Q4 to August, I wouldn't think one would be unduly excited about that  -32-    8/18/81   Except that last month we were looking at a situation in which we thought that nominal interest rates were going to end up somewhat lower than they were at the time of the FOMC meeting In fact, they've ended up somewhat higher with the exception  -33-    8/18/81  of the funds rate That's something, it seems to me, that we ought to take into account in thinking about where we want to be I agree with your general prescription of what we ought to be aiming for I don't think we know enough about the trends in the economy to make any significant change from what we wanted a month ago But what we wanted a month ago was not higher nominal interest rates And that colors my thinking It seems to me that we ought to do something like Tony is suggesting and put in a "significantly" above the upper limit for M2 to give us a little flexibility there, particularly in light of these developments regarding the small savers and all savers certificates, which are going to have effects on M2 that are awfully hard to predict   The markets surely are going to remember the decision to aim toward the lower end of the range for '81 and to  -35-    8/18/81  revise down the figure and establish a target for '82 which was still lower It occurred at the same meeting   My concern is not so much that we adopt something by way of a directive that will assure a drop in interest rates What I would like to see adopted is a directive that makes sure that we don't have a rocketing upward of interest rates just because M2 is above the upper end of the range If your concern is that you don't want to change the wording of the directive now because of the signals that may send, that I can understand If we can just have an understanding among ourselves that we will tighten if M2 is  -37-    8/18/81  significantly above its range--if that's in our minds--then, fine I would be very reluctant to see a marked further increase in interest rates just because we have one month of big money supply numbers This is a projection You've said that many, many times yourself As yet we only have one week's data for August; we have some partial data for the second week We don't really know what is going to happen We may have a sudden reversal And I just don't think we ought to jump to hasty conclusions about the need for tightening just because an M2 number happens to go above the upper end of the range   What is the projection for M-1B for August? Is it the same as in the Bluebook, 11 percent? Is that what we're talking about?   It is a current projection as well as a target?   It's okay with me I think there's a broad agreement with this sort of formulation so long as we have some understanding that the mere fact that M2 is starting above the upper end doesn't lead to an unusual--   Mr Chairman, I hate to do this, but I have one other small technical point on line 6, where it says the increase in retail sales reflected some recovery in sales of new cars It's probably more used cars than new I would suggest it say "some recovery in sales at automotive dealers," which is more likely to be the case   We're possibly moving along--   One wants to remember also that historically numbers of failures have not been procyclical; they were countercyclical for many, many years The reason was that when business activity speeded up, the rate of business formation accelerated and there were so many new firms coming out that there tended to be more failures But when there is a prolonged period in which the rate of net business formation is low and there's a very sharp acceleration in failures, I think it is an indication of growing difficulty The other thing that ought to be said is that one knows just from raw logic about interest rates that small businesses will have difficulty when they are paying 20 percent for credit and are looking at a rate of increase of basic industrial and service prices of between 8 and 9 percent You can talk all you want about how the interest cost is less taking taxes into account; but as a firm gets closer and closer to the edge, the less relevant this tax calculation becomes and the more the firm is going to be staring at the need to pay 20 percent for credit So, just abstracting, the problem has to grow and grow and grow as time goes on It's not surprising that Ed is finding more and more signs of this   Well, I want to compliment Mr Axilrod on his statement this morning I've heard him and his predecessors make many statements over the years, but I don't think I've heard a more weighty or meaty set of comments given to this Committee I particularly liked his comments about the need to look at what is going on in the real economy to make some ultimate judgment   That's particularly apropos when these monetary aggregates are so slippery and so difficult to interpret I think we have ended up with an economy that has had more restraint on it during the course of this year than we had expected earlier And, frankly, we have had more restraint than I personally would have wanted in the sense that I think our objectives over the long run are not likely to be maximized by permitting the economy to slip into a couple quarters of negative growth like this If we could somehow fine-tune--and I'm not suggesting we try--and keep the economy growing at zero or a slightly positive rate, I think we would be better off The pressures to do something to turn it around are going to intensify if we continue to have negative growth The structural damage that is being created is also growing, and I strongly agree with Ed Boehne that we have a real problem there  [Steve's] comments about M2--as to why M2 can be a very slippery guide--I thought were particularly interesting When we watch M2 and try to limit it, we induce innovations that in turn tend to make M2 continue to grow As a consequence, interest rates go up and that weakens the economy So, if we slow the growth of M-1B even more-- I look back at the past couple of months and I wish I had listened to my colleague, Governor Partee, about why we need to pay more attention to M-1B in a period like this I think one of the things we need to do in our decisions today is to make sure we don't do what in effect we have done in the past couple of months, which is literally to ignore M-1B We have given almost entire weight to M2, the way the period worked out That wasn't what we intended, but that's the way it happened I don't think we can adopt a policy today that is designed to make M-1B get back up in the target range by the fourth quarter or by December That would just induce a collapse of interest rates We would have the economy growing like gangbusters in the first half of next year and then we would be in real trouble But what we do have to do, I think, is to make sure we pay more attention to M-1B than we have in the recent past   Maybe we ought to have him repeat it It was a good point   Well, I can tell you what I would regard as the negative consequences, and that is that I agree with Governor Schultz that we have the potential for a big breakthrough on union wages next year Union wages have gotten way, way out of line with non-union wages You close that gap in one or two ways Either non-union wages catch up or union wage growth slows down We need a very sluggish economy in 1982 to make reasonably certain that that gap is going to be closed by a slowdown in union wages But I don't want an economy that's sluggish by having it nosedive and then come roaring back again   Why not all?   Well, I'm worried about the economy going down deeper than what the staff has forecast before it comes back again I don't disagree with the overall forecast, which goes to 1982, but I think we are looking at a prospective weakness that may be of larger dimensions than the staff has put down on paper yet In adopting a directive this time, I think we've got to give more weight to holding up the growth of M-1B and focusing less on M2 than we have in the  -33-    10/5-6/81  past I would do that by going back to a formulation in which we incorporate both M-1B and M2 into the initial stipulation rather than having a proviso clause for M2 We ought to avoid a 1980 kind of drop in interest rates, but I don't think any drop in interest rates is going to be damaging to us Some drop in interest rates in the context of a weakening economy and very slow growth in M-1B is essential if we are going to maintain a public posture that it isn't very heavy handed inflexibility on the part of the monetary authorities that is causing all this damage So, if we could get to an agreement on directive wording which places some additional weight on M2 [rather than have M2 in a proviso clause], then I could buy something like halfway between "B" and "C" I think Frank has made a good point That lower limit on the funds rate in "B" of 11 percent is quite low I could go with something like a 12 to 17 percent range   I'd take it out of the proviso and put it up on a collateral basis with M-1B   Oh, yes We'd specify reserve aggregate behavior consistent with growth of M-1B and M2 at such and such percentages, respectively, taking into account NOWs and all savers   Your worry that we may have a weaker economy is a real one, Tony, and I share it And we don't want a precipitous decline of interest rates What would happen is that it would trigger a consultation   We would have to ask ourselves at that point if the incoming news was sufficiently weak that we ought to lean in the direction of slightly lower interest rates or not So, we'd revise our targets   Does a 10 percent number for M2 mean that we take out of the actual number whatever we're attributing to all savers in there and the 10 percent means an underlying growth of less than that? We'll get, I think, very [unintelligible]   Quarterly average, Steve, or for 3 months?   But if we stick that in the proviso clause, then in effect what happens is that the weakness in M-1B has a very, very small influence on what happens at the Desk I think we have to give more weight to what is going on in M-1B The danger that you worry about we handle with the consultative process by specifying the federal funds rate more tightly   I think the argument was reasonably solid a month ago--what Governor Partee put forth--but I just didn't go with it But the argument seems to me overwhelmingly strong now when the M2 number is being affected by something that we simply cannot measure We will have no idea for some months, if then, what the all savers certificate has done to that number  -46-    10/5-6/81   Well, if we don't put in anything for M2, then no one knows definitely how to interpret any words we might use If we use words and M2 growth goes up to 15 percent, what do we do given those words? If it goes to 10 percent, what do we do? We have to be able to specify what specific action will follow upon a particular pattern of growth of M1, otherwise M2 will be totally ignored If we totally ignore M2, then what will happen is that M-1B will become the only target of policy And then we have the possibility of having a tremendous decline in interest rates So, it seems to me that the reasonable way out of this is to put M1 and M2 on a collateral basis in the directive and specify something about the uncertainty with which the M2 number is going to be [viewed]   Well, if we narrow the fed funds range somewhat, that's in effect what happens   What would go with that, then an $800 million initial borrowing level and a fed funds range of what?   Well, the Chairman said at one time either 12 or 13 percent at the bottom   That's quite acceptable to me   Well, some of the things I'm going to say echo what Fred has just said As I listen to the staff, they are telling us, I think, that we are in a classic recession now It is quite pervasive across sectors; it has cumulative characteristics, but the economy is by no means falling apart We are not looking at a 1974- 75; we're not looking at a second quarter of 1980 I find myself in broad agreement with that, and I think that is what the tone of the Redbook is saying also But, frankly, I don't like what we're going through I would much rather have seen a continued more or less sideways path instead of heading into a recession If we look back at what has been happening in the last two years, we find that the economy got too weak in the early part of 1980 and it got too strong in the last half of 1980 and then it was too weak again In all candor we have to acknowledge that the behavior of financial variables has been principally responsible for that I don't think we ought to cast any blame If I had been responsible for running the whole thing myself, I don't know that I could have done any better and I may well have done worse  I certainly agree with Willis Winn's comments that we're looking at the behavior of a measure of transactions balances that we have not the foggiest notion of how to interpret But I don't think the answer is simply to recast our statistics, because what we're going through is a wholesale change in ways of portfolio management on the part of both businesses and individuals And it's going to take a long, long time for this to shake down until we finally understand what these monetary aggregates mean I think what we have to do is to take into account what is happening to interest rates, at least to some degree; and there just isn't any doubt in my mind that interest rates have gone through much too wide swings in the past couple of years In retrospect, I come to the conclusion that when we let the fed funds rate get up to the 18 to 20 percent range, the behavior of the economy subsequently has become too weak And when we let it get down into the 8 to 10 percent range, the economy has become too strong Now, those are rather wide limits, but somewhere between those two limits is where we want to be  I agree with Mr Axilrod's comments that the economy is different now than it was in the second quarter of 1980, so we're not going to see the same kind of response that ensued upon removal of credit controls when interest rates on short-term securities were slightly below 10 percent But let us remember also that we have an enormous amount of fiscal stimulus coming along in the latter half of next year, and that's going to work the other way And I agree with Ed Boehne that we have a lot of pent-up demand out there that could begin to affect the economy if interest rates come down a lot further  The most important policy question we need to focus on as a Committee today is how far and how fast we want interest rates to fall  -18-    11/17/81  from here I would remind you that interest rates are already lower than the trough level of interest rates that underlies the staff forecast The staff forecast has a trough level of Treasury bill rates--that is, on short-term securities--of 11-1/2 percent in the first quarter of 1982 We're already below that I think we will see a significant further reduction in important rates of interest like mortgage rates if short-term rates stay where they are for a while It may well be that some further decline in short rates is appropriate, maybe even desirable, but we need to be extremely cautious in how far we let them go because inevitably if the economy begins to recover strongly, with a combination of a relaxation of financial constraints and fiscal stimulus, the rates are going to rocket back up again   Well, in nominal terms, 10 percent--  -31-    11/17/81   I would agree with Roger, and I would prefer the 11 to 16 percent I do think the alternative formulation, the first one that you read, is awfully fuzzy It's sufficiently fuzzy that I don't know whether anybody would know exactly what we're talking about   That 9 to 15 averages 12, not 13-1/4 percent   I share Jerry's views all the way I could buy the idea of keeping a 7 percent path instead of a 6 percent path and putting in a contingency clause to the effect that an overrun would not be resisted in any way But the idea of too disorderly a drop in interest rates at this point is the most important thing   I agree   I could buy Ed's formulation of $400 million and 7 percent with a 10 to 15 percent federal funds range   $200 million is--  -49-    11/17/81   Yes, it's a lot of borrowing   Well, it seems to me the more we go for the reserve path under alternative A, the greater the likelihood that we're going to run into the frictional level of borrowings very soon If you can agree with the staff's forecast that the actual money growth is more likely to be "C" than "A," and then you say to yourself that, if anything, we're more likely to come in below that than above it, you've really compounded the problem that I've been worrying about by selecting 8 or 8-1/2 as the money number on which we calculate the nonborrowed reserve path Although it's true that it's only $40 million on average for the full month of November, it's going to accumulate to a lot more than that on an ongoing basis by the fifth week of this period I think it gets to be a rather significant difference   Do you mean 7 percent for October to December?   September to December you calculate at 8 percent   Well, I don't know how that relates to what we've been talking about   Well, I don't understand why we want to deviate so drastically from the kind of operational directive we typically set up In effect, we're using language that doesn't have any meaning to me And I don't know how it will have any meaning for somebody on the outside Why [don't] we go along the lines of what Fred was suggesting of specifying for the directive that we're seeking M1-B growth of 7 percent between October and December?   Or somewhat higher   Then we know what we're talking about   That's the one thing I can agree with   I certainly can go along with that   We could say "while noting the shortfall in October"   You're going to drive the monetarists up the wall with that In the context of a weakening economy and declining interest rates, we'll accept shortfalls from our targets   I know I'm not a monetarist I was just thinking about those sensitive ears out there   We'd have to drop out the language "seeks behavior of reserve aggregates" Or maybe we wouldn't   It gives us a little breathing room   It's the bottom end--   The fed funds rate?  -65-    11/17/81   To maintain our credibility in fighting against inflation at 16 percent  \  In the earlier part, in the general paragraphs of the directive, there needs to be some reference to the elimination of the surcharge You have a sentence here which is "On October 30 the Board of Governors announced a reduction in the Federal Reserve basic discount rate from 14 to 13 percent" I would think we'd also want to add that "on November 16 the Board announced the elimination of the surcharge"   Mr Altmann called to my attention that we have had more than one change in the surcharge since the last meeting We'd have to do more than put in this suggested elimination, so I withdraw my suggestion  -68-    11/17/81    Or we stand ready to intervene    12/21-22/81 -3-    12/21-22/81   Well, some of this is showing up now There is much more improvement in manufacturing wage increases this year than anywhere else That is where the big improvement has come; it's in the average hourly earnings index   For raw industrial commodities, we are now back to something like [the level of] the middle of 1978   When we removed the wage and price controls in the spring of 1974, what happened immediately thereafter was a catchup burst of wages If you look at a chart on wage rates, they were rocketing upward and then the rate of increase came way, way down But a very large part of that reduction in the rate of increase in wages was nothing more than a termination of the round of wage increases that ensued after the wage and price controls were removed So, you can't look back at the 1974-75 experience   April 1974   As I remember, by about the third quarter of 1975 the annual rate of wage increase got up to around the 12 to 14 percent range There was actually an acceleration of wage increases during the recession It wasn't until afterwards, once the recession was over, that it began coming down; then we began to get the big downward adjustment in the rate of increases in wages  -14-    12/21-22/81   [I'd say] that, if anything, we are likely to go through a recession this time which is worse, or somewhat worse at least, than the average postwar decline We are talking about something that is quite pervasive and quite deep If memory serves me, the average postwar decline in real GNP is about 2-1/2 percent What we are looking at is a forecast of about a 2 percent decline, which is a milder recession than the average in the postwar period Now, recessions come in all different sizes, so this is still a classic recession; there's no question about that But I have a hunch that if things work out differently--and they always work out somewhat differently than anybody expects--the area I worry about that happening in is business fixed investment And I think Mr Kichline is right that if we are in for a surprise there, it will be a surprise in which the drop in business fixed investment is significantly worse than the decline of about 4 percent we are now forecasting I think businessmen are very, very pessimistic for a variety of reasons One is that they look for a future of real interest rates that potentially will stay up at extremely high levels because of huge deficits in the federal budget And they are pessimistic because they have been through a 2- to 3-year period in which each time the economy has gotten off the ground it has gotten slugged in the head again and gone right back down They are pessimistic because they are looking at very, very low levels of capacity utilization And they are pessimistic because in some areas of the country we have had such [economic] devastation So, I think we are going to see a bigger drop in business-fixed investment than this [forecast] We are likely to see a first quarter that looks very, very bad--considerably worse than what we are now forecasting--and it may stretch out into the second quarter before we begin seeing things turn up again   The staff's full employment budget calculations show a switch of around $48 billion from the first half of '81 to the last half of '82, with most of it coming in the latter half of '82 And that is something like 1-1/2 percent of GNP That is a pretty good kick from the fiscal side And I think Chuck was right that it is something we need to keep in mind as a source of stimulus as the year goes on I don't think we really are too far apart, Chuck; I do feel that the recession is going to end and we are going to have recovery   Your point is very well taken   I just want to say a word about credibility and what it means in terms of selecting targets for next year I think credibility is terribly important I do think we have improved our credibility enormously but we ought to understand why and what that has to do with the selection of targets next year We have gone through a two-year period in which the first year M1-B ran way over the target and the second year it ran way under the target M2 ran  -26-    12/21-22/81  over in both years The fluctuations in the money stock have been greater since October of 1979 than they ever were before; so have the fluctuations in interest rates And somehow we have come out ahead I think the reason we have come out ahead is because in the pre- October 1979 period, whenever the System was faced with a choice of erring on the side of opting for a lower unemployment rate and more inflation or the reverse, it opted for the former; and in the post- October 1979 period, we have said we are going to opt to hold the line on prices and take a higher unemployment rate That is basically what the markets are telling us That is basically why we have had the improvement in confidence We have run a much, much tighter policy  So, what we ought to do is try to figure out what sorts of targets we need for 1982 to run the kind of monetary policy we think is sensible and worry less about the announcement effects or the reactions of the financial markets or the public On M1-B, although Frank has a point that we need to worry about the possibility that demand for M1-B will run over a 5-1/2 percent upper end, I think the bigger likelihood is that we will have trouble holding M1 growth up to 2-1/2 percent because so many of these innovations, which have just gotten started, will continue So, I would be prepared to live with the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range [adopted tentatively in July] And if it runs below, I don't think that is going to hurt our credibility On M2, though, so many things are happening that to hold to a 6 to 9 percent range runs the danger of having an M2 figure that is again way, way above the target And I think we could raise that range to 7 to 10 percent or 6 to 10 percent or something like that without doing our credibility any damage at all   And if they can't?   Shift-adjusted?   I wonder if anybody has noticed how beautifully we have come out by way of the performance of nominal GNP in terms of deceleration Page I-V in the Greenbook shows the fourth-quarter changes Starting from 1979 it shows 99 to 94 to 91 to 86 percent Now, that is about as good a target for nominal GNP as one can possibly imagine--fortuitous, but very well balanced   I'd like to say first that I don't think anything we do here today is going to help this recession come to an end soon It's going to run its course for a while I do believe that if we are not careful in the selection of where we go, we could draw out the recession and make it longer Therefore, I want to avoid any alternative that would result in rising interest rates at this stage I think that would be a grave mistake What we ought to be aiming for is to set the stage for a recovery later this spring but one of moderate dimensions We ought to be very careful to avoid the kind of problems we got into in 1980 I'm cognizant of the enormous  -53-    12/21-22/81  uncertainties we face in interpreting the monetary aggregates, not only in the long run because of these tremendous innovational changes but also the point you made earlier, Mr Chairman, that we have something going on here in the OCD area that we ought to be awfully careful with I would opt for alternative B I could live with a somewhat lower borrowing level, but $450 million or $400 to $450 million is acceptable I would say, however, that in addition to adopting the specs of "B" for growth rates of M1 and M2 we ought to be willing to live with a larger increase in M1-B if it results from the kind of increase in OCDs we've been seeing recently, which we have a reasonable basis for interpreting This parking of funds while there is uncertainty is clear   Yes, that's all right; I would go with that   I tried not to use--   Wasn't this partly a consequence of very little demand for excess reserves?   As long as we have this around 4 percent, I'd--   An alternative is 5 and 9 percent with an understanding that we may get even more than that   I think Chuck's point is very well taken We're looking at a growth rate of M1-B shift-adjusted in our thinking whereas we are now targeting on non shift-adjusted The difference was 3 percentage points That is quite--   It was 111 versus 88 percent in the month of November, and that is a huge difference   I don't think that interpretation is necessary any more than it meant we were going to revise the targets on M1-B when we put a number like 7 percent for M1-B shift-adjusted during the summer or early fall   Well, we could say that the growth rates implied for January and February, given the present estimates, would be below 9 percent I really think we can handle that   You are full of Christmas spirit!   It is better not to start down that route because if we do, then we do have to stamp them as official  SPEAKER(?) Yes  -78-    12/21-22/81   Put them out now and if [no member of the Committee] has looked at them, they are purely staff documents I think we are safer that way than to start trying to hunt down those people who might remember   The Federal Reserve's recession hasn't hit yet!   Well, I think one of the answers to why real rates are so high is contained in one of the charts that the staff had in its briefing [to the Board] this morning I don't happen to have it with me, but it showed the components of GNP and the trends in those components over time It had consumption going up like [a rocket] to 65 percent [of GNP], the highest ratio since 1948; it had defense expenditures going up from something like 4 percent to 6 percent, as I remember the numbers, and investment dropping out of bed In effect, what is happening is that when we have a fiscal policy that stimulates consumption and is designed to increase defense expenditures, real interest rates have to go high enough to hold down the rate of business fixed investment to the point where it will fit within the monetary growth assumptions provided If you look at the numbers for monetary growth and nominal GNP, you find that strategy one provides for an increase in velocity of roughly 4 percent in 1982, 3 percent in 1983, and 38 percent in 1984; it's 33 percent on average And what has to happen, if we're going to get a better economic performance than what the staff has provided here, is that we have to get awfully lucky and have another one of those big downward shifts in money demand That may happen, but I think the staff is quite right in saying one can't be sure   It looks at it in a different way It says when we have a combination of--   I wouldn't subscribe to that theory at all   I don't subscribe to the theory that you get the same nominal GNP no matter what fiscal policy does   A lower nominal GNP with a smaller deficit, right   You get more unemployment and somewhat less growth Yes   In the short run But you'll get an economy--   Well, over the long run--and by long run I mean over the next 20 years--if you believe that prices are sufficiently flexible, then the real GNP will be related to productivity and real resource use   This is year-over-year as the chart reads?   Well, I have several things on my mind One is that I think we're in a real box and we have a way to go with the monetary aggregates in 1982, M1 in particular Given what has happened so far, if we were to reach the midpoint of the range by the fourth quarter, we would end up permitting an increase in M1 of all of 155 percent from January to November And I just don't think we can live with that With M2 I haven't made the calculation, but taking a rough ruler and laying it out and comparing it with this 6 percent growth triangle, to get to the midpoint must imply a growth of something like 6-1/2 percent from January to November I don't think we can live with that either   If we want to get to the midpoint of a 6 to 9 percent range, starting with where we are in January, a rough guess is that it must be around 6-1/2 percent Have you made that calculation, Steve?   Unless we're awfully lucky, I'm afraid those growth rates are not going to permit the economy anything like the kind of progress this year that the staff is projecting We need to think seriously about doing something that will give the economy some breathing room Also, I think this year we ought to start out giving more weight to M2 than we have We ought to express that publicly so that the focus of attention is not all on M1 as it has tended to be recently And I think there's a way to rationalize John Balles' suggestion that we raise the target range for M2 that's different from the rationale he uses, and that is that the increasing interest- sensitive component of M2 has probably raised the income elasticity of demand for M2 If you look back at history, the studies of demand for M1 and demand for M2 have always come out that M2, the luxury good, has an income elasticity that is bigger than 1 and M1 has an income elasticity of considerably less than 1 The main reason was that M1 didn't have interest payments on it and M2 did But as more and more assets that are interest sensitive are shifted into M2, the chances are that its income elasticity has grown And I [considered] the fact that Fred Schultz has said we will have some adverse reaction in terms of loss of credibility if we adjust our targets But I said at either the last meeting or the previous one, I don't remember which, that I think our credibility basically doesn't depend so much on these targets and whether we stay within the ranges from one month to the next as it does on the basic fact that we've been following a very tough and tight monetary policy since October of 1979 That is what has gained us our credibility If we stick with that basic posture, we will still have credibility I think we ought to give serious  -36-    2/1-2/82  thought to the suggestion of raising the M2 target range to 7 to 10 percent And I think we ought to go further than just raising the bottom edge of the M1 target I would prefer to do something like using a different base--starting out with the lower end of the range for 1981 as the base figure rather than starting from the actual   Unfortunately, we have to make the judgment in terms of what we decide for the long-run ranges   Well, you have to adjust M1 the same way You just take the difference--the amount of shift adjusted in that period   It sounds too messy   If you want consistency, you follow Governor Teeters' suggestion Use the upper end of the band for M2   The base drift   As long as we're going to put out extremes, I'll suggest throwing out M1   And I don't think we ought to have a hidden consultation rate that we don't tell the public about It seems to me we owe the public [information on] the way we're looking at things and the way we're operating and how that works If we're going to use a 16 percent and 12 percent as the upper and lower limits for purposes of consultation, we should tell the public that   I'm very much with Jerry and Ed and Si on the specs And I'm there because I am deeply worried about what would happen to the economy if interest rates go up again I think Bob Black said, perhaps inadvertently, that we can't rule out a recovery But we can't rule out the possibility that there won't be a recovery I'm particularly worried about what may be happening to business fixed investment I think that all the risks are on the down side as regards capital formation and that any inadvertent increase in interest rates now, with the aim of pinching this bulge in the money stock, would be a grave mistake  I want to note what we're doing here around the table as we  set specs for the short run We say that we'll take M1 of zero and that for M2, well, maybe there's something to that aggregate but we  don't really care much [about it] I do care and I care a lot That's because I think we're looking at a world in which M1-B or M1--  or what we use for M1 now with other checkable deposits in it--is showing an enormous variation in response to changes in interest rates  that very much parallels what has been going on for several years in  savings deposits If you look, for example, at the recent period    2/1-2/82  you'll find that other checkable deposits had a turnaround; in terms of annualized percentage rates their growth was around 26-1/2 percent from October to December Savings deposits had a turnaround in terms of annualized growth rates of roughly 32 percent I think the parking argument is very much the reason for it People are using their savings deposits as a vehicle for temporarily depositing funds that they're going to put back into other forms of financial assets later, and they're beginning to use their other checkable deposits for the same purpose We're going to see a tremendous amount of variation in Ml, I think, in response to changes in monetary policy and in response to changes in the economy that affect interest rates that we will not see in the nontransactions component of M2 to anywhere near the same degree I think we get a more stable response to changes in policy, therefore, in a larger aggregate like M2 than we do in M1 I wouldn't push this to the point where Frank Morris is of throwing out all the aggregates altogether; I could perhaps be persuaded if you twisted my arm, Frank But I do think it means that we ought to give more attention to what is happening to M2, not just for this meeting but more importantly for the longer term   But what does that mean about the nontransactions component of M2?   If you're that concerned, Chuck, about parked money moving from one component of [M2] to another, then focusing on the broader aggregate seems a way of dealing with that If you look at the monthly growth rates in terms of the billions of dollars of nontransactions components in M2, there was a big bulge in November, but September, October, December and January were all very much the same order of magnitude We did not have this tremendous burst, and a continuation of that burst, in the nontransactions components of M2 That's exactly my point   Where will this all end--this pragmatism over there?   It would be about $20 billion   Well, we really didn't have it last year either   The issue is that if there's some deliberate decision to consume less and save more, the logical disposition of the proceeds is to pay off debt or increase financial asset holdings And I would think that for the average homeowner who has a mortgage well below 16 or 17 percent or whatever he could earn on money market mutual funds, he's not going to pay off his debt, he's going to add to financial assets So, the counterpart of the consumer balance sheet would be an increase in financial asset holdings and it would likely go into M2--not the whole thing, but maybe 3/4 of [it]   It seems to me that the bigger [issue with respect to] what we want to do with M2 is not the fact that we have an additional bias or lack thereof this year relative to last year but that last year we were well over the upper end, or several tenths over If what we want is an increase in nominal GNP of, let us say, between 8 and 9 percent, then we ought to be choosing a range for M2, given the recent velocity figures, that has a midpoint between 8 and 9 percent And if we put out another 6 to 9 percent range, particularly if, as I hope, we will be giving increased stress to M2 this year relative to M1, then we would be aiming almost certainly at a target that we will tend to violate on the up side unless we're not going to get that kind of economic performance   When you say that something would have to be changed that was announced, are you talking about the date of your testimony?   Or the decision itself?   Allegedly, no one knows that we are making a decision on long-run targets today That is always a big deep secret that is reported in the newspapers, but no one really knows for sure   So there would not be any question of a leak because we would not have made any final decisions   The counterargument is that if we are not willing to be flexible from July to early February, what makes anyone think that suddenly we are going to resolve to be flexible between now and, let's say, March?   If we can agree that we are going to be flexible, let us start flexing Let's not postpone this by notifying the public that we are flexible   Look, how many times have we been accused of base drift? We hear "You people always have base drift," to which we are going to say now "By Jove, no more!"   That is the important point    2/1-2/82   Only the expansionists want to change the range   Unfortunately, if we are not careful, we will end up with targets so low that we really have no option as a regulatory body but to permit sweep accounts to save the economy! I am not entirely joking I just don't think that we can possibly have anything like a well performing economy unless two things happen One is that this bulge proves to be very temporary; and the second is that we have more innovations that are pushing down the money demand function That is built into the staff forecast And if both of those do not come along, we are going to be in tough shape   May I question what it is we are assuming about the behavior of M1 from here on out which would give rise to a change in the targets? Do we, for example, decide that if what we have voted on this morning for our short-run targets materializes, which would get us essentially zero growth between now and March, that we can breathe a big sigh of relief and live within our targets? Making some very rough calculations, that seems to me to imply at most a 3 percent annual rate of growth from March on out to get within the upper limit of the range So, are we going to say then that we made it and now we can supply 3 percent money growth and that will be enough?   Well, let's say the economy begins to show signs of a modest recovery along the lines that the staff has forecast But the staff forecast was built on the assumption that there was going to be a big drop in M1 during the course of the first quarter Given the policy targets that we set this morning, we are saying that is not happening; we are saying it is going to stay level So, from March on we are going to be applying a tighter monetary policy than was built into the forecast, which means that if we want to stay within the range, we will be opting for a weaker economy Do we want less than 13 percent real growth from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter?   I would opt to wait a couple of weeks, if I thought I could get anyone else to go along with me, on loosening the reins But I doubt very much--no matter what happens over the next two weeks--that this Committee is going to be willing to loosen up the ranges Maybe they are, but I suspect that your suggestion has appeal because I do not think this Committee realizes yet how harsh a monetary policy it is imposing on the economy with the kind of targets we are looking at now, given what I think is going to happen to money Maybe we will be lucky and money growth will turn negative and we will have a lot of room from then on But I doubt it So, I think we are looking at a situation, if we are not awfully careful and if we do not stay really flexible, where we are going to be opting for a still worse economy than what the staff is forecasting   I wonder how we lose credibility the fastest By saying, in effect, that we are going to go back to the base we had for the fourth quarter of 1980 and use the same target range that we had for 1981 and now a lower target range for M1 for 1982, explaining in the footnotes what the numbers are; or by going out in March or April or thereabouts and saying we give up, money is running too fast and we cannot hold it within those targets, so we are going to raise them and retroactively change the base My feeling is that we are    2/1-2/82  less likely to upset the public and give rise to those concerns Fred Schultz was talking about, if we tell them right now that money growth very recently has been rapid but the fourth quarter was very, very low and, therefore, we are taking a longer-range point of view and still reducing the growth of M1 but basing it from the fourth quarter of 1980 I think we could sell that point of view   With 2-1/2 percent as the lower end?   Taking the 12 percent or so that we are raising it by the implied base shift, then we are talking about 37 percent growth in M1 after this shift And that is not likely to give rise to a new wave of inflation   It will be worse if, in fact, the quotation from Mr Meese that Bill Ford mentioned is correct--that the President is going to pull you over for a little conference We have not heard that officially yet We would be better off as a Committee to make our decisions before that occurs   I did not see it    2/1-2/82   I am not sure what the other decision is   Well, I prefer to rebase now, but I do not think I have much [support]; not too many people are with me   I would like to argue the case for raising the range for M2 Given the fact that we are postponing any decision on rebasing, changing the range for M1 would make no sense at all We would lose any credibility that we might otherwise hold by sticking with this postponement But for M2 the most persuasive case seems to be the fact that in the past two years growth has been running over the upper end of the target range I grant that there may be some arguments to the effect that that problem will be a little less in the future But, as Governor Partee pointed out, we do not know what these IRA accounts are going to do to the magnitude of M2; and more importantly we do not know what will happen to M2 growth if in fact we get a one point or thereabouts increase in the saving rate That could add [to M2] considerably And I would much prefer a target  -102-    2/1-2/82  range that had some realistic hope of being realized within the context of a growth in nominal GNP in the 8 to 9 percent range Therefore, I think a persuasive case could be made for raising the M2 range to 7 to 10 percent   Well, from my standpoint, I am inclined to give more explicit weight to M2 I do not regard that as a--   It is very fuzzy and it says, in effect, that we really do not give a damn what M2 does; we are really concentrating on M1 It says If M2 goes up above the upper end, so what?   Yes I would like to pay more attention to M2 I think it is important for us not just to do that internally but to communicate that because I believe the volatility of M1 is giving rise to a great deal of misunderstanding--and indeed misunderstanding on our part as to the effects on interest rates and the economy of our decisions, which I think is unfortunate We have to be more tranquil about these short-run movements in M1 And if we do not develop that attitude ourselves, we are going to be building increasing problems for the future   We are doing it with words not deeds   Well, nobody pays any attention to those targets   If this happened to be a movement along the function instead of a downward shift in the function, we would get real trouble If, for example, the economy started to collapse--   You can come back There is a place for you We will give you another lunch if you come back!   Is this specific seasonal for April in the public domain? Is that published?   So the people in the market know what that number is?   Are you not saying that, although we expect something in the 8 to 9 percent range, we should relax until it's 12 to 14 percent or something like that?   The old method put that out? I thought I had understood you to say the opposite at first   I thought you said the X-11 Arima method assumes a larger seasonal bulge in April   And part of the answer may lie in the trend of the deficit in the next two years If you look at page I-8 in the Greenbook, [your projection of] the NIA account deficit started out at $74 billion, then $68 billion, then $46 billion, then $47 billion It was on the way down This time it's starting to go the other way And that can make a big difference between where we are now relative to where we were a year ago and how the annual totals add up  -12-    3/29-30/82   Well, Mr Chairman, I have to add my name to the list of the worriers today I don't know that I would develop a forecast, if I had to make one, that looked any different in significant ways than the staff's But it seems to me that as the information comes in, increasingly it's calling into question whether or not we're at the end of recession and about to see a rather significant recovery Obviously, the staff's forecast is not a recovery of the dimensions that we've seen typically in the postwar period after a recession; but it indicates pretty good growth in the last three quarters of the year, a 3-3/4 percent annual rate And as Frank Morris mentioned yesterday, the price figures have been quite weak Maybe we're looking at something different now but  -25-    3/29-30/82  historically, at least, prices of industrial raw materials turn up before the rest of the economy Initial claims are still very high Yesterday we learned that consumer confidence in March, on the basis of the Conference Board survey, was down again The machine tool orders figures continue to be very weak There's just no sign of abatement at all in that area, but it's a very small part of the total economy I would say that there's at least a 60-40 chance that we won't see growth of more than, say, one percent in the last three quarters of the year; that we'll get a bump because of a turnaround in inventory investment from deep negative to small negative or zero or small positive; that final sales will continue to erode, at least in areas like business fixed investment and maybe housing; and that we will see very, very little upturn at all  I think we have seen a very, very substantial weakening of attitudes around the country I just sense a different kind of attitude than I can ever recall during my period as a professional economist Part of the reason is the concern about the budget but I think to a larger extent it is a consequence of the fact that continued monetary restraint over a very prolonged period has put the economy into a very, very weakened state I don't think we should look at what we're seeing now as an unexpected development We've had as much growth in nominal GNP as we had any reason to expect, given what we had provided by way of increases in the stock of money-- indeed, more so because we've had downward shifts in money demand I think we're making more progress on inflation than we had any right to expect We're making more progress than the traditional Phillips curve type of analysis would have led us to expect So, we're looking at a situation now which is essentially of our own making, though not entirely And now the question is what we do about it I think we have a very narrow line to walk I don't think we can afford to give up the progress we've made or to endanger it But if there is a danger now, it is that we have more restraint than we want rather than less restraint than we want I'm very much worried about what is going to happen in these next few months   Mr Chairman, I expressed earlier, in my comments about where the economy is going, the doubts that I have in mind as to the prospect for a recovery of the dimensions the staff is forecasting I would say again that I think the state of the economy is principally the consequence of monetary restraint--principally our responsibility, not that of anybody else--although I would acknowledge that fears of the deficit are contributing to the mood around the country It's also our responsibility in the sense that we permitted a rather substantial increase in interest rates right in the middle of a very deep and deepening recession I'm very much impressed with the line of argument that Chuck has developed We really have something very, very unusual going on in the growth of M1 as it's currently measured To put his point a different way It is true that one could explain small or even moderate sized differences in growth rates of the various elements of M1 on the basis of differences in income and interest rate elasticities But there's no way in the world that one can explain the kind of divergences that we have seen between coin and currency, demand deposits, and OCDs except by reference to something very, very unusual happening to the demand for OCDs And we don't know what it is It may be a continuing shift into OCDs because the process that began last year has not yet been completed It may be a liquidity preference kind of development We just don't know what it is   I think the growth of M1 since last October greatly overstated the extent to which monetary policy has been stimulating the economy Another factor that convinces me that this is the case is looking at the prospective growth rates, fourth quarter-to-first quarter, of the various monetary aggregates Although less disparate and less unusual than the fourth quarter-to- February numbers, they still show a progressive decline in the growth rate as you get to the broader aggregates 103 percent for M1, 96 percent for M2, and 86 percent for M3  -42-    3/29-30/82  I don't think any alternative more restrictive than "A" is at all suitable I think we ought to permit the economy to have the kind of growth in narrow money balances and broader money balances that is needed for some recovery in economic activity I'd remind you, in looking at alternatives B and C, that the M2 figures in B and C are 7-1/2 and 6-3/4 percent, [respectively] And our experience in the past several years suggests as a first rough approximation that we are going to get an increase in nominal GNP that is approximately in proportion to the growth of M2 The velocity of M2 has not been very variable recently And over the last three quarters of this year what our staff is projecting is not a 7-1/2 or 6-3/4 percent increase in nominal GNP, but a 94 percent increase, or somewhere around 9-1/2 percent So, I think alternative A is where we ought to go And I think we ought to be very, very careful about trying to run too fast to offset a bulge in April which may reflect nothing more than the fact that we've changed our process of seasonal adjustment   Now, I was speaking of the last three quarters   Is the path that we are building one that says a 9 percent increase in M1 in April and a 10 percent increase in M2? If so, I'm not worried too much about the words   I am worried about the substance of your argument I think 3 percent as a target for the second quarter assumes that we are going to get a reversal of this build-up in OCDs, and I am not at all sure that that is going to take place And I    3/29-30/82  don't want policy to follow a course that is going to push up interest rates if that doesn't happen On the other hand, if we have a path based on a 9 or 91 percent increase or thereabouts for M1 in April and a 10 percent increase in M2, then we can come back next time and look at it again Maybe that--   Yes, that's what I wanted to be sure of   The thing that I think we need to worry about now is the phenomenon that happened last summer In putting more attention on M2, I think we let more constraint develop on the economy ex post than we wanted And Governor Partee was reminding us over and over again that we were going to do that I wish I had listened to him then I think that's something that we have to be careful about in April If the M1 number happens to come in at 3 percent, let's say, one could easily interpret that as no bulge But in fact if the economy was weakening and the signals of economic weakness were gathering [momentum], then we would be sitting back and accepting 3 percent and it would just be the wrong thing to do   Yes   If that were happening and if we had a fairly significant continuing growth of currency and demand deposits and M2 and the OCD phenomenon began to unwind, then I wouldn't worry too much about it, particularly if it were not accompanied by further signs of developing economic weakness   Can we take a vote just to go right on to May instead of all this?  -55-    3/29-30/82   I strongly would prefer $11 billion   But the number we use for M2 for April is not the quarterly average, presumably   If we get a bulge in M1, then presumably M2 is going to be higher also, since M1 is a big component of M2 In fact, what is consistent with 9 percent in M1 is about the same or a little bigger M2 growth, is it not?   There's a danger, I think, in this operational prescription, and that is that if the economy weakens and the demand for M1 weakens correspondingly, so long as M1 growth is above 3 percent, we would proceed to adjust the path downward But we would keep initial borrowing where it is and interest rates where they are If the source of this weakness in M1 is a weakening economy, we have big problems   In one month? I don't know It seems to me that the shifts in demand for M2 are sufficient so that it may or may not   I would hope though, if we saw an M1 number that was coming in around 3 percent, that we would want to have a consultation to make sure that we are following procedures that make sense in light of what we see going on in the economy   But I'm not at all sure that the objective should be to offset the reserve impact We're talking about what may well be a marked increase in liquidity preference And if so, we've    5/18/82  just got to accommodate it We are looking at an economy that the latest Redbook suggests is teetering on the brink of going over the edge Attitudes are very, very pessimistic There are lots of very worried people out there Add to this atmosphere a financial crisis, and there's just no question in my mind that that is the factor that will push us over the edge We can't afford to [allow] that We cannot let devotion to a predetermined path of reserve growth or money growth permit us to commit a major crime against the US economy It just can't be done   But I think the Chairman's approach to this, if I understand it, is to be ready in case the market is not functioning   How has the market reacted to the austerity program, or whatever you wish to call it, that the Mexicans have put into place?   Well, I listened to my colleague Bob Black and I wish I could share his optimism If we get a budget compromise and get it soon, I think I would go along with his view that we have a potentially good recovery ahead of us I think we would get a significant drop in bond rates, a pickup in stock prices, improved consumer confidence, and improved business attitudes generally But I must say that I think the likelihood of getting a significant reduction of prospective deficits before the election is pretty slim We have to be prepared for the possibility that we will live for 3, 4, 5 more months with this extremely gloomy set of attitudes pervading financial markets and the nation more generally I don't think that what Bob is talking about is very likely On the contrary, I see things going the other way in recent months Plans for business fixed investment are weakening I had been worried earlier about the possibility of a very, very large decline in business fixed investment, and I thought that the incoming evidence over the winter months had alleviated that concern; now I believe that that [revised] judgment was probably not right I think we may see further signs of  -15-    5/18/82  deterioration in business spending plans in the months ahead Consumer attitudes are very, very sour And until that situation is rectified, we're not likely to see a significant pickup in demand for durables  I'm worried, and worried considerably, about the cumulative effects of high interest rates and what they are doing to the strength of business enterprise Interest charges are transfer payments; what goes out of one pocket ought to go into another But I'm afraid the effects on marginal propensities to spend in the aggregate are very, very negative as these high levels of interest rates continue Ratios of interest to profits plus interest have gone up very, very considerably and they're going up further And that is clearly having a very substantial effect on the ability of businesses to finance their operations, particularly smaller businesses I'm wondering if the real danger at this point may not be that an episode of the kind we were talking about earlier will cause credit markets to close in the sense that lenders around the country will suddenly stop lending as a means of protecting themselves against the possibility of very serious effects That's something we need to watch very, very carefully I hope the staff at the Reserve Banks will all keep in contact with their banks so that we can understand fully what is going on in credit markets I think we're going to have to be extremely careful to avoid upsetting the situation, which could precipitate a renewed downtrend in economic activity instead of the upturn the staff has forecast If I had been in the staff's position, I probably would have forecast just about what they did because that's what I think the logic of the numbers suggests But the logic of the qualitative evidence coming in suggests that all the risks are on the down side and I think that's what Jim Kichline was telling us this morning   What do you assume about cuts further out? It seems to me that the critical issue in terms of the effect on the economy of a compromise is what happens to expectations about further growth of the deficit beyond fiscal '83 What does that mean for long-term interest rate expectations, not just for long-term interest rates now If one were to assume that we had that kind of deficit reduction for fiscal '83, but much much more in '84 and '85, then I would be quite convinced that the economy would come out of its current slump and turn up But if that were the only action--a cut in the deficit of $40-$50 billion or somewhere around there--and if that were the figure for deficit reductions in '84 and '85 also, then I don't think we'd get much relief   Well, I come from a very different position, but I'm going to get somewhere near Larry's I should begin to think about that; I wonder if my logic is as tight as it ought to be! We have made a lot of progress against inflation but I don't think the battle is over yet by any means I think the recent numbers on the actual PPI and CPI changes overstate considerably where we are in terms of the underlying [inflation] rate And, indeed, the underlying rate itself has come down because of this very, very severe pressure on labor markets But I think we've made enough progress to have gained some credibility and it's time to let the economy grow at a restrained pace and still make progress against inflation  I expressed earlier my deep concerns about the possibility that we might inadvertently push the economy off the cliff That should be one of our major concerns now as well as doing what is necessary to make continued progress against inflation However, the room we have to maneuver is very, very limited because of what is happening in fiscal policy It is true, as Governor Teeters says, that the present deficits are primarily recession deficits; but is not true that the deficits we're looking at beyond, say, the coming fiscal year, have anything to do with recession The budget deficits projected for the out years take place--and are growing--in the context of a fairly well functioning economy Indeed, our staff is forecasting by way of a change in the high employment deficit between the first half of '82 and the last half of '83 an $87 billion swing; that's over a period of six quarters And, of course, it gets bigger and bigger as far out as one can go That is horrendous fiscal stimulus in process if we do not see a compromise reached that has some meaning to it I think Mr Kichline's words are well taken; he said that these unspecified budget cuts being talked about are not going to convince anybody That is having a negative effect on the economy now because of its impact on expected future interest rates and on some present long-term interest rates If we were to engage in any actions that suggested, in effect, that we were throwing in the towel, I think the effect on public expectations would be extremely adverse  So, I think we have a little room to maneuver and we ought to use it We are doing basically what we wanted to do in the second quarter; things are coming out about as well as we could have expected The money growth rates are about on target and interest rates have inched down a little from where they were So, I would like to stay about where we are--that is, about "B" I might lean a little in the direction of Ed Boehne, going toward "B+," but I wouldn't want to go far enough in that direction to generate a substantial downward movement of interest rates Although that would be nice from the standpoint of the economy, it would be adverse from the standpoint of public expectations and would take some of the pressure off Congress and the Administration to get something done while there's still time   I have the numbers that Governor Partee was looking for Of the $118 billion increase in seasonally adjusted money supply from December to April, $117 billion came from other--   From the fourth quarter to April would be the numbers that you had, I think   I think that would be a good idea   All we have to do is to make it "The Committee also noted that deviations from these targets should be evaluated in light of changes in the relative importance of NOW accounts as a savings vehicle" Just cut out everything from--   Just drop the next sentence   Well, I guess I'm going to say about what everybody else has said, so I'll try to be brief I would put down a forecast that doesn't look a lot different from what the staff has written down But I, too, think the risks are predominantly on the down side I would mention three factors on that One is the extremely gloomy attitude that prevails in the business and financial community and to some extent, too, among customers All of us could list a dozen different reasons for that, but I think increasingly a perception is growing and is reflected in the kind of deficit estimates that are being made now in the financial markets that we may be in a state close to paralysis in terms of finding our way out of this fiscal box It's a very frightening situation The second factor that has been mentioned a couple of times is the possibility that shocks--and I wouldn't call them just financial shocks, Henry, but shocks that originate in the financial sector which may be affecting primarily nonfinancial firms--may be coming along that will cause great consternation around the nation and make the attitudes still worse The third factor is the fact that the staff's forecast depends on the expectation that interest rates won't rise as recovery begins And that is in turn predicated on a judgment--and I think there are strong arguments for it as well as against it--that we will have a downward shift of money demand, which will permit an increase in velocity of something like 5 or 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate That may happen and then again it may not    6/30-7/1/82  What I would hesitate to see us do is to adopt a strategy now that conditions the kind of economic performance outlined here, which is really a miserable performance, on the assumption that that will happen and if it doesn't happen, the outcome will be much worse I think we need to try to find a strategy that gets us out of that box I look at the monetary aggregates as Henry does and say that there are good reasons for thinking that we haven't provided enough money I think credit developments are reflecting that In Jim's chart on funds raised by domestic nonfinancial sectors as a percent of GNP, if you take the difference between the total and the federal part, the number is down to barely over 6 percent of GNP Now, that number has a long-term historical growth trend If you look at a chart that plots that ratio from 1952 on and plot a trend line through it, a normative ratio would seem to be something like double that figure That figure is as low as it is now in part because the economy is in recession but in major part because interest rates are so very high I think we have to be very careful in trying to work our way out of this box We can't solve all these problems, but I think we can help to solve one of them And that is that we have more restraint on the [economic] system from the monetary side than we want at the moment In trying to provide some way to let money grow a little faster, we ought to look over all the alternatives One of them is to raise the targets for 1982; another is to leave them where they are but make a clear, public announcement that we're going to permit money growth to exceed that target for reasons having to do with liquidity preference or for technical reasons The third--and here I think one can make an argument with some cogency that perhaps the idea of continuity of policy over a longer period working toward lower growth of money and credit and toward reducing inflation--could best be presented if we rebased our money growth targets for 1982, taking into account the fact that we undershot so much last year But again, I don't know which way we can do this and best maintain credibility   We've changed the ranges; we always change them downward See how flexible we are!  -14-    6/30-7/1/82   Where will we be in July?   Well, they could be reinstated by the new president   May I ask a technical question, Mr Chairman? If one were to leave the September levels where they are and start with the new lower June base, what would the growth from June to September be?   My thinking runs very much along the lines of Chuck's I think it's possible that money demand may shift down again in the third quarter, but I don't think we can set forth on a course of monetary policy which starts with that as a proposition and, if it doesn't happen, lets interest rates rachet upward significantly further I want to try to find a way of designing some specifications that will permit a bit more money growth if, in fact, this downward shift of money demand does not happen, but that will not let things get completely out of hand One way this might be done is to leave the September levels where they are and to recalculate our June-to- September growth rates accordingly If I understand Steve right, that would mean something like 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent for alternative A, 4-3/4 to 5 percent for "B," and 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent for "C" I would start with that Is that right, Steve, roughly?   Well, whatever the numbers are, I'd make those adjustments to M1 and whatever corresponding adjustments need to be made to M2 Then I would take the quantitative specs of "A" and the initial borrowing of "B" By doing so, we would be putting together a set of specs that say in effect that we may have more money growth than the staff has counted on if this downward shift of money demand does not happen If, in fact, we find that money growth is falling short of this path set forth by the specs of "A," then what I would do is split the difference I would take half of it and lower money growth and half of it and lower interest rates That's how I would proceed, and I would get around the problem of having to put in a proviso clause that would specify a strict upper limit for the federal funds rate   Well, the borrowing would be $800 million to $1 billion; taking a midpoint of $900 million would be all right   Well, it has a chance It may not, but I would count on the Chairman to use his good offices to call us in for consultation if we had serious problems with rising interest rates   No I'm proposing the 11 to 16 percent range the initial borrowing assumption of alternative B, and the quantitative specs for M1 and M2 of "A" modified as I indicated  -45-    6/30-7/1/82   May I just make a technical comment? If I've understood you right and you're going with 5 percent for M1 and the appropriate number for M2 from June to September with a new lower June base, you in effect are saying that you are prepared to tolerate a September number for M1 that is a tiny bit less than what is in "B"   [The level] is $4570 billion, if you take $4515 billion for June   I don't know; I don't have that   But again, what you're doing is assuming that the June figure is a solid one and that it signals the first of a series of downward shifts in money demand, which is built into these specifications in the first place If that doesn't continue, unless we have some sort of understanding that we're going to operate on money market conditions, interest rates will begin to ratchet up And that's something that I just don't think we ought to do One way to get around this might be to go to a May base A number of 5 percent from a May base would be a lot more satisfactory from my standpoint  -60-    6/30-7/1/82   If you take 5 percent from May to September--   Yes   It's about $459 billion We'd have essentially what is in alternative A   It's a bit less, but in round figures it would be $459 billion   Do you mean that if in July we appear to be getting a bulge of over 9 percent in money supply growth that you would adjust the nonborrowed reserve target upward unless there were some indications that this growth was being generated by a strengthening in the economy? If what happens is that the amount of borrowing goes up and interest rates go up, then that is not accommodating in the sense that I would use the word And I--   But that means targeting on quarterly levels or on the levels for the month and not on the growth rates If we target the levels, then it seems to me what we need to do is to decide what our specifications are relative to the month of May If we're adjusting the whole quarter downward for this fortuitous development in June and we end up having a 5 percent growth rate for M1, we're ending up with a level in September that is at or slightly below where we were in alternative B in the first place And that, it seems to me, does not come to grips with the problem that these specs have built in them a downward shift in money demand, and if it doesn't happen, then we're in really big trouble   Providing too much stimulus is the least of my worries   When I was tolerating the shortfall, it wasn't from 5 percent   But not 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent A quarter of a percent at an annual rate is not [interpreting it] liberally If you take the September levels that we have here and use 5 percent from May to September, the June-to-September implication is 6-3/4 percent That's what I thought I was talking about when I made my proposal in the first place   No, I was proposing keeping the September level, not paying too much attention to the fact that June was as low as it was And what I was saying about accommodating was really designed to go in the other direction I was saying that if in fact the money supply comes in weaker than that and the difference were not construed as evidence of a collapse in the economy, I would be prepared to compromise in the sense of taking part of that shortfall in lower money growth and part of the shortfall in lower interest rates--not accommodating in the other way by setting a number low and then letting the overrun occur   I'm prepared to acknowledge the possibility that we may have to overshoot this year   The other way to do it is to make it quite clear that we're talking about an overrun and have an understanding amongst ourselves as to how much we're thinking about in very broad terms Then we could use language such as Jerry suggested "The target is 5 percent or somewhat more if the liquidity preference of the public remains high" The "somewhat" in my case would mean that I'd be willing to tolerate growth up to 7 percent for the quarter   I like 10 to 15 percent And I would hope that we would have some language in the directive indicating that it's 5 percent or somewhat more if liquidity preference runs high   If we have an understanding that the Chairman is going to consult if the funds rate is over 15 percent, that ought to be the upper end of our range We ought not to say one thing and have an understanding on something else If you're going to wait to consult until the fed funds rate gets up to 16 percent, I'm not happy with that   There's another good argument for keeping it where it is It looks awfully funny to me, if we're in a meeting where we are trying to make sure that we adopt a directive that does not countenance increased interest rates, to raise the upper end of the federal funds range That just seems rather strange   If we were so fortunate as to see interest rates decline also, there would be the usual lag in the downward adjustment of yields on money market mutual funds and hence a tendency for [funds to move] into those from market instruments, which would help keep the M2 numbers up So, I would prefer 9 percent also   Well, it would help the individuals too   Oh, no I wouldn't say that it will come exclusively out of other M2 accounts I think we could get a significant transfer of individual savings out of market instruments into some funds   Well, it's not [unlikely], so that 9 percent sounds better to me   The folder was so shocked by the results!   Mr Chairman, I would strongly encourage you to develop the analytic line of reasoning you were presenting yesterday for how velocity [behavior] for the period ahead, if we succeed in bringing down inflation, can bring down interest rates It may be a very different animal than what we've been dealing with before and we have to be sensitive to that in setting our longer-range targets That would give us another reason for not taking a step in a downward direction for 1983   Prospectively much higher   But I don't think we have to say it that way, Tony If you look back at the thrust of policy since late 1979, it began with the notion that fiscal policy would be reasonably restrained, and we continue to hold to that expectation And the continuation of targeting along these lines has been made with an eye to the expectation that fiscal policy will begin to provide the assistance that we want in bringing down inflation We're not talking about a highly restrictive fiscal policy being put into effect We're talking about going back [from] what is potentially a horrendously stimulative fiscal policy to where we thought we were on fiscal policy at the beginning of 1981 And we need to think about our monetary targeting and our monetary policy generally in that context   I was asked by the Economic Advisory Council of the American Bankers Association whether the Federal Reserve would change its monetary targets, if in fact we had the kind of explosion of budget deficits implied by current law And I said we might, but I'm not sure which way   We talked about the possibility of adding a highly stimulative monetary policy to a highly stimulative fiscal policy I have no doubt that that's where we would end up The alternative of continuing on the course of a monetary restraint  -91-    6/30-7/1/82  discipline in the face of these kinds of budget deficits has catastrophic implications for the capital markets, for business investment, for the thrift industry, for small businesses, and for farmers It is a nightmare   Oh, yes   The real problem is not so much the size of the deficit for fiscal '83; it is the continuing expansion of the deficit even in the face of a well-functioning economy   One could argue as to whether or not there is a crowding out going on at the moment, at least in terms of the level of short-term interest rates But there is simply no question whatever that in a well functioning economy, if the deficit rises to 5-1/4 percent of GNP, there is no way to avoid extensive crowding out   Even better yet is to take the ratio of the net private savings Net private savings is between 7 and 8 percent of GNP, as a rough estimate, so you're talking about 3/4 of the total being taken by the deficit   Well, I have no doubt that interest rates are high What I'm questioning is why My theory is that I have a hard time explaining the level of short-term interest rates as a phenomenon associated with the deficit Now, the long-term rates clearly are, and there is some crowding out from that standpoint because of the expected future interest rate impact of this deficit impinging on current investors   I don't find that argument at all convincing The reason why long-term interest rates are high is because investors are reluctant to buy long, so they buy short And we're transferring the credit demand as well as the supply into the short-term markets So, I don't see why that should have an effect on short-term rates except to the extent that the fear of deficits is generating increased demand for the aggregates that the Federal Reserve controls And to that extent, yes, one can explain high short-term interest rates that way except that a central bank which recognizes what is going on presumably has the option to increase the growth rate of those aggregates to take that into account So, on net, I end up saying the fear of the future deficit causes high long-term rates now but I'm not sure at all that it should affect short-term interest rates   I certainly might I would want to keep my options open I think that could have a major effect on expected inflation rates and, therefore, on current interest rates It could have a major effect on demands for the monetary aggregates because of what happens to the level of interest rates and expected inflation rates I would want to keep an open mind to the possibility that complete and thorough resolution of the budget problem would give us an opportunity to follow a more expansive monetary policy I grant Henry's point that in the long run what determines prices is the stock of money, providing one makes sufficient assumptions about the competitive character of the markets and so on But I'm afraid that long-run period exceeds my term as a Governor; so, during the period when I'm here, I'd like to think about adjustments   Let's go back to the Chairman's discussion That decline in interest rates, together with reduced expectations of inflation, might have an important bearing on the trend increase in the velocity of money We would need to take that into account I think Chuck has a good point We are a long ways from full employment of our resources We do need to be concerned about the speed with which we get back to a higher level of resource utilization, and one of the factors we clearly need to take into account is what fiscal policy is doing in this respect   There's another way of approaching it, which is to say that we have to base monetary policy on the assumption of a reasonable fiscal deficit, which does not involve excessive crowding out and which is, therefore, in the neighborhood of, say, 2 to 2-1/2 percent of GNP Accordingly, that's the fiscal policy assumption that our monetary policy is based on Now, automatically, if the Congress doesn't hit that kind of reasonable fiscal policy, then monetary policy bites harder And that reminds Congress of where its responsibilities are I'm only saying that half seriously   It would certainly be my sense that it would be appropriate for us to follow a course of policy, whatever that meant in terms of monetary aggregates, that would not only let interest rates decline in the context of reduced deficits for the future but decline enough to do what Chuck says--to improve the performance of the economy And I certainly would stand ready to follow an aggregates policy consistent with that because I do think it would take away the fears of inflation It would give us an opportunity to shade on the up side, without nearly as much worry that we would lose credibility and lose control of the inflation problem   What will that number be for the [week ending September] 8th?   Have you figured out what the third quarter will be relative to the second?   Well, I think we could take into account Bob's comment about the greater uncertainty with respect to any numbers about borrowing by giving you a wider range, Mr Chairman--giving you a $500 to $700 million range and letting you use that judiciously My own hunch is that the kinds of reactions in financial markets we are likely to get, depending on which way we go, are the reverse of those that Bob Black is worried about My perception is that Wall Street now has a view that interest rates simply can't go up because the economy is sick, sick, sick So, if we started any operation that began to push interest rates up by reacting strongly to an overrun on M1 now, that would be the worst possible thing we could do   I think the reports have been on private home heating fuel   Supplies of home heating fuel I think are rather low relative to the stock of petroleum generally   May I point out one other factor in this respect? The staff forecast has been uniformly the most pessimistic for the past year-and-a-half and it has overestimated the performance of the economy   We're looking at a situation in which I think Jim is quite right that all the risks at this point are on the down side, both from the domestic demand side and from export demand   Isn't the more basic problem that, in order for all of these countries around the world who have severe difficulty servicing their debts to find a way out, we simply can't rely on internal adjustments within those countries to do it We have to have some world economic expansion That's really a necessary condition for finding a way out of this whole problem   No, I wasn't talking about strong [world expansion], and I would agree with your point on individual countries But it's no longer a question of just one individual country and what it does to get its problem solved It is how all of them together are going to get out that I think requires some degree of economic expansion   Indeed I think growth of the US economy and of the world economy is a necessary but not sufficient condition to get us out of this severe difficulty we find ourselves in   Well, I think the period ahead is one in which we have ample reasons not to target on M1 My own judgment, however, is that the problem we face is much more fundamental than whether we target on M1 now because of all savers certificates and the new DIDC regulations that will come out as mandated by legislation I think the world economy is literally starved for liquidity And I'd liken this [situation] to the dietary analogy that suggests Fat people have good reasons to go on diets Diets are very good things unless they get out of hand They sometimes do And when they get out of hand, the patient becomes anorexic and that's often a fatal disease If it's not fatal, it's often a life-long disease I am worried that we have gone on long enough starving the world economy for liquidity and that we may be at a point of impending anorexia  Larry Roos mentioned earlier that he thought real interest rates were getting down toward normal levels I must say I don't know how he reaches that conclusion The three-month commercial paper rate is 10 percent, and my perception is that the three-month expected    10/5/82  inflation rate would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 to 5 percent So that makes the cost of issuing commercial paper 4 to 6 percent in real terms Private corporate bond rates for AAA issues are 13-1/2 percent and are much higher for lower-graded issues I understand that most businesses now have a 5-to-10 year inflation expectation of something like 6 to 7 percent  So that makes 6 to 7 percent the long-term real interest rate That simply isn't normal It is not even close to being normal There are all kinds of reasons for that, and I think fiscal policy is one of them But if you look at what has been happening to the real money stock recently, I think you will find the answer largely in a very, very tight monetary policy And it started before October 1979; it started earlier In 1979, we had an increase in the nominal money stock of 7-1/2 percent; prices went up above 12 percent In 1980, nominal money went up 7-1/2 percent; prices again went up around 11 to 12 percent In 1981, money growth was 5 percent against a price increase of 10 percent This year it will be a little closer probably But we've had a very, very substantial drop in the real money stock in this country It has forced the kinds of policies other countries are following So, I think we have to do what is necessary to provide the liquidity that will permit this economy to grow and will permit the world economy to grow I think we're right in going in the direction we are at this particular meeting of unhinging [policy] from what is likely to happen to M1 in the months ahead I am wondering as I look at this directive if the last two sentences are necessary This leaves the directive focused on expanding bank reserves as necessary for an orderly and sustained flow of money and credit and that leads to an expectation about M2 and M3, without these last two sentences about somewhat slower and somewhat [more rapid]--I'm sorry, I think I'm losing my voice   Do we have evidence of that, Henry?   Liquidity preference?    10/5/82   I thought the staff said that the increase in the quantity of M1 recently is pretty much in line with a movement down the demand function, given the current interest rates, and not a shift in the demand function   That was a good argument last April, but I'm not sure it is now   When the staff made out the alternatives in the Bluebook, the difference in borrowing levels between "A" and "B" was rather substantial, $150 million versus $450 million The $450 million was associated with essentially no change in market interest rates and "A" was associated with some easing, but I didn't get the impression that it was that significant an amount of easing If we were to go, say, to a number like $400 million, it would imply hardly any change in market interest rates   It not only says would be "acceptable" but would be "desirable" in the context of declining interest rates   If I may pick a nit in the second paragraph, I would say "In these circumstances"   The subject should not be "these uncertainties" but "these developments"   Well, it seems to me if we're worried about changing gears radically as opposed to small degrees, in terms of public perception, we ought to leave it a little vaguer than that   Yes   That's the problem; it goes back some years   Save that "maintain the expansion of bank reserves" and leave the rest of the phrase as it is   Then we need to change something else in the sentence; maybe we don't The reference to those aggregates is pretty far back To then say "Somewhat slower growth"   That, I think, is questionable, Henry; I really do   M2 is again very, very low [Relative to] the targeted M2 now, the last number we have is very low And it's just awfully hard to see why--   Yes   I know, but the previous two months presumably were affected by the fact that interest rates came down We have to ask ourselves whether we're talking about a movement along the demand function or a shift in the demand function And as far as I know, the recent evidence does not strongly point toward an upward shift in demand for money And that's the way I interpret the staff's comments in the briefing   Well, velocity of M2 does have some cyclical movements to it We sort of expect that when interest rates fall, velocity is going to go down some; now, whether it's off the function, I don't know But I thought the staff said yesterday that the evidence of recent money behavior is consistent with movement along the function and not a shift   Well, I don't think we're going to fool anybody one way or another; when this press conference occurs, they are going to know what we did They will just look at money market conditions and it will be abundantly evident by what happens in the interval between now and the time the directive is released   We've left it up to you, Mr Chairman Do what you want   So moved   How long has it been since you've made coupon purchases?   I have no problems   Let me just make one comment I have always found it interesting and useful when I'm uncertain about whether my forecast is right or not to do what I call a "National Bureau exercise" in which I look at what I think are the better leading indicators of economic activity to see whether they confirm or deny my thinking Of course, I play this game in my own way; I choose the ones I think are best I don't look at the leading indicators, but I look at things like the average workweek in manufacturing, initial claims for unemployment insurance, orders for durable goods, and industrial raw materials prices And they are all still going down I'm quite convinced we will find that the recession not only has not ended in October but that it will not have ended in November either And while I would make a forecast like Mr Kichline's that recovery probably is right around the corner, I made that same forecast at midyear, as he did, and I was dead wrong So, I think we have to reckon with a quite high probability that recession may well continue through the first quarter of 1983   The other aspect of this interest rate movement that I think we need to take carefully into account is that this recession is quite unlike earlier ones in terms of the international component A very large part of the decline in real GNP since the middle of 1981 can be explained by the drop in real merchandise exports Now, that's a consequence partly of a worldwide recession but also of a very substantial increase in the value of the dollar in exchange markets And the drop in nominal interest rates has not reversed that That negative effect is still there in spades, as the International Finance Division has reminded us   Each has its own golf course!   I am with the majority view that is beginning to develop That view is that we have to do something to make sure that a recovery begins soon Frank used the word "imperative" and I think that is quite right It's a matter of urgency Looking at the domestic economy, I have a feeling that the widespread expectation of the business community at midyear that the recession was over and that a recovery would begin led to actions that were deeply disappointed when the growth in final sales that was expected to come from the consumer sector didn't happen We had a very serious worsening of expectations during the course of the summer and a drop in the demand for business fixed investment among other things And I think there is more than a small risk that it might happen again If I were forecasting, I suppose I would say it is probable that the recovery will begin sometime early in 1983 But there are no concrete signs as yet that the recession is over  I agree with Governor Teeters that the international considerations are pointing strongly in that direction, too, as well as considerations about what Congress might do It's not just a question of potential anti-Federal Reserve legislation, but we badly need to have action that is going to reduce the prospect for growing deficits in the out years And it's going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Congress to go in that direction if the economy is still falling I look at the present level of interest rates and I have to acknowledge that I'm not sure the present level of interest rates is inconsistent with recovery But if it's the wrong level, it certainly is not that interest rates are too low On the contrary, they are more likely to be too high I don't think there's any significant danger that what we do between now and the end of this year is likely to provoke a massive turnaround of inflationary expectations I think we have established our credibility I think we have to follow a course now that prevents any possibility that interest rates might go up So, "C" and "B" are quite unacceptable to me I wouldn't want to take such aggressive action that the markets would think we were throwing in the towel I would be inclined, therefore, to go somewhere between "A" and "B" with an initial borrowing of maybe $250 million, as Roger Guffey suggested I wouldn't be reluctant to stick with the growth rate of M2 in "A" and I certainly would want to keep in the directive the statement that we included last time about uncertainties leading to exceptional liquidity demands We ought to err on the side of providing more growth rather than permitting less   It seems a fairly good guess, Chuck   You were sort of premature on your forecast!   Were you thinking of retaining that statement about precautionary demands for money? That would be a critical part of the directive, I think, saying that expected growth in September through December is at levels which might well imply the need to change the nonborrowed reserve path fairly soon   The market went down again today, I understand   And why not make 6 to 10?   So we're not narrowing the range still further   I know he means the [upper end of the] range   The other thing is, looking at the structure of industrial output in October, there isn't any evidence that it is consistent with an immediate turnaround That is, one normally would expect in an economy that is about to pull out of recession and flatten out that production of materials will not go down as much as final product In this case what we saw was a flattening out of materials production in the early summer and then it resumed [its decline] again and is still going down rapidly   Put more generally, the level of the exchange rate gives us more freedom to do something with money supply, interest rates, and so on without worrying that somehow it is going to have an immediate inflationary or expansive impact We are not getting a symmetrical response to changes in interest rates The movement upward in interest rates carried with it a very substantial increase in the exchange rate, so we had a lot of negative effects on exports from that The decline in interest rates, it seems to me, has not had that effect It's a lot less than the opposing effect on the up side   That doesn't have any meaning   You mean when it's published   I think the case for waiting was a saleable one at midyear But too much time has elapsed since then I no longer think it's saleable to say that we will wait to see whether or not this velocity trend continues It has been going on too long So, I think we've got to err on the side of setting specs that give us a high probability that we will not see any upward movement of interest rates and that the greater likelihood is that they are going to move down It's not guaranteed; one can't guarantee anything in this world But I'm afraid if we have another recurrence of the disappointment that we have had with an economy not recovering, we're going to see a souring of attitudes, and this economy is going to get away from us We then are going to have to take some very, very strenuous action on both the fiscal and monetary sides to rescue it The international complications make this a profoundly different kind of recession than we ever have had before in the postwar period   I'd sure be a lot happier about applying the brakes if the car were rolling rapidly down the hill than to roll it backward down the hill   I don't want to give any kind of [unintelligible]   That's just not the way to go now Later, maybe We just have not had the uncertainties clarified [enough to determine] that figure   Two dashes   If it happened in a nice smooth fashion, that would be all right I would not worry much about immediate release if I were quite sure we were going to stay with the operating procedures we now have But we were talking earlier today about what will happen if [banks] begin to [pay] interest on all types of money And I think the answer to that is that we would have the same kind of problem targeting on M2 that we now have on M1 It would make it very, very difficult to do And we may end up deciding that, in fact, what we have to do is target on interest rates And if we start targeting on interest rates and say that this month, by golly, our interest rate target is 1 percentage point lower, the markets are going to go absolutely bananas And I'm not sure that's what we want   Well, the whole problem would be that we would come up with a bunch of mush that could mean anything   When that sort of thing has happened with government statistics, though, the word gets around The word gets around because it has a market effect and other people in the markets begin to learn about it and they call in I agree with you that it would be a terrible black eye But as far as I know, there is no reason to think that that would ever happen   That is the sort of thing I was referring to When we have heard that, we've typically heard back from the market as to what the information is all about and where it probably came from  -63-    11/16/82   Well, the fact that somebody got some information and put it in the press did not reduce interest in the question of what was going on It intensified it enormously I think if we release the directive, which has in it some rather mysterious language about M2 and the fed funds rate ranges, and the language is changed a little--if instead of "is" it says "remains" and "unusually great" becomes "substantial"--then the phones will begin to ring off the wall People will ask "What does this mean? Did you guys cave in or not?" It just isn't going to change that problem at all   I would add my voice to those who are concerned about whether or not the recovery is going to materialize The Redbook this time, although noting elements of optimism--the twinkle, if you will, Ed--commented repeatedly about the manufacturing sector slipping further into recession and attitudes becoming more and more pessimistic I think we're dealing here with a combination of a big inventory overhang, particularly in durables, declining business fixed investment, and very, very sick export markets What I worry about most is the possibility that the efforts to improve productivity, which have been going on in full force since midyear, will continue to erode employment and earned incomes So this little revival of consumer spending that we feel over Christmas may prove to be very, very short lived If I were to put down numbers--if I were in Mr Kichline's position and thank heaven I no longer have to make my living that way--I might come up with some very similar numbers But my worries all focus on the possibility that in fact we'll see another disappointment   The staff called our attention repeatedly to the range of uncertainties in these estimates, and I'd like to start by stressing that If one takes a look at table 2 in the Bluebook on page 8, one sees the staff estimates that for the year 1983, fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, flows to M2 will add somewhere between 1/2 and 2-1/2 percent to the growth rate of M2 But they get to that conclusion by going through a whole series of instruments and by making estimates that are often clever and often well conceived but in the final analysis are off the wall That is said not in any way to denigrate the work of the staff There is simply no one who can know whether out of the $350 billion in CDs $1 billion or $50 billion is going to shift Now, if these uncertainties are bad for M2, think of what they are for M1 From my standpoint, when the estimates for 1983 imply somewhere between a reduction of $8 billion and an increase of $24 billion, which is an increment of from minus 2 percent to plus 5 percent for the growth of M1, that aggregate is a very dangerous target until these things settle down  There has been some suggestion that the way out may be to look at something like the nonborrowed base I don't interpret the staff documents the way others must be interpreting them The staff said that if we start with these problems and go back to the total monetary base, we'd be dealing not only with all those problems but one more the instability of currency demand Therefore, that is going to be a horrible target Some of this horribleness would be removed a bit if we went to the nonborrowed base To focus on what the nonborrowed base would mean If the demand for money is -4 and we're trying to push out 10, we're going to be dumping in reserves like gangbusters So, borrowing will go down to the floor to keep the nonborrowed base exploding and interest rates will fall And we are just going to be all over the place We are going to have wild instability in interest rates As I look at what the staff has said, the best we can do at the moment is to focus on a broader aggregate like M2 I come to that conclusion not without some sympathy for where Frank Morris is But the main problem with a credit target is that we simply don't get the data with the kind of timeliness we need in order to make it a sensible intermediate target for monetary policy It's just not there   My own line of thought on this is that for the moment the best thing we can do is to focus on M2 I think we ought to shift adjust it; I would agree with Bob Black that we ought to get the best figures we can get But I want to call to the Committee's attention that with the kind of uncertainties we face, there isn't really a serious choice theoretically as to whether we ought to be stabilizing interest rates or stabilizing quantities The theory of stabilization of quantity develops from the hypothesis that demands for money are more stable than demands for goods and services so that greater stability can be provided to the economy by focusing on quantities and stabilizing them than by focusing on rates My own guess would be that we're in a situation now, if we're going to use monetary aggregate targeting, where we have to be a lot more flexible than we have been in the past And we have to give a lot more weight to seeing to it that interest rates don't go through wide swings I think that's also the implication of what Steve has been telling us for some time about the insensitivity of demand for M2 to changes in market interest rates If we are not very careful--if we try to control M2 too closely--we're going to see interest rates moving all over the map And, frankly, I don't think the present very fragile state of the economy will permit that   For however long it takes for the demand for M1 to settle down Maybe it will settle down by midyear; then we can    12/20-21/82  reconsider that decision I'd hate to decide now, however, that by midyear it will definitely happen, because as you mentioned, John--   --the new accounts for businesses, which may in effect end the prohibition of interest on demand balances, may come along soon or it may not Who knows what is going on?   What I said was It is better than M1 and I know of no alternative at the moment And because of those uncertainties, I think we have to use a lot of flexibility--in effect give a lot of attention to how much movement of interest rates we're willing to tolerate to shut off an excessive growth of M2 or to stimulate growth that is too low If we're not awfully careful, we're going to be chasing an aggregate the demand for which is being changed by financial innovation rather than something fundamental going on in the economy That's why I want to shift adjust this as soon as [possible]   It could easily have a deflationary potential It depends on how the judgments work out   On the report of demand and time deposits? You have to because--   The one we have says it's lines 39 to 42  -74-    12/20-21/82   What is your M2 number, Tony?   Is this supposed to be a shift-adjusted number now?   The whole idea of alternative one was to put in a number that had no shift adjustment I thought alternative two was to be an alternative in which we had a shift-adjusted number  SPEAKER(?) No   That isn't the way it reads The way it--   If these estimates are right, 9-1/2 percent implies a 6-1/2 percent shift-adjusted M2 growth And that's ridiculous   What kind of a path is he going to draw from this?   Now you're talking about this as a not shift- adjusted number   But we're already expecting 3 percentage points   I know But if we're talking about 9-1/2 percent as a not shift-adjusted number, that implies about 6-1/2 percent shift-adjusted and if we have velocity declining in--   I'm thoroughly confused   I was thinking of going the other way My thought was that we need to include in the directive a number that is realistic and also has some indication of shifting I think the alternative two as you now propose it is alternative one prime; it is no longer alternative two as it was in the Bluebook I would prefer to use a number like 11-1/2 percent and say that it includes an amount of shift ranging from one to five percentage points I want to emphasize the uncertainty The 11-1/2 percent comes from the same shift-adjusted 8-1/2 percent we started with   Maybe   Could we say "a modest shift"?   I want to protect against the possibility that we may have to allow M2 to grow by 14 or 16 percent or some number like that   "Allows for a modest amount of shifting"   It sounds all right to me   It doesn't say M2 or M3; it's general   We can interpret [the evidence]; that gives us flexibility to--    12/20-21/82   I would take it out also   I don't like to say final sales strengthened when they went up about a tenth of one percent   This is after allowance--   Gross   It's further shift?   Does that include the Super NOWs?   You must be looking at an increase on average in January of maybe $40 billion in MMDAs--December-to-January If we had 10 percent of the increase in MMDAs coming from market securities, that's $4 billion that comes out of market securities Multiply that by 12 and you get a [$48] billion dollar annual rate of increase, and that's a lot in M3   Yes, I know That's why I say if only 10 percent came from that amount--   But you can't adjust CDs that rapidly At least it seems to me that if they are not maturing right away--   We didn't say "somewhat"!   They're real gunslingers out in the Midwest, I'll tell you that!   I like the staff forecast for 1983 at least And maybe that's because my numbers, which I put down in advance, turned out to match the staff's almost exactly I look at the higher numbers that many people are now forecasting--5 percent or more for the four quarters of 1983--and I ask myself "Why?" I wonder if perhaps we are being overly influenced by signs that we got off to a pretty good January, judging by the improvement in nonfarm employment I think it's quite possible that if we get off to a flying start, a momentum could develop But I think it's just as possible that quite the opposite could happen That after an initial burst, real GNP growth suddenly comes to a halt or at least slows down very substantially; industrial output goes nowhere; unemployment begins to rise again; and a new wave of pessimism begins to set in I think we need to concern ourselves with that a good deal However, in making a projection and thinking about the course of 1983 as a whole, I really think the same basic factors that led all of us to worry a month or two months ago about whether recovery was going to happen at all, and if so when, are still there We're still dealing with a business community that is shell-shocked, that is going to play its cards very cautiously on the inventory front, that is going to wait until capacity utilization has gone up, and that is still very worried about the durability of the recovery We're still dealing with very, very high real interest rates and very little hope that something will be done at this juncture about the deficit further out to bring real interest rates down We're dealing with consumers who, although they've improved their financial positions, are not going to lead us out of this into a strong recovery; I think the state of the saving rate is one factor that argues against that And I think the export markets are just very, very weak All this adds up to a very modest pace of economic expansion I think the staff has it about right   There are some that are actually below   There have to be at least three one nonvoting president, one voting president, and one Board member   That's the hereafter, I guess!   I think so As a matter of fact they started in July to produce for the upturn that never materialized   I think the situation presently is one in which we have to regard our principal objective for 1983 as making sure we do whatever is necessary to permit a recovery And we have to be awfully careful in defining our financial objectives to make sure that we keep that in mind Having said that, I still think it's important for us to continue using quantitative targets of some kind If we go in the direction of trying to target on interest rates, we will be sending signals that we have changed our fundamental long-run objectives of policy I agree with Henry completely on that And I think if we start targeting on interest rates, any hope that we're going to make progress on the budget is going to go right out the window because Congress is going to say "Well, if you can do all those good things on interest rates, then what's the point of our being more disciplined?"  In thinking about the targets, I have come to the conclusion that Ml ought to be confined to the nearest waste basket at least for the next 5 years When I look back at 1982, I don't think this decline in velocity is an accident The 8-1/2 percent increase we had in M1 over the four quarters consists of a 3-1/2 percent increase in old Ml, which is the measure on which we based all of our historical relationships between M1 and GNP, and a 35 percent increase in other checkable deposits My point here is simply that we have no real idea whether this new composition of M1 will give us a cyclical and secular    2/8-9/83  pattern of M1 anything like the old one or not And the Super NOWs, of course, make it much worse no matter how much shift adjustment we make for them So, I think we're in a position in which we ought to give zero weight to Ml and ought to concentrate our attention on the broader aggregates And I think there's much to be said for using a credit aggregate in some way; I don't think we can use it for a target in the same way we've used the monetary aggregates because we simply do not have the kind of data availability, much less capacity to control it But using it as an information variable--telling us where we have been, giving us additional flexibility in adjusting our monetary targets as the year goes on--is potentially a very valuable use of that kind of financial variable Also, if we focus on a total nonfinancial debt variable the way the staff has suggested, it also has the other very substantial benefit of in effect saying to the Congress "Look, if the number we're shooting for is, say, $450 billion, and the federal government is taking $210 billion, then we only have this much left for the private sector and anything you can do to bring down the deficit will increase private credit availability"   What is it you are arguing for--M3 or L?   Well, the other way you can interpret Steve's remarks is that what you should do, according to the model, is take the growth rate of old M1 and the growth rate of new Ml and average the two together Then you get the right answer  SPEAKER(?) That leaves us another problem   Just don't expect us to read it, Bob!   I think we shouldn't try, Mr Chairman The idea of shift adjusting--   When the magnitudes are $200 billion in two months it is absurd because if you get a very minor change in that percentage that comes from non-M2 sources, it makes a fundamental difference in your appraisal   And you ought to make that point But I think it argues strongly for using a February-March base instead of a fourth-quarter base   You can still argue that from February-March    2/8-9/83   One point we ought to keep in mind in thinking of the M1 target and using the fourth quarter is that we in effect are saying that that horrendous drop in velocity, which largely took place in the fourth quarter, is either going to get reversed or we're going to put it into our targets somehow Otherwise, you see, we're not going to forgive that big fourth-quarter growth; we're going to make up for it later on Or to put it differently, if you look at page 15 of the Bluebook and take the first-quarter average for 1983, just for alternative B we have 87 percent first quarter over fourth quarter largely because of what happened in the fourth quarter   M1, yes I think going back to that base of the fourth quarter for Ml is very, very risky Now, I'm prepared to do that if we're prepared to put a zero weight on the target To me that's a good compromise 95 percent weight on M2, 5 percent on M3, and 0 on Ml   You can use any base you want But I think that's a very, very risky business   In which case the staff's forecast probably also will be wrong--not in the direction of more nominal GNP but less   One way of handling the binding aspects of this is to widen the range and make it 6 to 10 percent, extending the upper limit That has the additional virtue of maintaining the same lower limit as we had last year   I think we gain nothing by cutting it a half point We allow ourselves a little more flexibility by leaving it where it was   I would strongly support that An additional argument for the ones that both John and Steve have given is the fact that we're looking at responses to Super NOWs which at the present time are being conditioned by the fact that the banks and the thrifts are just being flooded with money on MMDAs I think a very logical    2/8-9/83  possibility is that, as the MMDA rates settle down, interest in Super NOWs is going to build up, and none of us knows exactly how much allowance to make for that I think we ought to provide flexibility on that score   There's a very good reason for looking at what happens to debt growth in a year in which the monetary aggregates may well be developing a new kind of relationship with GNP that we don't fully understand I would hope we'd use this seriously And I do want to say something about the numbers at the appropriate time   I think another way of getting a perspective on it--and none of us really has looked at this number very closely--is to look at the flow of credit implied and how that relates to the level of GNP forecast for the year We're starting with a range that in my judgment is too low The 8 percent lower limit would imply a growth of credit equal to 117 percent of forecast GNP And that would be the lowest ratio we've seen since 1970 in a ratio which has a secular tendency to go upward Furthermore, if you take out the $210 billion the staff is forecasting that the government will borrow, that leaves $171 billion for private domestic nonfinancial borrowing That ratio is 53 percent of GNP You have to go back to 1950 to find anything similar   Yes The midpoint is 9-1/2 percent and is also in my judgment very, very low It leaves a ratio of private credit expansion to GNP of 7-1/2 percent There's only one number since 1961 that was that low 1975 So, we're talking about recession levels of private credit expansion relative to GNP  -53-    2/8-9/83   Right Of course   To put Chuck's point in a different way There is a secular upward movement in this ratio We get in the 13 to 14 percent range, as a portion of GNP, for the first time in 1972-73 We're talking about a very, very stringent set of credit market conditions that would lead to that kind of ratio of credit expansion to GNP I think 9 to 12 percent would be more appropriate in terms of the kind of credit market situation we all want   But that's a flow   I'm just looking at it a different way and one that to me is a more familiar one And I think what it says is that we're targeting on growth rates of private credit relative to GNP that are [comparable to] the ratios of 10 years ago   We're talking about a ratio of private credit expansion to GNP that we last saw maybe in 1954-55 or somewhere around there You'd think somehow--    2/8-9/83   I'm looking at the middle column of the last row And then I'm saying What if we took out the government component of that and got to the private ratio?   You will note that this ratio has a secular upward trend to it It started out in the 6 to 9 percent range in the early 1960s and got up into the 12 to 14 percent range in the early 1970s   Well, that's part of it   We don't need to roll back the world that fast   No I wouldn't suggest anything of the kind   Yes Well, from the $452 billion I took out the staff's [projected deficit] number, which I think was $210 billion, and I got a figure--I don't have the numbers--whatever 452 minus 210 is And I divided that by the GNP and got 7-1/2 percent I looked at my own tables here, which I happen to have with me, to compare that 7-1/2 percent And when I went back, I thought Well, in 1975 we had 69 percent And then I went all the way back and had to go back to 1961 to find any comparable ratio   But let's get this causation straight You do not put interest rates up, if you were targeting on credit aggregates, by having high credit aggregates The reason that credit expansion declines is precisely because interest rates go up We want a target here, I think, that accommodates a sufficient expansion of credit at something close to prevailing interest rates That's the way one would have to look at it   I think the argument almost came out the other way around That is, that you could have low credit aggregates because there may be sufficient restriction on the economy with present interest rates so that private credit demands are not going to be strong I say that may well be, but we may be misappraising the level of interest rates necessary to hold credit expansion down this low And I want to make sure that our credit aggregates are not that tight It's because I'm taking these numbers seriously--and I hope we use this number seriously--that I'm arguing this strongly Maybe we're not going to, but maybe--   That 13 percent could be used to set the monetary aggregates very low Typically what we have had in the early period of recovery is a marked increase in interest rates from very low levels, which leads to economization of money and credit use But that's not the situation we're in now We're already starting from real interest rates that are very high and we're worried about whether or not interest rates are going to go up enough to choke off the recovery And one way to guarantee it is to set both monetary and credit aggregate targets that are too low   Monetizing the debt in that sense, Bill, would mean taking off all limits and I'm not arguing that It's a question of what particular numbers are appropriate, and there can be disagreement on whether or not 8 to 11 percent or 9 to 12 percent is appropriate Arguing that raising the limits by one percentage point means monetizing the debt seems to me to be a bit extreme   All I'm arguing is that we're dealing with a new ratio that none of us really knows too much about I'm saying, in my judgment, 8 to 11 percent is just too tight It's as simple as that   When you look at the 3 years we've just completed and see that we got away with 9-1/2 to 10 percent expansion in total credit, you say to yourself Well, maybe that's enough What I want you to recall is that in those 3 years we have had no growth in economic activity at all None We've had extremely high  -59-    2/8-9/83  real interest rates It is no surprise that debt expansion assumes a very low--   This relates to nominal GNP and how fast credit grows overall Nominal GNP figures clearly were much higher in the latter part of the 1970s   No, you need year-over-year figures for these   Oh, I guess you're right These are kind of fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter   I think that's basically [unintelligible]   You're right When you add one percentage point to the flow, you get an extra $48 billion An extra $48 billion of credit is a lot   It was $48 [trillion] at the end of 1982   [Unintelligible] economy from the liquidity position of businesses and individuals And it clearly has a very strong secular upward trend It always has; that went on before there was an acceleration of inflation [unintelligible] If you go back to the 1950s, you'll find there was an acceleration in the growth of debt relative to GNP   We could say "slowed further, but not appreciably"   If you take the period from last September to January, you get a 53 percent rate of increase The third quarter was 55 percent, measured from June to September There has been a tiny further slowing, but not a lot   I definitely think that would do it   Mr Chairman, in line 44, I would prefer to put the lower market rates of interest after declining inflation because it sounds as if the declining inflation is what is causing the lower market rates of interest It would read then, starting at line 43, "and that the availability of interest on large proportions of transactions accounts, declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest"   Mr Chairman, that language about the Super NOWs--if it says we assume nothing happens on that--may compromise your position at the moment with the DIDC Does it bother you at all?   But you used the wording that this range makes no allowance for any marketing of Super NOWs for businesses It would be a little difficult--   The range makes no allowance for that   Well, we're talking about long-range targets for the moment And if Jerry's problem becomes a real one, the way we can deal with that is in the short-run directive in May or June or December or whenever the date is by providing more weight to M1 because then we'd get the more automatic response So long as we haven't thrown it out, as I suspect [we may have], we're all right   Is this simply added weight? If we're setting any kind of target for Ml at all, we presumably are putting something other than zero [weight on it]   We could monitor it "carefully" instead of "closely," Mr Chairman   All we need is a sentence here that keeps our options open I think we're arguing much too hard about details of the language We want to keep the options open   You can even monitor it while--   But we use "associated range of growth" on the previous page I think it's just a reiteration, making clear that this--   I certainly agree with Roger's objective that we want to ensure a recovery But I would argue that 50 basis points  -85-    2/8-9/83  on short-term interest rates is not going to do the job If we don't have interest rates low enough now to provide reasonable assurance of a recovery, then let's forget about 50 basis points on short-term interest rates and knock them down 200 basis points; I would agree with trying to go to a 50 basis point reduction only if that were a first step in a substantial further easing of interest rates And frankly, I don't think that's necessary The best thing we can do now is to provide some assurance that interest rates are not going to rocket upward To provide a signal that we're going to knock them down now and then maybe knock them up again a week from now is going to shake markets much worse than leaving them where they are   If after four or five weeks' evidence on the state of the economy or the monetary aggregates they are too fast instead of too slow and we decide we ought to change our policy, we're making decisions based on last week's numbers, not on a well-reasoned view of where the economy is going to go So, I would stop with the slow growth of the monetary aggregates   I appreciate the difficulties of putting in any numbers at all given the prevailing uncertainties But to put out an operating paragraph which says, in effect, that we have some numbers and we're going to act in accordance with them but we're not going to tell you what they are, doesn't seem like a reasonable way to proceed   Then we ought to use different language   Or 8-3/8 to 8-5/8 percent!   Is the word "introduction" the right word in that phrase "introduction of new accounts"? Maybe it is   How often do we engage in RPs in the BA market? Is this once a week, once a month? Is it with the kind of frequency that if we were out for any significant length of time there would be commentary on it?   I don't know that I would want to argue that my own thinking is radically different from that of the staff's, but I think the time has come when we have to wonder whether or not this recovery might not be gathering more steam than we've realized up to this point I can make a case for a significantly higher rate of increase in GNP, I think, along lines like this If we look back at the past two quarters, in the fourth quarter to the first quarter we see an increase of private final purchases on the order of 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate--a little less in the first than in the fourth quarter--and this is just in the process of going into recovery That's what we are getting before we have the effects of the tax cut hitting in the second half of the year and before we have the beginnings of a pickup in business fixed investment, which we all expect to happen at some point or other Now, the staff forecast doesn't have a sustaining of the recent pace of advance in private final purchases, partly because it's expected that we're going to get a big drop in net exports in real terms and also because residential construction is not going to contribute as much as it has in the recent past The staff may be right But there is a tendency, I think, for final sales to gain momentum as a recovery proceeds; and that could happen again  The second fact is that I'm very, very much uncertain about what we ought to be forecasting for inventory acceleration during the course of this year When I talk to people out in the field they tell me Boy, those shelves are just bare so that if you get a dollar's worth of orders at the consumer level it just goes right back through to an order for a manufactured good because there's nothing [on the shelf] to sell In fact, if you look at the statistics, you'll find that in real terms we've had the biggest drop absolutely in inventories in this recession than in any since 1949 And that tends to confirm the bareness of the shelves argument that we hear from qualitative comments We don't have what I would consider a normative ratio of inventory investment to GNP in real terms until we get out to about the end or the middle of 1984, when we get inventory investment up to about 1 percent of GNP It could happen sooner than that We could easily get an increase of as much as 1 percentage point in real terms above what the staff is forecasting at present levels of interest rates for 1983 If that happened, the momentum is going to build still further I don't know whether this is really going to happen or not, but my guess would be--and we talked about this at the Board meeting this morning--that the risks at this juncture are more on the high side than they are on the low side of our staff forecast   Are you talking about the thrifts or the international situation?   To facilitate discussion, I think it's better if it is fresh in our minds   That won't even show up in Frank's statistics   Are you talking about alternative I or II?   Yes, but I mean in terms of alternative [wording]   Well, Mr Chairman, we're getting some indications of a divergence of views among the Committee members as to where the economy is going, and I think that's understandable This is, after all, a recovery that's only just beginning The evidence on where we're going is still fragmentary And each of us, I think, tends to seize upon a particular number that tends to support his own view Not by way of singling out Frank, but Frank for example mentioned that durable goods orders had fallen in February and that was disappointing I could come back and say, yes, now we only have a 34 percent annual rate of rise in durable goods orders from the fourth quarter to February You can take either side of this issue and make something of it if you want I think we ought to recognize that there are a lot of uncertainties and that means to me among other things that we ought to be cautious Whatever we do we don't want to go back to a situation in which inadvertently we either let interest rates drop a ton or increase a ton If they move in either direction, we're likely to find ourselves far from where we want to  The second thing I want to say is that I agree entirely with Jerry Corrigan, not just on Ml, but on the Ms generally I just don't know what they mean Now, it is true that M1 in the past has proven to be our faithful friend--more predictable in terms of its relationship with GNP and maybe more controllable I also would want to remind everybody that since the fourth quarter of 1981 the growth of M1 has just baffled us We've had a movement of velocity we do not understand In mid to late 1981 and early in 1982 I think we reacted in an overly restrictive direction to the growth of OCDs We got an economy that was a lot sicker in 1982 as a consequence thereof To say that somehow these recent increases in Ml despite five quarters of very, very puzzling velocity, are going to generate inflation right around the corner is a very, very dangerous line of thinking For the moment, I think we ought to try to look at other things I agree with Bob that we need to start positioning ourselves for where we want to  -51-    3/28-29/83  be in the future I have come to the conclusion that real interest rates may well need to be moved up to keep this recovery from strengthening [too much] I'm very much impressed by the fact that the cost of capital, if you take into account the rise of stock prices, has dropped a lot And we've added a half a trillion dollars of wealth Now, this affects consumption spending, through the cost of capital, as well as the outlook for business fixed investment But I would want to proceed very slowly and very gradually I'm inclined, therefore, to think that we ought to go somewhere between "B" and "C" I'm not quite sure what I want by way of initial borrowing, but I wouldn't mind at all if the federal funds rate were nudged up to 9 percent or maybe a little over As to the alternatives, I don't really care whether we go with I or II I'd feel a bit more comfortable if we begin moving back in the direction of something other than a strict money market directive But I can go with either one of those   I think that level of borrowing is quite all right I would note particularly that, although short-term rates are a little higher than they were at the time of the last FOMC meeting, longer-term rates--the important ones--are in fact down So, I think we've not had any additional tightening in any meaningful sense   One can always reason that even with alternative language, he who seeks may not find   "Speculating wildly, the Committee"!   You wouldn't abandon your old friend so completely would you, Frank?   If you take the sentence from alternative II instead, you don't have to worry about it because it says "a more pronounced slowing"   I would go the other direction   Me too   Mr Chairman, this is Lyle I agree with Frank's last comment that the aggregates have not been giving us an indication of what is happening to monetary policy And I would be strongly opposed to the use of one month's prospective reduction in the growth rates from very high paces to take action to lower interest rates I interpreted Jerry Zeisel's comments as indicating that by and large the recovery is coming along as well as we could have expected There are the same kinds of weaknesses and question marks that we had at the time of the FOMC meeting, but nothing new in that respect I think we ought to wait until we have a clearer indication before we take precipitate action to lower interest rates   I would agree with Chuck and Ed too I think what we are getting now are some of the typical internal dynamics of the business cycle process, with dynamism in one sector reviving confidence in another and the whole thing building up into a more cumulative cyclical process And in this connection, I was interested in Jerry's comment in speaking of 1984 I don't think I can quote him exactly but he said something like this That present high levels of real interest rates, which are assumed to be a consequence of the monetary policy we're pursuing, will be a major restraint on private demand Another way of stating the whole idea is that if we follow a policy which keeps interest rates from rising during the course of the dynamic cyclical process and that's fed by additional fiscal stimulus as time goes on, we may well be fueling a much larger economic expansion than anybody is forecasting now Those are two different statements, looking at the same phenomenon in a different way None of us knows for sure whether we ought to regard present real interest rates as a major restraint on private demand or as a level of interest rates that will accommodate a substantial increase in private demand And I think as one looks at what has been going on in the past six months one is inclined--or at least I'm inclined--to the latter view rather than the former We are getting a very, very dynamic response, particularly in those areas that are most credit sensitive like housing So, we may be seeing a revival here of the usual cyclical process, which will give us a much bigger increase at present levels of real interest rates over the next two years than we're now forecasting  -10-    5/24/83   Well, I come out somewhere near Karen, although I start at a different place I don't know what in heaven's name to make of these money supply numbers I have read the staff document with great interest and I think it does point out an important reason why we have had so much growth in M1 here--that is, we have a much higher interest elasticity of [money] demand, almost twice as high as the model suggested for the period 1959 to 1974 So, I assume from that that we aren't anywhere near as expansive as the 9, 10, or 11 percent growth rates in Ml would indicate over the past year or so  -24-    5/24/83  But I don't know how much expansion we have had on the basis of the money numbers, so I tend to retreat to basics under uncertainty of this kind I start with the proposition that if I could shape the recovery in any way that I would want to, I would like to have economic growth come out just the way the staff thinks it's going to, at somewhere between 4 and 5 percent both this year and next If we get that, we will have improvement on the employment front, we will reduce excess capacity, we will get an investment process started but we will have, I think, continuing progress on inflation My worry is that we are going to get more than that for reasons I have already indicated And I add one more factor, and that is that I think fiscal policy is much more likely to be more stimulative than we are now talking about rather than less I think we are not going to get a budget resolution; we are going to end up with lots of appropriation bills and they are not going to be easy to veto But I am in a horrible dilemma, in terms of deciding what we ought to do as regards policy I think that the international debt situation argues very, very strongly for not letting interest rates rise Unfortunately, that international debt situation is still going to be here a year from now And so, if I am right and at some point down the line we will need to think about raising interest rates, I guess it would be easier to raise them a little now, rather than to let the internal dynamics of the cycle begin to take hold and then raise them a lot more later So, in terms of operational procedures for the moment, I would be inclined to argue for something like "B minus"--I think "C" is much too tight--with initial borrowings at maybe $350 to $400 million or somewhere around there I don't care whether the federal funds rate range is 6 to 10 percent or 7 to 11 percent And I would continue to use M2 as our principal target   They didn't invite you!   I would want my own prescription in that case to be reinterpreted as pushing a level of initial borrowing that would get the funds rate up to somewhere in the 8-3/4 or 9 percent range I'd like the market to notice it I can certainly understand why people who look at the present unemployment rate, excess capacity, and so on are saying No, this is not the time to do it And I can understand Tony's concerns But I think we're going to be faced with  -35-    5/24/83  these same concerns a month from now, 3 months from now, and 6 months from now; and they're going to be worse then they are now   [You think] the "increase" should be "decrease"   But this won't get published for 45 days and meanwhile he can bail us out   That's not fair That's not fair at all The argument that I think people are laying out here is that we now have a good cyclical recovery underway It's not out of hand at the moment But I think past cyclical processes strongly suggest that recoveries tend to gain momentum as time goes on That's not what the staff has forecast, but I think Jerry would agree that the risks at this point are on the up side and not on the down side   It depends on how much we want it to gain And the question is--   Everybody recognizes that too   I always think that monetary policy has to work on a forecast, Tony I don't believe that we operate just on what we see in the past 3 months or past 1 month on Ml or anything else You have to ask yourself where you want to go and where you think the economy is going If I thought the economy were falling off a cliff now, I'd want to drop interest rates a ton But I don't I think the evidence has been accumulating month-by-month that this recovery is gaining a lot of strength Let's cite some numbers The industrial production index has gone up at a 17 percent annual rate since December   That's right We had private final purchases, residential construction plus personal consumption plus business fixed investment, going up at a 5-1/4 percent rate in the first quarter This is not a weak recovery We've had an increase in new orders for total durable goods at a 24 percent annual rate since December and at a 39 percent annual rate of increase for nondefense capital goods Now, this is a recovery that's gaining momentum I grant you that if we could be assured that we're going to get 4 to 5 percent growth and no more for the next two years, then I would be happy just to sit right where we are But I don't think that's the outcome that is going to happen, so I think we need to take the precautionary move now And if we go up 1/4 percentage point or 1/2 percentage point on the fed funds rate, it isn't going to end the world It's not going to be the fact that dumps Brazil off the edge of the precipice If we have to go up 200 basis points next September because we didn't go up 50 basis points now, Brazil is going to have a lot worse time of it Obviously, there are risks in going in either direction But I think the cautious and prudent thing to do now is to snug up just a tiny bit   Well, I think it's important for us to keep a facade up that we're using all the monetary aggregates   I don't want us to say we're deliberately pushing up interest rates That's not the kind of indication that's going to be easy to deal with later on So, I'd like to use that Ml as a cover   That's right   Oh, I would want to   Well, his statement does that   That you're offering in the spirit of compromise?   What if we put the two together? "The action was taken against the background of evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery and continued rapid growth of Ml"   That's a rather unusual construction no matter what, if we have lesser restraint if M2 and M3 slow further but we don't say what we're going to do if M1 slows   I think we'd need to drop the "while," though The Chairman's point is correct The argument seems backwards--   --if we say we're doing this while Ml [is high] although M2 and M3 are falling below We ought to drop the "while recognizing that"   Or leave the order the way it is but take out the word "while" and just say "recognizing that [Ml] growtheven though M2 and M3 are below"   I think it helps the syntax of it   To Poole, the lower the money number the lower the funds rate, I think  SPEAKER(?) In the long run  [Unintelligible] talk about Poole?   Oh, no!  SPEAKER(?) But then we have a lot of--   I'd prefer $400 million, but I'll buy $350 million I'm getting hungry too!   Again as a consensus   We had six for $350 million   Are unfilled orders rising or falling at this point?   I agree with the staff's forecast for this year, and I don't think we're looking at a runaway boom I would think the case for some deceleration of growth in 1984 is a strong one, given the net export picture we're looking at The question is how much deceleration And I think the area where the staff may have underestimated the amount of strength is in the business fixed investment area where the magnitude of the increase over the four quarters of next year is 7-3/4 percent That's rather weak relative to what we typically see I know one can make a case for it in terms of the weakness in the nonresidential construction area But to turn to your question about interest rates, this is why I think you're really going to have to look harder The survey of inflation expectations that we get from this guy Hoey came in today; we get a copy of it   It turns out that in the last quarter inflationary expectations worsened somewhat over every time horizon, and the 5- and 10-year expectations of inflation are in the range of 6-1/2 to 7 percent If you take today's interest rates on corporate bonds and put them on an after-tax basis to compare with that kind of inflation expectation, you don't have any positive real interest rate at all The corporate bonds are forecast at [unintelligible] after taxes So, I'm not inclined to the view that the economy is going to stop in its tracks at the present level of interest rates I think there is a case that could be made that we may have somewhat more of a buildup of business fixed investment plans this year than the staff has forecast   I was looking at it from the borrower's viewpoint in thinking about this   Yes, domestic borrowing  -18-    7/12-13/83   I'd like to ask a question What specifically do you assume for Ml velocity for the latter half of this year?   I got a little shaky when I read his number   I thought I saw a number that said 5   So, you have a zero in the third quarter and a 5 in the fourth quarter   I just wonder if we're not taking this setting of the target for next year a bit too seriously here We're talking about 1/2 percentage point on a 3 percentage point range with a variable whose linkage to GNP is rather uncertain I think mainly what we should be concerned with is the cosmetics of this We're not  -29-    7/12-13/83  setting policy here for the next 3-1/2 years; we're setting the target for M2 for next year   I'm inclined to go in that direction, yes I don't think the difference between 7 to 10 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent is going to be all that constraining in terms of the course of policy We could change it next February if we wanted to   Oh, we're changing them right now as a matter of fact That argument is quite incorrect   We did last year   We had a target of 6 to 9 percent and this year we have 7 to 10 percent So, I'm reasonably sure that if we have to change it, we could change it in the future   Easy money   Yes, 11 percent is all right; even 10-1/2 percent would be   8 percent in 1984   What happens to interest rates, of course, is critical And it will work primarily in the areas like the mortgage market, where you can have a substantial degree of variance between the amount of borrowing and the amount of residential construction But I think your reasoning is sound, Mr Chairman, that the range for debt is high relative to the broader monetary aggregates and that one would expect those things to converge eventually And, therefore, we could go a percentage point now without too much damage   That's June to December, not second quarter [to fourth quarter]   A range of 4 to 8 percent rebased gives you about the same as 7 to 11 percent   With an 11 percent--?   I calculated the fourth-quarter levels using 11 percent from the fourth quarter of 1982 and 8 percent from the second quarter of 1983 and I got within $1 billion   I think we ought to listen very carefully to the substance of what Tony is saying, in the sense that it would be a terrible mistake to impose too much restraint in the second half of this year because Ml is going up faster than we now think it might, if  -43-    7/12-13/83  the staff's forecast comes out right But also, if we seem to say that we have dismissed altogether the growth of Ml that is likely to be interpreted, given the present concerns of the market, as [meaning] that we have dismissed any concern about inflation And that would also be unfortunate I think we ought to find some way that avoids both of those problems   Any Ml forecasts [unintelligible] would be something like 6 to 8 percentage points off on nominal GNP growth   To complete my thought, what I would do is rebase and tell the market this We are not giving Ml any more weight now than we have all year; our principal focus still is M2 because the velocity of Ml is so terribly uncertain; there is some indication of a return toward normalcy, but it is by no means clear   The arrow is nice and straight; we just don't know which way it's going   In the second year?   You get a lot by way of money growth; that's worth $10 billion in Ml, I think The second-quarter average is $505 billion and June is $515 billion   Not necessarily   The argument for a big increase in velocity and slow growth in Ml is that we had this big cyclical drop in velocity, which relates to higher interest rate sensitivity in demand for NOW accounts and changes in compensating balance practices as interest rates go up And I think the implicit argument here, which we ought to lay on the table, is that interest rates are going up a good bit more than the staff has forecast and that slows down Ml growth a lot, so we need to keep a low range for that reason I worry about that about as much as I worry about the problem that Chuck posed earlier, which is that the economy may hit the rocks and Ml growth may slow down for that reason I think both of those are protecting against being run over by a herd of stampeding elephants in Washington at high noon The main problem we're going to have, I think, is that we have a fairly strong economy that's going to pull a lot of money growth out And the question is what we want to do about that Do we want to ignore it or not? I would be prepared to put very little weight on growth of Ml, but I don't think we ought to tell the public inadvertently that we're giving up on the fight against inflation So, I think Jerry's suggestion of basing on June makes good sense because I don't think we ought to constrain ourselves too much Then we can use 4 to 8 percent and it sounds better Cosmetically, it sounds better And I think we can finesse this business of velocity in 1984; that's no problem No one really knows what is going to happen to velocity anyway so we just make some arguments for [the possibility that] it may go up or it may not and we'll be all right   No, if we say it may not go up, we're saying in effect that we're not going to put much weight on Ml until we see normal patterns of M1/GNP relationships restored And if, in fact, when we get to 1984, it takes 10 percent growth in Ml to have a decent economy, we're prepared to do that  -54-    7/12-13/83   That makes a very strong case, if we are going to rebase at all, for rebasing on June   Hopefully, we're only about 1/8th of the way   Maybe 1/16th   Would it be better, instead of an initial borrowing assumption, to talk about an initial net borrowed reserve number?   No trickier than [the relationship of] initial borrowing to the federal funds rate   Pages 21 to 22 That would go with the bracketed comment on page 21   Well, it's going to take a while to get there   We're not going to get there until there has been enough evidence in the financial data and the nonfinancial data to indicate to the public that no further tightening is needed   That's why I would agree that some slight further nudging up is needed I do think it's important to recognize that we have accomplished a good bit We have long-term rates up 3/4 percentage point, the stock market has stopped booming, and the exchange rate hasn't dropped a ton like we thought it was going to do in the past year, so we got restraint from that side too So, we've made some progress I think we probably need a little more   Well, progress in achieving a--   Well, I would go for a borrowing figure of somewhere around $800 million probably, or $850 million I'd like to see the federal funds rate hit around 9-1/2 percent I wouldn't want it to go up high into the 9-1/2 to 10 percent range I would go basically with the specs of "B" That's where I'd be I want to do this cautiously I would not wish to go in the direction that the bracketed language in the directive suggests, with a lot of automaticity in response I think automaticity in response ought to be avoided like the plague because we just don't know what these money numbers mean Until those numbers begin to make more sense, I think we ought to use a judgmental approach rather than an automatic response   I agree with that too; for the long-run range I would use 4 to 8 percent based on June   You just have to convince them that we've moved enough to choke off inflation and not enough to hurt the economy   Would that be demoting Ml further from what it was?   We're talking about the operating directive It's getting somewhat absurd   It's getting somewhat absurd The whole idea of providing a little broadening is fine, but you are throwing in the monitoring of the credit aggregate and you are throwing in the international situation This is--   We can list these things in the Chairman's ear I agree with flexibility, too [Unintelligible] between now and the next meeting   What has it been?   Well, then, leave it there   What is the staff--   Well, that's the part that bothers me We start out with an Ml target for this year of 4 to 8 percent and then we are going to allow an overrun and raise it for next year And what is going to happen is that people are going to say the Fed [is not] fighting inflation I think you are making a lot more of this velocity point than is necessary from the standpoint of consistency with GNP projections If you're talking about the midpoint and the average, fine But there's no reason at all why if we have a target of 4 to 8 percent, we can't let the 8 percent happen If 8 percent happens, 10-1/4 or 10-1/2 percent is easily a reachable measure for nominal GNP   If we go to 5 to 9 percent, isn't there a reasonable argument for rebasing on the second quarter for the second half of this year also?   If we go to 5 to 9 percent, I think we could do that Maybe the staff could give us estimates of what 9 percent would be What would a range of 5 to 9 percent give us if we hit the upper end of that range?   Yes   The only question is what the year-over-year growth is I think it'll be close to 12 percent   1/2 of a percent, yes   That's a lot of progress, Bob   We could put it in the list below the credit aggregate M2, M3, credit aggregate, and Ml   I'd prefer 4 to 8 but I could live with 5 to 9   Well, I'd rather switch than fight   It could be 5 to 9 percent and then 4 to 8 percent, but not the reverse   That would be my preference   We could leave the total nonfinancial debt in 1983 in that sentence, take out the next bracket and the following bracket, and then change it to the second half of this year   We've done it before [unintelligible] M1   Our range for 1981 was 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent   We should have We knew as little then as we do now   I think we're much better off to have it somewhat lower; I would worry very much about just the announcement effects of numbers like 5 to 9 percent continuing through 1984   It's not that it's going to affect policy at all; I don't think it will But I think the announcement effects could be unfortunate It's not the market effects but the announcements effect that I'm worried about   The 5 to 9 is just for a half year, Nancy That's annualized   Somehow they seem rather anticlimactic   Generally speaking, $50 billion a quarter is what we'll be looking at   Mr Chairman, I sense a somewhat different tone developing at this meeting in regard to where the economy is going than I detected at the last meeting We have seen some signs of slowing in retail sales, although it's hard to assess what one month's numbers mean Prospectively, in housing we've heard a lot qualitatively about the slowdown in mortgage applications and so on Still in all, I think it's wise to recall that if anyone had forecast 6 months ago that we were going to be looking at a 9 percent real GNP growth in the second quarter and 8 percent in the third, he would have been considered slightly off his rocker [The expansion] has developed much, much more strongly than nearly everybody had foreseen In my judgment, probably the best single analogy one can use for the economy is that of the fly wheel What happened in this quarter is going to happen in the next one My guess, if I had to make one, would be that we're more likely to see somewhat faster growth than the staff has forecast for 1984 And I think the big candidate for an overrun is business investment It's something I cannot pin down except to say that the increase in contracts and orders for plant and equipment in the past two quarters has been very, very substantial, but I have a hunch that more is developing in this area than what was allowed for  Still in all, if I had to put out a forecast, it wouldn't be drastically different from what the staff has for next year It might be a half point more or something like that, but certainly nothing that would change in major ways the outlook for employment and for prices One of the things that we do need to think about and concern ourselves with is what may be happening in the food area The staff has a 7 percent rise in food prices fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter Unless we get some rain of substantial magnitude soon, it could be a lot more than that It would be worrisome if that got built into the underlying inflation It's awfully hard to keep that from happening I'm not quite sure what to do about it, but I worry about it   We are, in wheat But the inventories of corn and soybeans are going to be quite low If the crop forecast is reduced much further, I think we will get some liquidation of livestock herds, hogs and cattle both, and then a very large run-up of meat prices next year That is the big risk   I think the statistics show that household wealth has gone up somewhere between 3/4 of a trillion and a trillion dollars in the past year, taking the two things together Now, the distribution of this is another question But certainly the household wealth statistics have looked much, much better in the past year How much of that one can really expect to influence consumption is hard to say because it is rather narrowly distributed among a small--  -15-    8/23/83   If you think [unintelligible]   I think Henry is probably right and that things aren't really as nice as they seem, but I'd just like to relax and enjoy it awhile   But looking at the wage picture generally, the astonishing thing is the extent to which we're still getting give- backs and freezes The Board staff's latest memorandum on wage concessions says that concession bargaining was extensive again in the third quarter; at least 150,000 workers agreed to wage freezes or pay cuts just in that quarter And the latest wage concessions bring the cumulative number of workers who have acceded to give-backs so far this year to around a million compared with two million in 1982 I think we still are getting indications of very, very substantial moderation in wage rates   That's right Wage rate figures for the third quarter confirm what is going on in the union sector   Well, I'm not sure the average is holding up We don't have an employment cost index for the third quarter and the average hourly earning figures are a little difficult to read now because the latest employment situation report has a big strike figure in it I don't know what the August numbers will look like once the strike effects are taken out, but indications for the third quarter so far are for a slower rise in average hourly earnings this quarter than in the previous one   Hours? For the wages it's more like 4 percent   We're going to get that in industries where the [competitive] pressures are not there But they are surely being counterbalanced   Mr Chairman, there are two things that worry me about the staff forecast One is that it is so similar to a wide variety of forecasts that exist in the private sector The staff provided us with the usual summary of forecasts that they follow-- Chase, Wharton, DRI and Merrill Lynch--and it's amazing how close everybody is Real growth next year ranges from 42 to 47 percent; inflation rates measured by the deflator are somewhat higher than the staff's forecast but are very uniform at a little over 5 percent; everybody expects the unemployment rate to drop to somewhere around 8-1/4 percent by the end of 1984; and interest rates are expected to stay about where they are or maybe go up a little, but certainly not very much by the standards we've seen in recent years You know, when everybody forecasts the same thing, something is bound to be wrong There has to be something coming along that we have not foreseen  The second thing that worries me is that the outlook seems just too good to be true And if I could lay out the way I want it or what can reasonably be hoped for in terms of a course of economic and financial development next year, what I would hope for is a growth rate that slows down to the range of 4 to 5 percent--enough to make further progress on unemployment and not so rapid a growth rate to generate any unusual inflationary pressures I'd want a combination of developments that keeps interest rates about where they are or going down a little, pushing off any serious crowding out problem until 1985 and beyond I've listened to the comments around the table as to which way the risks go, and the sentiment tends to be that the risks may be on the up side I've asked myself [that question] and I would assess the risks as fairly well balanced But I would agree that the thing we ought to worry about most from the standpoint of policy is not that we will get a weaker economy but that we will get a stronger one with more inflation If we get a weaker economy, my feeling would be that we have enough pent up demand for housing and for consumer durable goods that, with a moderate decline in interest rates which certainly would not be unwelcome, we could keep the recovery going But if we got a considerably stronger recovery and more inflation and began to get significant pressures in credit markets with money growing very rapidly, we would have to resist Then we would have significant problems So, really, I hope things work just the way the staff forecasts But what I worry about most is that the recovery might be stronger with more inflation later on   Well, I'd want to be evenhanded but I would want to try and interpret [the aggregates] in light of what was happening in the economy If I saw a weak money number for October prospectively and a very strong set of September employment statistics, then I'd relax and let that happen If, on the other hand, the money growth were strong in October and the September employment statistics came in very weak, then I'd want to go in the other direction But I'd want to have a lot of input from thinking of where the economy is going   Well, we're quibbling about words now   I understand In terms of the way this should hit the public later on, I think we'd be much better off if we said unchanged and then--   Right When you say "reserve restraint" are you talking about the funds rate or are you talking about net borrowed reserves or borrowings?   It seems to me if we put out a directive--   I can't imagine that market participants would look at numbers like net borrowed reserves, borrowings, and the funds rate and decide that what we've been trying to do is to hit a target for net borrowed reserves The numbers are all over the map, as are the borrowing figures They saw the funds rate average 94, 94, 95, 95, 95, and 90 percent [in recent weeks] And to say that market participants are going to look at what we say and then compare it with the borrowing numbers seems to me a little strange   Yes, but they're all over the map The range runs from $647 million to $16 billion on borrowings And for net borrowed reserves it's from 0 to $13 billion   Well, it isn't just one week Throw out that one week and now the range on borrowings goes from $647 million to $12 billion and on net borrowed reserves from 0 to $700 million   Mr Chairman, should we heed the Biblical passage "Seek and ye shall find"?   Yes, there was a range of views   "Somewhat" is all we ever do between these [meetings] anyway   I wouldn't wish to change the language, even though I believe in going much less symmetrically, to make it consistent I think everybody reads into these changes in language much more than they ought to  -43-    10/4/83   We don't really expect it to be enough to bother to put that in   I'd like to ask about the increase in the GNP deflator in 1985 If you take 6-1/2 percent as the natural rate [of unemployment] and we're 2 percentage points above that in both '84 and '85, that should get us, according to your formula, about a 1-1/2 percentage point reduction in inflation per year You offset that with a drop in the average unemployment rate from 9-1/2 to 8-1/2 between '83 and '84; that should add about a quarter of a percentage    11/14-15/83  point to the inflation rate So, on balance, one would think that in '85 we ought to come up with about a 1 to 1-1/4 percentage point lower inflation rate than in '84 But you have it going up Can you [explain]?   Thank you   I would like to ask the staff this question Did you by any chance turn this exercise on its head and say Suppose we were to walk the unemployment rate down gradually to the natural rate by 1988? What results do you get then? I don't think they are going to be all that bad, really   And if we accept the definition of price stability of the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, we're almost there   If you just take the straight Phillips curve approach to it and make some rough ballpark calculations, leaving out what happens to the exchange value of the dollar, it looks as if you ought to be able to get [unemployment] even lower than that I suppose you have a very different effect on the dollar   You're always above the natural rate of unemployment All that is happening then, if you reduce the extent to which you get improvement, is that you have the speed limit effect The speed limit effect in any case is one that has been much in dispute; not everybody believes the speed limit hypothesis But if you threw that out, you would get even better performance   Well, in light of the results in chart 17, the remarkable thing is how well the Phillips curve model has done to explain what actually has happened It got a little off track for a while in 1981, but in terms of the overall performance of the economy from 1978 on it has done very, very well indeed So, I think the result that the staff is presenting to us is eminently reasonable in terms of outcome If what you want to do is get back to price stability, this is what you're going to have to suffer And if you want to get back to the natural rate of unemployment, you're going to have to have a worse inflation outlook   Yes, I don't think Chart 7 at all contradicts what is in Chart 17   But if you believe that theory, how would you explain what is on Chart 1?   Well, but that's kind of a technical answer out of a model which goes through the exchange rate  SPEAKER(?) That's right   It doesn't say what kind of political pressures evolve when high interest rates begin to upset the capital goods industries and residential construction and the export industries get devastated and trading partners complain a lot All those exogenous factors no longer stay unchanged When you build a model that endogenizes a lot of these responses, which never would take place, you would get different answers I don't know how you could argue seriously that in the long run the only way to finance a deficit is through money growth or inflation That to me makes no sense I'm not a monetarist, but if you give me 30 years, I have to believe that what happens to the money stock primarily determines what happens to prices   Yes, except if you go back to these 30 years in Chart 1, they were years in which the federal deficit as a percentage of GNP was dropping like a stone   It would be nice if the world worked the way Tony wants it to   But we've just been through an experience in which the Fed said to the world in 1979 Here it comes, guys; we're going to put you through the wringer And what we got, if you believe the model, and there have been other studies that confirmed this, was by-and-large the response of prices to the degree of slack in the markets--period, end of story Now the question is Why do you think it's going to work any differently the next time around? It would be nice if you were right, Tony, but I don't--   Well, I'm getting worried about whether or not we're going to get the speed and the degree of slowdown that the staff has forecast I agree with Governor Rice that the current quarter is one in which we may end up with more GNP growth than 63 percent I wouldn't worry too much about that, but I would worry a lot if growth in 1984 didn't slow down to somewhere close to the 4-1/2 percent or so rate the staff is forecasting One can make a strong argument, based on past cyclical performance, that we're going to get a lot less thrust from those two areas that typically lead the recovery--housing and inventories What we don't know at this point is the degree of strength that is developing in the business fixed investment area, which tends to replace the strength that comes along from housing and inventories in the first year of recovery We're in a very difficult position, I think, in trying to predict that because the investment intentions surveys that we used to depend on so heavily have become almost totally worthless The two private surveys we have gotten now for 1984 are predicting increases in nominal terms of between 9-1/2 and 11 percent And the staff has said, quite properly, that those numbers can't possibly be right; a lot more has happened The other kinds of information that we've tended to use are the contracts and orders figures, and they show simply enormous strength The contracts and orders figures in September in real terms are up at a 25 percent annual rate [from] the fourth quarter of 1982 The problem with forecasting from those figures is that they carry for about a quarter or maybe two quarters but not much further The staff's forecast for business fixed investment is reasonably strong for next year but it shows a progressive slowdown in the rates of increase from what we've had recently--from a 15 percent annual rate in third quarter of 1983 to 13 to 11 to basically 9 percent And if that doesn't happen and we get something more toward the upward end--in the 10 to 15 percent range--then we have a lot more growth ahead of us than we've allowed for  The other reason I think we ought to ask ourselves whether past cyclical patterns of slowdown in the second year are going to emerge is the policy assumption the staff is using on the monetary side It is true that we've had a very, very substantial slowdown in the growth of the monetary aggregates, but we've also had a very substantial turnaround in the performance of velocity The staff here--and there are many other economists who have been doing the same thing--have been using what we call effective money growth or what other economists call adjusted money growth I have been looking at some of the numbers What you do is ask yourself what would have happened to the money stock if the relationship between money and GNP and interest rates had been what it was prior to 1974 Now, that's a wild kind of thing to have to do, but it yields some interesting results What it says is that effective money growth in the first three quarters of this year was about 6-3/4 to 7 percent at an annual  -45-    11/14-15/83  rate, about 5 percentage points below the actual figures And in the fourth quarter it's going to be reversed; it's going to be about 8-1/2 percent at an annual rate, about 5 percentage points [above] the growth forecast by the staff Next year the staff forecast assumes that 7 percent is appropriate; but if we translate that to effective money growth, it comes out to 8 percent And that means, if you believe the staff's forecast for real money growth, that Ml is increasing at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate next year That is very, very high by historical standards On the fiscal side, I would remind you that we still have a lot of fiscal spending ahead of us The full employment deficit, based on the 6 percent unemployment rate calculation, went from a $10 to $15 billion range in the first half of 1981 to a $65 to $70 billion range in the first half of 1983 It goes up to a range of $115 to $120 billion in the first half of 1984 and to $125 to $130 billion in the last half of next year I have to figure, with that kind of fiscal stimulus and monetary expansion still proceeding quite rapidly, that the chances of an overrun of the staff's forecast for next year are very substantial   I share Governor Wallich's concerns that we're looking at an economy that is growing a lot faster than we thought it was going to And I think it's probably still going to show a lot of robustness over the next couple of quarters If I think about the kind of posture monetary policy for the course of 1984 that's likely to be consistent with keeping the economy's growth rate down to 4-1/2 percent or so and inflation no worse than 4-1/2 to 5 percent, I end up concluding that we're going to need higher interest rates I just don't see how we can run a monetary policy that provides the kind of expansion in the money supply that is in the staff's forecast for 1984 together with this horrendously stimulative fiscal policy in an economy that has a tremendous amount of cyclical momentum developing and not have an outcome that's rather different from what the staff is suggesting I've listened to what [Governor Martin] has said with great interest I think there are considerations on the down side that we need to think about But in my judgment the risks of an overrun are much greater at this point So, I agree with Jerry fully I think a precautionary step in the direction of firming is necessary  -58-    11/14-15/83  and desirable It wouldn't have to be done today It can even wait until the December meeting But the sooner we make it, I think the better off we're going to be Jerry's specs were a "B-;" I had put down $700 to $800 for borrowing and 9-1/2 to 9-3/4 percent [for fed funds] and that's exactly where he was So, I agree fully with him   I agree with what you say You're right that we are not going to have any better numbers a month from now The problem is that if we wait until February the capital spending plans for 1984 would be set in concrete; they are all being developed now The Christmas sales boom will have taken place and there is all the inventory planning that stems from that And it then becomes late If I'm right in my hypothesis, and I may not be, we're going to find ourselves in February wishing we had acted last August   Five percent Ml?   That isn't what the staff is projecting for next year   Yes, but if 5 percent looks high, what does 7 percent look like?   That sounds good to me   If we leave it the way the Chairman has expressed it and we understand that he's thinking of taking into account particularly the business news as well as the aggregates, that seems to me to be reasonable We can't express all the different--   That "7 percent or less" sounds so blooming high that it leaves the whole thing wide open   One problem I had with the analysis is that it seems to imply that we're looking at Ml as our principal target What I'm wondering is What do we do in a world of CRR if we're continuing to target primarily on M2? It seems to me that we ought to have an analysis of that If we [use Ml], we would be changing our operating techniques in that event   Well, I was not terribly sympathetic with the procedures we followed from October '79 to October '82 in the first place and I haven't looked back on that period with any different view I'm even more reluctant to see us go in that direction now by elevating Ml even partially toward an intermediate target or by increasing automaticity That's not just a matter of week-to-week or day-to-day or even month-to-month variability in the funds rate that we would be looking at, but it's the fact that we're looking at relationships between Ml and GNP since the fourth quarter of 1981 that simply have no parallel in prior history To make it very simple, let me take the past several months The staff has been anticipating a substantial increase in the growth rate of Ml, as I have, because we have such a strong economy It hasn't happened If we had had the kind of operating techniques that we did earlier and they were augmented by CRR, we would have experienced in the past couple of months a very substantial decline in interest rates And from my reading of the economy, we need a decline in interest rates and a stimulus to economy activity to go with the fiscal stimulus like we need holes in our heads In my judgment, we're looking at a very strong economy--an economy in which the risks are too much expansion, rather than too little, and more inflationary pressures I recognize that not everybody agrees with that, but that's my view And that's why I would be very, very reluctant to see us go back to an automatic response pattern and the use of Ml as an intermediate target now   That was the argument that was used in October '79 You don't have to worry much because most of the variation would be in the funds rate, a little in the short-term market rates, but the long rates would hardly react--particularly after the markets have an opportunity to adjust And that just didn't happen at all   Well, I'm on the opposite side of Chuck I think there are a couple of areas in which the staff forecast is likely to be a bit low on the real side next year One of them is business fixed investment I can't demonstrate any evidence of this other than a gut feeling, I guess The staff forecast is well above what the surveys of intentions to spend are indicating, but those surveys have been practically useless in terms of the trend of business fixed investment in recent years Given the kind of confidence we hear about and given cash flows, I think we're going to see more investment next year than the staff has forecast The second area is inventories I have heard over and over again the story that Jerry Corrigan is telling us--that inventory/sales ratios are so blooming low now that delivery times are lengthening--and I think we're going to see some price reaction to that early on in 1984 The staff forecast, incidentally, has a build-up of inventories and inventory investment to what might be called a normative relationship with GNP of around 1 percent of GNP That means, in effect, however, that the inventory/sales ratio shows no improvement whatsoever; it stays at its third-quarter 1983 level, which I think is the lowest inventory/sales ratio ever in terms of GNP My guess is that if final sales continue to be fairly strong--and I think they are likely to be --that we're going to see some efforts to build up inventory more than the staff has indicated Secondarily, I worry about--   The other area I worry about is that the labor force may well continue to show the kind of very slow growth we've seen during the course of 1983 In the staff forecast, growth of the labor force doubles in 1984 so we get less progress in reducing unemployment than I think may take place If it turns out that we get more real growth and a greater drop in unemployment relative to the growth rate, then I think the prospects are for a worsening of price inflation as the year progresses--more than what the staff is forecasting I don't think the risks are for huge overruns on either side; one percent more in real growth and maybe 1-1/2 percent or so on the price side is the most I can see But if we were to get that kind of situation, then by the last half of the year we would be looking at a rate of price inflation between 6 and 7 percent and we would be going into 1985 with a much higher level of resource utilization and with the near certainty that, unless something slows it down, the rate of inflation would worsen And that's what I think we need to focus on   I would join with those who see trouble ahead, but I don't think 1985 is going to be the critical year; I think 1984 is If we were to get through 1984 with an outcome on the price side no worse than what the staff is forecasting, then we would be in reasonably good shape going into 1985 But, as I said yesterday, I think the risks are all on the up side I think we're probably going to see somewhat stronger growth and more pickup in the inflation rate And if we let that genie get out of the bottle in 1984, it is going to be awfully hard to put the cork back on in 1985 I can live with these targets or I could live with a somewhat lower range for both Ml and M2 But I want to remind the Committee how far these are from the kinds of ranges one would have to adopt ultimately if one were going  -41-    12/19-20/83  to get price stability If, for example, we interpret price stability as being something like 1 to 2 percent--the rate of increase we saw in the early 1960s--that allows 2-1/2 to 3 percent for potential growth of real GNP Hack off 1-1/2 percent for a trend increase in velocity not related to interest rates and we are talking about 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent for growth of Ml and maybe 1 percentage point more or so for growth of M2 So, we're a long, long way from where we're going to have to be if we're really serious about getting the inflation rate down And if we're not serious about getting the inflation rate down, we ought to decide that and adopt a course of policy in accordance with that view--for next year, I think   Over the long run, yes   Oh no, not for 1984 I think we have to be pragmatic We have an inherited inflation rate so what we have to strive for is to do no worse than see a tiny bit of acceleration of inflation along the lines the staff is forecasting, and then see if we can do a little better in 1985 But if we let inflation get considerably worse in 1984, then in 1985 it's going to get worse still  For reasons I talked about yesterday, I think that M2 ought to be our principal target The relationship between Ml and GNP may tend to reestablish itself on a more stable basis than we've seen recently, but I'd like to wait for that to happen As far as targets for '85 are concerned, I would not be inclined to put out any numbers I would like to see us make qualitative statements to the effect that we will attempt over time to bring down the rate of growth of money for reasons having to do with bringing down the rate of inflation, not as an end product in itself But I think we ought to put out some warnings that we're serious about this business And if we're not, we ought to tell the public that also   Well, I have never believed that one can find macroeconomic reasons for thinking that fiscal stimulus and monetary restraint are enough to push the economy into recession Fiscal stimulus unleashes economic expansion; monetary restraint holds it back And it's the balance between the two that determines whether or not the economy grows and whether we have more inflation or less I think the main problems are on the micro side They have to do with the damage high real interest rates create in the international area, to the thrifts, to the rate of business investment, and that sort of thing I wouldn't be inclined necessarily to say that a continuation of current fiscal policy--that is, the current services projection of the growing deficit--together with more monetary restraint would push  -42-    12/19-20/83  us off the cliff into recession It sure as heck would create a lot damage   Mr Chairman, if we did not have these Ml numbers and were looking just at the real economy and what is going on, I think we would have moved long ago toward a posture of more  -57-    12/19-20/83  restraint than we have now I can understand people's concern about Ml, but I think we have to recall that what we are looking at is a stock, not a supply; it is an intersection of demand and supply We have to try to figure out where the weakness is coming from One could well argue that it was coming from restraint on supply if we were seeing either a significant slowdown in the growth of nominal GNP or a rise in interest rates or both None of those things is happening Indeed, when the staff runs its model and tries to figure what money growth is taking place in the fourth quarter, consistent with the old relationships that we used to have between Ml and GNP based on the old standard Ml demand function and the econometric model, the answer is 83 percent And I dare say that if we were looking at 83 percent growth of Ml in this quarter, given the history of very large growth for the last two years and the continuing tendency for the economy to far outrun our expectations, we would be moving toward restraint I don't see any strong reason for waiting I think we ought to begin moving now toward a tighter posture I would opt, therefore, for something between "B" and "C" I might go even a little further than Roger--up to an $850 million borrowing level I wouldn't want to see the fed funds rate go over 10 percent, but I wouldn't mind at all if it stayed in the 9-1/2 to 10 percent range   Well, I think what you do is lean in the direction of the way the economy is going I think all the evidence is pointing in the direction of an economy that continues to outperform our expectations I don't know what the flash GNP is going to show, but the housing starts figure this morning alone is going to add several tenths to real GNP growth in the fourth quarter   Prices always move with a lag and they always are glacial in their performance unless something spectacular happens on fronts like food or energy The underlying factor driving inflation is wages, and wages are well known to be very sticky; they move glacially What we do now is going to affect wage bargaining throughout 1984 and 1985 That is what we have to worry about And as the economy continues to get stronger--   If you look at what has happened to Ml over longer periods, I suppose you'd look back at the past four years--I would at least--and say that Federal Reserve policy was heavily responsible for the improvements on the inflation front that we have been experiencing And yet if you look at the figures, you will find out that growth of money in the past four years was every bit as rapid as it was in the previous four years You have to explain prices other than just by what has been happening to the money stock   I think that is not what the figures have been showing recently   I'm thinking of the period since the Federal Reserve made its historic decision in the fourth quarter of 1979 The growth rate of Ml since then is almost exactly the same as it was in the previous years The previous four years were a period of substantial build-up of inflation and in these recent four years there has been a substantial unwinding You have to explain that on grounds other than just Ml   We get inflation down with erratic patterns too   I think we need a range   I think changing the range would not send the wrong signals; it would send the right signals I could live with 6 to 10 percent, but I prefer 7 to 11 percent   Because they've run out of money?   It might give a little more weight to the recovery if we left the order of the sentence the way it is now "Depending on evidence about the continuing strength of economic recoverysomewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly"  SPEAKER(?) That's correct   Yes   Are we supposed to be having our regular go around now or is that going to be later? If we don't talk now, do we forever hold our peace?   Well, I have a couple of comments I want to make on the price forecast I think there is very considerable danger that prices are going to go up more than the staff is forecasting over the next couple of years, and I think so for several reasons One is  -13-    1/30-31/84  that I am more optimistic on growth--or pessimistic, as the case may be I don't want to chop that one up, but I noted Ted's comment--and [I did so] with approval or otherwise I wouldn't be mentioning it-- that when net exports go down as they have recently, one shouldn't regard that as a sign of weakness in the economy but as a sign of strength It's a consequence of the fact that the domestic economy is growing very rapidly We have a lot of fiscal stimulus and high interest rates If you apply that to the fourth quarter and take into account the fact that the rise in inventory investment in the fourth quarter was very small, that more than explains why we had a slowdown in [economic] growth Indeed, if you take the private domestic final purchases--they went up more in the fourth quarter than they did in the third--my hunch is that we're going to have a stronger economy in the first half than the staff is forecasting I think the underlying dynamics are stronger than the 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent growth rate projected for the first half And I think that is going to be building up pressures on prices as time goes on Second, I think we have to reckon with the possibility that the turn-up in the labor force participation rate that the staff is forecasting may or may not happen And if it doesn't happen and we have somewhat stronger growth to boot, we're going to have a much bigger drop in the unemployment rate in the course of 1984 Third, to go back to what Governor Partee was saying, I don't understand the consistency of the staff forecast in regard to prices The staff is kind enough to give me all kinds of details when I ask for them and I--   Well, they are very good about that The fixed weight deflators for private domestic final purchases, excluding food and energy--and that's about the most trouble-free index you can look at--goes up 44 percent over the four quarters of '83, 5 percent in '84, and 56 percent in '85 But if you take out the half point bonus that Ted has been talking about for the appreciation of the dollar in '83 and take out two-tenths for the depreciation in '84 and eight- tenths in '85--and I think that's the right calculation--you get a deflator that's just flat It goes nowhere And it goes nowhere despite the fact that we have both higher food prices and higher compensation per hour Now, if there have been a few miscalculations on that side that have favored lower prices and if we get more growth and if we get this flat participation rate, the potential is there-- I'm not sure it's going to happen, but the potential is there--for a worse inflation outlook [It could mean] 1-1/2 percentage points or maybe 2 percentage points by 1985 on the inflation rate, and that's something I think we ought to--   Not rising Well, they rose from the third quarter to the fourth quarter   Well, not forever, that's for sure Something is going to happen But the fact is that a $9 billion drop in net  -14-    1/30-31/84  exports in 1972 dollars at an annual rate is most unlikely to continue in the first half of this year This would be a lot greater deterioration in the trade balance than what the staff is forecasting And if what happens is that we get a somewhat smaller decline in net exports and a somewhat larger increase in inventories and continuation of fairly strong private domestic financial purchases, we're going to get a growth rate, I think, in the 5 to 6 percent range during the first half of this year And that is going to be trouble for us, particularly if we continue to get slow growth in the labor force   We're starting off well!   Well, if Frank Morris is on one end and John Balles is on the other, perhaps I can think of little old reasonable me as being right in the middle I'm probably more bullish on the economy than most people here and I'm at least as concerned about the inflationary aspects of what may happen this year and next as others are But I don't think there is any need to deviate from the  -23-    1/30-31/84  alternative II targets, which are consistent with the staff's forecast If we could get a 9 percent nominal GNP, we would be in reasonably good shape So if these target ranges are consistent with that--and I have no strong reason for thinking they're not--that's what we ought to start with In any event, if things work out more along the lines of a stronger economy and somewhat more price pressures, it seems to me that growth ranges that are as low as 4 percent for M1 or 6-1/2 percent for M2 or 6 percent for M3 give us all the room for monetary restraint we could possibly want So, I like alternative II as it stands I don't want to put more emphasis on M1 this year I think that would be a very, very bad idea in a year in which I think we're going to need an awful lot of flexibility for monetary policy And I think we've had more flexibility since we adopted the broader aggregates as our principal targets in October of 1982 I don't deny that we may be getting back to a situation in which velocity is following historical patterns, but I don't think that in and of itself is sufficient cause for elevating M1 to the principal target If we get into a situation in which the dollar begins to fall like a stone and interest rates begin to rise and we find ourselves thinking we have to be constrained by an M1 target in the way we were during the period before 1982, I think we're going to be in big trouble   None of the above!   I don't think we gain anything by lowering it Nobody's expectations are going to be markedly altered if we leave it where it is or lower it So why not just leave it?   We have a special Xerox machine in [this corridor] that only the Board Members' secretaries can get to   To some degree, however, the problems with M1 tend to get cancelled out in M2 That is, the staff argues that if interest rates go up, because of the higher interest elasticity demand for M1 now we might get a sharp slowdown of M1 That would not apply to M2 because the nontransaction components will probably continue to grow So, there would be a less marked movement   True   I have a little problem with the sentence about "taking account of emerging evidence that in the light of the changed composition of M1 its velocity growth over time" I think we believe that on the basis of theoretical considerations That is, we think the more elements that bear interest in M1, the higher the income elasticity of demand will be and the less tendency there will be--the more we have Super NOW accounts--for M1 velocity not to slow down as interest rates rise But that's primarily a theoretical proposition We really don't have much evidence of that yet  -45-    1/30-31/84   Yes, that's better   Do you want to read that again--the possibility part?   A question may arise as to what a reader would interpret "more substantial weight" to mean--more substantial weight than M1 or more substantial weight than they had previously One could get around that problem, if it is a real one, by simply putting principal weight instead of more substantial weight   Perhaps there's not a problem   Maybe not   The "more" is the problem   If we understand what we're doing, whether that word "more" is in there or not isn't going to make a lot of difference If we agree that what we're doing is putting principal weight on M2 and M3 and that we will continue basically as we have in the past with a bit more weight to M1, I don't think the inclusion or exclusion of the word "more" is going to rock markets   In this phrase about interpreting M1 in the light of growth in the other [aggregates] do we want to say "monetary and credit aggregates"?   The reason I raise this is because in the next paragraph we talk about continuing appraisal of the relationships among the various measures of money and credit   With the jockey holding them in!   That opens it up   You are supposed to forget, Tony!   May I ask a technical question of another kind? The selection of November to March as the period to focus on is explained essentially by the fact that that is the same period we used at the December meeting Why does that take precedence over a December-to-March calculation, given the fact that we have fairly solid figures for December?   For M2 and M3 it's about 77 percent   Yes   I think December to March is 77, 77, and 73 percent   I'm not quite sure why you want to round up   I had come into this meeting prepared to argue that the weight of the evidence, as I see it, leans if anything in the direction of suggesting that we ought to be just a bit tighter I still interpret the fourth quarter as a very strong quarter with very strong private domestic final purchases We have money numbers now which fortunately--I mean fortunately for my argument--look stronger in the fourth quarter and continue to be strong into the first quarter We're talking about a December-to-March increase in M1 of about 7-1/2 percent The M2 and M3 figures are much more tranquil At a minimum we ought to be evenhanded, I think, in the statement of the alternatives   Existing home sales are the bulk of the buying   Existing house sales came out earlier They too were up, but not--   Why don't we just take the sentence out of the last operational paragraph and use it?   I don't think that's the thing to do I much prefer an evenhanded treatment, and I think evenhandedness in this case would mean staying with the existing language The existing language lets the qualifying comment about the strength of the recovery affect both   I'm reading from the draft domestic policy directive that the staff passed out   On page 4, line 77 The old language is "depending on evidence about the continuing strength of the recovery" and so on   I don't think so I don't think the markets are going to interpret it that way   That's right   But the language as it is put here was on page 4 [of the draft directive] If we changed that lesser restraint from "might" to "would," that would make it perfectly symmetrical or almost perfectly symmetrical Maybe we'd have to put the "somewhat" in there before "lesser" to make it perfectly [symmetrical]   No, Jerry's right, I think The "evidence of stronger business expansion, inflationary pressures" and so forth modifies the "greater restraint" whereas nothing--   Yes   The way to be evenhanded is to go back to the language on page 4 of the draft directive and put that sentence on the  -62-    1/30-31/84  front end that refers to depending on evidence about the continuing strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the inflation outlook   But Paul is not   We've come to agreement too easily It's not time yet!   I'm on the opposite side of that   The point is Suppose the business news comes in strong, which I expect it will, and the aggregates tend to fall short Then what do we do? Do we ease or not? And I don't want to ease in those circumstances I don't want to ease because I think the risks for the year as a whole lie predominantly on the side of more growth than the staff is forecasting and stronger inflationary pressures If I'm right--and, of course, I may not be--then easing now in response to those [monetary aggregates] signals would be the wrong thing to do   If it were soft enough to really question the continuation of recovery along the lines that the staff is forecasting, then I would plan to ease   I hope We've done it  SPEAKER(?) In 1982   Do you mean take out the whole works--the references to more restraint and lesser restraint?   That takes away some of the lack of evenhandedness   So, if things don't work out this way, the Committee will decide what to do about it   I would like to be clear that I am a lot more concerned about policy than I am about words And what I would like to have some indication of is whether everybody is leaning in the direction that you're indicating--that they would rather ease than tighten To operate erring on that side is one thing; I want to go in the opposite direction, if anything I will live with evenhandedness but I care a lot more about the policy than I do about the words   We have been sending the Greenbook to those three places for at least 20 years, I think And in the interest of maintaining an exchange of views with people in the Administration there are times, regularly, when the Chairman is provided access to information well ahead of time--about the same time the President gets it--and is one of the very few people who gets that kind of information There are times when we are made privy to what is going on in the budgetary process, even at the staff level I think we would be jeopardizing that free interchange of information if we didn't send the Greenbook over there   On what day, Friday or Thursday?   Not yet You skipped it    What about the parts from the international division?   If we do this, it might be wise to put a different cover on it and stop calling it an FOMC document   Make this one beige too!   I have the perception from reading the Beigebook that apart from some certain stylistic changes--taking out comments such as one director said something and taking out the view of panelists--that the content of the Beigebook is not materially different from what the Redbook was before   He's an arsonist!  -30-    3/26-27/84   Well, Mr Chairman, I don't know anything about what is happening in the agricultural sector but I do share Jerry Corrigan's concerns about where the economy is going I think the dangers are very great that the economy may grow faster than the staff is forecasting for this year The two areas where that is most likely to happen are business fixed investment and the change in inventories The staff projection for business fixed investment essentially says that, after slightly faster growth than had been anticipated earlier, the growth rate continues from the second half on through all of 1985 just where we thought it was a month ago And indeed, it's a markedly lower rate than we're seeing currently Business fixed investment was growing at a 23 percent annual rate in real terms in the later half of 1983 and that tools right down to 5 percent by the latter half of 1985 I think we probably are going to see a major revision in capital spending plans develop over the first half of this year as a consequence of the fact that the economy is growing so much more strongly than had been widely anticipated And I think we're going to see, even in the Cleveland District, the beginnings of some desire to  -50-    3/26-27/84  increase capacity On the inventory side, the Board staff briefed us this morning and showed us a chart on the ratio of inventories to sales, which is as low now as it was in early 1973 Of course, part of that is a consequence of better techniques of managing inventories But it's also true that the number of companies reporting slower deliveries is back to where it was in late 1972 And my guess would be that during the course of this year we'll see some efforts to build up inventories relative to sales, so we'll see a bigger kick from inventory investment  On the price side, the thing that stands out most is the staff forecast for prices relative to unit labor costs There is only a 02 difference there, with 5 percent projected for the fixed-weight deflator for gross business product as opposed to 48 percent for unit labor costs That isn't even enough to take into account the effects that depreciation would bring And the ratio of corporate profits to GNP declines during the course of 1984 from the peak in the first quarter despite very active markets and relatively stable unit labor costs I just don't think that's the way businesses are going to price this year I think they're going to have the opportunity to improve their profit margins and will do so The big sleeper, however, in the price area is one that I've talked about before I don't know whether it's going to happen, but the labor force projection that the staff has included in its forecast is for growth of 24 million from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter That compares with a 12 million increase during 1983 Now, last year's increase was very, very small We did not see the kind of cyclical increase in the participation rate that we usually get The staff forecast has one thing going for it now namely, that in February we did get a big increase in the labor force and an upward movement in the participation rate If this proves to be the beginning of a trend, then that forecast may be right If it's a one-month phenomenon and we were to see the continuation of the slow growth in the labor force that we had last year, we'd be down to an unemployment rate below 6 percent by the fourth quarter and then we'd have a big problem The word that Bob Forrestal put out is "caution" I certainly would agree with that and I may even be going toward a red light   I agreed with Emmett all the way up to where he said that alternative B was his choice I start with the view that the staff forecast is not an unreasonable one but that if it is wrong it's likely to be that growth will tend to exceed the 53 percent rate the staff has forecast for the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter and that we will have somewhat more price pressures I would be happy with the kind of growth the staff was forecasting a month or two ago-- 4 to 4-1/2 percent or somewhere in that neighborhood But 5 to 5-1/2 percent and possibly more in the second year of a recovery when we're moving rapidly toward much higher rates of resource utilization for both capacity and labor is something that I find disturbing Now, "B" is essentially the alternative that is consistent with the staff forecast And that means, I presume, that in the second half of the year if we stayed with "B" and extended it with the same interest rates that we are talking about as consistent with "B," we would find that money growth would slow with the slowdown in the pace of the economic expansion that is forecast And this is a policy that I would call leaning with the wind It's providing enough money in the first half to keep interest rates from going up too much and then letting the money growth come down a little as the economy begins to slow down of its own natural processes If we are in the second year of a recovery and are willing to supply the kinds of increases in the Ms that are involved in "B" and to permit credit to grow by more than 11 percent, when are we going to get back to a policy that is designed to bring inflation down over a long period? So, I just don't think "B" is the right alternative I share your worries and concerns about the economy, but I think we've got to go further than that Now, "C" is a bit of a shock perhaps, but I think we ought to move in that direction; something between "B" and "C" is where I would come out   Well, because of this problem of not knowing how to interpret borrowing numbers, I'd like to hear--when we get to the point of getting down to specifics--what we're going to mean with this directive or any other in terms of how far we're willing to let interest rates go up I would not be shocked to contemplate a federal funds rate of 11 percent I take it that others would be But if the idea is to run a monetary policy which in effect says that what we've done so far is let the federal funds rate and associated rates of interest go up in recent weeks and we will just hold them there, I'm not going to be happy with that I just don't think that's the way we ought to go But I'd like to have a translation  -72-    3/26-27/84   I do too   I would go back to the comment the Chairman made earlier We are living in a world in which interest rates have become the cutting edge of monetary policy   In a world of deregulation, they have to move a lot more I know that causes potential damage here, there and elsewhere in terms of the LDCs, the thrifts, and so on But the point is that if we want to get any restraint on the economy we have to let interest rates go up And in this kind of world we have to let them go up more than we used to If we sit here and let these interest rates creep up by 1/4 percentage point per FOMC meeting, we are never going to get the job done   My point, Ed, was that the rate has been close to 10-1/2 percent in recent days and if we have a ceiling of 11 percent, that tends to leave no room to operate unless we say the ceiling doesn't have any meaning And if it doesn't have any meaning, then I don't know why we'd want to put that kind of ceiling on it It just leaves almost no room to maneuver at all starting from where we are now, if we have a federal funds range with an upper limit of 11 percent If it's going to mean anything at all, then it's very, very restraining in terms of the amount of interest rate movement we will contemplate If it doesn't have any meaning, then it's just purely for publicity purposes, so then let's decide among ourselves what we really think it ought to be and keep that a secret   I could live with that   I was going to offer a series of numbers, but now with that stipulation--   I would go with Bob  -76-    3/26-27/84   There's good reason for asymmetry if the risks are stacked on the side of stronger growth and more inflation That way we don't expose ourselves to a circumstance in which, even though the economy is going along fairly strongly, we for some reason have a downward shift in money demand and overreact and let too much ease take place An asymmetrical arrangement makes very good sense under present circumstances   Do we mean 6-1/2 percent by that? Would we accept up to 7 percent before we would react? Then what do we do with--   Could we just expand the range of estimation? What is the borrowing level for 11 percent, too, so I know where another option might be   Yes   Well, I think the market is expecting more than this  -84-    3/26-27/84   I think we're in very serious danger of losing credibility as an agency that is trying to hold down inflation It seems to me that the numbers have been coming in very strong on the real economy We have been looking at money and credit numbers that are very large in any kind of historical perspective We are doing so in the second year of a recovery when expectations have been greatly exceeded We are doing so in the context of a fiscal policy that is the most stimulative we've ever seen I just don't know how we can talk about making sure we don't ease The situation calls for more than that It calls for more, in my judgment, than just confirming for the market the fact that interest rates have gone up in recent weeks   Well, what you're trying to do is to hold the funds rate in the 10-1/4 to 10-3/4 percent range  -89-    3/26-27/84   I'd rather have the consultation now I don't think we will see anything in the next two weeks that is going to be convincing on where the economy is going to go And two weeks more on the money numbers is not going to tell us anything about longer-term trends of money, which is what really matters I think we're pussy- footing I think we've been sitting here for some months now looking  -91-    3/26-27/84  at an economy that continues to exceed everybody's expectations This is going to come back to haunt us if we don't decide to act And we can't act by just confirming what happened in the market in the past couple of weeks   I do indeed That's what we're saying   Not in my judgment   I just don't translate net borrowed reserves as restraint on the economy I think the more relevant consideration is what happens to interest rates   That's my view What I want is a larger movement in interest rates   I agree with that, certainly   Well, if I interpret the Chairman's comments correctly, he doesn't want to see the fed funds rate get down toward 10 percent and he would be uncomfortable with it getting up to 11 percent And he's thinking about playing the net borrowed reserve objective so that the federal funds rate stays in a 10-1/4 to 10-3/4 percent range Now, that has a midpoint of 10-1/2 percent and we're not far from that now, which means that I don't see much change   It's just that I'm not trying to hide the move, you see I think the economy needs to be told that monetary policy has tightened because the economy is growing much too fast for comfort I think we need to do something that's rather obvious and decisive  -93-    3/26-27/84   Oh no, I have both instruments in my mind I just haven't got the right forum to talk [about the discount rate]   Well, we used to time these matters in three or four weeks   I currently get seven   I don't think anybody's--   I was just hunting for something like that too "The Committee seeks to maintain pressures on reserve positions consistent with"   Or we could go even so far as to say "during the period from March to June" We don't hit it from June to July   But use "anticipate will be consistent"   M1 from 1 to [unintelligible]  SPEAKER(?) Just say consistent with the various Ms   Peter, where do we stand on the process of mopping up the additional reserves injected through Continental's borrowing?   I'm less certain now about where the economy is going in the near future than I have been at any time since very early in 1983 These recent numbers are to me very, very puzzling If we really had an almost 9 percent increase in real GNP in the first quarter, the fifth quarter of recovery, there ought to be a sense of euphoria around the nation Boy, we sure don't hear that here this morning! I can't figure out why the increase in nonfarm inventories in real terms was so very, very large in the first quarter Clearly, it wasn't undesired It was not a case of an unexpected slowdown in final sales, yet I have a hard time arguing that businesses are so desperately concerned with shortages or so desperately worried about price increases that they are scrambling to get inventories I just can't understand it This number on new orders this morning is very weak It's a volatile series, as Mr Kichline said, but there are negatives all down the line It is just very, very puzzling A second uncertainty has been added by recent developments in financial markets I don't have any doubt in my mind that these developments on balance are a significant negative, but I don't know how much We have had a big increase in interest rates since the last meeting-- bigger than I think any of the more hawkish members of this Committee would have wanted at that time We also have had a drop in stock prices and we don't know precisely what effects those changes are going to have It may well be that confidence, at least among banks if not nonbanking institutions, has been affected a bit by what has happened with Continental I think a slowdown is ahead and if I were forced to write down numbers, I probably would write something down very close to what the staff has If it works out that way, I don't think we should be concerned We need that kind of slowdown But, frankly, it could be a little more or a little less, it seems to me  I would like to make a couple of comments on the price side One of the things that has happened in the past several months that to me is very comforting is that the increase in the civilian labor force, as a consequence of increases in the participation rate, is finally developing along the lines the staff had forecast earlier It looks much less likely now that we're going to get down below the natural rate of unemployment in the very near future, as I was worried about earlier Still in all, I do expect to see some larger price increases relative to wages because in the kind of markets that the staff is forecasting, with the increase in the capacity utilization rate, I think businesses are going to take the opportunity to try to widen profit margins I would just like to say in closing that developments in credit markets are to me still very, very worrisome We had an enormous increase in the debt of the nonfinancial sector in the first quarter The forecast now for the second quarter is even worse And when I listen to comments around the table, particularly by Karen, about the lack of discipline, I have to conclude that up until very recently at least we have not had much financial restraint Whether we'll see that as a consequence of developments in the past few weeks I think is still problematic  -17-    5/21-22/84   I'm not far from where everybody else is But one of the things I would like to point out is that both the Bluebook and Steve's comments indicate that we might well find, if we vote for "B," that long-term interest rates have overreacted and in fact will come back down again to where they were roughly speaking, say, three or four weeks ago That, I think, would be unfortunate I'm not at all sure that the current level of interest rates in long-term markets is not the right level for where we want the economy to go in the future If I'm wrong and the economy starts to slow, that drop in interest rates will be welcomed and everybody will love us If on the other hand, a higher level of rates--the present level or somewhat higher--is needed and we let interest rates go back down to where they were four weeks ago, we are going to get blamed the second time around for pushing them back up and that would be unfortunate So, what I  -32-    5/21-22/84  would like is "B" with a tiny minus on it I think we're going to have to give the Chairman a lot of discretion as to how he runs policy in any event between now and the next meeting But I would be inclined to talk about a borrowing range of $1 to $12 billion with the idea in mind of using the upper end of that range as needed, probably in the latter part of the period if interest rates on long- term securities begin to come down significantly I like Roger's idea of thinking of a federal funds rate that might go up as high as 10-3/4 percent to achieve that objective I do think it is a good idea to take out that language about unusual strains There is concern developing that we are going to throw [away] everything that we've gained so far I don't think that's true and I don't think it has to be true And I think that language would give people ideas that they shouldn't have   Remember that the public is going to be seeing this after the whole period is over And they will know what we have done Hopefully we will be remembered by our deeds rather than our words And they're perfectly aware of the fact that we have been involved in a heavy way   Not only that, they will say Aha! They have a "somewhat" before "greater restraint," and they used the word "might" instead of "would"  -38-    5/21-22/84   Well, but that modifier says "considered in the context" I think it's better to drop that "only" and say "considered in the context of appraisals of" these three things The "financial market conditions" gives you the caveat to lean in an operational sense in the direction of less restraint if that seems to be necessary because of unusual financial strains  -39-    5/21-22/84   Well, we don't want to imply with the directive that he has to call for a telephone conference to deal with a developing problem that may require instant action I'd make the point that we didn't have special language in the previous directive, which did not prevent the Desk and the Chairman and Steve from working on what was necessary I don't think this language is going to hinder us in that respect either   Well, we can have it understood   If you put the market value of equities into it, you can't do that You have to figure out what base to put in there; the amount of the base that's included is the critical issue   That's the converse of the argument that productivity hasn't gone up so much; those two are mirror images of one another It's hard to use the one to justify the argument that productivity is going up faster than it really is The reason productivity didn't go up so fast explains why we had such a big increase in employment given the rise in GNP The rise in GNP in the first 6 quarters has been a little above average but not much So, if you had that much larger increase in employment, it is precisely because the rise in productivity has not been so great   I think the fact was that the recession phenomenon was one in which we had a better productivity performance than one could have anticipated, but there just wasn't any follow through, if the GNP statistics are right Now, we may get a revision to the GNP statistics But unless we get a marked upward revision, one has to hope for the future in productivity rather than pointing to something that's a fact now   One of the determining factors will be whether or not we get 2-3/4 percent real GNP growth fourth quarter to fourth quarter for 1985 or, let us say, 1/2 or 3/4 percentage point more We're getting down into the range on the unemployment rate where that much additional growth, quite possibly, could trigger quite different responses in labor market conditions and wage rates than the staff has anticipated Similarly, an additional half percentage point real GNP growth would result in maybe 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points [more] in manufacturing output and that gets the capacity utilization rate into a range in which we begin to have problems So, while the staff's forecast might not be unbelievable in terms of internal consistency, a somewhat stronger economy can produce quite different results   I think we're at a stage in the business cycle in which the uncertainties of forecasting are a heck of a lot greater than they have been If you look at a recovery in prospect, the first four to six quarters do differ from one cycle to the next but not all that much But what happens after you get up to where we are now is much harder to foresee It's certainly very logical to anticipate some slowdown in the pace of the economic expansion but whether we slow down to something like a 3 percent rate, let us say, or a 4 percent rate, makes a hell of a lot of difference to the rate of resource utilization when it is up this high and, therefore, to price behavior The other big factor on the price side now that makes price forecasting very, very uncertain is the issue that Frank was pointing out about the accumulation of dollars abroad and what that means for interest rates When we have dollars accumulating abroad on the scale that has been occurring, the willingness of foreigners to continue accumulation on anything like the scale that the staff is forecasting depends on what happens to prices here and what happens to their expectations of prices If we get the beginnings of some upswing in wages and prices in the United States, it will then induce the kind of drop in the value of the dollar that Chuck is talking about, which in turn will reinforce this price cycle And that's why it seems to me the outlook for prices is very, very uncertain   May I talk a bit about what I think this credit variable is supposed to be?   I would have thought the way we were supposed to use a variable like this--a monitoring variable that we're not targeting on--is as a variable that gives us some information about the adequacy of the monetary targets we set in the first place M3 very much falls into that same category also If we set ranges, say, of 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 for M2, and we think we're doing pretty well in those and get these gigantic increases in M3 and in credit, what we really ought to do is to lower our targets for M1 and M2 That's the logical thing to do To go to the conclusion that what we should do is increase the target for the credit variable because we didn't anticipate it right is totally the wrong thing to do If we're not gutsy enough to follow the logic to its conclusion, which is to pull the growth rates of M1 and M2 down--and I'm not going to suggest that we do that--at least let's hold to the targets for M3 and debt   Yes, we provided a lot more credit than we should have   Well, but if you take out the 1 percent or so for mergers, we still end up well above the upper limit of the range for the first two quarters   Another aspect we have to think about is that if we have a standardized, very small decline in the dollar, that is going to touch not only the price forecast but also the real growth forecast And it begins to look perhaps a bit artificial   Not only that but if you had a stronger GNP forecast and more price inflation, then you probably would be talking about increases in nominal interest rates, in which case you're no longer confined to the projection of velocity that assumes that interest rates are unchanged   Then you leave the targets where they are and [let growth] run over them   I think we mainly have to ask ourselves what sort of message we want to convey now with the targets for 1985 In this connection, we ought to be thinking about what we're going to do with the others before we decide what we're going to do with M1 My guess would be that one would have a pretty hard time arguing for a reduction in the target ranges for any of the other aggregates M3 and credit probably are going to end up way over the upper end of the range [this year] If we can get back down into the range for 1985,  -35-    7/16-17/84  we will be doing well For M2, there's a case [to be made] that its current behavior will persist, but the current behavior is really very, very odd relative to historical trends Normally speaking, we don't expect to see much velocity increase for M2 over time So, I would argue that we'd be better off now to play it safe and leave the ranges for M2, M3 and domestic nonfinancial debt where they are Then that would argue, if we want to do something that conveys a message, for dropping off a percentage point from the top of the M1 range and being ready to go back up if the circumstances strongly recommend that in February   We could color that by noting that we've been looking at a range for M1 that was 1 percentage point wider than those for the other aggregates and now that the velocity of M1 is beginning to behave along a more normal cyclical pattern we changed the width of the range to 3 percentage points   What would the secular trend be on M2?   The staff's views are of less value than the FOMC's! [Laughter]   Not too bad an idea   I think one ought to put this in a somewhat longer-run context also That is, if the Federal Reserve is still setting as an objective a long-run return to price stability, we do have to contemplate a gradual reduction in growth in all the monetary aggregates over time This is now the fifth year of this long-range program and we are talking about setting targets for the sixth year And we begin to worry about an upper limit of 7 percent? That looks a little bizarre to me in the context of where we're supposed to be going After all, if the long-run growth of velocity is 2 percent or thereabouts, with no rise in interest rates then we're going to have to get M1 down somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 to 3 percentage points--given what we think is potential growth--to get back to price stability   It's a really gutty move   I agree with Tony's and Henry's version of "B" Use the specs of "B" and if, in fact, we see some different attitudes of borrowing develop, inch up on the borrowing number rather than let interest rates go down I do think, from a macro standpoint, that our  -61-    7/16-17/84  real concern is that this slowdown in economic activity which the staff foresees, and which I could foresee also, may or may not happen It is still primarily a forecast The concrete signs of that are precious and slim at this point We have to keep hoping that it will occur And if it doesn't occur and we have upward pressure on interest rates, then we're going to have some very, very serious problems about what we should do Henry is right The choice for the short run is either more inflation or a financial debacle I think the best we can do about this is not to let inflation happen, but just to hold to a rather steady, sensible policy And if we don't get some budget restraint, then there's going to be no way to avoid this   I could certainly support an asymmetrical directive because I do think we have to worry lots more about the economy growing too fast than the economy slowing down too much But precisely for that reason, I think a modest move in that direction along the lines suggested by Ed would be all right, in the sense that I think the chances that M1 growth is going to slow below 5-1/2 percent are about 1 in 10 I'm really not worried about that I think the third quarter is going to be quite a strong quarter; unless something very unusual happens, we're likely to get more M1 growth in that [quarter] I don't disagree with Chuck; if [M1 did slow to below 5-1/2 percent], I'd want to think about easing But I don't think it's going to   If what we did was take that operational paragraph and used the word "would" in line 81 [of the staff's draft] and left "might" in line 82, careful Fed watchers would say "Aha! a degree of asymmetry" So, we'd get our purposes served   Well, I would not interpret this, Roger, as something we're bringing on just between now and August Of course, this is the first meeting of a quarter We're looking at quarterly growth rates for the third quarter for the first time And we're trying to structure a directive that hopefully will last us through the quarter--not just until the next time--and give some indication about our basic concerns about how fast the economy is growing, the risks in financial markets, and so on I would prefer to interpret it more broadly than that   I would hope you would   I would not like to put that "in considerable part" as the main reason why the credit variable is growing above the upper end It's because the economy is growing so fast   He means in the testimony   Well, the trend was But Frank is talking about the same period of expansion We had a very substantial improvement in productivity as we came out of the 1974-75 recession   Do you mean on the price side or business?   The one thing we do know in that respect, though, is that the revisions of the second-quarter statistics make that picture look a little better The upward revision of GNP was accompanied by a downward revision in the rate of inventory accumulation So that looks a little better In terms of the prospects for too much of a slowdown, I think one needs to take into account the fact that the 76 percent rate of growth in the second quarter took place despite a drop in auto inventories If you take into account the drop in auto production, you're looking at an underlying rate of over 9 percent The staff has it going down a long, long way and I think the basics that we've been looking at for the past year--including the thrust of both monetary and fiscal policies--would suggest to me that worries about an excessive slowdown would seem premature at this point   Yes It isn't going to add a lot to the third quarter, but it's going to stop taking off so much   It took out 2 percentage points or thereabouts in the second quarter and the amount of upward thrust in the third quarter I don't think is quite that large   I'd like to just say a word or two about what I think we ought to be worried about for a longer period I have been worried, as everybody knows, about the prospects of worsening inflation I haven't been right; the staff has been a lot more right than I But I do think we could make a very big mistake if we don't recognize the potential for that This was called to my attention by Tony this morning when he talked about the Carter period There were two very large mistakes made then One of them was misestimating the natural rate of unemployment; we thought it was around 5-1/2 percent So, when the actual unemployment rate was 7 percent we thought the economy had all kinds of room to grow The other was a failure to recognize how poor productivity really was Let me just read to you what the actual productivity figures were showing in that period From the fourth quarter of '74 to the fourth quarter of '75 we had a 38 percent increase in productivity; in '76 we had 22 percent; in '77 we had 26 percent It looked like we were doing beautifully In fact, those were all cyclical improvements in productivity, not secular trends And we didn't recognize how bad things really were So, I think we ought to be very, very careful in looking at the recent productivity statistics not to get overly optimistic  The other thing I want to mention is that if you look at what has been happening to monetary policy and take what I would regard as the best view of how stimulative it is, you have to look at real increases in the money stock When you do that, you find that real M1 is going up at about twice the rate of the trend rate of increase, which is about 1 percent a year It's going up at over 2 percent a year So, I would like to take some of the benefits of the recent slowdown in money growth [incorporated] in the lower specs of "B" I note in this connection that if we stick with "B," according to the  -26-    8/21/84  staff we will end up with about a 6-1/2 percent increase in M1 fourth- quarter-to-fourth-quarter, which is about the midpoint of the range we set at the beginning of the year And that would be reasonably satisfactory So, I would stick with the specs of "B" with $1 billion in borrowing, and I would accept a lower aggregate growth for the third quarter   When you say "bias toward lower numbers," are you talking about borrowing or interest rates or aggregates?   How would you interpret this 5 percent if you could have an asymmetrical calculation [for the] 3 months? If you took that 5 percent literally, it would imply a growth rate of 8-1/4 percent for August and September and that's way too high for me to be comfortable with If you wanted to add -15, 55, and 81 percent together and [say that] averages [roughly] to five, then that's the sort of asymmetrical calculation I could agree with   My point is that we start from a low base; July was negative If you use 5 percent for the period from June through September, it implies an August-September increase averaging 8-1/4 percent   Putting my point differently If the staff is correct, a specification of $1 billion in borrowing to start with--and holding to that with the kind of federal funds rate which would be implied if the current demands for borrowing relative to that funds rate prevail--would not give you 5 percent growth It would give you something more like 4 percent So, if you were aiming for 5 percent, in fact, what you would do is proceed to lower levels of borrowing, lower levels of the funds rate, and more increase in the aggregates over time And I don't think that would be appropriate   Yes   If one were willing to play that game and put in a 5 percent for visual purposes only, then I wouldn't have any problem with it   In the economy?   Beyond what the staff is talking about?   Yes It probably would be wise, though, given Bob's point, to change that "slightly" to "were significantly slower" That would use parallel language to what was in the first part of the sentence and would deal with Bob's point   That sounds all right   Are you talking about slowing in the economy beyond expectations?   Why would a bank want to hold additional cash assets that are [earning] nothing?   But they could put it in other assets   What are your present holdings?   Then we'd want to raise the informal maximum for all currencies to $6 billion from $5-1/2 billion too?   How many times in the past have we seen periods of economic expansion interrupted by a quarter of pause and then it goes on? I would bet that over the postwar period you could find ten of those   Jim, have you looked at previous cycles to see whether--   I'm very much in the Ed Boehne/Chuck Partee camp I do think something rather fundamental has happened to the basic expansion and I think we should be thankful for that I would note again that we've been through a lot of periods of economic expansion--Jim mentioned 1976, which was one, but there have been many others--in which the growth of employment, industrial production, and real GNP slowed for awhile and then picked up again Jim was asked what the probability of negative GNP in the fourth quarter was and he gave the answer 25 A more meaningful question in my judgment would be What is the probability of two successive quarters of negative GNP growth? And the answer the model cranks out on that is 05, which is negligible And that agrees with my own perception   Yes That's a regular output run of the model and I get the model forecast   Yes If you look over the basic factors that have been driving the economy, and many of them have been mentioned here, they all seem to me to be conducive to continuation of economic expansion Budget policy is expansive Monetary policy has not been unduly restrictive--we're looking at a growth of real money over the first three quarters of around 2 percent, which is quite high by historical standards Consumer confidence is high Consumer balance sheets are in quite good shape--income ratios have gone up but to nowhere near where they once were Net worth has improved recently with the pickup in stock prices As for incentives for business investment, surely we can't expect to see 20 to 25 percent rates of real business fixed investment taking place, but profits are high, the tax incentives are still there, and capacity utilization is up As for the inventory situation, one can see problems in some areas like chemicals and fibers, textiles, and metals, but overall inventory sales ratios are quite low My perception is the one that Jerry mentioned--that most businesses are quite comfortable with their inventory positions So, I think the staff has it about right I think we will see a pickup in the fourth quarter, and if not then, we will see it in the first quarter And then if we can see growth stay in the range of 3 to 3-1/2 percent, it's certainly going to be quite beneficial in terms of the impact on interest rates and aspects of financial markets and the problems we have there  -19-    10/2/84   I would buy the specs of "B" $750 million on borrowing, 6 percent for M1, and leave the fed funds rate range where it is Basically, I want to try to stay where we are I would agree with Chuck that what we have done couldn't be considered aggressive easing, but I think we have eased significantly The principal concern on my mind is that if I'm right and the staff is right on the outlook, the greatest danger at this point is that we might inadvertently ease too much, which would then give rise to the need for higher interest rates later In this connection, it seems to me that none of us knows for sure whether or not this pause, if it is a pause, is going to continue through October or through the first part of November or exactly how long That may mean that we're going to be looking at some rather weak money numbers for a while and I don't think we ought to panic We ought to move gingerly toward a lower level of adjustment borrowing, if that's necessary I would be quite reluctant, for example, to see us move down to $500 million, given that we've moved to $750 million within the past few weeks   They also said that underlying policy is consistent with 6 to 7 percent inflation and that unless we bring money down, we might get worse results   Maybe we should go back to lagged reserve accounting   I for one would repeat my own concern about moving too far too fast because I don't think we know when the economy is going to start picking up again I thought I heard a fair number of people share that concern; maybe not There were a number of people who were worried, as I am, about the possibility that if interest rates come down too much and if the economy then recovers rates would go bouncing back up again And that's not a desirable development, in my judgment   Yes   If the funds rate were to get down into the 10-1/4 to 10-1/2 percent range, I wouldn't be acutely uncomfortable If it gets down to 10 percent, having been up to 11-1/2 percent only a few weeks ago, that just seems to me to be too big a move  -35-    10/2/84   Well, yes, except it stayed up in that 11-1/4 to 11-1/2 percent range for quite some time To go down more than a full percentage point in a matter of 6 to 8 weeks--   You're dropping out the tightening [alternative] altogether   Why not just take the existing sentence and reverse the order?   But wouldn't you want to put that sentence before the "in any event" sentence?   "Well above these expectations"   Sometime we ought to put out a directive which says "Complete with the usual boiler plate"!   Would you read that significant strengthening in economic activity [part]?   What is the probability of two consecutive quarters of negative growth?   As I look at the numbers coming in, I am inclined to agree with the staff that they do suggest there is some improvement in activity going on When I think of how the numbers were coming in a month or two ago, the recent figures look to me a lot more optimistic The last figure on new orders for nondefense capital goods was up after a couple of months of decline Shipments were up quite strongly The last figure we had for retail sales was up; we don't know what October will bring I read the Beigebook and I thought it was saying that the gains we had in September seemed to be sustained in October even though that doesn't seem to be confirmed by department store sales   Well, we haven't heard from everybody yet But certainly, the comments in the Beigebook did not reflect what we're hearing today   We're now looking at a period of rising auto production--increasing availability of models instead of the reverse that was going on in the summer The last figures on housing starts and new home sales were up in contrast to earlier weakness The October employment data were considerably stronger than the data coming in during the summer; indeed, we had a turnaround in manufacturing employment from a rather sizable decline in September to an increase in October In a period like this there is bound to be uncertainty As Henry mentioned, you can list a dozen factors on the  -10-    11/7/84  positive side and a dozen on the negative side, and there is room for doubt among reasonable people as to where things are going We've been through this sort of pause many, many times in periods of economic expansion If you asked what basic factors were driving the economy during the first six quarters of recovery--strong fiscal stimulus, a lot of consumer confidence, low inflation, the technology driving business fixed investment--I think those factors are still there And I'm about 75 percent certain, personally, that the incoming figures a month and two months from now will show a more positive trend I do not worry about the possibility that third- quarter GNP growth will be revised downward I don't doubt that at all That is what happened in the past Indeed, if it turns out that the downward revision reflects a lower rate of inventory investment, that would be on balance a plus and not a minus I agree with the staff forecast I think we will see some strengthening in activity I don't know whether it is going to be in the fourth quarter and I don't really care It's a question of whether or not it comes along soon enough, as I think it will, to generate the kind of growth that the staff is forecasting for 1985 And I think they are about right on the button   Is this imports of goods or goods and services?   But I think the staff's forecast is for some increase in the constant dollar value of goods counterbalanced by a decline in the services component, which largely reflects reduced investment income   I have a question about the contention that the increase in velocity in the fourth quarter might be explained by a supply side phenomenon rather than a demand side phenomenon I know there are differences in speeds of adjustments, depending on the models, but if you had a stable money demand function and a restriction of supply and the short-run elasticities of demand with respect to interest rates were a lot less, what you would have is a phenomenon in which interest rates rose much more than they would have to to equate money demand to money supply Well, that's not the problem we are looking at now Interest rates are going down, not up It seems to me you have to argue that if we have not had a downward shift in money demand either we don't really understand the factors affecting money demand, which is possible, or that our estimated nominal GNP figure for the fourth quarter is way too high   Is that right? I thought the level of real GNP at the end of 1985 was almost exactly what it was in the previous forecast   Well, Bob has given my speech; I am with him I would like to suggest that there is a case that we could look at, Chuck, where the money numbers were giving us the same kind of misinformation they are now and that was in the late spring and early summer of 1980 Now, the situation was quite different But we were looking at very, very large declines in real GNP and so we were experiencing weak growth of money because we were moving down the money demand function And at the same time the money demand function was dropping a ton Signs that the economy was going to come out of recession were beginning to emerge but that was very uncertain So what we did--and I have to say that I participated in this--is that we kept pushing the interest rates down far enough so that finally we got the money growth that we had been contemplating; but when we got it we found that the economy was roaring upward So money growth began to take place at horrendous rates and we pushed interest rates way, way up again and got involved in a situation of volatility of money growth and of interest rates which I think was neither necessary nor desirable Now, this is a totally different situation than that   Yes, and that's my point I am optimistic that the economy is going to turn around; the signs of emerging strength are there I am not certain, but I am reasonably confident that that's going to take place I would not, therefore, want to see interest rates drop much further from where they are now In this connection I would note that the staff forecast implies a federal funds rate for the end of 1985 in the 10-1/4 percent plus range and if we let the rate drop too much further, we are going to be looking at the need for a significant increase in interest rates to keep both the economy and money growth under reasonable control One point I want to make is a more or less technical one The staff has been telling us that seasonal borrowing is a very, very large part of the total adjustment plus seasonal borrowing I think the number for the seasonal component is $300 to $350 million If we adopted a borrowing target of $400 million, we are talking about $50 to $100 million of pure adjustment borrowing I don't know where the federal funds rate is going to go but it could go down a lot further than to the 9 percent number that the staff is talking about   Well, that could happen I think the problems with the agricultural banks make it less clear that most of them have been playing the rate spread and that what we're likely to see is the normal seasonal decline In any event, I would stick with alternative B If we wanted to shave the borrowing level down to $650 million or so, that would be fine I would want the federal funds rate to stick in the range of 9-1/2 percent plus or minus a little and wait and see what happens   You think there's a difference?   No matter what we do, they are going to grow at those rates   You see they didn't throw the cone out They just put some parallel lines around it It makes everybody feel good; you can take your pick that way   Let me make a clarifying point first, and that is that there are at least two operating issues that we started talking about and they don't have anything to do with one another necessarily One is the level of borrowing and whether or not the federal funds rate in relation to the level of borrowing is where we thought it was going to be And the other is how we respond to unexpected deviations of growth in M1 from the path laid out ahead of time Now these two happened to be closely related this summer, but that was an accident One has to deal with those two problems quite separately I can easily think of an example in which the opposite sort of relationship began to develop between borrowing and the federal funds rate and the kind of automaticity we're talking about would have made things go in the wrong direction The automaticity issue relates strictly to whether or not we respond more quickly and  -13-    12/17-18/84  more sensitively to changes in growth of M1 relative to path than we have in the past I'm very much with Jerry on that and I would put it this way that we haven't been frozen in stone between FOMC meetings We've evolved a procedure over the course of the past couple of years in which we instruct the Manager on what he's supposed to do when these deviations occur, and why, taking into account a whole lot of things And in a world in which if money demand is stable from one quarter to the next it isn't necessarily stable from one month to the next, I think that is a lot more sensible response to deviations of money growth from the path than an automatic response   I'd just like to remind us that we're going through a period now in which the money numbers have been weak and the economy is weak So we say to ourselves "Oh, I wish we hadn't let that happen" But the safer course is not always the one of either slowing down money growth at this point too fast, or speeding it up at this point too slowly I want to take you back to that period from October of 1981 until April of 1982 in which we had a growth rate of M1 in the range of 9 to 10 percent Had we permitted the kind of growth that the economy needed to turn around, it would have been 15 percent The safer course in that case was not to resist the growth of M1 but to let it happen Now, that was a case in point in which the money demand function that we were using was just miles off track And I don't think we should decide that just because M1 has been behaving reasonably well roughly since the middle of 1983--we have a little less than 18 months' experience--that this number is now going to be a safe guide for the future I don't think it will be I agree with Frank entirely   Well, isn't that what we're doing now?   Merry Christmas   That was the theory proposed in October of 1979; it just didn't work   Recall also that in the first half of this year we had growth rates in one month as low as 1/2 percent and in another month as high as 13 percent And unless those are anticipated--those rates were surprises, and monthly variations of that kind are always to some degree a surprise--we are going to be accompanying them with very, very large variations of interest rates I really can't see why anybody would want to go back to the kind of policy we pursued in the fall of '79 and the fall of '82, given the success of what has happened since   Well, yes I'm by no means ruling out that with a monetary policy as ideal as any human brain can conceive, given our knowledge, that we're still going to have variations in economic activity There's just no way that I could buy the argument that the main reason why we had this dramatic slowdown in the economy was because of high interest rates in the spring I just don't believe that for a moment Some of it is; the decline in housing surely is But [with] the increase in the saving rate of 1/2 percentage point or  -23-    12/17-18/84  so in the third quarter, why would you so argue when consumer credit continues to grow? This tremendous drop in net exports surely can't be assigned primarily to the rise in interest rates in the spring It's a much broader phenomenon there We can't provide a perfect monetary policy There's no way   Well, all right; I'll accept that   The two of us make a great team!   If I were to write down a forecast today, it would look very much like the staff's with about 3 percent growth And I would agree with the staff's judgment that the risks are roughly balanced as to whether or not growth would exceed that or fall short So, I don't agree with Frank or Jerry in that respect My thinking has changed over the past several months and I hope it's not because the news has been coming in rather poorly I think the worst way to forecast is to assume that tomorrow will be just like today We all know that we can do a lot better than that But some things have been happening that have affected my own judgments The most important is the fact that the drag from the international sector is turning out to be a lot larger, a lot more pervasive, and a lot more persistent than I had anticipated And the second is the evidence coming in over a series of months suggesting that the process of very rapid growth in business fixed investment is behind us  Turning to the desirability of this forecast, I certainly would agree with those who say that it would be much more desirable for growth to come out on the plus side of 3 percent than on the minus side And I say this less for domestic reasons than international ones Growth of 3 percent is still above my estimate of potential It's also above the staff's estimate, which is why we make further progress in reducing unemployment with this forecast in 1985 according to the staff But I don't think a 3 percent growth rate is satisfactory from the standpoint of the international economy There is just no evidence of any developing dynamism or cumulation of the recovery in Western Europe And if our economy grows at 3 percent or less, I think the risks increase that maybe the international economy generally is going to begin to stall, with consequences that I think are quite serious Let me just say a word or two about the exchange rates I think all of us want to see a lower exchange rate and I assume we all mean a lower real exchange rate We all know that it's very, very easy to produce a lower nominal exchange rate All we have to do is dump out money in buckets and gin up double digit inflation and the exchange rate will fall All we would have to do is signal that we intend to do that and we would get some anticipatory movements, I'm sure But what else we could do from the standpoint of monetary policy to bring the real exchange rate down, I don't know If we foster more growth in the US economy, will that raise or lower the exchange rate? I'm not sure We're told that one of the reasons the exchange rate is as high as it is is because the investment prospects look so much better here than they do in Western Europe If we lower interest rates in the short run, will that do the trick? Well, we've done that in recent weeks, and lo and behold the exchange rate turns around and goes back up again--according to some arguments, at least, because holders of dollars figure that interest rates have  -48-    12/17-18/84  reached a temporary floor and may turn around and go back up again I'd like to know what to do to bring the exchange rate down, and I think there is a way to do it, but the policy lever is not in our hands It's in the hands of those who set fiscal policy What do we do about the desire for more growth than 3 percent? If I may take a page out of your book, Mr Chairman, let me remind us all that forecasts are often inaccurate It may happen that we will get more growth than that 3 percent   Or less, that's right It's not clear at this point I would note also that the staff forecast is for price inflation in 1985 at about the same rate as in 1984 And, as has been mentioned earlier, this is still above our long-run goal But I would be prepared, over time, to try to conduct monetary policy in a way that would foster more growth than 3 percent if in fact evidence is produced as time goes on that more than 3 percent is not materializing Now, that to me doesn't call for any changes in the ranges for the monetary aggregates in 1985 I don't like M1, particularly Chuck and I are going to average one another out here! I wouldn't change the weight we give M1 in our implementation of monetary policy But I can express my views on the ranges either in terms of M2 or M1 and I get the same answer We have ranges; I think we ought to use them That's what they are for We don't have to hit the midpoint; we rarely do But the upper limit of the range for M1 is 7 percent If you add to that the 1-1/2 percent increase in velocity which is a trend increase independent of interest rates, that gives you 8-1/2 percent in nominal GNP And with a 4 percent inflation rate that gives you 4-1/2 percent real growth, if the expansive forces are there Or, with a 6 to 9 percent range for M2, an upper limit of 9 percent with no trend in the velocity of M2 independent of interest rates gives you 9 percent nominal GNP So, I think we ought to sit with these ranges; I'm happy with them   Make it 8-1/2 percent Then my arguments for M1 and M2 are completely symmetrical   Is your proposal that we start with $250 million as the borrowing number? This isn't "B," then?   Just take the aggregates specs?  -58-    12/17-18/84   May I ask where the assertion of $250 million in borrowing being consistent with the specs of "B" comes from? Does one assume that the economy is not as robust as the staff has forecast and, therefore, transactions demand for money balances does not grow along the lines that the staff has forecast? Or does one assume that, given the state of the economy, the money demand function has been misspecified or fallen or something so we get slower growth of M1? In [the latter] case why do you want to go in this direction? I just don't follow the argument   The staff's estimate of seasonal borrowing is $100 million and the staff says on page 9 of the Bluebook that the frictional level of borrowing--I assume this means adjustment borrowing--is now in the neighborhood of $150 to [$250] million   But when borrowing is getting down, do you view the $250 million borrowing level, with $100 million in seasonal, [as] one that approaches the low end of the frictional amount of adjustment borrowing? I think Ed's point is a really good one If you don't lower the discount rate, you really don't have any target at all Interest rates could drop a ton   But if you're willing to provide that kind of growth in reserves--that is, if you start with a borrowing level which is frictional, then what happens is that you just dump in whatever reserves are necessary And if interest rates drop down to 6 percent, that's within the 6 to 10 percent range for the fed funds rate, so then that's all right? It's not for me   Should we not focus also on a number like M2, which went up 15 percent at an annual rate in November? I suppose this downward revision of M1 means perhaps some downward revision of M2 The forecast that you have here for December is 13 percent?   That's been telling us that maybe what we're looking at is a circumstance in which what monies would have gone into NOW accounts earlier now are going into MMDAs, giving you the same interest rate effects   What is the level of borrowing now, $400 million? That's what we were targeting   It's a fluky situation we're in now   Let me start by calling attention to a couple of things in the general paragraph that are nits, but I think they might well be picked In line 9 we have--    12/17-18/84   The general paragraphs [of the draft directive] In line 9 it has "largely reflecting a rebound in auto production" The immediate antecedent of that is "after two months of decline" and [unintelligible] would be a lot better I'd start the sentence "After two months of decline, industrial production increased somewhat" and then follow with "reflecting" My next one is going to be a little harder to swallow On line 14 it says "The information on outlays and spending plans suggests substantially slower growth" "Substantially" has been put in this line even though the staff forecast, although it was revised down from 7-1/2 percent, is 6 percent in real terms for the four quarters of 1985 I think what has happened here is that there is confusion between the fourth quarter, which has been revised down an awful lot, and the longer-run future The easier way to handle that is just to leave it the way it was without the word "substantially" I'm not going to fight about that   My point is simply that this factor is not an awful lot different than it was the last time and to insert the word "substantially" now when the forecast has been revised down from a growth rate of 7-1/2 percent to 6 percent in real terms sounds like not quite--   Well, fine   Well, the fourth quarter is going to be very low The shipments data both from domestic sources and based on the import data for October would suggest a very slow fourth quarter And I thought putting in this word "substantially" maybe reflected a mix- up [between] what is ahead for the fourth quarter and what the outlook is for the more distant future   That would do it Then the "substantially" is needed On the more general issue, I don't want to push the ease button again; we pushed it the last time I think Bob Boykin's prescription is the right one What we need is a little patience We need to remember that monetary policy works with very substantial lags We've done a lot already And I take some encouragement from this housing report that came out this morning The rise in permits is quite strong Permits are not a forecasting device; they don't tell you anything about what is going to happen in the future but they are a lot better indicator of what is happening now than the starts figures are And to have the permits go up 11 percent, I think, means that we can be reasonably sure the process of a revival in housing is on the way   Starts were 1528; normally permits are about 93 percent of starts   Well, next I want to say that I thought we were supposed to be giving equal weight to M1 and M2 and I don't think we're giving any weight to M2 In fact, the M2 path for the fourth quarter is substantially above what we decided it was going to be in September and we're just throwing that out Nobody is even talking about the fact that we had been expecting 7-1/2 percent growth and now it's 11 percent plus We ought to think about that I think we ought to ask ourselves whether or not some of the effects of the ease we've put in are showing up in M2 instead of M1 and if that isn't just as good in terms of what it does for easing conditions in credit markets I don't think we have to go back to 8-3/4 percent on the funds rate but I would like us to aim for somewhere around the 8 to 8-1/4 percent range on the fed funds rate I don't want to take back a lot of the ease that's been put in, but I don't want to ease further And I don't know what borrowing number that would be associated with, but my guess is it would be around $325 million or thereabouts--maybe a little less That would be my prescription for policy now   I promised to give him a quarter if he said that!   No matter what we do we're going to get the same number for December!   Well, maybe that indicates that the level of frictional borrowing is $300 million instead of $250 million At $250 million now the bottom is falling out of the funds rate This is a very dangerous course of policy Interest rates can drop with no bottom There's just no way we're going to limit them, if it turns out that the estimate of frictional borrowing is wrong   If you're prepared to live with a 6 percent funds rate, why, that's fine   Well, I don't want the fed funds rate to go anywhere near that level I think we're going way too fast   That's where the disagreement lies   And lowering the discount rate is only a partial solution to the problem--that is, if the lowering of the discount rate does, to be sure, [leave unaffected] the frictional level of borrowing But if what we do with monetary policy, both open market operations and discount rate changes, is send another strong signal to the market that we think the economy must be turning down and, therefore, we're going to push the ease button, don't expect interest rates to go back up again It isn't going to happen that way It didn't happen this last time   That's the wrong way to get some support   "Seeks to maintain reserve positions" or something like that   It's the only one we're paying any attention to also Now the truth comes out   Well, "particularly if business news continues weak and the dollar continues strong"   Change your mind--   But Tony's point is right More growth is acceptable because the dollar is high If the dollar starts to fall, then the implication might be--   "Particularly provided"!   Well, I think the forecast in many respects is a remarkably good one for the third year of a recovery--when growth in the first two years was well above the average for the first two years of recovery and in the third year the expansion is sustained at a rate well above potential growth and unemployment is reduced while keeping a low inflation rate and relatively stable interest rates As I recall--and I didn't look this up--this forecast for '85 is not dramatically different than what the staff presented for '85 a year ago and I swore then that it couldn't happen But we're here now and, if you look at outside forecasts, a very large number of them are centering on performance very much like this one Indeed, when I put in my forecast, I found myself putting in numbers very much like what the staff has here  In thinking about uncertainties, what worries me the most is what's going to happen to the dollar Lots of people worry about that, too Oddly enough, some people say if the dollar goes up, that will be bad for the economy and when you ask them what will happen if the dollar goes down, they say that will be bad for the economy, too There are some bad things and some good things, but we need to keep straight exactly what is going to happen if either of those two outcomes occurs I worry more--a lot more--about what's going to happen when and if the dollar begins to fall than if it rises further If it rises further, it will put some additional restraint on the growth of domestic production but it will have beneficial effects on the inflation rate and beneficial effects on interest rates And I think it is not too difficult to handle the negative aspects on domestic growth by adjustments of monetary policy, even though I am worried about the kind of protectionist measures that develop [in those circumstances] If the dollar begins to go down and go down rapidly, particularly [unintelligible] as we're approaching the natural rate of unemployment, it's going to stimulate the economy strongly It's going to put strong upward pressures on prices and, through both of those things, strong upward pressures on interest rates And that we're going to have a lot of problems with So, I hope the staff is right and we begin to get a modest gradual decline of the dollar beginning fairly soon   It looks a bit like a whale, I think   If we have both, you can do the kind of shading you want with words; and you'll tell a lot more about what our thrust in policy is than in any kind of picture we can draw If we draw this strange looking picture, you're going to spend about 6 pages of your testimony trying to explain to Congress what that crazy thing is If we draw both the dotted lines and the cones and then you say "Look, we started off rapidly--"   I'm not sure I could figure out what mathematical equation would describe that animal   If you look at where our projections were last July when we first set these targets versus where they are now, the median forecast for real GNP looks like it might be half a percent or so higher than it was then For the GNP deflator it looks like the median forecast is going to be about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent lower So, we have more real money balances assumed and a larger real GNP growth and it seems to me that we would have a heck of a time explaining to anybody why we raised the targets for money growth I think we could sit with these   It's room I don't think we need And I think we send the wrong kind of signal when, after having set these targets initially, we're forecasting more real growth and higher growth of money balances with the lower GNP deflator I don't see that we need that additional freedom And I would prefer to send a signal which says "Look, we're still concerned with bringing down growth of money and credit over the long run to bring down inflation"   I tend to think of these longer-run ranges the way Karen Horn does They tend to send a message about what our strategy for monetary policy is over a longer period And I really think there's a complacency developing in our country about this inflation problem I just don't think we can afford to decide, even implicitly if not explicitly, that we don't need to be concerned about this inflation problem anymore I'm a bit puzzled when people say 7 percent growth in M1 is a constraining influence on the economy If our forecast for prices is half-way honest, we're talking about a 4 percent increase or less, and a 7 percent increase in nominal M1 provides for a 3 percent increase in real money balances If you look over the trend of the past 20 to 25 years, you'll find that the growth rate of real M1 has a trend of less than 1 percent a year So, I would like to stay with these targets If the economy turns out nowhere near the lines of the staff forecast and it's much weaker, I would be prepared later on to see growth of M1 exceed that upper limit; but I don't want to send that kind of message now   Everybody knows we studiously ignore M3 anyway, so whether we have 6 to 9 percent or 6 to 33 percent or whatever--   Why should we be more humble now than we were at midyear?   Like Chuck, I'm worried about how fast money is growing now and I hope we're going to get that slowed down I'm not at all certain that I know what level of the Federal funds rate is going to do that I'm reluctant to see policy shift from one direction to another abruptly, and I can go along with "B" with the understanding that if, in fact, we get money growth above those numbers, we begin to snug up a bit  I would like to call the Committee's attention to the language of the operational paragraph with respect to what it says about economic activity I think we need a change there What we have there talks about an easier policy in the context of sluggish growth in economic activity and greater restraint if indications of significant strengthening of economic activity occurred If we leave that wording, it seems to be saying that we still think the economy is  -50-    2/12-13/85  sluggish and I don't think that's what we ought to say; we ought to have a more neutral set of phrases than that   I have a suggestion for a way of dealing with that that's fairly neutral, and that is--   Yes Where the term "sluggish growth" falls now, since it's second, it doesn't seem to say that we've failed to notice what has happened so far   It sounds a little obscene   Well, so long as we all understand what's going to happen This language is going to come out after the fact anyway I think the point to be made is the one that Jerry made that if we say "limited," the public may say that we had a certain degree specified and would go no further beyond that We still want to maintain the idea that we have the ability to respond to what is happening   What about saying "reserve pressures would be increased somewhat, particularly if business activity"--  -55-    2/12-13/85   It's much better to say it in the testimony because that way the message gets to the public and you want it to Otherwise, it's too late   We could even use colors!   It will become known as the Volckergram   You can always turn the picture sideways, though, Henry!   In mid-1983 we--   We rebased and raised the target from 5 to 9 percent   And accepted the overrun in the first half   We made a tremendous change in mid-1983   I wouldn't look for much price relief from raising the quotas The quota increase probably will be quite small And the excess demand for Japanese cars is so great that I think at existing prices they could just ship a few more and that's about it   Well, my sense is that the Japanese would be so reluctant to risk the possibility of a reimposition of quotas that they would increase their shipments to the United States in quite modest amounts I would doubt seriously, if we had a removal of the quotas, that we would see an increase in Japanese shipments of more than, say, 10 percent   Yes, I know I was just--   --making the comment solely with respect to Japanese quotas The shipments from South Korea and so on are going to increase anyway But the shipments from Japan I don't think are going to increase very much   Poetry   What are you talking about now?   If we change it once more, I'm going to wear a hole in this paper!  -68-    2/12-13/85   I think so   He's liable We have already given him the authority to make his pictures anyway he wants to including colors, dots--   Did he call him P Adolph Volcker?   They worry about their own   Do we have any maturing Farm Credit issues coming due in the near future?   That, I suppose, would be the critical issue that we face   What do we have in the near term in that respect?   I don't either   I thought Mr Axilrod's message was that there is no way to get there from here   I think Henry's point about looking over a longer period and not judging where the economy is going by last month's statistics is one that is worth repeating If one looks at the first-quarter flash [for GNP] and compares it with where we are in the second quarter--during which time we have had a lot of erratic numbers--we're looking at growth of aggregate demand of around 3-3/4 percent and the growth of GNP is between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 percent because we had a big drop in net exports during this period What the staff is forecasting basically for the next 3 quarters is a continuation of that very moderate pace of growth in aggregate demand, a little under 4 percent, and a somewhat better GNP performance of about 1/2 percentage point less than the growth of aggregate demand because net exports are not going to drop so much And that seems to me a reasonable forecast for the moment I certainly agree that this confidence factor is one that's difficult to appraise, but presumably the staff thought about this in the process of putting together its forecast I would remind you all that the increase in business fixed investment that they are talking about is a very, very substantial slowdown from what we saw in the first two years of recovery In the first two years of recovery we have seen an increase in real business fixed investment of over 30 percent--a tremendous increase And part of this forecast is a consequence, I think, of the erosion of confidence that has occurred If you ask yourself what has happened typically in the third year of recovery in business fixed investment, typically it continues to go up and it does so even though corporate profits flatten out The big difference besides the confidence factor this time is the fact that we have been looking at an actual decline in the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing since the middle of last year I would be inclined to give that some weight, but not an undue weight, because this is a recovery--as I would appraise it at least--in which the growth of business fixed investment by and large has not been related in any close way to the need for additional capacity It has been replacement investment; it has been investment designed to cut costs and improve productivity; it has been investment driven very heavily by tax incentives and by technology Having said all that, I would still come out--although I am a little less gloomy than the Chairman is--with the view that this is a forecast for which the risks are predominately on the down side I don't see any serious concern that we're going to have more growth of aggregate demand during the course of 1985 and early 1986 than we would want   What sort of a funds rate does that likely give rise to?   I'm concerned, as many are, that over the long run--that is, the next 5 years or so--we will have an inflation problem that is probably going to get worse when the dollar begins to fall, so that less money growth is better than more So, I would prefer to see the growth of M1 come in lower than 6-1/2 percent; but I wouldn't want to do anything to force it to do that I like Ed's  -32-    3/26/85  prescription of prayer better than Si Keehn's of raising the borrowing level to $500 or $600 million It may be that by midyear we will regret this But I don't think one can assume that, simply because money might be at the upper edge of the parallel line--maybe not even in close enough contact for an intimate kiss--at that point I think we have to decide that later; we have to wait and see what economic conditions look like at that time Six percent might make sense, cosmetically, for the M1 target for March to June What I worry about, however, is that if we get a speed-up of tax refunds, we might have an increase in money growth for that reason, which really wouldn't make any significant difference to the course of economic activity What I'd like to do is to adopt a course of policy now that keeps us really where we are I don't want to see the fed funds rate go up to 9 percent and I don't want to see it go back down to 8 percent I would like to see it hover in the range of 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent, or even 8-5/8 percent, which is about where it has been recently I have a hunch that maybe we need a little higher level of initial borrowing than $350 million--maybe $400 million or somewhere around there But the sense of my prescription would be to stay pretty steady at this time   If I thought that were going to happen, I would share Roger's concern I would rather have the market say "There has been no change in policy and the Fed is even-keeling now; it hasn't panicked because of those high growth numbers for money early in the year; on the other hand, it is not prepared to lower interest rates because it appears that the economy is going into recession" So, if Roger is right, I'd rather see $450 million I'm not sure   I think if we start with borrowing of $350 to $500 million, that ought to provide a lot of flexibility on exactly how that's interpreted, depending on demand for excess reserves and so on And that's certainly not too wide a range of borrowing to be unreasonable   $350 to $500 million  -40-    3/26/85   Yes, I know But I'm responding to Bob Black's suggestion that maybe we ought to start with $400 to $500 million instead of $350 to $400 million because that's really where we are now according to Peter Sternlight So, I say let's be very reasonable let's start with $350 to $500 million as a working range; that's presumably one we all might be able to live with   It means we're going to start at $375 million   And the economy also   On page 13, this sentence that begins "In either case, such a change would be considered only in the context" why do we want the word "only"? We should just flat put it that we would consider this in the context of some larger considerations  -43-    3/26/85   I would be inclined to sunset the decision at the end of the present Chairman's term of office and, in effect, await a new request The individual who first requests information like this may well understand the confidentiality with which to protect it The next guy may not   Is it a miracle or have they hedged their positions sufficiently so that they get by?   But the reduction of 4 [tenths] is primarily, I think, a consequence of governmental purchases rather than private final purchases That is, the private final purchases were actually revised up somewhat from what they had been That part does not signify anything    5/21/85   The domestic final demand was revised down from 16732 to 16729 but the private component thereof was increased from 13626 to 13638 I don't have the growth rate, but it is a tiny little adjustment   The remedy for that is good old-fashioned monetary discipline--make credit tight enough   You can't win!   Well, we are hearing a lot of gloomy reports today and that's understandable There is a lot to be gloomy about When that sort of thing happens I think it's worthwhile at least to remind ourselves that there are some positive signs developing Housing has been moving up for four or five months now I agree with Jerry that we have had enough reduction in interest rates, given the lag in the way they affect spending and credit sensitive sectors of the economy, that we should expect to see some results from that as time goes on I would regard auto sales as a positive; they may go down but they certainly have been quite strong recently Consumers remain quite confident And I take some comfort in the fact that, although investment spending intentions for 1985 are a lot more subdued than they were at this time last year, we don't seem to have seen any further deterioration from the fall to the spring That rather surprises me, but maybe it will turn out that that won't hold up We should remind ourselves also, I think, that periods of slowdown during an economic expansion are the rule, not the exception If I remember my business cycle history correctly, Wesley Mitchell and Arthur Burns used to talk about a mid-cycle retardation, which  -19-    5/21/85  occurred about 3/4ths of the time The problem is that we don't know whether we are in the 3/4ths now or in the 1/4th I am not a wild optimist by any means I agree with the staff's forecast that we will have some pickup in economic activity I have a hard time assessing whether the risks are a little on the minus or the plus side, but I think I would assign a probability of 001 to an outcome of more growth over the next year than I would be comfortable living with  Now, I would like to put that in a longer-run context I think we ought to take into account the fact that what we are looking at now is an economy that is being severely depressed by competition from the international side It's a consequence of a horrendous increase in the value of the dollar and the dollar is eventually going to decline When? I don't know whether it is going to be next week or next month or next year; but when the dollar goes back down, we could find the economy as severely stimulated as it is now being depressed And if that occurs in the context of a federal structural budget deficit that is still rising, we are in big trouble That may not happen, but I think one has to remember that the problem we may be worried about on average over the next three years is not too little growth but too much, and not too little demand, but too much We need to keep that in mind as we think about the course of monetary policy under present circumstances   There is another way you can get basically the same conclusion One of my favorite ways--nobody else likes it but  -23-    5/21/85  me, I guess--is to look at those old money demand functions and ask What would money have done if the relationship between GNP and interest rates and the growth of money had been what it used to be? If you do that, you find that over the past year the predicted growth of M1 on those old money demand models was 69 percent compared with an actual of 62 percent; for the past two quarters predicted growth was 70 percent compared with an actual of 68 percent I think the really big question is not so much whether money is behaving in a peculiar way relative to what might have happened in the past if old money demand models prevailed, but rather whether money growth has the same kind of meaning when you have an exchange rate that is way, way out of line We used to think that money was related to aggregate demand not to output That in itself makes a difference But maybe even the relationship between money growth and aggregate demand is not the same in a world of wildly volatile and fluctuating exchange rates   Well, I earlier indicated that I think we have to be thinking about where we are going over the longer run in deciding on policy today By that I mean that I don't think we ought to dump in reserves in buckets We shouldn't act panicky We shouldn't let rates drop a ton We should be ready to take back whatever additional stimulus we put in now, if it turns out that the  -27-    5/21/85  economy gets a bit more robust as the year goes along than we now are forecasting I do think that what we need to worry about most with respect to M1 is not so much how fast it is presently growing, but whether or not there is going to be an impression out there that the Fed is throwing in the towel on inflation If that impression were widespread, I would be deeply concerned I don't sense that now and I do want to make sure that we don't give that impression But I am perfectly happy to go along with the specifications of "B" and the borrowing range specified by Jerry of $350 to $375 million   If we separate M1 and M2 and M3, does that perhaps convey the notion that only M1 is the target now and that for M2 and M3 we have expectations but not targets?  -38-    5/21/85   I would feel much more comfortable if we stayed above $350 million I like Jerry's formulation of $350 to $375 million It just seems to me that if the funds rate gets down below the 7-3/4 percent range, then it raises questions again about whether or not we're going to have another cut in the discount rate We've sent some very strong signals to the markets with this cut in the discount rate And I really wouldn't want to send any more messages like that   Well, given what's happened to market interest rates and stock prices, it seems to me that the markets weren't expecting it all that confidently   But it really suggests that we ought to have an agreed upon target for the federal funds rate I would think that's--   Not a written one Let Steve translate that to whatever borrowing level is appropriate   What was that again?
