4518,2001-12-11, Thank you  
4519,2001-12-11," First, I’d like to associate myself with Governor Bies’s preamble  I share the   same view  I would like to make one observation on the subject of fiscal policy and the stimulus   package, which has been discussed by a number of people  I do so from the standpoint of having   spent much of the last 30 years being very closely involved in the public policy formation process     Congress functions best or most rationally in two environments, either a crisis or a   consensus That's not because members of Congress are necessarily weak people but because the   system was designed that way  We reelect the entire House and a third of the Senate every two years,   and that is not a circumstance that lends itself to creating statesmen or women or to fostering long-  term thinking  As we move away from a sense of crisis, we move into an environment where I think   the stimulus package is in some jeopardy  That is not, as President Jordan suggested, because it   involves a conscious rejection of discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy but because we find   members of Congress, particularly in an election year, tugged by their core constituencies  Where that   leaves us now is that to the extent there is a growing sense of confidence in the economy--despite that   confidence being based in part on the assumption of a fiscal stimulus package--it will in fact have   jeopardized the possibility of a stimulus package being passed  It’s a bit of a Catch-22  So in that   very narrow component of the outlook, I think the probability of an economic impetus package is less   than it was 30 days ago Thank you    I support the recommendation  "
4574,2002-03-19," Let me add a couple of thoughts to what has been said thus far  We’ve   talked a bit about the seeming disparity between the attitude of business leaders and the direction   of the economy I spent a good part of the ’90s doing strategic planning and identifying        March 19, 2002 Page 68 of 117  corporate goals, and one of the interesting changes that took place over that decade was a   telescoping down of a multitude of corporate goals to a single one of shareholder value  I think   the extent to which the business community will be happy with a recovery in the economy and   the performance of their individual businesses will depend in part on whether or not they think   the stock market is going to recognize it  So until that happens, I suspect that we will have a   somewhat pessimistic or at least somewhat disappointed business community  Should they see   the market start to perk up, I think we will see a difference in attitude   I tried to identify some of the public policy issues that may affect the economy, and there   are a few One of them is the current absence at the moment of terrorist insurance  I think there   will be a bill before this session of the Congress ends that will provide a backstop for that risk    We had some discussion earlier about the effect of the lack of terrorist insurance on the   commercial mortgage-backed market  As the Greenbook points out, the market seems to have   identified and isolated the areas of risk  So I think that the Greenbook well pretty captures that   particular exposure We’ve talked about the stimulus package  The Greenbook also deals with   the potentially explosive Middle East situation  And the scenario in the alternative simulation   that called for a $10 per barrel increase in the price of oil, with only a modest downward pressure   on the economy, seems to me to identify that risk exposure  A third one, the steel tariffs, we also   talked about a bit An important factor will be the manner in which the rest of the world views   the imposition of those tariffs—a point that Karen discussed in an earlier meeting  It will be   interesting to see whether the world sees that as a political event that is a single, isolated anomaly   or if they see it as a drift toward protectionism  I think that will be determined in part on how the   Bush Administration follows up that action and how it chooses to comment on it on an ongoing   basis        March 19, 2002 Page 69 of 117  The one reservation I have about the Greenbook forecast relates to the federal   government budget  The staff projects from 2002 to 2003 a 6 percent increase in federal receipts   in spite of the tax increase and only a 4 percent increase in expenditures  That will take more   discipline in an election year than we saw in the last election year cycle  So I think that’s a   potential downside risk Having said that, I do not see any exposures that were not well captured   in the Greenbook analysis and in the other material provided  "
4575,2002-03-19, I support both parts of the recommendation  
4623,2002-05-07," The discussion in the Greenbook and the discussion today have focused   on the conclusion that the economy is expanding but that there has been a lack of business   participation through capital spending  The issue has not been whether but when the business   community might participate to a greater extent  In other meetings, I have looked at public   policy issues to try to determine the extent to which a public policy initiative might affect either   the economy or the psychology  At the last meeting we were pleasantly surprised by the nature   of the fiscal stimulus package that the Congress had passed  This time we still have the overhang   issues of market discipline, corporate governance, and transparency questions that Vice   Chairman McDonough addressed  But another issue has emerged, and it is one that I think will   continue to concern us   For the last decade at least, we have had a period of fiscal discipline in the Congress  A   process has been observed whereby any increase in expenditure needed to be matched by the   identification of the revenue source to pay for it And in other election years, there has been a   bipartisan effort to demonstrate at least some adherence to that concept  The budget discipline   started to disappear in late 2000 when it was clear that we were running significant surpluses                 May 7, 2002 60 of 81  That issue was alive as a high-level public policy issue up until September 11  But I think   among the casualties of the events of September 11 was support for budgetary discipline    Evidence of that is probably as apparent this week as it ever has been, with the manner in which   the Congress is approaching the farm bill  One of the things that we had accomplished in the   past decade, in the context of greater fiscal discipline, was a move away from the subsidy   support of agriculture  We see today that sometime this week the Congress will pass a bill where   all of that discipline is gone; we are moving back at least a decade in terms of weaning   agriculture from that kind of support  So, to the extent that the business community correlates   prosperity with fiscal discipline, I’m afraid these developments will not be positive and will not   be reassuring    Three years probably    A budget resolution?    I don’t know the timing    Agree  "
4674,2002-08-13," In preparation for the meeting today, I surveyed a number of bankers, and   in many respects my findings basically are consistent with what we’ve heard around the table   today Consumer lending has remained strong  The growth is starting to level in nonmortgage   consumer products, but loan quality remains strong  Home equity lines continue to grow and         August 13, 2002 53 of 92  perform well  Mortgage lending both for refinancing and purchase are not simply strong but in   some cases will continue to set records  On the commercial lending side, the medium and   regional-sized banks are reporting flat loan growth—in fact, almost no loan growth—but steady   loan performance, which suggests that loan quality is still good  The most notable observation   came from two CEOs of large commercial bank lenders who both reported a significant change   in what one might call the temperament of their largest borrowers  The resulting combination of    risk aversion on the bank’s side and hesitancy on the borrower’s side is quite consistent with   what we’ve seen in the commercial paper markets and the commercial bond markets    With respect to agriculture, there was an acknowledgement of the drought around the   country, although some of the areas where the drought is the worst are also areas where the   irrigation systems are the best  So the farm economy is expected to be fairly strong, on balance,   in part because yields are high And the lenders say with some chagrin that the agricultural bill   also will add price improvement on top of the high yields  So the farm sector will be in   relatively good shape   The other point I want to mention is the fiscal discipline issue that the Congress will face   when it comes back after Labor Day This Congress, as we’ve discussed before, will adjourn   without having passed a budget resolution—for only the second time in history and for the first   time since 1997  On the House side they’ve passed a budget, and that is their focal point now as   they go through the appropriations process  In the Senate, the lack of a budget resolution means   that there is no spending discipline in the Senate because with a budget resolution there is a   requirement of sixty votes in order to exceed the budget  So the prospect for legislation of the   type that President Hoenig mentioned is very much alive  Moreover, the expectation is that this   Congress will adjourn having passed perhaps only half of the thirteen appropriation bills required                  August 13, 2002 54 of 92  and that the government will be funded on a continuing resolution basis from September until   probably February   All in all, the reports still suggest underlying strength on the consumer side of the   economy, a very strong wariness with respect to business investment, and a lack of fiscal   discipline on the part of the Congress That certainly reinforces the view that there is some   uncertainty in the marketplace  Incidentally, the President’s economic forum in Texas today is   expected to focus significantly on the fiscal issues, anticipating what is going to happen in the   fall  "
4675,2002-08-13," I support both parts of the recommendation  I do think—and this relates   to something that Governor Ferguson raised—that we have two roles here today  One is the   monetary policy role But we also have a de facto role at this time as one of the few bastions of   credibility left in the country and particularly in Washington, DC  So I would suggest that the               August 13, 2002 82 of 92  manner in which we describe our position today is particularly important  I think it has to be as   much analytical as explanatory for that purpose  "
4726,2002-09-24," Much like Governor Bies, a lot of the comments that I have prepared have   already been stated, so I will just mention a couple of points  One is on the subject of fiscal   policy As the Chairman testified two weeks ago, the Budget Enforcement Act provisions are   about to expire next week  Also, we will end the fiscal year without a budget for only the second           September 24, 2002 72 of 115  time in our history  And starting as early as perhaps this week but no later than next week, the   government probably will be funded on a series of continuing resolutions from now until either   February or March The significance of that, I think, is that from a fiscal policy perspective the   government will be locking in uncertainty for the next five or six months   I’d note a couple of observations from the banking industry, many of which have already   been discussed The minimal business lending activity that is occurring tends to be for   restructuring or lending to achieve additional efficiency  One issue that I think is of some   concern is that shared credits or syndicated credits are particularly tough to arrange  The   exception is leveraged business buyouts with strong partners, although there is some   indication—as President McTeer and some others mentioned—that we may be seeing a bit of   strength among medium-sized businesses  What I’m hearing from bankers, however, is that they   sense that we’re at the bottom of the cycle but they’re unwilling to say so because they have said   so now for some time  So there is a reluctance to suggest that this is the bottom  Also, we’re   hearing words like “fatigue” and “stagnation” being used to refer to the economic situation   I was particularly struck yesterday by the report that we got—the chart that was   mentioned earlier by Dave Stockton and the Chairman—showing corporate America in its most   liquid condition in a decade About thirty-six years ago I started doing cash flow analysis for   debt service, and I don’t remember a time when ample corporate liquidity was compatible with   the expression “tough times”  When you combine that with the fact that the banking industry is   in a strong capital position, a strong liquid position, and has good asset quality, I can’t figure out   if that should be reassuring or a point of concern  I think, on balance, it’s more reassuring  And   coming back to something President Jordan said earlier, given where we were a year ago, if we     September 24, 2002 73 of 115  had known then that there was so much dry powder in the system, I think we would have found   that very reassuring   On the other hand, the terms “fatigue” and “stagnation” suggest to me that there is a   nervous impatience in the air  Combined with our fiscal circumstance, that impatience is   certainly a cause for concern My feeling, however, is that if the market is impatient, maybe this   is the time for us to be patient  On the other hand, as had to be done two or three weeks ago in   this city, there was enough anecdotal evidence out there that it was deemed necessary to move to   a slightly heightened state of concern  I think the same is true for us  It seems to me that it may   be time to move from a code yellow to a code orange  "
4727,2002-09-24," I support both parts of your recommendation  In the brief period of time   that I’ve been here, it seems that every word that is changed in the press statement that   accompanies our policy announcement generates ten additional questions But even having said   that, I think it’s very important to acknowledge the geopolitical risks today  I think that’s   particularly critical    My sense is that the less said in this press statement the fewer questions   we’ll have, but you can clarify any questions in a dialogue type of environment in a way that we   can’t do in a statement  "
4783,2002-11-06," Let me make two general points  First, in conversations with bankers I   surveyed over the past week, almost everything I picked up anecdotally supports the update that   Dave Stockton gave us Second, I would say that the flavor of those anecdotes was along the   lines that Cathy Minehan, among others, described very well  But I’d like to go over just a   couple points that I did pick up   One of the bankers that I talked to has an automobile finance subsidiary in nine states on   the East Coast; and in all nine states, sales of new vehicles are down across the board  He   attributes that to the fact that the spate of aggressive financing deals has in fact exhausted the   appetite for new car purchases So in the view of my banker contacts, the strength that we’ve   been able to get from the automobile side probably has been dissipated  Moreover, and this is a   secondary consideration from their standpoint, they don’t believe that the automobile   manufacturers can sustain the strategic direction they have taken, with essentially profitless sales   of automobiles  Because of the deterioration in their financial positions, they’ve increased the   risk premiums  They’re going to have to find a new paradigm there, so that approach is probably   over            November 6, 2002 71 of 122  On residential real estate, however, I got the same sense that Susan Bies and others have   talked about There is still strength in that sector, with no deterioration evident  From the   banking side what we’re getting is no improvement in commercial lending activity and no   significant deterioration in asset quality  But in addition to their assessment of developments in   the auto and residential real estate sectors, all three of the bankers that I talked to had the same    sense that activity in the retail sector has declined   Moving to the fiscal policy issue, yesterday’s election has enormous implications  Most   of the focus up to this point has been on the construct of the new Congress starting in January    But some significant issues will be addressed in the interim during the lame duck session  Some   of the variables are so recent and so unexpected that they haven’t really been considered fully    But let me go over a couple of them   First of all, the government is being funded now on a continuing resolution that goes only   through November 22  So either the Congress has to address that by a continuing resolution that   would go beyond the time the next Congress convenes, probably until about March, or the matter   will have to be taken up this year    Second, the most critical election that took place yesterday in terms of the near term was   in Missouri  With Senator Talent being elected to fill an unexpired term, he will be eligible to   take that seat as soon as the election is certified  And in Minnesota with the death of Paul   Wellstone and the appointment of an independent to serve briefly, if you assume that the   independent will caucus independently as opposed to Senator Jeffers who caucuses as a   Democrat, the numbers will be fifty Republicans, forty-nine Democrats, and one Independent   The immediate implication is that because no vote is required for Senate majority leader, Senator   Lott will simply be acknowledged as the new majority leader  On the other hand, in order to               November 6, 2002 72 of 122  change committee chairs, there must be a vote  So there’s at least some possibility that a week   from now when the Senate reconvenes we’ll have a Republican Senate majority leader and   Democrats as committee chairs     Now, what does all that mean?  [Laughter] I think one of the things it means is that   there’s incentive on both sides to address the appropriation bills  In my view the Democrats will   believe that they can’t get a better deal next year than they can obtain this year  And my sense is   that in the fiscal policy area the Republicans want to address tax policy and want to address it   very quickly My guess is that they do not want to do that in a context where they’re looking   also at appropriations bills  So there will be incentive on both sides to get that done this year    Therefore, I think there’s a real possibility that we may see one single, very large appropriations   bill in this interim session    I think it’s so the Republicans will then be able to move on and focus on   tax policy—that is, if he is reasonably satisfied with the dollar amounts in the bill  That would   be my guess, that there will be some incentive to get past it for the purpose of moving on with   their agenda When we talked about revenue sharing it reminded me that, when the concept of   revenue sharing became law, that was also a time when the Congress had incentive  Because of   the accelerating tax rates, there was incentive to build in inflation, and it was a tax policy that we   called “progressive” at the time  Fortunately, we’ve moved away from that era     In summary, the consumer side, which had been the source of strength in this economy,   clearly has deteriorated since our September meeting; and based on anecdotal reports from the   bankers I talked with, it looks as if there is no pickup yet on the business side  Assuming that         November 6, 2002 73 of 122  there is a fiscal policy agenda in the form of tax cut policy, it undoubtedly will not take effect at   all in the year 2003 So I think the situation clearly has deteriorated from what we were seeing at   the time of our last FOMC meeting  "
4784,2002-11-06," When I began reviewing the Greenbook information, I had a reaction to it   that I didn’t expect As I was reading through it, I heard the theme that the current news is   disappointing, but the economy was still seen as poised for accelerating growth at some point in         November 6, 2002 95 of 122  the future And it struck me that I had been reading that same thing time after time after time    As I thought about that, it seemed to me that it was not a reflection of our ability to model nor a   reflection of our ability to understand the data  I think we are reading the data accurately  But in   every other environment I’ve ever experienced in my life, that sequence just screams “do   something!”  Now, this is the first time I’ve been in a monetary policy environment, so I came    into the meeting trying to get an understanding of what the downside risks would be of an   aggressive move And I think I’m persuaded that the downside risks of moving the funds rate   down are fairly well mitigated  Also, a balanced risk statement seems to me to suggest what   we’ve been saying all along, that the fundamentals are still in place for a turnaround  So I   support both parts of the recommendation    "
4833,2002-12-10," I want to mention a couple of points that I’ve picked up in discussions   with bankers, which tend to reinforce what we’ve heard around the table today  Basically the   sense of bankers on the commercial lending side is that the psychology seems to have changed         December 10, 2002 57 of 87  slightly but lending activity has not yet followed  Of the four bankers I talked to, one of them    who is the CEO of the largest mortgage lender in the country emphasized the significant decline   in the number of home loan refinancing applications received in the last several weeks  We   discussed some of the reasons for that  Refinancing applications tend to show a correlation with   movements in the ten-year Treasury note  But the recent falloff is disproportionate to the   movement in the ten-year Treasury issue, so that has caught his attention     Two of my banker contacts commented on the growth in savings accounts at their banks    Most of the discussions I’ve had with bankers over the last year have focused on the asset side of   the balance sheet This is the first time much has been said about the liability side  Both of these   bankers emphasized the growth in savings accounts; they said consumers were adding to savings   as opposed to putting funds into an interest-bearing transaction account  Implicit in that   behavior, in their view, is that consumers expect interest rates to stay low for some time  A   similar reaction came from a banker who talked about what was happening with home loan   equity lines of credit, which are variable rate instruments  Fifteen percent of those loans are now   first lien positions, which carries the same suggestion—that home owners are taking advantage   of the lower interest rate line of credit as opposed to locking in a longer-term rate  Implicit in   that behavior, too, is some sense that the consumer thinks rates will remain low for a while   On the fiscal policy side, I think the only thing we can know for sure is that it will be a   front burner issue in the new Congress and will involve a lot of legislative activity  Also, the   continuing resolution to fund the government expires January 11, and still only two of the   thirteen appropriation bills have been passed   It seems to me that the two scenarios built into the Greenbook are the most likely and are   very realistic—the payroll tax holiday and the acceleration of the marginal rate reductions  As            December 10, 2002 58 of 87  President Minehan suggested, the discussion of the tradeoff between tax changes and budget   balancing will spark a very lively debate  But at this point very little has changed from six   weeks ago  "
4834,2002-12-10, I support  
4884,2003-03-18,"  In talking with bankers within the last week or so, I think the vantage   points of two in particular were of interest  One indicated that at his bank, one of the largest   consumer lenders in the country, the volume and credit quality they have been experiencing   recently is consistent with upward pressures on prices and yet they don’t sense any pricing   pressures  The fact that they are a major credit card issuer and have a significant range of   consumer loan products has historically given them a window through which they have been able   to predict retail sales quite well, and that was the vantage point he was talking about  In contrast,   on the commercial loan side he had two observations  One is that there is nothing in the pipeline    But two, which is of considerable interest, is that the credit quality of their loan portfolio has   improved  If you follow the Call Report data, you would know that credit quality even on   commercial portfolios had been declining up through the end of last year; but in this banker’s   judgment, it has leveled out and maybe even improved  So we see the contrasting effects of   banks having experienced improved credit quality yet no loan demand, which may in fact   March 18, 2003 63 of 101    corroborate Governor Bernanke’s thesis that the closer we get to the event, the higher the hurdle   rate    The second report is from a bank that is a major commercial lender and also a major   securities servicer  That bank had exactly the same experience with respect to the commercial   loan portfolio but also had what it described as paralysis with respect to equity activity—no   cross-border activity and no IPOs  The underwritings tend to be coming primarily from the   municipal sector  The description we’ve heard this morning is of an atmosphere of uncertainty,   some portion of which is geopolitical This banker would characterize it somewhat differently    He would describe it as paralysis of which the dominant reason is geopolitical risk, recognizing   that there may well be other risks also           One other note of caution from my contacts is that banks are now recognizing and   starting to feel how expensive liquidity can be  As a result, we’re seeing evidence of banks   reaching for yield  There has been a firming of the secondary market for commercial loans, for   example, and new interest in the B tranche of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)  We also   see banks reaching out on the term of their loans and investments to achieve higher rates of   return, something Dino suggested was occurring and that I think President Pianalto hinted at as   well  All in all, it is certainly a time of great uncertainty and therefore, as President Guynn and   others have said, perhaps not a circumstance that can most directly be addressed through   monetary policy  "
4885,2003-03-18,  I support both parts of the recommendation  
4933,2003-05-06,"  Could I just follow up on that issue?  Unlike in the recession of the early   ’90s, this time corporate bonds and equities took most of the hit in terms of losses as opposed to   bank loans  So it isn’t just the corporate governance scandals or the lack of confidence in   financial reporting that are involved but the fact that there were more losses in the market   securities segment than in the previous period  I was interested in Dino’s analysis, too, when in   reference to his chart on S&P 100 volatility he related that volatility in some respects to the   corporate governance issue  Even so, I think we have to remember that there were financial   market losses that were separate from the corporate governance issue     Which is a problem that seems to be behind us now     Let me add two points to the discussion  The first is on fiscal policy    This is going to be a very key week with respect to fiscal policy because the tax writing   committees of both the House and the Senate meet this week  It seems to many that the   momentum has shifted to the House, in part because the House committee chairman has   exhibited perhaps the strongest thought leadership and maybe the most sagacious political   leadership as well  I must say that he’s also dealing with the most friendly and accommodative   budget restraints    The Senate probably will meet also and may make an effort to cram the President’s   dividend exclusion proposal into the legislation in some way within the limitations of their   budget restraints  It seems likely that, instead of the President’s proposal with respect to   dividends, they may come out with a cap on the tax rate on dividends and a drop in the tax rate   May 6, 2003 63 of 115    on capital gains  Many in the Congress will find that more palatable than the dividend exclusion,   just in terms of the ability to explain what they are doing  That would also then clear the way for   the acceleration of the previously enacted tax cuts  I might note that last Wednesday the   Chairman, in response to questions by the House Banking Committee, made a real effort to try to   distinguish between tax cuts that stimulate capital spending and tax cuts that stimulate   consumption  But I would say that we don’t see any of that discussion being reflected in the   deliberations on either side   In trying to read the political tea leaves, it seems as if people have a sense that the White   House would be willing to accept a tax package with any number north of $350 billion—and if it   could be north of $450 billion, that would be all the better  But we will know more a week from   now with respect to tax policy than we know today     My other point relates to the banking industry, where interestingly there is little change   from what I reported at the last two meetings  We saw throughout all of 2002 a gradual decline   in asset quality, but in 2003 it has remained stable  On the consumer side, there has been no   postwar bounce, in part because there was no wartime decline of any significant extent in the   consumer area  We are hearing anecdotally—from members of our Federal Advisory Council at   its meeting last Friday and from a number of other people—the first hints of plans for expansion   or indications that business people think the time might be right to expand  It seems to me likely   that this is another area where there’s a difference between the data we can measure and the   anecdotal information we are picking up, which is ex parte the numbers we can read  "
4934,2003-05-06,"  Based only on my reading of the Greenbook and the options presented in   the Bluebook, I would have supported an easing today  I am persuaded, however, by the timing   question to support your recommendation  I would just like to add one point about executive   May 6, 2003 97 of 115    sentiment, building on comments made by the Chairman, Vice Chairman McDonough, and   Governor Bies  The markets still reward executives who outperform their peers  If we look back   at the 1991-92 environment, when a significant amount of downsizing was going on, once that   downsizing had been complete there were only two options available to achieve growth—to   expand by merger or to expand by additional investment  It seems to me that this time we have   seen a great deal of improvement in the efficiency and timing of investment decisions, to say   nothing of the decisions themselves in terms of what investments to make  But the margin of   error in the timing is even tighter than it was in 1991-92  So coming back to Vice Chairman   McDonough’s comment about the psychology, once the psychology seems right for businesses   to make new investments, I think the pickup in investment could be quite rapid  In my view to   do anything at this point to disturb that would be wrong   With respect to the statement, eighteen months ago when I first joined the Committee I   thought it would be pretty easy to improve the statements that we were making  It didn’t take me   long to realize that every change we made was parsed carefully, so by my second meeting I was   very conscious of the desirability of not changing any more words than necessary  However, as   in the business world, there are windows of opportunity  Having not opined a risk assessment at   the last meeting gives us an opportunity this time to make some changes, and these changes seem   to me to be appropriate  So I support not only the statement but also the manner in which we’ve   altered the statement  "
4987,2003-08-12,"  I would also refer to a comment that Governor Kohn made regarding the   need for the shift in psychology that apparently is beginning to occur  Last week I talked with   four contacts at major banks—CEOs or others in senior leadership positions—and the most   notable change in their description of recent developments at their banks is the across-the-board   improvement in business psychology that they are observing  It has not yet been reflected in   C&I loans in a broad way, though an exception is one of the major Midwest banks, which has   seen more activity in C&I lending in the rural markets than they’ve observed for the past five   years  However, in the major money markets, they do tend to see increased activity in some of   the areas of capital lending activity  Venture capital activity has gone from awful to signs of   improvement, I’m told  The corporate bond market is still strong, and the attractiveness of that   August 12, 2003 60 of 110    market has helped diminish the growth in C&I lending  Markets are described as improved,   particularly in the high risk area, and the leveraged transactions tend to be up  Another factor   that’s important is that loan quality is no longer mentioned as an issue of concern  We have seen   continued improvement in asset quality in both the consumer and the business sectors for some   time  So while there is optimism and a significant improvement in psychology, that has not yet   translated into business activity, at least as represented by the business channel  "
4988,2003-08-12,"  I support both parts of the recommendation, and I also look forward to our   meeting in September regarding communications  "
5020,2003-09-15,"  Put me in the category also of the members who don’t think we need to   make a major change  Like a lot of other people, I’ve spent a good deal of time thinking about   what we might have done differently in our past communication  As I’ve thought about our   recent communication, it seemed to me that over the March/May/June time frame we went from   having had a succession of two-part statements to a one-part statement and finally to a three-part   statement  I remember very clearly that one of the themes running through our May meeting was   that we didn’t want to surprise the market  What happened was exactly the opposite—the market   surprised us  It had the feel of a Steve McQueen movie!  You may remember the one where he   started out being chased and then very cleverly found himself being the chaser  It seemed to me   that we were then in a bind because at the June meeting if we had been following that dictum—if   we had acted in a way that would have pleased the market—it would have run contrary to the   policy views of the people in the room  We seemed to have found ourselves in a perfect storm    It was at a time when we were talking about the possible need to use unconventional operational   means that we made major changes in the statement  It was a time also when the economy was   just beginning to respond to the stimulus that was in the marketplace  I think that situation was   very much an anomaly, and in my view we should not overreact to the manner in which that   communication was received    Keeping on that theme—and recognizing that in January we’re going to continue   discussing this topic—I would hope that we do not make major changes between now and the   next time we talk about communication issues  I want to make sure that we continue to be   incrementalists on the subject  But in terms of this part of our deliberation and looking at the   alternative methods of communicating, I would tend to support option 4    September 15, 2003 57 of 78   "
5065,2003-09-16,"  I want to mention two additional data points that support much of what we   have already talked about  First, from bankers we’re getting increasing anecdotal evidence of   renewed interest in either expansion or acquisitions but still only a limited number of actual   deals  The change from the last meeting is only slight; the change from six months ago is quite   striking  Using Dave Stockton’s continuum on the psychology—ranging from skepticism to   guarded optimism—I would say that bankers are fairly far out on the optimistic side of that   continuum  Additionally, to the extent that they have surveyed their customers informally,   bankers are reporting that they detect a significantly more optimistic outlook for expansion than   had been the case in recent months  In part I think that supports Bill Poole’s comment on   September 16, 2003 69 of 106    inventories—not his remark about just-in-time inventory ordering for diapers but his observation   about the risk that businesses could miss this expansion by delaying action too long  That is a   real concern, and it may in fact be reflected in a more rapid move by businesses at some point in   the near future     On fiscal policy, you may remember that at the last two meetings it has been reported that   there is more fiscal stimulus in the pipeline at this point than at any time in the post–World War   II era, including the Reagan era  And that stimulus is about to increase significantly as the   Congress will within the next month approve the additional $87 billion defense authorization and   appropriation  That’s good news for the short run  As for the longer term, I share Governor   Gramlich’s concern because there is no indication from the Congress of any inclination to   reapply fiscal discipline to the system  I find the long-term considerations of that almost   appalling  The two data points I’ve noted suggest more optimism for an improved economy but   no indication yet of a change in pricing power or any other inflationary pressure    "
5066,2003-09-16,"  I support both parts of the recommendation  Regarding the last sentence,   I think the phrase that it is important to retain is “considerable period”  The phrase that I think is   going to get a lot of attention is “to foster the containing of ”  It will likely be the focus of   attention just because it is awkward  It would be less awkward if we dropped the participle and   just said “to contain disinflationary forces”  But to do so would be to promise more than   monetary policy can probably deliver  So on balance, I’ll accept the statement as it is  "
5123,2003-10-28,"  Well, working backward, I also would be in favor of taking our time on   this because I do think it’s important  I don’t think we have any reason to rush  I found the   Gramlich memo appealing but for a reason that I haven’t heard stated, and that is that maximum   sustainable employment and low inflation are our public policy mandate  Those of us who have   been through the confirmation process were reminded of that in our confirmation hearings  I   didn’t look at the transcripts of the recent hearings; but I suspect that, if Senator Sarbanes or   some others were there, the nominees may well have been reminded of that dual mandate  I   don’t see those objectives as requiring a benchmark of any more numeric specificity than what   we now have     I was involved in an exercise about a year ago with President Broaddus and others in   which we reviewed our strategic direction  When we talked about the monetary policy role, we   came back to that congressional mandate as the starting point  So from that perspective,   Governor Gramlich’s wording appeals to me  Also, I suspect that the Federal Reserve Act will   not change significantly over the next few years, so it seems to me that, if we have that as the   starting point, it’s also likely that we could stay with such a format  I’m also an incrementalist,   and I think we should not make a lot of changes  That’s a component of the Gramlich memo that   I find particularly appealing     Does he?   October 28, 2003 104 of 126      I guess I didn’t read it that way    "
5124,2003-10-28,"  I have a couple of comments  After two people in a row have said that   they’re going to be brief, I think I should say exactly the same thing, and I will  Over the past   week I’ve talked to a number of bankers whose comments essentially reinforced a lot of what we   have heard around the table  Two community bankers, one in the upper Midwest and one in the   Southwest, had exactly the same observation They are feeling additional competitive pressures   from the nation’s largest banks as those banks come after the small business market  That   supports the appetite for increased risks that we’ve seen around the country  I think it supports   also the notion that the slack demand for commercial loans has forced banks to reach toward   other kinds of loan opportunities  A regional lender in the Midwest had a slightly different   perspective, but it was along the same lines  He noted the difference between the response he   was getting from his front-line lenders as opposed to what he was getting from the credit   department people  The front line people felt that there was a good deal of increased activity but   October 28, 2003 67 of 126    that it had not yet translated into loans  The one exception was lending to businesses that were   exercising purchase options for currently leased facilities That, too, supports the view that a lot   of the lending is either to lock in liquidity or to restructure and improve the overall ability of   business entities to finance growth internally, which is what I think I heard Dave Stockton and   others say     In talking to some contacts in institutional and custodial service businesses, a couple of   other trends came to light  One was another reaffirmation of the shift by consumers into equities,   a trend that had been obvious but has become even more obvious within the last six weeks  But   the institutional investors were moving offshore, in many cases to emerging Asia, which is   consistent also with the story in the Greenbook in terms of expectations for growth there   Pulling together what I’ve been hearing—notably the change in risk appetites, which was   probably the most obvious—it appears that a lot of lending continues to be for balance sheet   restructuring  Much of the lending tends to be in anticipation of improvement in the underlying   economy  To the extent that there are increases in capital expenditures, they are not being   reflected in new C&I loans in the banking industry  But in comparing the feedback we were   getting with regard to inhibitions to capital investment six months ago versus now, I had the   impression that there was a significant change  Six months ago we were hearing the terms   “psychology” or “psychological,” whereas now in describing the underlying economy contacts   are using words like “confidence” or “optimistic” or perhaps “cautious”  The use of the word   “psychology” suggested that there was an irrationality to the decisions on capital spending—that   the decisions were not based on an analysis of the underlying data but were independent of the   data  We were looking at strength in consumer demand over the period, and that was not being   taken into account by the business sector  Now at least the underlying economic data are being   October 28, 2003 68 of 126    analyzed and taken into account to some degree  So while we have not yet seen the same   traction as in previous recoveries, the change in attitudes is very obvious  "
5125,2003-10-28,"  I support the recommendation   October 28, 2003 85 of 126   "
5189,2003-12-09,"  I’d like to bring up two points that largely haven’t been talked about here    The first involves fiscal policy issues  I’m sure you’ve noticed that the government is being   funded at the moment on a continuing resolution  The House yesterday passed an omnibus   budget bill that I think is totally consistent with Greenbook expectations of what that bill would   include  The Senate undoubtedly will not pass a budget bill this year  The significance of that is   that, for the Congress, the Presidential election year starts the first day following their return   after the recess  It will be interesting to see the extent to which budget issues are dealt with; I   have some concerns about it The hopeful sign from my perspective is that for the first time since   September 11, 2001, we are seeing some concern about fiscal discipline  You may have noticed   that the bill passed yesterday had almost as many Republicans voting against it as Democrats   December 9, 2003 77 of 133    voting for it  I think this country received a free pass for a period of time post–September 11,   during which it did not need to maintain the same fiscal discipline that it did for almost the entire   decade of the ’90s  I can’t help but believe that some of the concern about the dollar from   foreign investors reflects the seeming lack of concern for fiscal responsibility, particularly when   one considers that the most significant legislative accomplishment of this Congress will have   almost no budget implications until 2006  So while I don’t see anything resembling a return to   the pay-go spending restrictions in this Congress, it seems to me that at least it will be a   campaign issue for the first time since the year 2000  I hope so anyway   With respect to how the banking industry has responded in light of the improved   economic performance, you may have noticed that the third-quarter results indicated a significant   improvement in banking industry profitability  But it’s a different mix even from six months   ago  Six months ago the improved profit picture was based on fee income and securities   transactions  It is largely this time a result of improved asset quality  In fact, there was no need   for loan-loss provisioning that would indicate any weakness in asset quality  I think this supports   what Dino suggested also—that we are seeing very strong asset quality  This means two things   to me  First, the fact that we have not seen any growth yet in commercial lending means that   there is still a significant amount of firepower in the banking industry to fund a continuing   expansion  Second, to the extent that there’s a tightening in credit standards, it has nothing to do   with the availability of funds  I think those are two important points  We do not hear from   bankers the same concern now that the economy is not turning around  There is clear anecdotal   evidence that it is, but that hasn’t resulted in increased loan demand up to this point   "
5190,2003-12-09,  I support both the policy decision and the statement  
5237,2004-03-16,"  In preparation for this meeting, I focused again on business C&I loans,   and for the first time in the two-and-a-half years that I have been following that information   source, we are starting to see some measurable growth  It would be one thing simply to report   that, but it’s quite another, at least in my mind, to go back and think about how long it has taken   for us to get here  When I first began looking at these numbers, business loans were in a decline    From a decline and a sense of very negative feedback, they went to no new information and then   to early indications of some bottom fishing and options taking  After that there was some talk of   activity but no measurable activity and then some activity but it was still not showing up in the   C&I numbers  Finally it is in the C&I numbers  In addition, we have gone from a time when   banks and the securities industry were clearly cutting back on marketing and on their parameters   for loan approvals to a point where they’ve become very aggressive  So, I think in a real sense   this measure reflects not only the underlying economy but to a certain extent the psychology    And as Presidents McTeer and Moskow have indicated, there are indications that both have   picked up    So if one were to use the trend in C&I loans as a barometer, it would seem to reinforce   the Greenbook analysis of the strength in the underlying economy, with the lag in employment   growth being the anomaly  We made a significant shift in our communication six weeks ago   when we moved away from the “considerable period” language and expressed the need for   patience  It seems to me that patience is still in order in our communication at this time  "
5238,2004-03-16,"  Mr Chairman, if it is a close call as to whether or not we would bring the   inflation risks into balance—and I think it is a close call—then I have a strong preference for   changing the statement as little as possible  It seems to me that, in the past when we have made   significant changes in the statement, the market has overread their significance and has been   confused about what we were trying to communicate  The changes that have been proposed for   the statement today in my view reflect the minimal change in the outlook that has taken place in   the intermeeting seven-week period  And I think we ought to go with a statement that suggests   that the outlook has changed only minimally  So I support your recommendation  "
5292,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to discuss two data points  one a survey   of bankers and the other an update on fiscal policy  I surveyed a large money center bank, a large   regional bank, and a smaller Midwestern regional bank  I was surprised to find that they all were   less optimistic than both of our lender surveys and less optimistic than I had anticipated based on   what I was hearing from other lenders only recently   Starting at the money center bank, a point that I probably don’t need to repeat is that asset   quality across the board is bulletproof  Banks are in excellent shape, and loan quality is in excellent   shape  The money center banks are reporting that, while IPO issuance and bond issuance are   strong, supply may exceed demand given that loan demand remains light  As a matter of fact, the   focus this year has not been on the provision for loan losses, which is backward-looking, but on   capital required to support future lending, taking into consideration loan demand, credit insurance,   credit default swaps, and any other hedges for other parts of their portfolio  They are scaling back   the credit allocations that they had anticipated needing in the future  Also, in their equity funds they   are seeing an outflow in the high-yield funds, indicating what they believe is an emerging pickiness   among the investors, which I think reflects to an extent the oversupply   Another comment my contact made was that in his judgment the aggregate portfolio risk   was the lowest he had seen in several months  He attributed that to the fact that there is still not a   great deal of confidence in the resurging economy  As a matter of fact, he said that, if we were to   measure the difference in the approach to the economy of their economists and their traders, we   would find that the economists are more optimistic than the traders—although that gap is   May 4, 2004 62 of 112       narrowing, as has been the case for some time  But it’s a difference that we’ve seen before between   people whose views stem from looking at the data and those who assess the outlook based on their   feel of the activity in the marketplace   One point to be added is that the banks are not seeing growth in loan activity by the large   corporate borrower, for all the reasons we’ve talked about before—the improved cash flow, which   can increase the debt service capability; the internal financing of fixed investment; and the   restructuring of the balance sheet  But there’s going to be one very large borrower coming to the   market probably in this quarter, and the credit will be fully funded, which will make it appear as if   there is actually significant loan growth  A lot of financing in technology, such as equipment   purchases, is done by leases, which may or may not be reflected in bank lending activity, and   there’s still a lot of activity in the commercial lending sector  But, on balance, I was quite surprised   that the tone I detected among my contacts was not nearly as optimistic as that in the lenders’   surveys  Nonetheless, their comments did reflect the data that we saw in the Greenbook, especially   the flow of funds data, which were consistent with only isolated areas of improved activity   Fiscal policy is not a pretty picture, but it’s consistent with a presidential election year   scenario  We are probably not going to get any appropriations bills passed other than for defense   We’re not going to get a budget bill passed, and we’re almost certainly going to be looking at a   lame duck session following the election this fall  The good news is that, with the absence of a new   appropriations bill, spending will be limited to the appropriations levels from the previous bill    More troubling, however, are the lack of a coherent Republican strategy in the majority across the   House and the Senate and the lack of a coherent Democratic strategy across the House and the   Senate  So the debate on fiscal policy effectively focuses on whether or not the Congress will   produce a transportation bill that, as you all know, is loaded with pork and whether or not, if it is   May 4, 2004 63 of 112       passed, the President will veto it, a veto that almost certainly will not be sustained  So the news is   not good in either of the areas I’ve examined, particularly on the lenders’ side  If we’re looking for   support for an improving economy, it isn’t clear when one looks at the numbers  "
5293,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support the recommendation, and I’ve   been looking carefully at both sentence 8, which Cathy talked about, and the March FOMC   statement shown in alternative B  If I compare them word-by-word or even phrase-by-phrase, I can   see only minor differences—primarily the removal of the word “patient” and the addition of “is   likely to be measured”  But as I read the two, I think that alternative B comes across much more   strongly, and I think it’s the position of the word “remove”  We’re not talking about when at some   point in the future the policy accommodation will be removed  We’re describing the circumstances   May 4, 2004 94 of 112       or the manner in which it will be removed  Consequently, I would not be surprised—though I’ve   never been good at judging what the market response to our statements will be—if there’s a stronger   reaction than what many around the table have been suggesting  Having said that, I think the   statement is exactly accurate  And recognizing that we review these generally within a six-week   time frame, it seems to me that this is the appropriate way to describe where we are as of today  "
5342,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In preparation for today’s meeting, I surveyed a   major regional bank and two large community banks, one in the Southeast and one in the Midwest    Based on those conversations, I have both some general and some specific observations  In general,   commercial lending activity has increased, although the reason for the borrowing is more for   acquisition purposes than for capital purchases  When I probed as to why increased orders would   not have generated increased demand for capital loans, one of the reasons suggested was that, with   August 10, 2004 60 of 103          excess capacity, the incremental sales dollar goes largely to the bottom line and as a result improves   both profitability and debt service capacity  That, along with the existing liquidity of corporate   America, has meant that the demand for C&I loans hasn’t been as strong as we would see in other   environments   Demand for mortgages to purchase both new and existing housing remains strong, but one   notable change in the mortgage market is that there is a flattening of demand for home equity loans,   which I think dovetails with what President Yellen suggested  Given the ease with which   homeowners can acquire a home equity loan and the minimal cost and obligation that goes with the   acquisition, the implication is that the availability of home equity as collateral may have reached a   saturation point— particularly the increase in home equity resulting from rising valuations  The   other across-the-board change I noted is that banks apparently are cutting back on, or at least   looking much more carefully at, their commercial real estate lending     In a more specific sense, one of the more interesting anecdotes came from a banker who is   also a director of a major gasoline retailer  He said that this company had found that a price of   $180 per gallon at the pump is the point at which they see a flattening, if not a cutback, in gasoline   purchases  In their judgment, $180 is the point at which the price of gasoline triggers changes in   driving patterns  For their purposes, of course, they are looking at the elasticity of demand, so they   don’t go beyond that  For our purposes, the question might be whether or not that change would   also suggest a broader change in consumer behavior  But it was interesting that that was the cut line   they found in their analysis of same store sales  I’m starting to hear for the first time a little concern   among my banking contacts about what may be an over-extension in consumer lending  There was   heightened concern about the number of bankruptcies and just a slight indication that there might be   some softness in that market    August 10, 2004 61 of 103          Overall, I would say that banking activity does not reflect the current softness that we’ve   seen elsewhere  On the other hand, the information I’ve received over the two years that I’ve been   doing this kind of survey has often lagged the indicators we get from other sources  That would   suggest some limits in sight on the consumer side that may in turn point to the need for caution, but   it would not seem to suggest that we should alter our monetary policy direction at this point  Thank   you  "
5392,2004-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve again had some discussions with contacts   in the banking sector in preparation for this meeting, but they tend to reflect the comments that   we’ve heard around the room, particularly Governor Bernanke’s observation that the economy’s   growth is solid but less vigorous than expected  Certainly, nothing I’ve heard from those I’ve   talked with in the banking sector would be different from that   As the one member of the FOMC who has spent a lot of time as a political operative, I   couldn’t help but think about today’s meeting in the context of the fact that the upcoming   presidential election is six weeks from today  I was reflecting on the concerns that have become   issues in that contest and those that haven’t and the implications they might have for the   economy  The deficit levels and spending restraints have not become issues  We didn’t expect   that they would  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid also have not become political issues,   but I think concerns about them have been elevated during the course of the campaign, not by   either party but by interested observers—not the least of whom is our Chairman as well as Pete   Peterson and others  Just as we were talking earlier about our prospective role in discussions   about the dollar, I would suggest to members of this Committee who have concerns about deficit   spending, Medicare/Medicaid issues, and certain tax policy issues, that the time to elevate those   discussions is immediately following the point when it becomes clear who the next President   will be  I hope that will be right after the election this time!  [Laughter]   September 21, 2004 69 of 100          To the extent that James Carville’s admonition that “it’s the economy, stupid” is correct,   there seems to be minimal differentiation of the economic issues this time  The most aggressive   protectionists were given early exits from the process  We do hear talk about tax policy and   about outsourcing, but the one issue that seems to resonate is economic uncertainty  The   solution for that is not clear, which does not suggest that it isn’t a problem just because a   solution is not evident  But, importantly, monetary policy has not been a political issue  For the   three years that I’ve been either on this Committee or thinking about being on this Committee,   I’ve wondered about the extent that it would be as we moved into this time frame and came into   this meeting  The question to my mind was never whether the FOMC would allow political   pressure to interfere with its decisions on the appropriate monetary policy—I was certain it   wouldn’t—but the opposite  The question was whether the implementation of appropriate   monetary policy would become a political issue    Mind you, today’s statement will be examined very carefully for political advantage, and   attempts to gain that advantage will be made  But almost certainly there will be none, I think for   two reasons  First, the general sense of the appropriate implementation of our policy ensures our   credibility, and second, there is the clarity of our communication  Now remember, the   communication can work only if the first part is accurate  During the last several years, we have   gone from being accommodative, to being accommodative for a considerable period, to a time of   patience, to removing accommodation at a measured pace  And moving from accommodation   toward a return to neutral at a measured pace is not only the appropriate policy, but it will be, in   my view, not at all a political issue  "
5393,2004-09-21,  I support the recommendation  
5447,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will briefly continue on the same subject that   Governor Gramlich just discussed because I’d like to talk about fiscal policy issues for a moment    I’ve been encouraged even with the absence of gridlock—or at least to a certain extent the   loosening of gridlock—that the President and some of his team have focused on fiscal policy issues   such as Social Security and Medicare  I take that as a positive sign  But in terms of returning to a   budget surplus or even to budget neutral, I think it’s important to remember that the last time we   were in that area, it was primarily a revenue issue and secondarily a spending or budget discipline   issue  Now, there is nothing in our forecast for the immediate future that would suggest an   November 10, 2004 66 of 107    economy that is poised to generate tax revenue in the 20 percent plus range relative to GDP that   allowed for the surplus  But it is possible at least to reinstate some of the spending discipline by a   re-imposition of the PAYGO provisions And as Governor Gramlich is well aware, the PAYGO   provisions also apply to tax cuts  I think the reinstatement of that policy would do two things    First, it would impose some discipline on the appropriation process  One cannot be involved in the   appropriations process when PAYGO is in effect without being alert to it  Second, it would be a   signal of a return to fiscal discipline and to fiscal management policies, which I think could be   important   So as the Chairman and others indicated at the beginning of the meeting, we should be   out there talking about the need for fiscal discipline  The Chairman a few months ago spoke on the   importance of reinstating the PAYGO provisions, and I would encourage others to consider that as   you speak to the issue of fiscal policy   With respect to monetary policy, when we began to move from accommodative toward   neutral, we recognized that there were a number of risks associated with it, one of which as you   may recall was a concern that rising rates might shut off any improvement in the underlying   economy  Also, I think we were a bit gun-shy, given the succession of exogenous factors—  terrorism, governance issues, and the like—that had derailed the economy previously  As Dino   reminded us earlier and as the charts show, longer-term interest rates have actually declined,   particularly the ten-year Treasury yields  So a derailment has not happened  And even the parade   of hurricanes and the rising oil prices have not significantly deterred this slow but steady recovery   in the economy  I think the jobs numbers will be adjusted marginally, with the unconditional firing   of everybody involved in exit-polling a few weeks ago!  [Laughter]  But even with that, it seems to   me that the markets clearly anticipate a continued reduction in the degree of monetary policy   accommodation and a return to neutral, and I think we ought to be sticking with that course  "
5448,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support both parts of the recommendation    With respect to the statement, I also think it is appropriate at this time to make as little change in   the statement as is necessary, for a couple of reasons  First of all, the markets understand that the   absence of change is not a result of inattention; they know it is the net result of a great deal of   thought and consideration  So any change whatsoever is interpreted, and occasionally over-  interpreted, and I don’t think we are at the point yet where we need to open that possibility   With respect to communication in the future, I’m with Governor Bernanke  I don’t think   we can go back to communicating in the fashion that we were doing even a year ago  I think we   have set an expectation that we will make a real effort to communicate some of our underlying   sense of what’s happening with the economy, and I think we will be called on to continue that   trend  "
5506,2004-12-14,"  I have two comments  First of all, I see the decision as, on average, a four-  week acceleration of the release of the minutes, and therefore I think there are two considerations    One is, Is there a logistical problem with early release?  Having had Vincent track me down when   I’ve been away from the office at times, I realize that there is a burden in meeting the publication   deadline  But from what I’m hearing, that is not an insurmountable problem  The second is, Will   there be any significant changes in the minutes as a result of that acceleration?  We won’t really   know the answer to that until we get into it, and I think I’d support Don’s evaluation that it probably   is a manageable issue  Also, of course, the first time that we release the minutes early it will be an   early release  From there on, it will be a scheduled release So I think we will get the early release   only once  [Laughter]     Finally, I don’t see this decision and the language in the statement as a package  I think on   balance the market would tend to see a less forward-looking statement as a net reduction in our   communication, and I think we would have to reverse that policy  That gets back to a point that Bill   December 14, 2004 94 of 118           made earlier, which is that we can’t retreat  I’m an incrementalist because we can never go back  I   think our communication policies will continue to evolve  There is no end game  There is no   destination  We ought to make this move but do it in complete isolation and not have any other   corresponding moves along with it  "
5507,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There are two perspectives that I’d like to add,   one from the banking community and the other a follow-up on the fiscal issue  If I were to compare   the discussions I’ve had with bankers on what they see in the economy to the comments that I’ve   heard around the room, I’d say there is a notable difference  People around the room have described   the economy in terms ranging from “decidedly positive” on the upside to “reasonable” on the   downside, whereas the bankers I’ve talked would come down more on the side of “reasonable” than   “decidedly positive”  If there is a significant expansion taking place in the business sector, it’s   happening outside the banking industry in terms of their C&I lending  C&I lending is growing, but   December 14, 2004 56 of 118           there’s a strong sense that it reflects a greater appetite for risk-taking in the lending portfolio as   opposed to an expansion of business   As others of you have suggested, a lot of the demand for business lending has come from   the smaller entities  Larger entities that have the option of either expanding here or offshore are as   apt as not to expand offshore  The entities that do not have that option, of course, are expanding   through borrowing at domestic banks  US banks also have taken on more M&A lending—which   more typically had been the purview of the capital markets—as a result of the relatively low   demand they’ve found for typical C&I loans  There are a couple of exceptions to that  Of course,   the most notable exception is in commercial real estate  And yet, in condominium development in   particular, several bankers have reported that the growth in volume of new condo starts is absolutely   unsustainable  Moreover, the end of the cycle is typically when you see conversions of apartments,   and that is rampant, particularly in some markets—to the point where there almost assuredly needs   to be an adjustment in the near future  All that said, however, there still is nothing in that   observation that would suggest that we should alter our pace of removing monetary policy   accommodation  We should continue moving at the same pace that we have been   With respect to Washington, DC, and the willingness to take on some fiscal discipline,   there are two points that would suggest a somewhat more positive outlook in that regard  The first   is the reaffirmation of John Snow as Treasury Secretary  A presidential election, especially the re-  election of a President, is an opportunity for wholesale change, and indeed, that has occurred  The   fact that John Snow stayed on even after he was hung out to dry for a while suggests that this White   House did not seek the great at the expense of the good  It also suggests that there is an effort to   move relatively quickly on the agenda that flows through the Department of the Treasury, and that   agenda certainly includes tax reform  Governor Gramlich expressed concern at the last meeting that   December 14, 2004 57 of 118           tax reform may be, in fact, explicitly tax reduction; that has not yet been fully fleshed out, but   nonetheless the team is in place to move forward  The President is also discussing, at least in part,   alternatives on Social Security, which suggests a greater willingness to attack that one fundamental   issue that really needs to be addressed   The second point that I think is positive has to do with the intelligence reform legislation   that was passed last week  Now, one wouldn’t ordinarily think that there would be a correlation   between intelligence reform and fiscal responsibility  However, the passage of that legislation did   send an important signal, and that is that a Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a   Republican White House are willing to work together  Two weeks ago that was not clear  The   impediments to enacting that legislation came from within the Republican ranks, and many people   in Washington see the fact that the Congress moved very quickly to pass the bill as a suggestion   that, indeed, the Republicans may work as a team at taking direction from the White House  That,   taken along with the fact that certain of the fiscal responsibility issues such as tax reform, Social   Security, and Medicare are considered a priority, I think bodes well  Thank you  "
5508,2004-12-14,  I support the recommendation  
5561,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my comments I want to follow up on President   Guynn’s and President Lacker’s observations about speculative housing investment  We have heard                          March 22, 2005 70 of 116  increasing anecdotal evidence and concern about this issue, and I think the characterization in   yesterday’s Wall Street Journal that day trading is now occurring in residential housing markets is a   further indication of the concern Of course, the extent to which the speculative purchases make a   difference is reflected not only in the possibility of its impacting the pace of the growth in housing   values but also the pricing of risk, as Jack suggested But I think the question has been whether or   not the size of the market was significant enough to have an impact  Clearly, the trend was eye-  catching, but was the market significant enough to make a significant difference?   Data collected recently and provided by our economists indicate that non-owner-occupied   mortgages constitute 5½ percent of the total outstanding and have fluctuated around 7 percent of   new originations With respect to second homes, the numbers were about 28 percent of total   mortgage loans and 3 percent of new originations  However, this week, the National Association of   Realtors revised significantly their sense of the size of the market, based on surveys they had made   and also on information from the 2003 Census Bureau report  They indicated that, in their view, 23   percent of all home purchases in 2004 were for investment and an additional 13 percent were for   vacation homes  The difference was that through their surveys they have been able to isolate the   investment purchaser of single-family homes as distinct from the purchaser of a second home  The   implications of that are significant, and the size of the market is much larger than they had   perceived Also, those numbers would suggest that many of those buyers have made multiple   purchases of single-family homes, which brings in another element of risk—the risk associated with   the debt service capability they need to maintain those purchases in the event of a downturn    I think it’s appropriate that we are going to be looking at the issue of real estate bubbles and   the speculative component of that market at our meeting in June  There are a number of indications   that mortgage lenders are tightening up  Both PMI and MGIC indicated recently that they have                                                                  March 22, 2005 71 of 116  tightened their loan requirements for interest-only loans and for those with low down payments    And we have seen the criteria for loans being tightened in other places also   With respect to our policy decision today, I think the question is not so much what we should   do but how we explain why we are doing it As Governor Ferguson did, let me take you back 18   months, when we began using the phrase “for a considerable period”  Notwithstanding the impact   on implied volatility, also implicit in the statement “for a considerable period” was that there needed   to be an exit strategy And the exit strategy—or transition, if you will—went from “considerable   period” to “patient” to “measured pace”  I don’t think today is the time to change “measured pace,”   but it’s time to think about an exit strategy from it  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also agree with the ¼ point increase, and I know   there’s a lot of anticipation looking forward to the May meeting  I look forward to it now with some   trepidation [Laughter] I am fearful that creativity may be epidemic by the time we get there  While   I was not here in 1994, I was here in 2003, when we made significant changes in our statement in   successive meetings, and that significantly confused the marketplace  I would think that our   experience has taught us that there is value in taking incremental steps in terms of how we   communicate, particularly as Bill Poole has suggested, when the economy is moving in a manner   that is significantly predictable So, I would encourage us to keep that history in mind when we   think about the changes that we might make in May  "
5609,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In preparation for this meeting, I talked with   contacts at two large banks As all of us are aware, bank asset quality throughout all of 2003 and   2004 continually improved to the point where by the end of last year almost all bankers said in their   year-end reports that asset quality cannot get better; it has to get worse Thus far, the   announcements that have been made in the first quarter indicate that asset quality did get better  But   I suspect that some of the bankers are looking at the debt spread information and are asking   themselves the same question that Dino posed rhetorically  Is there something behind the data that   we need to know?  And both bankers that I talked to independently believed—because they’re in an   environment of intense pressure on prices and underwriting standards and in a situation with   significant liquidity—that the marginal credits may, in fact, be rewritten  They are circulating, so we   have a slight game of musical chairs going on with marginal credits  So, with bank asset quality, we   do not yet see the decline as we do with some of the debt spreads, but it may be lurking out there                                        May 3, 2005 65 of 116  That said, it is not significant because, with the very strong performance of corporate America in   recent years, there is still very little in the way of troubled assets out there, particularly in C&I loans   With respect to today’s meeting, as I read the Bluebook and the Greenbook information, I   was struck by the significant contrast with the last meeting  I was prepared to speak to that in a   substantive way until both David and Karen summarized in about three sentences what I would have   said in many more  So I don’t need to go in that direction   But what I was not prepared to speak to until I came in to today’s meeting was the fact that   when I compare the Beige Book reports and the comments of the Reserve Bank Presidents, there is   not nearly the wide variance that I noted in the Bluebook or the Greenbook Now, if the information   that we gather in Washington is cumulative data that we were able to pick up, albeit with a lag, and   we supplement that with the more contemporaneous data that we get from the Presidents, it seems to   me that there ought to be a lesson there  At least we ought to focus on it In the three-and-a-half   years that I have been on this Committee, I don’t remember the information always being identical,   but I never remember the Beige Book information lagging the Greenbook data  So I suspect that we   may be closer to a pothole or perhaps even the head fake that the entire Chicago Bulls went for last   night when Juan Dixon went up for his jump shot, which he made consistently    It has been 17 years, Michael It has been a long time     I’m inclined to support those of you who have already spoken to the strength of the   underlying fundamentals and who believe the output gap is continuing to close slightly  I think we   clearly communicated in the last meeting—and the market interpreted it correctly—our heightened   concern about the level of inflation With respect to the likely direction of the underlying economy,                                 May 3, 2005 66 of 116  I think the information is sufficiently contradictory or unclear that it is difficult to make a positive   statement    However, we may choose to do as Susan and Roger and I did in our announcement with   respect to the Basel II QIS4 [Quantitative Impact Study] information  Some of you may know that   as we were looking at the QIS4 data, which involved the study of the impact of the new Basel II   Accord on the banks, we decided that either the information reflected a wider disparity of risk   exposure or that there were some additional fundamental inconsistencies in the underlying data that   would require us to postpone the release of our notice of proposed rulemaking  So we did that   That we simply postpone, actually, would be my first choice for today  [Laughter] Since   that is not really being an appropriate option for us, I would suggest that we not significantly revise   the manner in which we have communicated our views regarding the removal of policy   accommodation until we get a clearer sense of what the underlying data are telling us  "
5610,2005-05-03," Let me point out that it isn’t how they do but how they communicate what   they do [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I will support the ¼ point increase in   the funds rate and the language of alternative B As I read through alternative B, I think it   communicates what we want to communicate  It says that the pace of spending growth has slowed   and it repeats our concern about inflation I will have to say that as I get down to paragraphs 5 and   6, I am also of the opinion that they are starting to get a little shopworn and that we do need to think   through how we want to communicate our assessment of risk   Having said that, I think my views are in a significant way impacted by my recollection of   the summer of 2003 where, in the course of three meetings, we had three different vehicles of   communication, or variations of communication, and by the third one we had confused the markets   And this was after what I thought was the most specifically clear articulation of our policy  That   reminds me again that we ought to be very deliberate in terms of how we change our   communication   I think we’ve done the markets a great favor by accelerating the release of the minutes  That   earlier release of the minutes now allows us to go back and look again at the type of statement we   release immediately after the meeting  And I would suggest that we look at this issue in that context;   it may allow us to alter the method by which we communicate on the day of the meeting  "
5655,2005-08-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman  August of the off-election year is a time when   we can take stock of how the Congress has responded to certain issues  As we began this year   hopeful that Congress would address some issues that had important fiscal policy implications, I   think now is an appropriate time to review to see what impact Congress’s actions will have and   the implications for our deliberations   That sense of timing was heightened in recent weeks when we got a mix of very positive   and very negative news The positive news was the 14 percent increase in receipts that the   federal government has experienced thus far this year combined with the increase in payments of   slightly under 7 percent That has had the net effect of reducing the expected 2005 deficit by   $100 billion Those trends are expected to continue going forward and the deficit projections for                                August 9, 2005 64 of 110  subsequent years have also been reduced  That sequence and the provisions of it were very well   documented in the Greenbook and particularly in Part 2 of the Greenbook    On the other hand, just before Congress left town they passed a transportation bill that   was loaded with pork, and it also contained numerous gimmicks—there’s no other way to say   it—that allowed them to ignore their own budgetary guidelines  And that passed with only eight   dissenting votes in the House, which was very discouraging to anybody who is expecting to see   some fiscal austerity   Unlike most of you, I’ve spent most of my public life involved with fiscal issues as   opposed to monetary issues So it’s somewhat disappointing to me that my arrival on the Board   coincided with the departure of fiscal discipline at the Congress  [Laughter]   As the year started, there were a number of issues on which there seemed to be a sense of   resolve that they would be addressed  In particular, Social Security was high on the agenda for   this Administration  There was a recognition that Medicare and Medicaid issues were of   growing concern and certainly more problematic  There was a desire to achieve some   fundamental changes in income tax policy, and there were some other unresolved issues relating   to either taxes or funding, particularly pension reform  The President began by announcing that   he was going to—I believe he said “spend” but I think he meant “apply”—some of his political   capital to the Social Security issue  Initially there was a very strong push on that but as of now—   at the August recess—there seems little likelihood of action this year or perhaps even by this   Congress The hope is, if there’s anything with respect to Social Security, that the Chairman of   the Ways and Means Committee could package it in some way with other policy issues that have   some momentum  So they might be able to move it as a package, but separately and   independently it seems unlikely that the Social Security changes will go anywhere                          August 9, 2005 65 of 110  With respect to tax policy, the President did appoint an advisory committee on tax reform   that has been meeting  I know our Chairman spoke to that group, as have others, and that   committee is expecting to produce a report by September 30  Even though the report deadline   seems to be in place still, the substance of what they are going to produce is not yet fully in   place However, the public statements by several of the members have indicated some of the   issues that will be included  Three in particular will be fairly thoroughly vetted  One would   involve a revision of the existing income tax code, highlighting the necessity of dealing in   particular with the alternative minimum tax  Currently the alternative minimum tax hits about 4   percent of taxpayers; within five years, it will be up to 20 percent of taxpayers  The cost of a   repeal of the alternative minimum tax could be anywhere from $600 billion to $12 trillion over   the next decade  So for each year that addressing it gets postponed, the cost gets much higher    That certainly will be considered  A value-added tax also will be given some consideration, as   will some sort of a consumption tax     What will not be produced is a report that is in the form of legislation  I’m told by some   that the report will be neither a legislative proposal nor a textbook  It will be a report that   discusses tax options that hopefully will keep the burden relatively neutral with respect to where   it is at this point  Because it will not be in the form of legislation, it will not become an active   legislative issue any earlier than the spring, and maybe late spring, of 2006  Therefore, it’s   unlikely to be considered any time within the next Congress  Among other issues that are still   outstanding, of course, are some other tax issues and the absence of funding of the Pension   Benefit Guaranty Corporation   In summary, the long and short in my view is that we will not see relief on the fiscal side    In terms of the implications for our monetary policy deliberations, the implications of that were                      August 9, 2005 66 of 110  less severe, I think, during the time when the economy was soft  The deficit spending, in fact,   was stimulative at a time when stimulus was welcome  As we get closer to equilibrium, it seems   to me that that changes     So, it seems to me that at the very least we will be proceeding with an absence of fiscal   discipline  What that will mean, among other things, is that it will add pressure, I would think, to   the external funding of our current account deficit  And it will certainly raise questions as to the   willingness and the appetite of the US Congress and the US people for maintaining a stable   economy and a stable currency  Thank you  "
5656,2005-08-09," I support both the new target level and the language in alternative B  On   paragraph 3, I did not try to compare it word for word with the previous characterizations, but   my sense is that this is a significant change from the pattern we’ve used in that paragraph, and I   think it’s appropriate  "
5697,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Dave Stockton’s introduction today suggested   that this Greenbook analysis was a combination of the use of judgment and models  And as I   reviewed the input, I noted it reflects that combination   To wit, the Greenbook said that Katrina will restrain economic activity for the remainder   of the year Information is scant and fractured We are in uncharted territory, with devastation   of an entire city Katrina is expected to depress real GDP by about ¾ percentage point in the   third quarter, half of the effect due to reduced energy sector output  In the fourth quarter, a small   positive real GDP growth is expected, but consumption will remain depressed  By the end of   2007, the level of GDP is expected to be back where it would have been prior to the hurricane    Not included in the Greenbook, but a judgment that seems obvious at this point, is that there is an   immeasurable but hard to ignore fact that the economy is only now recovering from a corporate   wariness toward expansion, suggesting that the psychological impact of Katrina is potentially   problematic   Turning to the inflation outlook, consumer energy prices are expected to increase   considerably in the third and fourth quarters and then fall back in subsequent years  Our current   projection for the pass-through effect contributes 02 to core PCE prices in 2006, with little effect   in 2007 The fiscal stimulus expected to follow Katrina will impact the economy primarily in the   years 2006 and 2007 I would say that, as time passes, hopefully the need for an appropriate   congressional response to Katrina will be balanced by the need for fiscal discipline, as suggested   by several of you                      September 20, 2005 82 of 117  With respect to the monetary policy path, the September Greenbook was unchanged from   the August Greenbook; the expectation is for a 4 percent fed funds target by year-end and a 4¼   percent rate by mid-2006  In one of the alternative scenarios in the Greenbook—characterized   by deteriorating inflation expectations created largely by surging energy costs—core PCE will   not stabilize at 2 percent by 2007 but instead rise to 2½ percent in that year  A Taylor rule   construct of monetary policy response would bring the fed funds target at that point to 4¾   percent   In summary, the economy has taken a body blow as a result of Katrina  The solid growth   that we had been experiencing has been interrupted, but the economy is expected to get back on   track during 2006 The speed of the recovery is unknowable at this point, as the devastation to   New Orleans has put us in uncharted territory, as we said earlier  It is important, as many of you   have pointed out, to note that the pass-through effects of higher energy costs require that we   maintain and perhaps increase our sensitivity to inflationary pressures  The effects of Katrina   and the concerns about the potential for Hurricane Rita, as amplified by yesterday’s movement in   the WTI spot price, suggest that we not take this week’s measure of inflationary expectations or   headline inflation as an indication of how core inflation may be impacted in future months   Ten consecutive ¼ point increases have brought the target fed funds rate into a range   where it can reach both the expected level for year-end as well as that for the middle of next year   without a need to continue our unbroken pace of rate increases  And a pause would   accommodate the alternative scenario of deteriorating inflationary expectations  As it will be   weeks, perhaps months, before we can fully assess the economic implications of the devastation                         September 20, 2005 83 of 117  caused by Katrina, I think it may be appropriate to pause or defer removing accommodation at   this meeting  "
5698,2005-09-20," Mr Chairman, I continue to support alternative A  I would emphasize,   however, in any description of it that it is a vote for leaving the funds rate unchanged as opposed   to a pause Indeed, that is what the wording would say—that we deferred further policy firming                   September 20, 2005 101 of 117  in light of the uncertainties surrounding Hurricane Katrina  I recognize that that’s very much a   minority view  "
5743,2005-11-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In preparation for today’s meeting, I surveyed the   CEOs of three large regional banks in the Southeast, the head of the Bankers’ Bank in Texas, and a   banker in Biloxi, Mississippi, hoping primarily to get an idea of the rate of recovery, although to a   certain extent to get a reading on the amount of devastation from the storm  The way to look at it, I   think, is to do it in bands going out from the point of the storm where the greatest damage occurred     The banker in Biloxi reminded me—maybe informed me—that although most of the publicity   was about New Orleans, the damage to the Mississippi Gulf Coast may have been at least as bad  I   see President Guynn nodding in the affirmative to that  From the beach to 600 yards in, everything                                         November 1, 2005 69 of 114  is gone from the Alabama coast to the Louisiana border  They are experiencing at the moment 24   percent unemployment and labor shortages, simultaneously, due to the fact that people can’t stay in   the area when they have lost their houses in addition to their jobs  In his judgment, 25 percent of his   customers have left the area  So some restaurants there are on reduced hours because they do not   have the labor to keep them open  It is this banker’s expectation that it will be five years before the   city of Biloxi recovers and that it will recover only because of a change the legislature has granted,   allowing the gaming industry to move their operations from offshore barges to on land  There’s   going to be a significant transition in the mix as a result of that  It is the gaming industry, and more   broadly the service industry, on which the recovery will be based     If you go from that immediate band out one more, to the areas not quite as heavily impacted   by the storm, you get a completely different picture  In the estimation of one bank with a significant   Alabama presence and a significant Southeast presence, it was about three weeks between the time   the storm hit until the banking activity—consumer and commercial loans—was pretty much back to   normal  The remarkable fact, which they hadn’t expected because it was completely different from   other hurricane experiences, is that the number of checking accounts—two different banks gave this   information—has doubled  This activity has doubled   Compare that to the Biloxi area where, over the years, hurricanes have generally been good   for banking, because what the banks do during the recovery process is recycle or, if you will,   intermediate, insurance checks  That is now happening more broadly throughout the region, but it   also suggests that a very significant realignment or redistribution of population is taking place   throughout that area   Similar to the experience that President Fisher noted, housing units as far away as Atlanta are   filling up, as they are certainly in Houston and in other areas  Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has doubled                                                November 1, 2005 70 of 114  in size; and it appears, based on the apartment rentals and home purchases, that that is at least semi­  permanent  More broadly, skilled workers throughout the Southeast are flocking into the storm-  impacted areas, the attraction being the difference in wage rates they can receive  A side   implication of that is that construction projects in other parts of the Southeast have been delayed or   in some cases postponed, both because of the unavailability of labor and also the increase in prices   of building supplies   Pulling it all together, the information I’ve received fairly well corroborates the Greenbook in   terms of the impact of the storm—namely, that outside of the most heavily impacted area, economic   activity proceeded largely unabated  And it suggests that we are clearly seeing evidence of price   pressures, both in wages and in building materials That being the case, it does seem that a 25 basis   point increase in the funds rate at today’s meeting would be appropriate, describing the rationale for   doing it in the language of alternative B  But I strongly support President Yellen’s suggestion that   we look at how we communicate what we do  Six or eight months ago, when I thought about   approaching the point where we were close to a position we would define as equilibrium, I was   comfortable that we’d have a clear sense at that time as to where we were going and what I could be   looking for But I don’t  And I don’t know if that’s consistent with just where we are in the cycle,   so the decisions are tougher, or if it’s because we are getting some mixed signals at this point when   we are close to a transition   I have heard this morning a very strong indication of the need to guard against inflation and to   identify inflationary pressures  I’ve also heard a very good explanation for the fact that long-term   inflationary expectations in particular, as Governor Kohn suggested, are well contained  But I think   we are at the confluence of a number of events, one of which is that we are clearly reaching the   point where our policy will cease to be accommodative  Second, we are clearly reaching the point                                     November 1, 2005 71 of 114  where the wording of the statement has outlived its usefulness  And third, we are approaching a   transition in leadership  And I think all of us are aware that while there perhaps have been   weaknesses in our communication, and maybe even in our analysis, there has been enormous   confidence in our leadership   In my experience, the only time that this body has significantly confused the market is when   we have tried to make a change both in our position and our communication simultaneously  If we   add in a transition in leadership, I would hope that if there is any miscommunication it would attach   to the communication, not to the transition  So in my view, December will not be too early to think   about the confluence of all of those events  But for today, I certainly support the 25 basis point   increase and the definition of it in alternative B  Thank you  "
5744,2005-11-01," I support the recommendation, Mr Chairman  With respect to the language,   what I think I’m supporting is the process by which we will be looking at what changes would be   appropriate  But I certainly agree that the next meeting is the appropriate time to look at it and that   in order to do that we need some intermediate communication about the options  "
5788,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  At each of our last eleven or twelve meetings there   has been a presumption in the analysis for several more moves of tightening  And while I agree that a   ¼ point increase in the funds rate is appropriate for today, I no longer find in our analysis a   presumption of multiple moves to raise it further   From Q4 to Q4, the rise in core PCE prices is estimated to be 18 percent in ’05, up to 21   percent in ’06, and back to 18 percent in ’07  Now, the alternative scenarios for core PCE include a   single option heavily driven by a presumed greater impact of rising energy prices on core inflation    And as I indicated to President Yellen, I’m interested in going back and rereading that analysis  The   Greenbook forecast is for the fed funds target to rise to 4½ percent and be maintained at that level  I   just looked at the chart in exhibit 1 that was handed out at the break and compared it to the chart that   was in the Bluebook, and the market seems to be even more sure that we will overshoot and then   retreat with respect to the fed funds rate   I share President Stern’s analysis with respect to the equilibrium real rate and the extent to   which our fed funds level relates to the range of values under the commonly used Taylor rules  I                                 December 13, 2005 59 of 100  think there’s a legitimate concern about the effect a premature pause would have on inflationary   expectations, and I take that very seriously  But, again, I do not see yet in our analysis where that   needs to drive our concern  Therefore, unlike in previous meetings, where there was a presumption of   multiple increases, I think that perhaps after today we would need to look for a justification for such   increases Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5789,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I support the ¼ point increase  We   have passed over fairly quickly, except for a couple of instances, the impact of removing the   “accommodative” language, which I think is very significant  And I am reminded, based on past   experience, that when we make multiple changes in our statement, there is a greater likelihood that the   market will respond in ways that we hadn’t intended   On the decision of whether to include or exclude the word “measured” from the language,   initially I was ambivalent  But after hearing the discussion, I wanted to make sure that if we removed   it, we also had language that took off the table the possibility of a 50 basis point move  So I was   intrigued by Brian’s suggestion of—I don’t know what to call it—a gentle jettisoning of the term, and   I think on balance I am in favor of keeping it  So I am supporting both the ¼ point move and   alternative B as written                                  December 13, 2005 84 of 100 "
5834,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The surprise of the fourth-quarter GDP number   and the slightly elevated inflationary pressure have caused us to take, I think, a closer look at the   underlying strength of the economy  And to an extent it is reassuring—certainly, the strength in   industrial production and real personal consumption  However, the risks that we have seen before   remain and may, in fact, be slightly elevated  The potential risk of increased oil costs and the pass-  through effect into underlying core inflation is at least slightly heightened, and with the flattening of   housing values, the potential effect on consumption remains slightly strong   It is often easy for us at these meetings to say we’ll have a clearer understanding at the next   meeting of where we are; but although the next meeting answers this meeting’s questions, it also   raises new questions  However, in this instance, we may have more reason than not to make that   January 31, 2006 57 of 106    point  The January jobs number will be out on Friday  If the initial claims number has any   predictive power, we may see a strong report  I couldn’t help but notice the juxtaposition of the   initial claims chart next to the GDP number as an indication that it’s one that will be looked at   carefully  Also, given the magnitude of the change in the prior-period GDP, the revised GDP   number for the fourth quarter may be much different from the preliminary number  Also, between   now and the next meeting, our new Chairman will be making a semiannual presentation to the   Congress on the state of the economy, with an opportunity to be more definitive than we can   perhaps be at this meeting   In conclusion, I suggest that we make the obvious move and raise our target ¼ point but not   be any more definitive or predictive than necessary in the accompanying statement  I support   President Yellen’s suggestion for flexibility in our description today  And I share with everybody   else the honor of having worked with you for these four years that I’ve been here  "
5835,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both the ¼ point increase and the   statement  I remind my colleagues that in the last two meetings we will have now removed the   terms “accommodative” and “measured,” and in combination, that’s a very significant move   forward  We have left ourselves at the point where I think we want to be, with the flexibility   moving forward to respond to the data as they come in  "
