      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative A  And given   the significant downgrade to the outlook for output and unemployment, and the heightened risks   to the recovery, I think an additional accommodation is needed for the very reasons that you said    In this regard, I, too, very much appreciate the very helpful staff memos on possible policy   actions for providing additional monetary accommodation  In following Governor Tarullo, I   have been changing my comments very much in real time, so let’s see if I’ve kept up with   everything  I support incorporating the more explicit forward-looking policy guidance as you   suggested  This step is a small one  It may help markets better understand our policy framework   and our intentions, and it may reduce uncertainty  But as Brian pointed out earlier, if you look in   the modal forecast, markets don’t expect us to raise rates until sometime in 2014, I think  And of   course, this is a conditional commitment, as the proposed language makes clear  But I don’t   think that’s actually enough  Based on what’s going on in the economy and the forecast for   inflation, I think we do need to go further, and I support extending the maturity of our Treasury   holdings as described in paragraph 4 of alternative A  Research by my colleague Eric Swanson   on Operation Twist shows that that policy indeed did reduce longer-term interest rates  His   findings are completely consistent with the research that was done on the effects of the first stage   August 9, 2011 114 of 162              of the LSAP program in the current episode  So I think that it’s a small step  I know it’s not a   panacea, but I do think it’s a step that would help, and it would have relatively small downside   risks  I also think we should be thinking about all the other options, and I agree with the idea of   a two-day meeting in September  I think one option that I am also in favor of is lowering the   target fed funds rate and IOER to zero, but I know that’s an issue that’s more complex  We’ll   have a good discussion of that at the next meeting  I also prefer, by the way, when I said   alternative A, the language regarding the downside that I think President Evans also   mentioned—“Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook have increased”—which was in   paragraph 2  I think that’s actually an important piece of the language that’s missing in   alternative B
