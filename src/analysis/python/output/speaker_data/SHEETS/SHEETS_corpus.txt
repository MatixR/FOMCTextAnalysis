  Your first international exhibit focuses on the dollar  As   indicated by the red line in the top-left panel, despite widening US external  imbalances, the dollar rose strongly against the major currencies through much of  2005  As seen on the top right, against the euro and the yen, the dollar has recorded  net gains of more than 10 percent over the past year, even after tailing off some  during the last two months  The dollar’s rise against these currencies occurred as  interest rate differentials (shown on the bottom left) moved strongly in favor of dollar  assets, and market commentary has pointed to this as a key factor supporting the  dollar  Against the Canadian dollar, however, the greenback has moved down since  mid-2005, and—as displayed on the bottom right—the dollar has also fallen against  an array of emerging-market currencies, as market confidence in these countries has  climbed  On balance, the broad nominal dollar has strengthened about 1¾ percent  over the past year      As shown in the top panels of exhibit 10, the dollar’s resilience last year came in   the context of a shift in the composition of reported US financial inflows, away from  official financing and toward private financing  In 2005, foreign official inflows (line  1 on the left) were down sharply from their 2004 pace  A plunge in official inflows  from the G-10 countries (line 2) led this decline, as the Japanese authorities ceased  intervening in foreign exchange markets  In contrast, inflows from emerging Asia  (line 3) continued to move up, reflecting massive reserve accumulation by China     Purchases of US securities by private foreigners (the top right panel) surged last   year to more than $700 billion  All major categories of instruments saw increased  foreign purchases, with particularly large gains in Treasury securities (line 2) and  corporate bonds (line 4)     The positive sentiment toward the emerging market economies, which was seen in   foreign exchange markets, has also been manifest in global debt markets  As shown  on the bottom left, the EMBI+ spread—which had hovered above the US double-B  corporate spread in recent years—cut below the double-B spread in mid-2005 and has  now sunk to historical lows of just above 200 basis points  These favorable  conditions, however, have not triggered a rise in external borrowing  As shown on  the bottom right, net issuance of international debt securities by the emerging Asian  economies has remained stable over the last year or two, and the Latin American  countries have been paying down debt on net  Moreover, a sizable fraction of these  economies continue to run current account surpluses     Your next exhibit focuses on the outlook for activity abroad, which in our view is   quite favorable  As shown in line 1 of the top left panel, we estimate that total  foreign growth in the second half of last year climbed to 41 percent, as growth in the  emerging market economies (line 6) exceeded 6 percent  Going forward, we expect  the foreign economies on average to expand at a strong pace of 3½ percent  Recent   January 31, 2006 22 of 106    data have pointed to renewed signs of life in the euro-area economy (line 3),  particularly in Germany, as strengthening in the export sector appears to have jump- started investment  We expect this impetus eventually to feed through to increased  employment and consumer spending  Accordingly, we have marked up our forecast  for the euro area and now expect growth there to remain near the 2 percent pace  posted in the second half of 2005  Our forecast for Japan (line 4) calls for the  expansion to broaden and for growth to remain above our estimate of potential  As  shown in the middle left panel, over the past decade, Japanese corporations have  dramatically reduced their debt burdens (the blue line)  As balance sheets have  strengthened, business investment (the black line) has risen and labor market  conditions (the red line) have improved  More recently, as shown on the right, urban  land prices—after many years of sharp contraction—appear to have stopped falling,  and bank credit seems to be following a similar pattern  These developments suggest  that conditions in the Japanese financial sector may finally be normalizing     The bottom panels focus on China  Over the intermeeting period, the Chinese   authorities reported that GDP in 2004 was $280 billion (or 17 percent) larger than  they had previously realized  Given these revisions, China’s GDP last year now  appears to have exceeded that of France and the United Kingdom, making China the  world’s fourth-largest economy  Other recent data indicate that China’s trade surplus  (displayed on the right) jumped to $100 billion in 2005, as import growth declined  sharply  Returning to the top left panel, this deceleration in imports did not reflect a  slowing in the overall pace of Chinese activity last year, as GDP growth (line 8)  remained near 10 percent  We see growth there notching down to around 7¾ percent  in 2006, as the authorities are expected to implement administrative measures to  restrain investment      As displayed in the top right panel, average foreign inflation is projected to   remain well contained, cycling near 2½ percent through the forecast period  Inflation  rates in the foreign industrial countries are seen to step down in mid-2006, as the run- up in oil prices plays through      For the emerging market economies, oil price increases typically pass through   into consumer prices more slowly, as a number of these countries have price controls  or subsidies in place that temporarily cushion the upward pressure on prices  As  such, the rise in oil prices should continue to push up consumer price inflation  through the next few quarters, but these pressures should abate in 2007      The top panels of exhibit 12 focus on trade prices  As shown on the left, the spot   price of West Texas intermediate (the black line) has surged about $20 per barrel over  the past year and now trades above $65 per barrel  Oil prices have been driven up  both by strong global demand and by concerns about the reliability and adequacy of  global supplies  Recent developments in Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria have further  intensified these concerns  Tracking futures markets, our forecast calls for the price  of WTI to remain elevated through the end of 2007  Nonfuel commodity prices (the  red line) have also risen sharply over the past year, as metals prices have surged in   January 31, 2006 23 of 106    response to strong global demand  In sync with futures markets, our forecast calls for  commodity prices to flatten out near current levels, as supply responses help cap  further price rises       The center panel displays our projection for the broad real dollar  After rising   somewhat on balance last year, the dollar is projected to depreciate slightly, at an  annual rate of about 1⅓ percent, through the forecast period  We see the expanding  current account deficit and associated financing concerns—as well as monetary  tightening by some foreign central banks—as likely to be sources of downward  pressure on the dollar      Core import prices (the right panel) spiked in the fourth quarter, driven largely by   a surge in natural gas prices following the hurricanes  Given that natural gas prices  have already retreated, the run-up in core import price inflation should quickly  unwind  Smoothing through these fluctuations, we see core import price inflation  moving down to around 1 percent by early next year, consistent with flat commodity  prices and only modest dollar depreciation     Recent data on US nominal trade (the bottom left panel) indicate that the trade   deficit has widened further  In October and November, exports of goods and services  (line 2) increased $17 billion, led by a rise in capital goods exports (line 3), owing in  part to a rebound in aircraft exports following the Boeing strike in September   Notably, exports of industrial supplies in October and November (line 4) were down  relative to the third quarter  A large share of US firms that produce these goods are  located in hurricane-affected areas, and their production has been temporarily  impaired  As shown on the right, this circumstance is highlighted by a sharp drop in  real exports from several industries that were particularly affected by the hurricanes     Nominal imports of goods and services (line 6 on the table) rose a hefty   $80 billion in October and November, notwithstanding soft growth in consumer  goods (line 7) and capital goods (line 8)  The recent rise in imports primarily  reflected large increases in industrial supplies (line 9) and oil (line 10)  These gains  were due both to higher import prices, particularly for oil and natural gas, and to  rising import quantities (which have substituted for impaired domestic production)   Notably, as seen on the right, real imports have risen sharply in some of the same  hurricane-affected industries in which exports have been particularly weak     As shown in the top left panel of your final international exhibit, we estimate that   the growth of US real exports of goods and services (the blue bars) dipped during  the second half of 2005, as the hurricanes contributed to softness in goods exports and  as last year’s dollar appreciation reduced the stimulus to services exports  Imports  (the red bars), in contrast, expanded at a solid rate in the second half of last year, with  a boost from the hurricanes  This pattern is expected to reverse in the first half of  2006, with exports recovering from the effects of the hurricanes and imports of oil  and industrial supplies moderating  Thereafter, imports and exports are projected to  grow at comparable paces, in line with solid US and foreign growth and with the   January 31, 2006 24 of 106    dollar projected to depreciate only mildly  As shown by the black line in the top right  panel, the contribution of net exports to US GDP growth in the second half of last  year is estimated to have been around negative 06 percentage point, but it is  projected to swing slightly positive in the first half of this year  Subsequently, the  subtraction due to net exports should run at roughly ⅓ percentage point; imports and  exports grow at comparable rates, but with imports more than 50 percent larger than  exports, a sizable subtraction from growth results      As shown in the middle left panel, the US current account deficit widened from   about $150 billion in 1997 to $780 billion in the third quarter of last year  Over the  forecast period, we see the deficit increasing further, to over $1 trillion, or about  7½ percent of GDP  The bottom panel provides some additional perspective on the  widening of the current account deficit  As shown in the first column, from 1997Q1  to 2001Q4—a period of dollar appreciation—the current account balance fell  $217 billion, which was more than accounted for by a decline in the non-oil trade  balance  Over the next four years (the second column), the current account balance  dropped another $421 billion, largely because of a continued decline in the non-oil  trade balance (despite a net depreciation of the dollar) and a sharp rise in oil imports   As shown in the last column, we expect the current account deficit to widen nearly  $300 billion over the forecast period, with all four major components contributing to  the decline  Notably, net investment income is expected to fall sharply, as growing  US indebtedness and rising short-term interest rates push up our payments to  foreigners      The middle right panel shows that our current account projections for 2006 and   2007 are markedly gloomier than those of other forecasters  Thus, there is a distinct  possibility that investors will be surprised by the extent that the current account  deficit widens  We see this as representing an important downside risk for the dollar        I think the source varies from forecast to forecast  One difference across   these forecasts relative to ours is in the oil price  The other forecasters are in the $50-$55 range,   whereas we have an oil price of $65 to $70  So that’s a piece of it  Looking at the assumptions   embedded in these forecasts pretty carefully, the one forecast that has a much sharper depreciation   of the dollar than what we’ve written down is the Global Insight forecast, which shows the dollar   falling quite dramatically over the next year or so  But I don’t find significantly different   assumptions about the exchange rate in the other forecasts  So I guess the bottom line is that I think   a lot of this difference is just a difference in models, and we’re confident that—if you give us an   January 31, 2006 28 of 106    exchange rate, relative prices, and so forth—we’re pretty good at mapping those underlying   variables into a path for the current account
