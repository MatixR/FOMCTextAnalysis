7692,2004-06-29,"  Your first international chart focuses on developments in   international financial markets  As shown in the top left panel, yields on long-term  government bonds in the major industrial countries have moved up over the past several  months, in line with mounting evidence of global recovery and prospective monetary  tightening in some countries  The rise in US bond yields has been particularly marked,  and Japanese rates have risen to their highest levels since late 2000  Rates implied by  three-month Eurocurrency futures contracts, shown on the top right, have also shifted  up—most noticeably for the dollar and for sterling but to some extent for the euro and  the yen as well  These moves in long-term and expected short-term interest rate  differentials have provided some support for the dollar  As seen in the bottom left panel,  the broad trade-weighted dollar has strengthened a bit since January, as the dollar has  posted gains against the euro and the yen     As displayed on the bottom right, equity markets have treaded water in most   industrial countries since late January, with improving growth prospects and rising  interest rates having broadly countervailing effects  Japan has been a notable exception,  however  Equity prices there have powered ahead, supported by the economy’s  remarkably strong recent performance  As shown in the top left panel of your next  chart, we estimate that Japanese growth (line 1) hummed along at a 5 percent rate during  the first half, as the rebound that began last year has continued to broaden  We expect  growth in Japan to moderate through the forecast period, to around 2½ percent  Growth  in China (line 2) is also expected to moderate from its recent sizzling pace, as the  authorities there seek to engineer a “soft landing”  As shown in lines 4 and 5, during the  first half of this year, growth in Germany has trailed even the sluggish recovery posted  by other euro-area countries, and we see German growth continuing to lag through the  forecast period    June 29-30, 2004 70 of 203          All told, we expect foreign growth (line 8) to proceed at a solid 3½ percent pace  through the rest of this year and next  As noted on the top right, a sustained global  recovery is now under way  The deflationary risks that plagued the foreign outlook a  year or so ago have generally abated, but inflation is also likely to remain well  contained  In short, our baseline forecast expects the foreign economies to put in a  favorable performance  Nevertheless, new risks have emerged  First, amid intense  geopolitical uncertainty, oil prices have recently been high and volatile, and this may  threaten price stability and growth in some countries  Second, rising interest rates and  tightening global liquidity conditions may pose risks for emerging-market economies or  heavily indebted sectors in the industrial countries  Third, the possibility of a hard  landing in China carries significant risks for other Asian economies (including Japan)  and, perhaps, for the rest of the world as well      The remainder of my remarks examine several of these issues in greater detail  I   turn first to the recent performance of the Japanese economy  As shown on the middle  left, Japanese exports have grown rapidly over the past couple of years, as exports to  China and other emerging Asian economies have surged, and manufacturing profits  have rebounded in lock-step with exports  More recently, nonmanufacturing profits  have risen as well—to the highest rate in a decade—suggesting that the recovery is  expanding across sectors  Rising profitability along with improving conditions in the  corporate sector more generally have allowed investment (the black line on the middle  right) to rebound from its recent trough  Labor markets have also revived, with the  offers-to-applicants ratio rising sharply and the unemployment rate (not shown)  declining from a peak of 55 percent early last year to 46 percent at present  Despite  these positive developments, it should be kept in mind that Japan has experienced false  dawns before—in 1996 and again in 1999-2000  Moreover, as shown on the bottom  left, Japanese consumption has inched ahead over the past decade, outpacing advances  in employee compensation (the dotted blue line)  The result has been a marked decline  in the household saving rate (in red)  We expect the saving rate to move up as economic  conditions improve  If this happens abruptly, consumption might lag the recovery even  if compensation begins to rise  The bottom right panel highlights two long-standing  sources of stress within the Japanese economy  First, although real estate prices in  certain parts of Tokyo have stabilized or even begun to rise, the decline in broad  measures of urban land prices has not abated  Second, bank credit has continued to  contract     The top panels of your next chart focus on the sustained economic weakness of   Germany relative to other euro-area countries  As shown on the left, over the past  decade German private consumption per capita has grown at a rate of only 1 percent a  year, while per capita consumption in the rest of the euro area has expanded nearly twice  as fast  Germany’s lagging performance is due to a number of factors, but the  inflexibility of the country=s labor markets—and the resulting inability to create new  jobs—has played a key role  As shown on the right, German employment has been  essentially flat over the past decade in the face of an unemployment rate currently above  10 percent  The fact that other euro-area economies—hardly poster children for labor  market flexibility—have successfully created jobs during this period underscores the   June 29-30, 2004 71 of 203          potential benefits of even incremental progress toward labor market reform  However,  the political support in Germany for such reform is limited and, if anything, has  diminished of late       As shown in the middle left panel, four-quarter inflation rates in a number of   countries have stepped up during the second quarter, as the prices of oil and other  commodities have approached or exceeded ten-year highs  Inflation in the euro area  (line 2) has recently moved above the ECB=s 2 percent ceiling  Inflation in the United  Kingdom (line 4) has increased as well but remains below the government=s 2 percent  target  Even so, the Bank of England has tightened policy 100 basis points since early  November in response to concerns that rising real estate prices and diminishing slack  will stoke inflationary pressures  As shown in line 6, Chinese inflation moved up during  the second quarter, largely reflecting a double-digit rise in food prices      Average foreign inflation should remain around 2½ percent through the second half   of this year and then decline to just over 2 percent next year  Our forecast for lower  inflation next year is conditioned on the expectation that oil prices (shown on the bottom  left) will move somewhat lower, as is now embedded in futures prices  Nonfuel  commodity prices are likewise projected to moderate through the forecast period  As  shown in the bottom right panel, the prices of several key commodities have already  retreated from their recent highs  In addition, foreign central banks are committed to  keeping inflation in check  With recoveries abroad becoming firmly entrenched, we see  the ECB and the Bank of Canada as likely to start raising rates late this year or early  next year, and the Bank of England will continue its gradual tightening  As shown in the  middle right panel, deflation in Japan—as measured by the CPI—appears to be ebbing,  and our forecast calls for slightly positive CPI inflation going forward  In contrast, the  Japanese PCE deflator has recorded steady declines  We expect the BOJ to leave its  policy of quantitative easing in place through the forecast period until there is clear  evidence that deflationary pressures have abated      The top panels of your next chart present data on corporate and household   indebtedness  If borrowers have gorged themselves on cheap debt during the recent  period of low interest rates, they may find it difficult to service or roll over their  increased debt burdens as interest rates move higher  As shown on the left, Japanese  firms have aggressively paid down debt and strengthened their balance sheets in recent  years, while the indebtedness of euro-area firms has remained about constant since the  ECB began easing policy in May 2001  Corporate debt levels in the United Kingdom  have climbed during the past few years, as bank borrowing by the real estate sector has  risen sharply, but such borrowing by manufacturing firms has actually declined     Data on household indebtedness (shown in the top right panel) indicate that the debt   levels of Japanese consumers have been about flat in recent years  In contrast, the debt  burdens of UK households have increased significantly, driven largely by rising  mortgage debt in line with the red-hot real estate market  As such, the assets of these  households have risen along with their indebtedness  As most mortgages in the United  Kingdom are variable rate and are directly linked to the Bank of England’s policy rate,   June 29-30, 2004 72 of 203          the recent monetary tightening has translated into higher debt-service burdens  To date,  however, households have absorbed the tightening of policy with few signs of strain   Household indebtedness in the euro area has also risen somewhat during the past few  years, as mortgage debt in some euro-area countries has posted considerable increases   This discussion suggests that interest rate vulnerabilities in the United Kingdom, and to  a lesser extent in the euro area, are likely to hinge crucially on the persistence of the  recent rise in real estate prices     The rest of this chart focuses on the vulnerability of Latin American countries to an   increase in global interest rates  As shown on the middle left, EMBI+ spreads are now  above their lows early this year but remain narrow, suggesting that investors are  relatively optimistic about these countries but perhaps also reflecting some willingness  to “reach for yield” in a low interest rate environment  As shown on the middle right,  over the past year or so Latin American countries have responded to the narrow spreads  by stepping up their issuance of external debt, but the pace of issuance has remained  modest in historical terms       The bottom panel compares recent readings on the vulnerability of major Latin   American countries against readings taken on the eve of interest rate tightening a decade  ago  For Mexico (line 1), these indicators show a striking improvement  The country’s  current account deficit as a percent of GDP has narrowed more than 4 percentage points,  and external debt has fallen to low levels  Similarly, Chile (line 2) seems well  positioned to withstand higher global interest rates  The country’s external indebtedness  has risen over the past decade, but its foreign reserves have moved up as well, and most  of the country’s debt is of long maturity  Brazil (line 3) is now running a small current  account surplus, which limits the need for new external financing  Nevertheless, the  government’s heavy debt burden—including both its external debt and its hefty stock of  short-term domestic debt (not shown)—leaves the country exposed to shifts in the  economic environment, especially in the event of policy slippages by the Lula  government  Finally, Argentina has defaulted on its massive external debt and remains  at loggerheads with its creditors  With these developments, inflows of foreign  investment have come to a halt, and a marked rise in global interest rates could further  complicate Argentina’s financial situation      Your final international chart examines the possibility of a hard landing in China    As shown on the top left, Chinese real investment has surged more than 30 percent  during the past year, and this, in turn, has fueled double-digit GDP growth  To slow the  pace of investment, the Chinese authorities have ratcheted up reserve requirements and  implemented a number of administrative measures  Notably, recent data suggest that  these actions are having significant effects  While our baseline forecast incorporates a  soft landing for China, the measures that the authorities have put in place may yet prove  too heavy-handed  Thus, as we discussed in an alternative simulation in the Greenbook,  a much steeper falloff in Chinese growth than we presently envision is distinctly  possible       June 29-30, 2004 73 of 203          The table on the top right focuses on two channels through which a hard landing  might spill over to the global economy  The first column reports a given country’s  exports to China as a share of GDP; the second column reports a country’s net exports  of commodities worldwide, also scaled by its GDP  Certainly those economies that  export heavily to China—such as Taiwan, the ASEAN countries, and Korea (lines 1- 3)—would be significantly harmed by a hard landing and an accompanying decline in  Chinese import demand  However, for importers of commodities—such as Taiwan and  Korea—there would likely be some offset, if a cooling in China took pressure off global  commodity prices  In addition, a large share of China’s imports from emerging Asia is  eventually re-exported  Chinese demand for such imports depends on global conditions  and might weather a hard landing relatively well  Outside of emerging Asia, countries  such as Chile (line 4), Argentina (line 6), and Russia (line 7) would be hurt by the hard  landing both because they have sizable exports to China and because they are net  exporters of commodities  Among the industrial countries, Japan (line 5) would be the  most affected by a hard landing, with exports to China now accounting for 21 percent of  its GDP  The fallout for the euro area (line 9) and the United States (line 12) would  likely be much smaller than for Japan  There are other channels through which a hard  landing in China might be felt  For example, it could sour business and consumer  confidence in other emerging Asian economies and Japan and weigh on sentiment in  global financial markets  Indeed, as shown on the middle left, over the past few months,  as concerns about China have come to the fore, equity markets in some emerging Asian  economies—most notably in Taiwan and Korea—have moved down significantly  A  hard landing would probably also weaken capital flows to emerging Asia and thus  reduce upward pressure on the renminbi and other currencies in the region      The bottom panels sum up my remarks by assessing the implications of our foreign   outlook for the US external sector  Although growth abroad (the blue bars on the left)  is likely to put in a solid performance through the end of next year, it will trail the pace  of US expansion  This growth differential—along with the greater income sensitivity  of US imports—should boost US imports relative to exports  However, the lagged  effects of the dollar’s depreciation since 2002 will work in the opposite direction,  boosting exports relative to imports  With these factors about balancing out, our forecast  calls for exports and imports (both shown on the right) to grow at roughly comparable  rates, rising at a double-digit pace during the second half of this year and then tempering  to 8 percent growth next year  Nevertheless, as the level of imports far exceeds the level  of exports, net exports will become more negative, subtracting about ½ percentage point  from US real GDP growth during the second half of this year and in 2005  David  Wilcox will now conclude our presentation    "
8369,2006-01-31,"  Your first international exhibit focuses on the dollar  As   indicated by the red line in the top-left panel, despite widening US external  imbalances, the dollar rose strongly against the major currencies through much of  2005  As seen on the top right, against the euro and the yen, the dollar has recorded  net gains of more than 10 percent over the past year, even after tailing off some  during the last two months  The dollar’s rise against these currencies occurred as  interest rate differentials (shown on the bottom left) moved strongly in favor of dollar  assets, and market commentary has pointed to this as a key factor supporting the  dollar  Against the Canadian dollar, however, the greenback has moved down since  mid-2005, and—as displayed on the bottom right—the dollar has also fallen against  an array of emerging-market currencies, as market confidence in these countries has  climbed  On balance, the broad nominal dollar has strengthened about 1¾ percent  over the past year      As shown in the top panels of exhibit 10, the dollar’s resilience last year came in   the context of a shift in the composition of reported US financial inflows, away from  official financing and toward private financing  In 2005, foreign official inflows (line  1 on the left) were down sharply from their 2004 pace  A plunge in official inflows  from the G-10 countries (line 2) led this decline, as the Japanese authorities ceased  intervening in foreign exchange markets  In contrast, inflows from emerging Asia  (line 3) continued to move up, reflecting massive reserve accumulation by China     Purchases of US securities by private foreigners (the top right panel) surged last   year to more than $700 billion  All major categories of instruments saw increased  foreign purchases, with particularly large gains in Treasury securities (line 2) and  corporate bonds (line 4)     The positive sentiment toward the emerging market economies, which was seen in   foreign exchange markets, has also been manifest in global debt markets  As shown  on the bottom left, the EMBI+ spread—which had hovered above the US double-B  corporate spread in recent years—cut below the double-B spread in mid-2005 and has  now sunk to historical lows of just above 200 basis points  These favorable  conditions, however, have not triggered a rise in external borrowing  As shown on  the bottom right, net issuance of international debt securities by the emerging Asian  economies has remained stable over the last year or two, and the Latin American  countries have been paying down debt on net  Moreover, a sizable fraction of these  economies continue to run current account surpluses     Your next exhibit focuses on the outlook for activity abroad, which in our view is   quite favorable  As shown in line 1 of the top left panel, we estimate that total  foreign growth in the second half of last year climbed to 41 percent, as growth in the  emerging market economies (line 6) exceeded 6 percent  Going forward, we expect  the foreign economies on average to expand at a strong pace of 3½ percent  Recent   January 31, 2006 22 of 106    data have pointed to renewed signs of life in the euro-area economy (line 3),  particularly in Germany, as strengthening in the export sector appears to have jump- started investment  We expect this impetus eventually to feed through to increased  employment and consumer spending  Accordingly, we have marked up our forecast  for the euro area and now expect growth there to remain near the 2 percent pace  posted in the second half of 2005  Our forecast for Japan (line 4) calls for the  expansion to broaden and for growth to remain above our estimate of potential  As  shown in the middle left panel, over the past decade, Japanese corporations have  dramatically reduced their debt burdens (the blue line)  As balance sheets have  strengthened, business investment (the black line) has risen and labor market  conditions (the red line) have improved  More recently, as shown on the right, urban  land prices—after many years of sharp contraction—appear to have stopped falling,  and bank credit seems to be following a similar pattern  These developments suggest  that conditions in the Japanese financial sector may finally be normalizing     The bottom panels focus on China  Over the intermeeting period, the Chinese   authorities reported that GDP in 2004 was $280 billion (or 17 percent) larger than  they had previously realized  Given these revisions, China’s GDP last year now  appears to have exceeded that of France and the United Kingdom, making China the  world’s fourth-largest economy  Other recent data indicate that China’s trade surplus  (displayed on the right) jumped to $100 billion in 2005, as import growth declined  sharply  Returning to the top left panel, this deceleration in imports did not reflect a  slowing in the overall pace of Chinese activity last year, as GDP growth (line 8)  remained near 10 percent  We see growth there notching down to around 7¾ percent  in 2006, as the authorities are expected to implement administrative measures to  restrain investment      As displayed in the top right panel, average foreign inflation is projected to   remain well contained, cycling near 2½ percent through the forecast period  Inflation  rates in the foreign industrial countries are seen to step down in mid-2006, as the run- up in oil prices plays through      For the emerging market economies, oil price increases typically pass through   into consumer prices more slowly, as a number of these countries have price controls  or subsidies in place that temporarily cushion the upward pressure on prices  As  such, the rise in oil prices should continue to push up consumer price inflation  through the next few quarters, but these pressures should abate in 2007      The top panels of exhibit 12 focus on trade prices  As shown on the left, the spot   price of West Texas intermediate (the black line) has surged about $20 per barrel over  the past year and now trades above $65 per barrel  Oil prices have been driven up  both by strong global demand and by concerns about the reliability and adequacy of  global supplies  Recent developments in Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria have further  intensified these concerns  Tracking futures markets, our forecast calls for the price  of WTI to remain elevated through the end of 2007  Nonfuel commodity prices (the  red line) have also risen sharply over the past year, as metals prices have surged in   January 31, 2006 23 of 106    response to strong global demand  In sync with futures markets, our forecast calls for  commodity prices to flatten out near current levels, as supply responses help cap  further price rises       The center panel displays our projection for the broad real dollar  After rising   somewhat on balance last year, the dollar is projected to depreciate slightly, at an  annual rate of about 1⅓ percent, through the forecast period  We see the expanding  current account deficit and associated financing concerns—as well as monetary  tightening by some foreign central banks—as likely to be sources of downward  pressure on the dollar      Core import prices (the right panel) spiked in the fourth quarter, driven largely by   a surge in natural gas prices following the hurricanes  Given that natural gas prices  have already retreated, the run-up in core import price inflation should quickly  unwind  Smoothing through these fluctuations, we see core import price inflation  moving down to around 1 percent by early next year, consistent with flat commodity  prices and only modest dollar depreciation     Recent data on US nominal trade (the bottom left panel) indicate that the trade   deficit has widened further  In October and November, exports of goods and services  (line 2) increased $17 billion, led by a rise in capital goods exports (line 3), owing in  part to a rebound in aircraft exports following the Boeing strike in September   Notably, exports of industrial supplies in October and November (line 4) were down  relative to the third quarter  A large share of US firms that produce these goods are  located in hurricane-affected areas, and their production has been temporarily  impaired  As shown on the right, this circumstance is highlighted by a sharp drop in  real exports from several industries that were particularly affected by the hurricanes     Nominal imports of goods and services (line 6 on the table) rose a hefty   $80 billion in October and November, notwithstanding soft growth in consumer  goods (line 7) and capital goods (line 8)  The recent rise in imports primarily  reflected large increases in industrial supplies (line 9) and oil (line 10)  These gains  were due both to higher import prices, particularly for oil and natural gas, and to  rising import quantities (which have substituted for impaired domestic production)   Notably, as seen on the right, real imports have risen sharply in some of the same  hurricane-affected industries in which exports have been particularly weak     As shown in the top left panel of your final international exhibit, we estimate that   the growth of US real exports of goods and services (the blue bars) dipped during  the second half of 2005, as the hurricanes contributed to softness in goods exports and  as last year’s dollar appreciation reduced the stimulus to services exports  Imports  (the red bars), in contrast, expanded at a solid rate in the second half of last year, with  a boost from the hurricanes  This pattern is expected to reverse in the first half of  2006, with exports recovering from the effects of the hurricanes and imports of oil  and industrial supplies moderating  Thereafter, imports and exports are projected to  grow at comparable paces, in line with solid US and foreign growth and with the   January 31, 2006 24 of 106    dollar projected to depreciate only mildly  As shown by the black line in the top right  panel, the contribution of net exports to US GDP growth in the second half of last  year is estimated to have been around negative 06 percentage point, but it is  projected to swing slightly positive in the first half of this year  Subsequently, the  subtraction due to net exports should run at roughly ⅓ percentage point; imports and  exports grow at comparable rates, but with imports more than 50 percent larger than  exports, a sizable subtraction from growth results      As shown in the middle left panel, the US current account deficit widened from   about $150 billion in 1997 to $780 billion in the third quarter of last year  Over the  forecast period, we see the deficit increasing further, to over $1 trillion, or about  7½ percent of GDP  The bottom panel provides some additional perspective on the  widening of the current account deficit  As shown in the first column, from 1997Q1  to 2001Q4—a period of dollar appreciation—the current account balance fell  $217 billion, which was more than accounted for by a decline in the non-oil trade  balance  Over the next four years (the second column), the current account balance  dropped another $421 billion, largely because of a continued decline in the non-oil  trade balance (despite a net depreciation of the dollar) and a sharp rise in oil imports   As shown in the last column, we expect the current account deficit to widen nearly  $300 billion over the forecast period, with all four major components contributing to  the decline  Notably, net investment income is expected to fall sharply, as growing  US indebtedness and rising short-term interest rates push up our payments to  foreigners      The middle right panel shows that our current account projections for 2006 and   2007 are markedly gloomier than those of other forecasters  Thus, there is a distinct  possibility that investors will be surprised by the extent that the current account  deficit widens  We see this as representing an important downside risk for the dollar        I think the source varies from forecast to forecast  One difference across   these forecasts relative to ours is in the oil price  The other forecasters are in the $50-$55 range,   whereas we have an oil price of $65 to $70  So that’s a piece of it  Looking at the assumptions   embedded in these forecasts pretty carefully, the one forecast that has a much sharper depreciation   of the dollar than what we’ve written down is the Global Insight forecast, which shows the dollar   falling quite dramatically over the next year or so  But I don’t find significantly different   assumptions about the exchange rate in the other forecasts  So I guess the bottom line is that I think   a lot of this difference is just a difference in models, and we’re confident that—if you give us an   January 31, 2006 28 of 106    exchange rate, relative prices, and so forth—we’re pretty good at mapping those underlying   variables into a path for the current account  "
