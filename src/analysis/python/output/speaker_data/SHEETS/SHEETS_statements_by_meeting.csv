7561,2004-06-29,"  Your first international chart focuses on developments in   international financial markets  As shown in the top left panel, yields on long-term  government bonds in the major industrial countries have moved up over the past several  months, in line with mounting evidence of global recovery and prospective monetary  tightening in some countries  The rise in US bond yields has been particularly marked,  and Japanese rates have risen to their highest levels since late 2000  Rates implied by  three-month Eurocurrency futures contracts, shown on the top right, have also shifted  up—most noticeably for the dollar and for sterling but to some extent for the euro and  the yen as well  These moves in long-term and expected short-term interest rate  differentials have provided some support for the dollar  As seen in the bottom left panel,  the broad trade-weighted dollar has strengthened a bit since January, as the dollar has  posted gains against the euro and the yen     As displayed on the bottom right, equity markets have treaded water in most   industrial countries since late January, with improving growth prospects and rising  interest rates having broadly countervailing effects  Japan has been a notable exception,  however  Equity prices there have powered ahead, supported by the economy’s  remarkably strong recent performance  As shown in the top left panel of your next  chart, we estimate that Japanese growth (line 1) hummed along at a 5 percent rate during  the first half, as the rebound that began last year has continued to broaden  We expect  growth in Japan to moderate through the forecast period, to around 2½ percent  Growth  in China (line 2) is also expected to moderate from its recent sizzling pace, as the  authorities there seek to engineer a “soft landing”  As shown in lines 4 and 5, during the  first half of this year, growth in Germany has trailed even the sluggish recovery posted  by other euro-area countries, and we see German growth continuing to lag through the  forecast period    June 29-30, 2004 70 of 203          All told, we expect foreign growth (line 8) to proceed at a solid 3½ percent pace  through the rest of this year and next  As noted on the top right, a sustained global  recovery is now under way  The deflationary risks that plagued the foreign outlook a  year or so ago have generally abated, but inflation is also likely to remain well  contained  In short, our baseline forecast expects the foreign economies to put in a  favorable performance  Nevertheless, new risks have emerged  First, amid intense  geopolitical uncertainty, oil prices have recently been high and volatile, and this may  threaten price stability and growth in some countries  Second, rising interest rates and  tightening global liquidity conditions may pose risks for emerging-market economies or  heavily indebted sectors in the industrial countries  Third, the possibility of a hard  landing in China carries significant risks for other Asian economies (including Japan)  and, perhaps, for the rest of the world as well      The remainder of my remarks examine several of these issues in greater detail  I   turn first to the recent performance of the Japanese economy  As shown on the middle  left, Japanese exports have grown rapidly over the past couple of years, as exports to  China and other emerging Asian economies have surged, and manufacturing profits  have rebounded in lock-step with exports  More recently, nonmanufacturing profits  have risen as well—to the highest rate in a decade—suggesting that the recovery is  expanding across sectors  Rising profitability along with improving conditions in the  corporate sector more generally have allowed investment (the black line on the middle  right) to rebound from its recent trough  Labor markets have also revived, with the  offers-to-applicants ratio rising sharply and the unemployment rate (not shown)  declining from a peak of 55 percent early last year to 46 percent at present  Despite  these positive developments, it should be kept in mind that Japan has experienced false  dawns before—in 1996 and again in 1999-2000  Moreover, as shown on the bottom  left, Japanese consumption has inched ahead over the past decade, outpacing advances  in employee compensation (the dotted blue line)  The result has been a marked decline  in the household saving rate (in red)  We expect the saving rate to move up as economic  conditions improve  If this happens abruptly, consumption might lag the recovery even  if compensation begins to rise  The bottom right panel highlights two long-standing  sources of stress within the Japanese economy  First, although real estate prices in  certain parts of Tokyo have stabilized or even begun to rise, the decline in broad  measures of urban land prices has not abated  Second, bank credit has continued to  contract     The top panels of your next chart focus on the sustained economic weakness of   Germany relative to other euro-area countries  As shown on the left, over the past  decade German private consumption per capita has grown at a rate of only 1 percent a  year, while per capita consumption in the rest of the euro area has expanded nearly twice  as fast  Germany’s lagging performance is due to a number of factors, but the  inflexibility of the country=s labor markets—and the resulting inability to create new  jobs—has played a key role  As shown on the right, German employment has been  essentially flat over the past decade in the face of an unemployment rate currently above  10 percent  The fact that other euro-area economies—hardly poster children for labor  market flexibility—have successfully created jobs during this period underscores the   June 29-30, 2004 71 of 203          potential benefits of even incremental progress toward labor market reform  However,  the political support in Germany for such reform is limited and, if anything, has  diminished of late       As shown in the middle left panel, four-quarter inflation rates in a number of   countries have stepped up during the second quarter, as the prices of oil and other  commodities have approached or exceeded ten-year highs  Inflation in the euro area  (line 2) has recently moved above the ECB=s 2 percent ceiling  Inflation in the United  Kingdom (line 4) has increased as well but remains below the government=s 2 percent  target  Even so, the Bank of England has tightened policy 100 basis points since early  November in response to concerns that rising real estate prices and diminishing slack  will stoke inflationary pressures  As shown in line 6, Chinese inflation moved up during  the second quarter, largely reflecting a double-digit rise in food prices      Average foreign inflation should remain around 2½ percent through the second half   of this year and then decline to just over 2 percent next year  Our forecast for lower  inflation next year is conditioned on the expectation that oil prices (shown on the bottom  left) will move somewhat lower, as is now embedded in futures prices  Nonfuel  commodity prices are likewise projected to moderate through the forecast period  As  shown in the bottom right panel, the prices of several key commodities have already  retreated from their recent highs  In addition, foreign central banks are committed to  keeping inflation in check  With recoveries abroad becoming firmly entrenched, we see  the ECB and the Bank of Canada as likely to start raising rates late this year or early  next year, and the Bank of England will continue its gradual tightening  As shown in the  middle right panel, deflation in Japan—as measured by the CPI—appears to be ebbing,  and our forecast calls for slightly positive CPI inflation going forward  In contrast, the  Japanese PCE deflator has recorded steady declines  We expect the BOJ to leave its  policy of quantitative easing in place through the forecast period until there is clear  evidence that deflationary pressures have abated      The top panels of your next chart present data on corporate and household   indebtedness  If borrowers have gorged themselves on cheap debt during the recent  period of low interest rates, they may find it difficult to service or roll over their  increased debt burdens as interest rates move higher  As shown on the left, Japanese  firms have aggressively paid down debt and strengthened their balance sheets in recent  years, while the indebtedness of euro-area firms has remained about constant since the  ECB began easing policy in May 2001  Corporate debt levels in the United Kingdom  have climbed during the past few years, as bank borrowing by the real estate sector has  risen sharply, but such borrowing by manufacturing firms has actually declined     Data on household indebtedness (shown in the top right panel) indicate that the debt   levels of Japanese consumers have been about flat in recent years  In contrast, the debt  burdens of UK households have increased significantly, driven largely by rising  mortgage debt in line with the red-hot real estate market  As such, the assets of these  households have risen along with their indebtedness  As most mortgages in the United  Kingdom are variable rate and are directly linked to the Bank of England’s policy rate,   June 29-30, 2004 72 of 203          the recent monetary tightening has translated into higher debt-service burdens  To date,  however, households have absorbed the tightening of policy with few signs of strain   Household indebtedness in the euro area has also risen somewhat during the past few  years, as mortgage debt in some euro-area countries has posted considerable increases   This discussion suggests that interest rate vulnerabilities in the United Kingdom, and to  a lesser extent in the euro area, are likely to hinge crucially on the persistence of the  recent rise in real estate prices     The rest of this chart focuses on the vulnerability of Latin American countries to an   increase in global interest rates  As shown on the middle left, EMBI+ spreads are now  above their lows early this year but remain narrow, suggesting that investors are  relatively optimistic about these countries but perhaps also reflecting some willingness  to “reach for yield” in a low interest rate environment  As shown on the middle right,  over the past year or so Latin American countries have responded to the narrow spreads  by stepping up their issuance of external debt, but the pace of issuance has remained  modest in historical terms       The bottom panel compares recent readings on the vulnerability of major Latin   American countries against readings taken on the eve of interest rate tightening a decade  ago  For Mexico (line 1), these indicators show a striking improvement  The country’s  current account deficit as a percent of GDP has narrowed more than 4 percentage points,  and external debt has fallen to low levels  Similarly, Chile (line 2) seems well  positioned to withstand higher global interest rates  The country’s external indebtedness  has risen over the past decade, but its foreign reserves have moved up as well, and most  of the country’s debt is of long maturity  Brazil (line 3) is now running a small current  account surplus, which limits the need for new external financing  Nevertheless, the  government’s heavy debt burden—including both its external debt and its hefty stock of  short-term domestic debt (not shown)—leaves the country exposed to shifts in the  economic environment, especially in the event of policy slippages by the Lula  government  Finally, Argentina has defaulted on its massive external debt and remains  at loggerheads with its creditors  With these developments, inflows of foreign  investment have come to a halt, and a marked rise in global interest rates could further  complicate Argentina’s financial situation      Your final international chart examines the possibility of a hard landing in China    As shown on the top left, Chinese real investment has surged more than 30 percent  during the past year, and this, in turn, has fueled double-digit GDP growth  To slow the  pace of investment, the Chinese authorities have ratcheted up reserve requirements and  implemented a number of administrative measures  Notably, recent data suggest that  these actions are having significant effects  While our baseline forecast incorporates a  soft landing for China, the measures that the authorities have put in place may yet prove  too heavy-handed  Thus, as we discussed in an alternative simulation in the Greenbook,  a much steeper falloff in Chinese growth than we presently envision is distinctly  possible       June 29-30, 2004 73 of 203          The table on the top right focuses on two channels through which a hard landing  might spill over to the global economy  The first column reports a given country’s  exports to China as a share of GDP; the second column reports a country’s net exports  of commodities worldwide, also scaled by its GDP  Certainly those economies that  export heavily to China—such as Taiwan, the ASEAN countries, and Korea (lines 1- 3)—would be significantly harmed by a hard landing and an accompanying decline in  Chinese import demand  However, for importers of commodities—such as Taiwan and  Korea—there would likely be some offset, if a cooling in China took pressure off global  commodity prices  In addition, a large share of China’s imports from emerging Asia is  eventually re-exported  Chinese demand for such imports depends on global conditions  and might weather a hard landing relatively well  Outside of emerging Asia, countries  such as Chile (line 4), Argentina (line 6), and Russia (line 7) would be hurt by the hard  landing both because they have sizable exports to China and because they are net  exporters of commodities  Among the industrial countries, Japan (line 5) would be the  most affected by a hard landing, with exports to China now accounting for 21 percent of  its GDP  The fallout for the euro area (line 9) and the United States (line 12) would  likely be much smaller than for Japan  There are other channels through which a hard  landing in China might be felt  For example, it could sour business and consumer  confidence in other emerging Asian economies and Japan and weigh on sentiment in  global financial markets  Indeed, as shown on the middle left, over the past few months,  as concerns about China have come to the fore, equity markets in some emerging Asian  economies—most notably in Taiwan and Korea—have moved down significantly  A  hard landing would probably also weaken capital flows to emerging Asia and thus  reduce upward pressure on the renminbi and other currencies in the region      The bottom panels sum up my remarks by assessing the implications of our foreign   outlook for the US external sector  Although growth abroad (the blue bars on the left)  is likely to put in a solid performance through the end of next year, it will trail the pace  of US expansion  This growth differential—along with the greater income sensitivity  of US imports—should boost US imports relative to exports  However, the lagged  effects of the dollar’s depreciation since 2002 will work in the opposite direction,  boosting exports relative to imports  With these factors about balancing out, our forecast  calls for exports and imports (both shown on the right) to grow at roughly comparable  rates, rising at a double-digit pace during the second half of this year and then tempering  to 8 percent growth next year  Nevertheless, as the level of imports far exceeds the level  of exports, net exports will become more negative, subtracting about ½ percentage point  from US real GDP growth during the second half of this year and in 2005  David  Wilcox will now conclude our presentation    "
7884,2006-01-31,"  Your first international exhibit focuses on the dollar  As   indicated by the red line in the top-left panel, despite widening US external  imbalances, the dollar rose strongly against the major currencies through much of  2005  As seen on the top right, against the euro and the yen, the dollar has recorded  net gains of more than 10 percent over the past year, even after tailing off some  during the last two months  The dollar’s rise against these currencies occurred as  interest rate differentials (shown on the bottom left) moved strongly in favor of dollar  assets, and market commentary has pointed to this as a key factor supporting the  dollar  Against the Canadian dollar, however, the greenback has moved down since  mid-2005, and—as displayed on the bottom right—the dollar has also fallen against  an array of emerging-market currencies, as market confidence in these countries has  climbed  On balance, the broad nominal dollar has strengthened about 1¾ percent  over the past year      As shown in the top panels of exhibit 10, the dollar’s resilience last year came in   the context of a shift in the composition of reported US financial inflows, away from  official financing and toward private financing  In 2005, foreign official inflows (line  1 on the left) were down sharply from their 2004 pace  A plunge in official inflows  from the G-10 countries (line 2) led this decline, as the Japanese authorities ceased  intervening in foreign exchange markets  In contrast, inflows from emerging Asia  (line 3) continued to move up, reflecting massive reserve accumulation by China     Purchases of US securities by private foreigners (the top right panel) surged last   year to more than $700 billion  All major categories of instruments saw increased  foreign purchases, with particularly large gains in Treasury securities (line 2) and  corporate bonds (line 4)     The positive sentiment toward the emerging market economies, which was seen in   foreign exchange markets, has also been manifest in global debt markets  As shown  on the bottom left, the EMBI+ spread—which had hovered above the US double-B  corporate spread in recent years—cut below the double-B spread in mid-2005 and has  now sunk to historical lows of just above 200 basis points  These favorable  conditions, however, have not triggered a rise in external borrowing  As shown on  the bottom right, net issuance of international debt securities by the emerging Asian  economies has remained stable over the last year or two, and the Latin American  countries have been paying down debt on net  Moreover, a sizable fraction of these  economies continue to run current account surpluses     Your next exhibit focuses on the outlook for activity abroad, which in our view is   quite favorable  As shown in line 1 of the top left panel, we estimate that total  foreign growth in the second half of last year climbed to 41 percent, as growth in the  emerging market economies (line 6) exceeded 6 percent  Going forward, we expect  the foreign economies on average to expand at a strong pace of 3½ percent  Recent   January 31, 2006 22 of 106    data have pointed to renewed signs of life in the euro-area economy (line 3),  particularly in Germany, as strengthening in the export sector appears to have jump- started investment  We expect this impetus eventually to feed through to increased  employment and consumer spending  Accordingly, we have marked up our forecast  for the euro area and now expect growth there to remain near the 2 percent pace  posted in the second half of 2005  Our forecast for Japan (line 4) calls for the  expansion to broaden and for growth to remain above our estimate of potential  As  shown in the middle left panel, over the past decade, Japanese corporations have  dramatically reduced their debt burdens (the blue line)  As balance sheets have  strengthened, business investment (the black line) has risen and labor market  conditions (the red line) have improved  More recently, as shown on the right, urban  land prices—after many years of sharp contraction—appear to have stopped falling,  and bank credit seems to be following a similar pattern  These developments suggest  that conditions in the Japanese financial sector may finally be normalizing     The bottom panels focus on China  Over the intermeeting period, the Chinese   authorities reported that GDP in 2004 was $280 billion (or 17 percent) larger than  they had previously realized  Given these revisions, China’s GDP last year now  appears to have exceeded that of France and the United Kingdom, making China the  world’s fourth-largest economy  Other recent data indicate that China’s trade surplus  (displayed on the right) jumped to $100 billion in 2005, as import growth declined  sharply  Returning to the top left panel, this deceleration in imports did not reflect a  slowing in the overall pace of Chinese activity last year, as GDP growth (line 8)  remained near 10 percent  We see growth there notching down to around 7¾ percent  in 2006, as the authorities are expected to implement administrative measures to  restrain investment      As displayed in the top right panel, average foreign inflation is projected to   remain well contained, cycling near 2½ percent through the forecast period  Inflation  rates in the foreign industrial countries are seen to step down in mid-2006, as the run- up in oil prices plays through      For the emerging market economies, oil price increases typically pass through   into consumer prices more slowly, as a number of these countries have price controls  or subsidies in place that temporarily cushion the upward pressure on prices  As  such, the rise in oil prices should continue to push up consumer price inflation  through the next few quarters, but these pressures should abate in 2007      The top panels of exhibit 12 focus on trade prices  As shown on the left, the spot   price of West Texas intermediate (the black line) has surged about $20 per barrel over  the past year and now trades above $65 per barrel  Oil prices have been driven up  both by strong global demand and by concerns about the reliability and adequacy of  global supplies  Recent developments in Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria have further  intensified these concerns  Tracking futures markets, our forecast calls for the price  of WTI to remain elevated through the end of 2007  Nonfuel commodity prices (the  red line) have also risen sharply over the past year, as metals prices have surged in   January 31, 2006 23 of 106    response to strong global demand  In sync with futures markets, our forecast calls for  commodity prices to flatten out near current levels, as supply responses help cap  further price rises       The center panel displays our projection for the broad real dollar  After rising   somewhat on balance last year, the dollar is projected to depreciate slightly, at an  annual rate of about 1⅓ percent, through the forecast period  We see the expanding  current account deficit and associated financing concerns—as well as monetary  tightening by some foreign central banks—as likely to be sources of downward  pressure on the dollar      Core import prices (the right panel) spiked in the fourth quarter, driven largely by   a surge in natural gas prices following the hurricanes  Given that natural gas prices  have already retreated, the run-up in core import price inflation should quickly  unwind  Smoothing through these fluctuations, we see core import price inflation  moving down to around 1 percent by early next year, consistent with flat commodity  prices and only modest dollar depreciation     Recent data on US nominal trade (the bottom left panel) indicate that the trade   deficit has widened further  In October and November, exports of goods and services  (line 2) increased $17 billion, led by a rise in capital goods exports (line 3), owing in  part to a rebound in aircraft exports following the Boeing strike in September   Notably, exports of industrial supplies in October and November (line 4) were down  relative to the third quarter  A large share of US firms that produce these goods are  located in hurricane-affected areas, and their production has been temporarily  impaired  As shown on the right, this circumstance is highlighted by a sharp drop in  real exports from several industries that were particularly affected by the hurricanes     Nominal imports of goods and services (line 6 on the table) rose a hefty   $80 billion in October and November, notwithstanding soft growth in consumer  goods (line 7) and capital goods (line 8)  The recent rise in imports primarily  reflected large increases in industrial supplies (line 9) and oil (line 10)  These gains  were due both to higher import prices, particularly for oil and natural gas, and to  rising import quantities (which have substituted for impaired domestic production)   Notably, as seen on the right, real imports have risen sharply in some of the same  hurricane-affected industries in which exports have been particularly weak     As shown in the top left panel of your final international exhibit, we estimate that   the growth of US real exports of goods and services (the blue bars) dipped during  the second half of 2005, as the hurricanes contributed to softness in goods exports and  as last year’s dollar appreciation reduced the stimulus to services exports  Imports  (the red bars), in contrast, expanded at a solid rate in the second half of last year, with  a boost from the hurricanes  This pattern is expected to reverse in the first half of  2006, with exports recovering from the effects of the hurricanes and imports of oil  and industrial supplies moderating  Thereafter, imports and exports are projected to  grow at comparable paces, in line with solid US and foreign growth and with the   January 31, 2006 24 of 106    dollar projected to depreciate only mildly  As shown by the black line in the top right  panel, the contribution of net exports to US GDP growth in the second half of last  year is estimated to have been around negative 06 percentage point, but it is  projected to swing slightly positive in the first half of this year  Subsequently, the  subtraction due to net exports should run at roughly ⅓ percentage point; imports and  exports grow at comparable rates, but with imports more than 50 percent larger than  exports, a sizable subtraction from growth results      As shown in the middle left panel, the US current account deficit widened from   about $150 billion in 1997 to $780 billion in the third quarter of last year  Over the  forecast period, we see the deficit increasing further, to over $1 trillion, or about  7½ percent of GDP  The bottom panel provides some additional perspective on the  widening of the current account deficit  As shown in the first column, from 1997Q1  to 2001Q4—a period of dollar appreciation—the current account balance fell  $217 billion, which was more than accounted for by a decline in the non-oil trade  balance  Over the next four years (the second column), the current account balance  dropped another $421 billion, largely because of a continued decline in the non-oil  trade balance (despite a net depreciation of the dollar) and a sharp rise in oil imports   As shown in the last column, we expect the current account deficit to widen nearly  $300 billion over the forecast period, with all four major components contributing to  the decline  Notably, net investment income is expected to fall sharply, as growing  US indebtedness and rising short-term interest rates push up our payments to  foreigners      The middle right panel shows that our current account projections for 2006 and   2007 are markedly gloomier than those of other forecasters  Thus, there is a distinct  possibility that investors will be surprised by the extent that the current account  deficit widens  We see this as representing an important downside risk for the dollar       I think the source varies from forecast to forecast  One difference across   these forecasts relative to ours is in the oil price  The other forecasters are in the $50-$55 range,   whereas we have an oil price of $65 to $70  So that’s a piece of it  Looking at the assumptions   embedded in these forecasts pretty carefully, the one forecast that has a much sharper depreciation   of the dollar than what we’ve written down is the Global Insight forecast, which shows the dollar   falling quite dramatically over the next year or so  But I don’t find significantly different   assumptions about the exchange rate in the other forecasts  So I guess the bottom line is that I think   a lot of this difference is just a difference in models, and we’re confident that—if you give us an   January 31, 2006 28 of 106    exchange rate, relative prices, and so forth—we’re pretty good at mapping those underlying   variables into a path for the current account  "
8253,2007-10-30,"  Although the foreign economies appear to have grown at a   moderate pace during the third quarter as a whole, indicators for September and  October suggest that the recent financial turmoil may yet leave an imprint on activity  in some countries  Perhaps the most striking evidence on this score has been the  ECB’s survey of euro-area bank lending  In the third quarter, this survey showed the  sharpest shift toward tightening in its five-year history, along with evidence of more- stringent credit standards for business and housing loans  In addition, we have seen  downward moves in surveys and measures of sentiment in the euro area, particularly  in Germany, although these indicators have generally remained in expansionary  territory  In the United Kingdom, the growth of mortgage lending continued on a  downward path in September, and a recent Bank of England survey suggests a  tightening of corporate credit conditions  All in all, we see this (admittedly  fragmentary) evidence as broadly consistent with our assumption in the September  Greenbook that fallout from the financial turmoil is likely to exert some drag on  growth over the next several quarters in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and  Canada  This assessment, however, is marked by significant upside and downside  risks—as it is still too soon to gauge these effects with much confidence  As in our   October 30-31, 2007 12 of 162    previous forecast, we do not see the turmoil weighing directly on activity in Japan or  the emerging-market economies     More generally, the contours of our forecast remain similar to those in September    Recent data have confirmed our expectation that average economic growth abroad  declined to about 3½ percent in the third quarter, cooling from the very rapid rate in  the first half of the year  We see growth edging down further in the current quarter,  to just over 3 percent, and remaining at about that pace in 2008 and 2009  After the  Greenbook went to bed, we received Chinese GDP data, which according to our  seasonally adjusted quarterly estimate grew at an annual rate of just over 8 percent in  the third quarter—a little slower than we had expected and down from the 14 percent  rate in the first half of the year  This deceleration appears to have been led by a  slowing in investment and a smaller contribution from the external sector  Going  forward, economic growth in China should remain below its previous double-digit  pace, as the Chinese authorities take further action to cool the country’s booming real  estate market and the rapid growth of bank lending        In addition to uncertainty about the eventual effects of the financial turmoil on   real activity, other risks to our generally favorable foreign outlook are worth noting   First on this list is the possibility of a softer-than-expected performance from the US  economy  Although there is talk in some quarters about so-called decoupling—that  is, that the foreign economies may now be less linked to developments in the United  States than has been the case in the past—the jury is still out on this point  Although  domestic demand does appear to have firmed in some foreign countries in recent  years, a marked slowing in US growth would affect the rest of the world through  trade channels (particularly Canada, Mexico, and emerging Asia) and, as highlighted  by the recent turmoil, probably through financial channels as well  As a second risk,  house-price valuations in many advanced economies appear elevated  Given that, a  correction in housing markets abroad—with potentially sizable accompanying wealth  effects—strikes us as an important downside risk for some countries  Third, although  we see average foreign inflation remaining well behaved, at near 2½ percent over the  next two years, inflation risks cannot be dismissed  After several years of  exceptionally strong economic growth, the foreign economies on average are now  operating near potential, and resource constraints may be more binding than we  currently envision  In addition, food prices have moved up in many countries, and  the prices of oil and other commodities are at high levels      Indeed, recent developments in oil markets seem to pose intensified risks  The   spot price of WTI is trading today at nearly $92 a barrel, up $5 since the Greenbook  went to bed  Since your last meeting, the spot WTI price has climbed $13 per barrel,  while the far-futures price has increased about $10 per barrel  It suffices to say that  underlying supply-demand conditions in the oil market are exceptionally tight  Over  the past several years, as the global economy has expanded briskly, oil production has  increased only sluggishly—reflecting both OPEC supply restraint and diminishing  production from OECD countries  Against this backdrop, the price of oil has been  driven up further in recent weeks by reports of decreasing inventories (at a time of   October 30-31, 2007 13 of 162    year when such stocks are typically on the rise) and by intensified concerns about the  stability of Middle East oil production, triggered by tensions between Turkey and Iraq  and by concerns about US relations with Iran  We see OPEC’s plans to expand  production 500,000 barrels per day beginning on November 1, even if fully  implemented, as unlikely to go very far in defusing the tightness in the market   Futures markets call for WTI prices to remain elevated, in the neighborhood of $80  per barrel, through 2015        I conclude with some upbeat news on US external performance  Exports   continue to surprise on the upside, having shown exceptional strength in the July and  August trade data, as exports of aircraft, autos, and agricultural products have all  expanded briskly  Consequently, as Dave mentioned, real exports of goods and  services are now thought to have surged at a pace of 17 percent in the third quarter,  up 3½ percentage points from the last forecast  We estimate that real imports in the  third quarter grew at a comparatively modest rate  Taken together, these data suggest  that net exports made an arithmetic contribution of 1¼ percentage points to US real  GDP growth in the third quarter     Going forward, we see export growth moderating to just under 8 percent in the   current quarter and proceeding at a solid 6½ percent average rate through the next  two years  Relative to our September forecast, the path of export growth is up nearly  2 percentage points in the fourth quarter and by lesser—but still sizable—amounts in  2008 and 2009  This higher projection reflects stimulus from recent declines in the  dollar, which have exceeded our previous projections  The broad dollar index has  dropped more than 3 percent since your last meeting  But in addition to support from  the weaker dollar, we now see greater underlying strength in exports than we had  previously thought  Our projected path for imports, in contrast, is little changed from  the last Greenbook  Import growth is slated to bounce up in the current quarter,  largely because of a seasonal rebound in oil imports  Thereafter, the projected  strengthening of US growth and a deceleration in core import prices should provide  increasing support to imports  All told, we see the external sector making a neutral  contribution to US real GDP growth in the fourth quarter, contributing  04 percentage point to economic growth next year, and returning to neutrality in  2009 as imports accelerate  Thus, to the extent that our forecast materializes, large  negative contributions from net exports might very well be a thing of the past  Brian  will now continue our presentation      In response to your first question, I think the answer is that it’s the   improvement in the net export contribution in the current account that’s being driven by both a   strengthening of exports and a softening of imports  The net export contribution or the direct   contribution of exports to GDP growth has risen roughly 25 basis points over the past couple of   years—so about ¼ percentage point  By the same token, the arithmetic negative drag from imports   has been reduced about 40 basis points  I think it’s strictly an arithmetic computational thing  Your   observation that it’s more imports than exports is absolutely right, comparing 2007 with where we   were several years ago  But certainly for the third quarter and for the second half, exports have been   extraordinarily strong, and imports have been softer than maybe they were a couple of years ago but   not extraordinarily weak  So in the near term, it’s more an export story  Then the other point is that   certainly you’re also correct that the softening of imports that we’ve seen over the past few years   has been driven in large measure by the softening of US domestic demand, and that’s probably—I   don’t have an exact decomposition here—on the order of two-thirds of the softening in imports  "
8278,2007-12-06,"  In conjunction with the establishment of the TAF, the staff   proposes that the FOMC authorize a temporary reciprocal currency arrangement with  the European Central Bank  This facility, which the ECB has requested, would  provide it with greater scope to issue dollar credit to euro-area banks  The proposal is  for a liquidity swap arrangement that would allow the ECB access to a cumulative  total of $20 billion outstanding, in tranches of up to $10 billion each, at any time over  the life of the arrangement  The swap facility would expire after six months unless  renewed  The purchase of US dollars with foreign currency would be based on the  prevailing spot exchange rate, and the ECB would pay interest on the foreign  currency held by the Federal Reserve  There is some possibility that the Swiss  National Bank may request a similar, albeit smaller, swap facility  This temporary  arrangement with the ECB is proposed to allow dollar funding problems now faced  by European banks, particularly at terms longer than overnight, to be addressed more  directly by their home central bank  Improved conditions in European dollar trading  would guard against the spillover of volatility in such trading to New York trading  and could help reduce term funding pressures in US markets  In addition, these  measures may help address the difficulties in the foreign exchange swap market,  which Bill has discussed  Establishment of this liquidity swap line, along with the  TAF, could have positive confidence effects  Moreover, given the strong financial  position of the ECB, the swap line would involve virtually no credit risk to the  Federal Reserve  By providing dollars to the ECB to use in its efforts to address term  dollar funding problems in Europe, we would assist credit markets without ourselves  providing funding to banks overseas  Sandy Krieger will now continue our  presentation       As to the question regarding the ECB’s reserves—indeed, the euro   system has roughly $200 billion of reserves, so it is substantial  This concern was raised in a   memo from Karen Johnson and Bill Dudley to the FOMC in September  Our response and our   sense about this, however, are that pursuing some sort of a cooperative arrangement with the   ECB would provide us with more advance information about what the ECB is planning to do and   would help facilitate monetary control  So we see some advantages arising from cooperation and   coordination as opposed to their injecting the reserves just on their own  "
8300,2007-12-11,"  The minimum bid will be one-month OIS    Our reading of the recent data suggests that economic activity   abroad decelerated toward the end of the third quarter and has remained on a  decelerating path thereafter  In the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada, this  softening of activity appears to reflect—at least in part—increasing drag from the  ongoing financial turmoil  Notably, in the euro area, business and consumer  confidence have weakened some in recent months, PMIs for both the services and  manufacturing sectors have declined, and recent readings on retail sales and industrial  production have softened  In the United Kingdom, indicators of sentiment and retail  sales also have slipped of late, and a slowdown in the housing sector is now under  way—with declines in net mortgage lending, mortgage approvals, and major indexes  of house prices  In response, the Bank of England late last week cut its key policy  rate 25 basis points, to 5½ percent  The Bank of Canada also lowered its policy rate a  notch last week, citing concerns about financial market turmoil     In assessing the impact of the financial turbulence, we continue to see little   evidence that the emerging-market economies are being significantly affected  Over  the past month or so, debt spreads for many of these economies have risen, and their  equity markets have given back some ground, but these moves are relatively mild  when viewed from a longer-term perspective  All told, foreign growth is projected to  step down from an average rate of nearly 4½ percent during the first three quarters of  this year to below 3 percent in the current quarter and early next year  In addition to  headwinds from the financial turmoil, this slowing reflects policy actions in some  countries (particularly China) to rein in above-trend growth, as well as the softer pace  of activity in the United States  Thereafter, we see foreign growth rising back to a  rate of 3¼ percent  This outlook is weaker over the next few quarters than in our  October projection, in line with the lower US forecast  In addition, given the  renewed market turbulence, we now see the drag from financial developments as  likely to be larger and more protracted than we had previously assumed  We continue  to believe that these effects will be felt mainly in the advanced economies, but an  important downside risk to our forecast is the possibility that the emerging-market  economies may be more affected than we now expect  On Friday, we received  revised Japanese GDP data for the third quarter  The latest estimate cuts growth in  the quarter to 15 percent at an annual rate, down 1 percentage point from the initial  reading  Notably, this growth can be attributed entirely to net exports, as domestic  demand contracted for the second consecutive quarter  Residential investment  plunged in the third quarter, as new building regulations temporarily weighed on  spending  Our forecast calls for domestic demand to bounce back quickly, but  downside risks are increasingly evident; for example, the profitability of small and  medium-sized companies has recently deteriorated, labor market conditions seem to  be softening, and wages continue to contract       December 11, 2007 18 of 138    The spot price of West Texas intermediate approached $100 per barrel in late  November, but mounting concerns about the near-term outlook for global activity  have since pushed the price back below $90 per barrel  At that level, spot WTI is  down a few dollars per barrel since the last FOMC meeting  Continued concerns  about the longer-term supply-demand balance, however, have kept the far-futures  price at its late-November level, near $87 per barrel—up about $7 since the last  FOMC meeting  Nonfuel commodity prices fell sharply in the third quarter and have  continued on a downward trajectory  The prices of copper and nickel have plunged,  driven by concerns that rising inventories may signal a softening of global demand  for these commodities  The price of zinc has fallen as well  Notably, however, the  prices of food commodities, including wheat, corn, and soybeans, have continued to  rise       This run-up in food prices, coupled with high oil prices, has stoked inflation in a   number of countries  For example, in the euro area, twelve-month headline inflation  has jumped from 17 percent in August to 3 percent in November, led by food and  energy prices, thus prompting the ECB to leave policy on hold at its meeting last  week  Going forward, this rise in inflation may continue to limit the ECB’s  willingness to ease policy, as fallout from the financial turmoil weighs on activity  In  the United Kingdom, however, a recent rebound in inflation to slightly above the  Bank of England’s 2 percent target—driven in part by rising food prices—did not  deter last week’s policy move  Indeed, in cutting rates, the BoE noted that “higher  energy and food prices are expected to keep inflation above the target in the short  term”  In China, food price inflation is running at more than 15 percent and has  pushed overall inflation to 69 percent in November  The pace of inflation has  elicited a range of policy responses from the authorities, including a move over the  weekend to further increase reserve requirements  Our forecast sees global food and  oil prices soon leveling off in line with quotes from futures markets, and this would  contribute to a welcome moderation of inflationary pressures in a number of  countries     Since the last FOMC meeting, the dollar has strengthened on balance, rising   1 percent on average against the major currencies and ½ percent in broad nominal  terms  Notwithstanding this reprieve from dollar depreciation, we continue to see the  current account deficit—which still exceeds 5 percent of GDP—as a key factor that is  likely to weigh on the exchange rate going forward  Thus our forecast incorporates  some modest further real depreciation of the dollar  Notably, this depreciation comes  entirely against our emerging-market trading partners, and we have slightly raised our  projections for the pace at which the renminbi and several other emerging Asian  currencies appreciate against the dollar     I conclude with a few words about the US external sector  We expect that export   growth, following its red-hot 19 percent performance in the third quarter, will  moderate to a still-strong pace of around 7 percent in the current quarter and through  the next two years, as exports are supported by past declines in the dollar and still- solid foreign activity  Import growth in the current quarter will be sustained at its   December 11, 2007 19 of 138    moderate third-quarter rate by a seasonal rebound in oil imports, but import growth is  expected to fall off during the first half of next year, in line with the softer pace of  US activity  Thereafter, imports are projected to gradually accelerate, as growth in  the United States firms  All told, we see net exports making positive arithmetic  contributions to growth of 01 percentage point in the fourth quarter of this year,  05 percentage point in 2008, and a little over 01 percentage point in 2009  That  concludes our prepared remarks, and we are happy to take questions       Just to underscore what Dave has said, our forecast is driven largely from   the quotes from futures markets  So, really, the question boils down to, Why in the world do the   futures markets expect the prices of these foodstuffs to decline?  I think a key factor is that there   are some important temporary developments that have driven up food prices  There have been   adverse weather conditions in a number of Asian economies  For example, in China, they had   floods earlier this year that have significantly driven up vegetable prices  In addition, there has   been a sustained drought in Australia that has driven up wheat prices significantly  It has been   several years that we have seen these drought conditions in Australia  It is an open issue as to   December 11, 2007 21 of 138    whether that goes away in 2008 or 2009, but the expectation is that at some point that is going to   abate somewhat   So we can point to temporary factors  There has also been a significant imprint on the   food prices of a move to ethanol in the United States, and that has driven up the price of corn  At   the same time, some acreage that had been in soybeans has shifted to corn, and that has reduced   the supply of soybeans and driven up that price as well  But it is our view and I think the view of   the futures markets that over time you are going to see some of these effects balanced out, and   the acreage production will be distributed in a way that will help bring these prices down  In   addition, you could get more acres brought into production of these foodstuffs   The final point that I want to emphasize here is that there are also some important   structural factors that are driving up food prices, two that I think are worth mentioning  One is   that you have a lot of people in these emerging-market economies who are a lot wealthier than   they were ten years ago, and they want to eat better, and the world is going to have to find a way   to produce more and higher-quality agricultural goods  It is imaginable that there will be some   upward pressure on price through that transition  The second important factor that I think is   structural is we have seen a sustained and now an apparently permanent increase in the price of   oil  It takes a lot of petroleum to produce these goods, so that is a longer-run factor that may   contribute to higher agricultural prices    Yes, just to echo what Dave said, we have very little hard data so far,   essentially no hard data for net exports for Q4  We will be receiving the October trade data later   this week  So at that point we’ll start getting a bit more insight into it  That said, we see the   contribution from net exports falling off from a substantial 14 percentage points in Q3 to just a   touch above 01 in Q4, and that’s driven by a moderation in export growth and continued 4 percent   import growth  But obviously there’s a lot of uncertainty around those projections  "
8369,2008-01-29,"  Your first international exhibits focus on the recent strength of  the US external sector  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 11, US exports are  now seen to have expanded at a moderate 4½ percent pace in the fourth quarter,  following the 19 percent surge in the third quarter  With import growth in the fourth  quarter stepping down to 2 percent, net exports are estimated—as shown on line 3— to have made a positive arithmetic contribution to real GDP growth of 02 percentage  point  Going forward, we see the external sector contributing 05 percentage point to  GDP growth in 2008 and 03 percentage point in 2009  Exports are expected to  expand at a crisp 7¼ percent pace in both years, supported by stimulus from the  weaker dollar  The pace of import growth, after stepping down on average in the first  half of this year, should pick up some through the forecast period, broadly mirroring  the contour of US growth  As shown in the bottom left panel, some additional  impetus to import growth should come from a projected decline in core import price  inflation, due to moderation in both exchange-rate-adjusted foreign prices (the red  bars) and commodity price increases (the blue bars)  Returning to line 4 of the upper  panel, we estimate that the current account deficit increased to 5½ percent of GDP  during the fourth quarter, driven up by a surge in the oil import bill  We see the  deficit declining to 4¾ percent of GDP in 2009, as the non-oil trade deficit narrows to  just 1½ percent of GDP  As shown on the bottom right, the oil import bill—which  has increased from around 1 percent of GDP early this decade to about 3 percent of  GDP at present—looms as an increasingly important factor influencing the evolution  of the current account balance     Your next exhibit examines US external performance from a longer-term   perspective  As shown in the top panel, the arithmetic contribution from net exports  was persistently negative from 1997 to 2005, subtracting ¾ percentage point on  average from the growth of US real GDP  The contribution from net exports,  however, has swung into positive territory over the past two years, adding about  ½ percentage point to growth, and we expect net exports to continue to make a  positive contribution over the next two years  As shown in the middle left panel, this  upswing in the net export contribution has reflected—in roughly equal measure—an  acceleration in exports and a slowing of import growth  Over the past two years,  export growth has stepped up to 8½ percent, more than twice its average 1997-2005  pace, and it is projected to moderate only slightly in 2008 and 2009  In contrast,  import growth over the past couple of years has fallen off to less than half its 1997- 2005 average and is expected to remain soft through the forecast period  The  individual contributions of exports and imports to US GDP growth have both risen  about ½ percentage point in recent years  This swing in US external performance  has been driven in large measure by the cumulative effects of the decline in the dollar  (shown on the middle right)  Since its peak in early 2002, the dollar is down more  than 20 percent in broad real terms, including a 30 percent fall against the major  currencies  We project that going forward the broad real dollar will depreciate at a  pace of a little less than 3 percent a year, with this decline coming disproportionately  against many of the emerging market currencies (including the Chinese renminbi),  which have moved less since the dollar’s peak in early 2002  The bottom panel  highlights another factor that has supported the shift in US external performance    January 29–30, 2008 28 of 249    From 1997 to 2005, US growth was on average just ¼ percentage point below that  of our trading partners  In recent years, US growth has slowed relative to foreign  growth, and this gap has widened substantially, reaching 1½ percentage points on  average in 2006 and 2007  This has, consequently, restrained imports relative to  exports  Our forecast calls for this gap to narrow only slightly through the forecast  period  But this projection depends crucially on the resilience of growth abroad—an  issue that is examined in your next exhibit     Recent data have confirmed our expectation that foreign activity slowed markedly   in the fourth quarter  As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 13, economic  sentiment in the euro area fell in December for the seventh consecutive month, and  the ECB’s survey of bank lending pointed to further tightening of credit standards for  both households and firms  In addition, euro-area retail sales volumes and industrial  production (not shown) have moved down in recent months  In the United Kingdom,  the preliminary reading on fourth-quarter GDP growth was surprisingly strong, but  other indicators seem to point to some softness going forward  As shown on the  right, the Bank of England’s new survey of credit conditions indicates a further  decline in the availability of credit to corporations during the fourth quarter, and the  level of new mortgage lending has plunged  Other indicators, including consumer  confidence, have also slid of late  The Japanese economy may be weakening as well   As shown in the middle left panel, the December Tankan survey showed a further  retreat in business confidence, including a softening of sentiment among both large  manufacturers and large nonmanufacturers  Housing starts have declined  dramatically lately, as the construction sector adjusts to new, tighter building  standards  We also see signs that labor market conditions may be weakening  As  shown in the bottom panel, our assessment is that total foreign GDP growth slowed to  about 2¾ percent during the fourth quarter, distinctly down from the 4 to 4½ percent  pace recorded through 2006 and the first three quarters of 2007  Notably, the fourth- quarter slowdown was broadly based  We estimate that growth in Mexico (line 8)  declined sharply, in line with a contraction in US manufacturing output  Chinese  GDP data, which were reported after the Greenbook went to press, indicate that  growth in the fourth quarter remained below its double-digit pace in the first half of  the year, with exports posting a contraction     The middle right panel summarizes what we see as the key sources of this near-  term slowing  First, a number of countries have experienced headwinds from the  ongoing financial turmoil; this is particularly the case for the euro area, the United  Kingdom, and Canada  In addition, sharp recent declines in equity markets have  occurred in a much broader set of countries  The softening of US growth is a second  factor weighing on activity abroad, especially for countries like Canada and Mexico  and many in emerging Asia that have sizable trade linkages with the United States   Third, through 2006 and 2007, many of the foreign economies enjoyed exceptionally  rapid cyclical expansions, so some eventual moderation in the pace of growth seemed  inevitable, and we have been projecting a deceleration for some time  Returning to  the bottom panel, we see these factors as continuing to weigh on foreign activity  through the first half of the year  Thereafter, growth should gradually strengthen, to   January 29–30, 2008 29 of 249    3 percent in the second half and to 34 percent in 2009, as financial turmoil subsides  and as the US economy rebounds  Nevertheless, we expect that growth will remain  well below the heady pace recorded over the past two years     As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 14, our foreign outlook is also supported   by projected easing of monetary policy abroad  Given mounting evidence of  economic weakness and continued financial stress, we see the ECB and the Bank of  Canada cutting policy rates 50 basis points by the middle of the year, and the Bank of  England easing 75 basis points  Given the persisting inflation risks, this is admittedly  an aggressive call  But we see the case for monetary action as compelling and believe  that these central banks will be persuaded, notwithstanding their recent hawkish  rhetoric  The futures markets also appear to be pricing in some easing, albeit at a  more gradual pace than we envision  Finally, we now expect the BoJ to remain on  hold until the end of 2009  To be sure, there are a number of risks surrounding our  forecast, most of which are on the downside  First, the prevailing financial  headwinds or the slowing of US growth may be larger or more protracted than we  currently project  Second, we do not yet have a good sense of the extent to which  many foreign financial institutions have been affected by the recent turmoil, and the  release of year-end financial statements over the next six weeks or so could bring  some bad news  A third risk is that overly optimistic expectations of decoupling may  lead to policy mistakes  Specifically, to the extent that foreign authorities are  convinced that they have decoupled from the United States—or that they are immune  from spillovers due to the financial turmoil—they may be too slow to ease policy to  address weakening demand  Policy abroad may also be restrained by too narrow a  focus on the recent rise in inflation, a topic to which I will return momentarily   Finally, housing markets in some countries may be vulnerable  As shown in the  bottom left panel, many countries have experienced run-ups in house prices in recent  years that are similar to or even exceed those recorded in the United States, and house  prices are now decelerating sharply in a number of these countries  Further  weakening of house prices poses the risk of adverse wealth effects  Notably, of the  major economies shown in the right panel, only the United States has yet seen a  marked downward swing in the contributions from residential investment to GDP  growth     Your final international exhibit discusses our projections for foreign inflation  As   shown in the top panel of exhibit 15, average foreign inflation jumped up to an annual  rate of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter, with marked increases in both the advanced  foreign economies (line 2) and the emerging markets (line 7)  The sources of this rise  in inflation—including rapid increases in the prices of food and oil—have been well  documented  Going forward, we see average foreign inflation moving back down to  an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second half of this year and continuing at that pace  in 2009  Despite the run-up in realized inflation rates, readings on long-term inflation  expectations have remained well anchored  As shown in the middle left panel,  breakeven inflation rates for the advanced foreign economies have continued to hover  around 23 percent on average, and long-term inflation forecasts have stayed near 2  percent  For the emerging markets, average long-term inflation forecasts (shown on   January 29–30, 2008 30 of 249    the middle right) have remained between 3 and 3½ percent in recent years  The  bottom panels show four-quarter percent changes for the prices of oil, food, and  metals  Given the marked slowing of global activity, the stage seems set for some  deceleration in commodity prices; indeed, metals prices are already on a downward  trajectory  Thus, in line with quotes from futures markets, we see the pace of  increases in oil prices and food prices as declining significantly over the next few  quarters  Nevertheless, we have been wrong on this score before and freely  acknowledge that there are upside risks to this projection  Brian Madigan will now  continue our presentation      We are happy to hear that there is demand for a bigger international   section  [Laughter]  You had better be careful what you wish for      Right  Just a word of background  The rationale for the falloff is the   expected decline in these commodity prices and the expected slowing of global demand  Now,   January 29–30, 2008 39 of 249    thinking about the risks, I am reasonably convinced that global demand is going to slow, which I   believe will translate into reduced demand for many of these commodities that have driven up   inflation  However, that says something only about the demand side of these commodity   markets  There is also a lot going on on the supply side  At the last FOMC meeting, we talked   about ethanol and the fact that many of these emerging-market countries are wealthier, that they   want to eat better than they used to, that the relative price of energy has risen, and that it takes a   lot of energy to raise these crops  So there are supply factors as well as demand factors at work   in driving up these commodity prices  It is very hard for us to forecast the supply side of these   markets  It is driven by things like weather and geopolitical developments and so on and so   forth  On the commodities, my sense is that demand is going to shift in to some extent  As long   as the supply doesn’t shift in as well, we should be able to see a decline, or at least a slower rate   of increase, in these prices  A very important point here is that, in order to get less of an impetus   coming from commodity prices and inflation in these countries, we don’t necessarily need oil   prices to come down in level terms  We just need them to stop going up at such rapid rates  If   we get slower rates of price increases, that will be disinflationary relative to where we have been    That is how I would characterize the risks around this forecast, mainly on the supply side of   these commodity markets  "
8411,2008-03-18,"  The global economy has likewise seen some extraordinary   developments during the intermeeting period  Notably, the spot price of WTI has  surged more than 15 percent, briefly reaching $110 per barrel, and many nonfuel  commodities prices have moved up by similar magnitudes  The exchange value of  the dollar, which had been relatively stable since November, has returned to a  depreciating path, falling more than 5 percent against the major currencies since mid- February and reaching a post–Bretton Woods low  The global financial stresses that  began last summer have further intensified  Also, as Dave has outlined, recent data  suggest that the US economy has continued to weaken  Nevertheless, not all the  news from the foreign sector has been grim  Indeed, given the shocks that have  materialized, the foreign economies appear to be showing somewhat more resilience  than we would have expected       Total foreign real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year stepped down to   32 percent from the rapid 45 percent rate that had prevailed through the previous  three quarters, as the pace of activity slowed in both the advanced economies and the  emerging market economies  This fourth-quarter out-turn, however, was about  ½ percentage point stronger than we had expected, reflecting an upside surprise in the  emerging markets  Available indicators of first-quarter activity paint a mixed picture   In the euro area, economic sentiment fell in February for the ninth consecutive month,  but the purchasing managers index for the services sector and the German IFO index  of business conditions picked up  In addition, industrial production and retail sales  posted stronger readings in January  The ECB’s bank-lending survey indicates a  tightening of lending standards, but measures of bank credit to the corporate sector  have continued to expand  Indicators of activity in the United Kingdom have also  been mixed  Consumer confidence in February slid to a five-year low, but business  confidence and conditions in the services sector have been more upbeat  In emerging  Asia, while the impetus from external demand is clearly diminishing, Chinese retail  sales have continued to grow robustly; industrial production in Korea, Singapore, and   March 18, 2008 18 of 127    Taiwan moved up in January; and domestic consumption in the ASEAN countries has  remained solid  Taken together, these data seem to indicate that growth abroad has  cooled but has not stalled      Our forecast thus seeks to balance several offsetting considerations  On the one   hand, the projection for US growth this year has been cut by a sizable 1½ percentage  points; this has particularly stark implications for countries like Canada, Mexico, and  some in emerging Asia that have close trade ties with the United States  The further  deterioration in global financial conditions should also weigh on activity abroad  On  the other hand, the incoming data suggest that the foreign economies are not yet  following the United States into recession, and the red-hot commodities markets also  lead us to believe that activity is holding up in some corners of the world        Weighing these factors, we have cut our forecast for total foreign growth in   2008 to 23 percent, down from 29 percent in the last Greenbook, with much of this  markdown reflecting softer growth in Canada and Mexico  Our projections for  emerging Asia have also been reduced, but we see these economies still expanding at  a moderate pace  Clearly, there are both upside and downside risks around this  forecast  On the downside, the adverse spillovers from the US slowdown and  continued financial stresses may be more severe and more broadly felt than we  envision  On the upside, the apparent resilience in foreign demand to date suggests  the possibility that growth abroad may hold up better than we now expect  In 2009,  foreign growth is projected to rebound to 3½ percent, in line with the expected easing  of global financial stresses and economic recovery in the United States        With commodities prices increasing sharply, foreign inflation has continued to   rise  Notably, in the euro area, 12-month headline consumer price inflation climbed  to 33 percent in February, well above the ECB’s 2 percent ceiling, driven up by food  and energy prices  In China, 12-month inflation in February surged to 87 percent, at  least in part reflecting sharp increases in food prices due to severe winter weather  In  an effort to temper these pressures, the Chinese authorities have introduced temporary  price controls for some basic necessities and this morning announced plans to raise  reserve requirements another 50 basis points  We now see average foreign inflation  in 2008 as coming in at around 3¼ percent, up ¾ percentage point from the last  Greenbook       Central banks have responded to this cocktail of slowing growth and higher-  than-desired inflation in divergent ways  To date, the ECB has held its policy rate  firm at 4 percent, citing the level of headline inflation, possible second-round effects  from commodity price increases, and risks from ongoing wage negotiations  Given  these concerns, we now expect the ECB to remain on hold a while longer but, in  response to a projected further slowing of activity, to cut rates 50 basis points later  this year  The Bank of England, in contrast, has reduced its policy rate 50 basis  points since the fall—and we expect another 75 basis points by year-end—in an effort  to cushion the economy against financial headwinds and slowing in the housing and  commercial real estate sectors  Finally, the Bank of Canada has reduced rates   March 18, 2008 19 of 127    100 basis points since the autumn, in response to downdrafts from the United States  and the strong Canadian dollar, and the Bank has indicated that “further monetary  stimulus is likely to be required”  Thus we see another 50 basis points of easing in  the second quarter        As noted earlier, the dollar has depreciated more than 5 percent against the   major currencies since mid-February as the widening divergence between the path of  policy rates in the United States and other industrial countries, particularly the euro  area, has weighed on the dollar  As a related factor, the tone of the recent US  economic data has been much softer than for most other advanced economies  In  broad real terms, the path of the dollar in our current forecast is about 2½ percent  weaker than in the January Greenbook  Going forward, our forecast calls for the  broad real dollar to decline at a 3 percent annual rate, with this depreciation expected  to come disproportionately against the currencies of the emerging market economies      I conclude with a few words regarding the performance of the US external   sector  The January trade data showed exports continuing to rise at a healthy pace  while nonpetroleum imports contracted  Imports of consumer goods were  particularly soft  For 2008 as whole, we now expect the external sector to contribute  a substantial 12 percentage points to growth, about twice as much as in our previous  forecast  To be sure, much of this larger arithmetic contribution from net exports  reflects a contraction in imports caused by the slowdown in US demand  However,  part of the reduction in imports is also due to the decline in the dollar  Exports this  year are seen to grow at a pace of nearly 7 percent, just a touch less than in the last  Greenbook, as the effects of the weaker dollar almost offset the markdown in foreign  growth  In 2009, imports rebound as the US economy recovers, and the positive  contribution from net exports accordingly shrinks to about ⅓ percentage point   Finally, yesterday the BEA reported that the current account deficit narrowed to  49 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter, its smallest share of GDP since 2004  We  had expected the rise in oil prices to drive up the deficit, but this was more than offset  by a marked improvement in net investment income, partly as earnings received by  foreigners on their investments in the US financial sector declined, reflecting the  effects of the ongoing financial turmoil  We will now be happy to take your  questions      Over the intermeeting period we have lived through an experience that   manifests the upside risk to our inflation forecast; and I would indicate that, with the   ¾ percentage point markup to headline foreign inflation in 2008 in our forecast, the vast majority   of that is a reflection of these red-hot commodity markets, which then presses the question to us,   Well, what is going on there?  Certainly, in the case of the demand in these markets, by now I   would have expected to have seen some attenuation or a bit of softening  Really, it seems to be   quite the opposite  The demand since the first of the year has accelerated  Some other factors   are at work as well—idiosyncratic supply stories, electrical outages that made it harder to smelt   aluminum and copper, and so on  So there are some supply factors as well  The demand side   seems to be important, and to the extent that demand remains strong, I am not sure where these   commodity prices are going to top out  The futures path is a reasonable guess at sort of the   balance of supply and demand  There is also some upward pressure on these prices from the   March 18, 2008 21 of 127    depreciation of the dollar  But to the extent that commodity prices move up, I would say that we   will probably be marking up our forecast of foreign inflation next time     Just a broader comment on the linkages between the US and the foreign economies—  again, I was surprised at the strength of demand in these commodity markets  I would have   expected by this point to have seen more marked evidence of slowing in the foreign economies    So we have marked down our forecast for 2008 in line with these prospective developments, the   further slowing in the United States, and the financial stresses  But we didn’t mark down our   forecast very much, just a tenth or two, and mainly in Canada in Q1; and the data that we have in   hand are not pointing to a dramatic slowing  We are expecting more of that to come through in   the second and the third quarters  "
8437,2008-04-29,"  Much as Dave just described for the domestic economy, our   forecast for economic activity abroad also is little changed from the last Greenbook   Recent data have come in consistent with our view that the slowdown in US activity  and the ongoing financial turbulence will leave an unmistakable imprint on economic  growth abroad  But the extent of this imprint appears to be somewhat less  pronounced than was the case in the high-tech-led recession earlier this decade,  particularly for the emerging market economies  Thus we continue to see foreign  growth stepping down from last year’s 4 percent pace to near 2 percent during the  second and third quarters of this year, as foreign activity is constrained by the  weakening US economy and headwinds from the ongoing financial turmoil  With  these factors projected to abate, we see growth abroad rising back to near its trend  rate of around 3½ percent in 2009       April 29–30, 2008 25 of 266    Suffice it to say, the risks around this forecast remain significant  On the upside,  China’s surprisingly strong first-quarter GDP growth—which we estimate was nearly  11 percent at an annual rate—highlights the possibility that growth in emerging Asia,  and perhaps elsewhere as well, may remain more resilient than we anticipate  On the  downside, the softer-than-expected German IFO data last week and the negative tone  of the Bank of England’s recent credit conditions survey suggest that growth in  Europe may slow more than we now project     The exchange value of the dollar, after falling sharply in the month before the   March FOMC meeting, has rebounded somewhat during the intermeeting period   Against the major currencies, the dollar is up almost 2½ percent, with a particularly  sizable gain against the yen  Going forward, we continue to see the broad real dollar  depreciating at a 3 percent pace, reflecting downward pressures associated with the  large (albeit narrowing) current account deficit  This depreciation is expected to  come largely against emerging market currencies (including the Chinese renminbi),  which have moved less since the dollar’s peak in early 2002     Turning to the US external sector, we now see the arithmetic contribution from   net exports to first-quarter US real GDP growth as likely to be around  03 percentage point, down a few tenths from the last Greenbook  Recent readings on  exports have continued to point to strength, but imports in February bounced back  from their December and January weakness more vigorously than we had expected   For 2008 as a whole, we continue to believe that the demand for imports will be  significantly restrained by the weak pace of US activity and, to a lesser extent, by  the depreciation of the dollar and rising prices for imported commodities  We thus  see imports contracting nearly 2 percent this year  In contrast, exports are expected to  post 7 percent growth this year, supported by the weaker dollar  The projected  contraction of imports, coupled with still-strong export growth, suggests that net  exports will contribute nearly 1¼ percentage points to US GDP growth this year— the largest positive contribution from net exports to annual growth in more than 25  years  In 2009, import growth is expected to bounce back to around 4 percent as the  US economy recovers, and the positive contribution from net exports should  accordingly decline to just under ½ percentage point     Oil prices have continued their apparently relentless march upward, with spot   WTI now trading at $115 per barrel  Since your last meeting, the spot price of WTI  has increased $6 per barrel, and the far-futures price has moved up almost $5 per  barrel  Over the past year, spot oil prices have risen a staggering 80 percent  While  the high level of oil prices appears to be taking a bite out of oil demand in the United  States and other industrial countries, the demand for oil in the emerging market  economies—particularly in China and India—has been supported by the resilience of  GDP growth there  In addition, fuel subsidies in some countries (including India)  have sheltered consumers from the effects of higher oil prices  In line with these  observations, India’s state-owned oil company recently released projections  indicating that oil demand in the country will increase 8 to 10 percent this year        April 29–30, 2008 26 of 266    The supply-side response to the rising demand for oil has been only tepid  Stated  bluntly, OPEC remains unwilling—or unable—to increase its supply to the market   Indeed, OPEC has actually cut its production over the past two years  In addition, oil  production in the OECD countries has been on a downward trajectory, primarily  reflecting the decline in the North Sea fields and in Mexico’s giant Cantarell field   Mexico’s state-owned oil company recently indicated that, for the sixth consecutive  year, additions to its reserves had failed to keep pace with production  The grim  outlook for Mexico’s oil industry has prompted the government to consider allowing  foreign investment in the country’s energy sector, a move that would require  constitutional reform  Finally, although the potential supply from non-OECD non- OPEC countries is substantial, production continues to be hampered by inadequate  infrastructure and by uncertainties about property rights and the stability of tax  regimes  In the absence of any better approach, we continue to base our forecast on  quotes from futures markets, which see oil prices as likely to remain high—at or  above $110 per barrel—through the end of the forecast period  But the confidence  bands around this forecast are exceptionally wide given uncertainties surrounding the  outlook for oil supply and demand      Nonfuel commodity prices have also been on a wild ride of late  The prices of   many of these commodities increased particularly sharply in January and February,  before peaking in early March  On balance, our index of nonfuel commodity prices  rose at a hefty annual rate of 50 percent during the first quarter  We project a further  13 percent rise in the second quarter, but—again in line with quotes from futures  markets—we see these prices flattening out thereafter  The underlying drivers of the  sustained run-up in the prices of nonfuel commodities have been broadly similar to  those for oil—sharp increases in demand (particularly from emerging-market  economies) coupled with typically lagging and often muted supply responses   Notably, however, moves in nonfuel commodity prices since the March FOMC  meeting have been quite varied  For example, copper and aluminum prices are up  whereas nickel and zinc prices are down  For foods, corn, rice, and soybean prices  have risen while wheat prices have declined substantially        The overall strength of commodity prices continues to put upward pressure on   inflation in many countries and to complicate life for central banks  Notably, in the  euro area, 12-month headline inflation in March rose further, to 36 percent, well  above the ECB’s 2 percent ceiling  In the United Kingdom, inflation pressures  stemming from rising utility, gasoline, and food prices are likely to push inflation  toward 3 percent during the summer, raising the risk that Mervyn King will be  required to write another letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining why  inflation has deviated from the 2 percent target  Concerns about the inflation outlook  have limited the willingness of both the ECB and the Bank of England to cut policy  rates to address slowing growth  Perhaps even more striking, faced with upward  pressures on inflation from rising food and energy prices coupled with still-solid  economic growth, central banks in a broad array of emerging market economies  tightened policy over the intermeeting period  This group included China, Singapore,  India, Brazil, Russia, Poland, Hungary, and South Africa  In addition, some countries   April 29–30, 2008 27 of 266    have recently responded to social unrest and other strains brought on by higher food  prices by restricting exports of foodstuffs, particularly rice, and this has exacerbated  upward pressure on the global prices of these commodities     The run-up in commodity prices, coupled with the weaker dollar, has pushed up   US core import price inflation of late  Core import prices are now estimated to have  increased at a 7½ percent annual rate in the first quarter, more than twice the pace of  increase in the second half of last year  Prices of material-intensive imports  (including industrial supplies and foods) are seen to have surged at a surprisingly  rapid pace of 20 percent in the first quarter, on the back of the rapid rise in  commodity prices  Prices of imported finished goods (including consumer goods,  capital goods, and autos) are estimated to have risen at a comparatively muted rate of  3¾ percent, but this also was up sharply compared with recent quarters  The  acceleration in finished goods prices seems well explained by recent moves in the  dollar, however, and does not suggest any notable increase in the extent of exchange  rate pass-through  Going forward, we see core import price inflation remaining  elevated in the second quarter, at around 6 percent  Thereafter, core import price  inflation should abate, given the projected flattening out of commodity prices and the  slower pace of dollar depreciation      It is, quite frankly, pretty tough to get a straight and compelling answer out   of the OPEC folks about how they think about the oil markets  A number of us have sat in   international meetings and listened to various explanations  In fact, at one recent meeting in Basel,   the representative from Saudi Arabia indicated that OPEC was not prepared to supply any more oil   to the market because the market was already well supplied at the equilibrium price  It is really   quite frustrating  Now, what they say in these meetings is that their analysis of supply-and-demand   fundamentals would suggest a price of $70 a barrel, $80 a barrel, or something like that  Then they   blame the residual on speculators and so on, and we spend a fair amount of time looking for such   speculative effects in these oil prices, and we wouldn’t want to rule anything out  I mean, from   what we’ve seen, there may be an explanation out there that eludes us, but there are a number of   things that we would expect to see if it were speculation—for instance, run-ups in inventories—that   we don’t see  We have also looked at the behavior of noncommercial traders, and it does not seem   as though the noncommercial traders are actually predicting prices  Quite the opposite—they seem   April 29–30, 2008 35 of 266    to be chasing the price, which is quite different from what we would have expected  Most recently,   in a statement just this week, OPEC’s president linked the run-up in oil prices to the depreciation of   the dollar and indicated that, for every 1 percent decline in the dollar, oil prices would rise $400 a   barrel, which strikes us as being just absolutely extraordinary  We can see 1 percent on the dollar   moving oil prices 1 percent, but to get a coefficient beyond that just seems—I don’t want to say   “economically impossible,” but I’d like to see the model that generates it  Now, about how they   actually talk about oil prices behind closed doors, I don’t have any additional insight to provide   other than what I’ve heard them say in some of these international meetings   Certainly in our analysis we try to think through the outlook for demand from countries like   China and India  In fact, quite regularly we do a full-blown supply-and-demand balance exercise in   which we say, “Here is the price  What kind of supply-and-demand fundamentals would be   necessary to deliver that price?”  We use the IEA, the EIA, and others as input, but we actually do   our own separate analyses  We try to think very granularly about the demand from these emerging   market countries and the implications that that has on the price   As to the last part of your question, I think certainly it’s true, at least until recently, that there   was a sense on the part of OPEC that, if they allowed the price to stay too high for too long, there   would be a significant supply response that would end up driving the price back down  Now, the   fact that they seem quite comfortable to live with the price of $115 or $120 a barrel suggests to me   that maybe they have come to the conclusion that there is just more demand out there and, in some   sense, they are going to ride the wave of this increasing demand in some of these emerging market   economies  That said, the prices have risen a lot  They’re up 75 percent or 80 percent over the past   year  A year ago I’m sure that that’s not what my predecessor was forecasting, and it’s hard for me   to imagine that we’re going to see oil at $200 a barrel  Nevertheless, given the income and price   April 29–30, 2008 36 of 266    elasticities of this thing, our view is that 1 percent greater global demand that’s not met by supply   could very well push prices up at least 10 percent  It isn’t going to take a whole lot of surprise on   global demand to have a significant impact on prices  As I said, I think that OPEC is aware of that   and is willing to run the risk that there may be at some point a large supply response that could put   significant downward pressure on the price of oil  "
8462,2008-06-24,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given that developments in global  commodities markets have continued to have influential effects on our forecast for  domestic activity and prices, we felt that it would be useful for me to lead off with the  international portion of the chart show, which will include a discussion of these  markets  Following my remarks, Larry and Bill will present our outlook for the US  economy      As shown in the top panel of your first exhibit, total foreign real GDP growth   (line 1) stepped down from an average pace of 4½ percent in the first three quarters of  2007 to around 3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this  year  We see growth abroad as likely to decline to 22 percent in the current quarter  and to pick up only slightly in the second half of the year  Next year, with the  expected firming of US activity and diminishing headwinds from the financial  turmoil, foreign growth should rise back to a 3½ percent pace  Growth abroad was  just a bit stronger in the first quarter than we had anticipated, but the composition of  that growth came as more of a surprise  Canadian GDP (line 3) posted a slight  contraction, reflecting a continuing downturn in exports and stagnant investment  In  contrast, the pace of activity in Japan (line 4) and the euro area (line 5) was much  more vigorous than we had expected, including a 6¼ percent surge in Germany   Nevertheless, recent data for these economies point to much weaker growth in the  second quarter  As shown in the middle left panel, Japanese manufacturing output                                                     2 The materials used by Messrs Sheets, Slifman, and Wascher are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   June 24–25, 2008 11 of 253    has declined recently, and labor market conditions have softened  For the euro area  (the middle right), various indicators are showing weakness, including retail sales and  the purchasing managers’ index  As highlighted in the bottom panel, growth in the  emerging market economies is expected to step down over the next few quarters but  should remain relatively resilient, especially compared with the weak performance of  these economies during the US recession earlier this decade  Many of the EMEs  were particularly vulnerable to the high-tech- and manufacturing-led downturn that  occurred at that time, and fundamentals in the EMEs are now stronger than was then  the case  In addition, Chinese domestic demand has remained quite robust of late,  and this has likely helped to support growth in emerging Asia     As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 2, oil prices have continued to soar with   the spot price of WTI closing yesterday at $136 per barrel  The far-dated futures  price has climbed to about the same level  Our forecast for the path of oil prices is  now roughly $50 a barrel higher than at the time of the January chart show  Divining  the causes of this staggering rise in oil prices is no doubt ground on which angels fear  to tread, but we continue to assert bravely that the primary driver of higher oil prices  is constrained (and price inelastic) oil supply coupled with relatively strong (and price  inelastic) oil demand  These deep features of the oil market—along with stressed  geopolitical conditions in many oil-producing countries, rising production costs, and  concern about the reliability of medium- to long-run supply—have sent oil prices  spiraling upward       As shown in the last column of the middle table, the increase in oil prices appears   to have contributed to modest declines in oil consumption in the advanced economies,  including the United States (line 3)  But oil consumption has continued to move up in  the emerging market economies, especially in China (line 5) and the Middle East (line  6)  Consumers in many EMEs have been shielded from rising prices by government  fuel subsidies  The economic and fiscal costs of such subsidies are becoming  increasingly burdensome, however, prompting some countries (including China late  last week) to allow domestic fuel prices to move toward world levels  As seen on the  top right, oil inventories in OECD countries have declined over the past year and a  half  Unfortunately, little information is available about the behavior of inventories  outside of OECD countries       The bottom left panel shows that the rise in global oil production since 2004 has   significantly lagged the expansion of world GDP (weighted by oil consumption);  indeed, production has remained relatively flat during most of that period  Notably,  however, the lack of oil production is not due to geological constraints  Data on years  of proved reserves (shown on the bottom right) are at roughly the same level as a  decade ago  But those reserves are now concentrated in areas where production is  constrained by acute geopolitical risks, uncertainty about property rights, inadequate  investment, and high production costs       Turning to your next exhibit, nonfuel commodity prices have also risen   significantly on average since your last chart show, with most of the increase coming   June 24–25, 2008 12 of 253    in the first few months of the year  Here, too, we believe that the elevated level of  prices is a result mainly of strong and sustained global demand, lagging supply  responses, and rising production costs  Consistent with this observation, inventories  of key commodities, shown in the middle left panel, have trended down in recent  years  It bears emphasizing, however, that nonfuel commodity prices certainly have  not moved in lockstep with each other  As seen in the bottom left panel, the price of  corn has surged to new highs, supported by ethanol demand and, more recently, as  adverse weather in the Midwest has endangered a substantial fraction of this year’s  crop  In contrast, the price of wheat has fallen back from its recent peak, as improved  growing conditions in Australia seem likely to boost supply  For metals, the price of  zinc has moved down significantly since its peak in late 2006, as new smelters have  come on line  The price of copper has moved sideways—but at a high level—over  the past two years, as prospective increases in supply have not yet materialized       A number of other explanations for the recent run-up in oil and other commodity   prices have also been advanced, including the possibility that increased purchases by  “speculators” in commodity futures markets may be playing an important role  Given  the magnitude of the financial flows into these markets, we are hesitant to slam the  door completely on this explanation, but our work finds little supporting evidence   As noted on the top right, prices of a number of commodities that are not traded in  futures markets have also risen substantially  Second, a sustained increase in demand  by investors would suggest that inventories should be rising; instead, as I have noted,  inventories are now relatively tight  Finally, we see no evidence that the positions  taken by noncommercial traders in futures markets actually predict commodity prices;  for example, such positions for light sweet crude oil on the New York Mercantile  Exchange have been roughly flat since mid-2007  Two other frequently cited  explanations for the rise in commodity prices are the depreciation of the dollar and  declines in interest rates  The middle-right panel shows the correlation of the broad  nominal dollar with oil prices and with an index of nonfuel commodity prices  Both  correlations are negative over most of the sample, implying that depreciations of the  dollar have tended to happen at the same time as rises in commodity prices  While  these correlations have become more negative since mid-2007, they remain within the  ranges seen in recent years, and interpreting the direction of causality for this  relationship is difficult  Also, as Bill noted, the dollar has been relatively stable over  the past several months, but oil prices have continued their upward climb  Similar  plots of correlations of interest rates with commodity prices (shown on the bottom  right) are quite noisy and fail to point to any clear conclusions     As shown in exhibit 4, the run-up in commodity prices has continued to lift   headline consumer price inflation in both the advanced foreign economies and the  emerging markets  We expect that inflation abroad will remain elevated in the near  term but eventually move back down as slower global growth reduces pressures on  resources and as commodity prices flatten out (consistent with quotes from futures  markets)  Of course, one clear risk to these projections is that commodity prices may,  yet again, confound our expectations and continue rising  Another risk is that the  high rates of inflation now being recorded may become embedded in inflation   June 24–25, 2008 13 of 253    expectations  As shown in the top right panels, measures of long-term inflation  compensation have recently edged up in the euro area and increased more markedly  in Canada  In recent weeks, major foreign central banks have intensified their  inflation-fighting rhetoric  Notably, the ECB has warned that it may raise rates at its  next meeting; and in the United Kingdom, Mervyn King—in his letter to the  Chancellor—underscored his determination to ensure that inflation remains  contained  As shown on the bottom left, we now assume that both the ECB and the  Bank of England will raise rates in the second half of this year, compared with the  near-term cuts we had anticipated in the April Greenbook  In addition, we now see  the Bank of Canada keeping policy on hold  In the emerging market economies,  including Mexico and China (the bottom right panel), increases in inflation have  largely been driven by rising food prices, which account for a substantial share of  consumer expenditures  Policymakers in the EMEs have taken steps to slow the rise  in food prices, with some countries introducing price controls and export bans on  agricultural goods  But officials have also relied on more-orthodox policies to  combat inflation, including raising policy rates and hiking reserve requirements   Indeed, over the intermeeting period, monetary policy was tightened in a range of  emerging market economies, including Mexico, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and  Hungary       As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 5, the path of the broad real dollar is now   just a little weaker than we anticipated at the time of the January chart show  We  continue to expect the dollar to depreciate at an annual rate of 3 percent through the  forecast period, reflecting persisting downward pressures associated with the current  account deficit  This depreciation is projected to come largely against emerging  market currencies (including the Chinese renminbi), which have moved less since the  dollar’s peak in early 2002  It’s safe to say that core import price inflation (on the  right) has come in substantially higher than we projected in January  Incorporating  the BLS monthly data for April and May, we now see core import prices in the  second quarter surging at an annual rate of 10½ percent, the fastest rise in two  decades  This increase, which comes on the heels of an 8 percent jump in the first  quarter, was heavily concentrated in material-intensive goods and suggests a much  more rapid and, perhaps, stronger effect from the run-up in commodity prices than we  saw in the past  Conditional on nonfuel commodity prices flattening out, core import  price inflation should decline to less than 2 percent next year       Finally, summing up what these developments mean for US activity, we now see   the contribution from net exports to US real GDP growth (line 3 in the table) as  likely to exceed 2 percentage points in the second quarter, as exports expand at a  smart pace (supported by the lower dollar) and imports contract sharply  This marked  weakness in imports reflects both a steep drop in real oil imports and a continued  decline in imports of core goods (reflecting sluggish US GDP growth and rising  prices of imported commodities)  The positive contribution from net exports  moderates to ¾ percentage point in the second half of this year and to ½ percentage  point in 2009  While the pace of export growth is projected to remain strong, at   June 24–25, 2008 14 of 253    above 7 percent, imports should gradually accelerate as the US economy recovers   Larry will now continue our presentation      You are asking particularly with respect to the emerging market   economies?    In the process of preparing our forecast, we do come up with estimates of   slack for the emerging market economies, but we are not inclined to put a whole lot of weight on   them  The concept of an output gap is not really a well-defined construct for, say, China    Nevertheless, these economies will be growing a little more slowly than they have in the past,   and some of the pressures on resources associated with that growth may abate a bit  I think that   is at least a piece of the story of what you see here as the decline  But at the end of the day, it   has to be a story about commodity prices  Food prices and energy prices have pushed this up    Depending on exactly which emerging market economy you’re in, food prices will range   anywhere from 25 percent to 33 percent of their basket  As long as those food prices and energy   prices are moving up dramatically, you are going to see rapid increases in inflation  So the   decline that you are seeing in this chart really is conditioned first and foremost on commodity   prices flattening out  I wish I had a better story    Oh, absolutely    Yes  The spike that we have seen is driven particularly by commodity   prices  The depreciation of the dollar has played a secondary role, so the decline in core import   price inflation to below 2 percent next year is conditioned crucially on commodity prices   flattening out and the dollar not depreciating as rapidly as it has over the past few years  "
8534,2008-09-16,"  I believe that number is about $180 billion of dollar reserves in the euro   system  The ECB itself has control of only a fraction of that    I also will be very brief in summarizing economic developments   abroad  Indeed, I would just like to make six very brief points  The first one is that the  incoming data we’ve received since the last Greenbook for the foreign economies have  been extraordinarily soft  Indeed, we’ve marked down our forecast or projection of the  second quarter by a full percentage point  The data also suggest that we should carry  forward a fair amount of that softness at least through the next year  So our foreign  outlook is much softer than it was before     The second point is that this softening outlook in our view has been a key factor that   has contributed to further sizable declines in oil and commodity prices  This morning,  oil prices were trading around $92 a barrel, which was down another $25 a barrel from  where we were at the time of the last meeting     The third point is that this deteriorating foreign outlook also seems to have triggered   something of a reassessment in currency markets  Since your last meeting, the dollar  has strengthened nearly 5 percent in broad nominal terms  In our view, what happened  in currency markets was that the markets had priced in the expectation that the foreign  economies would remain quite resilient in the face of a slowing in the United States    September 16, 2008 22 of 108    Now with the incoming data over the past couple of months, it is becoming clearer and  clearer that the US slowing is going to have a marked effect on these foreign  economies, and this has shifted the relative attractiveness of the dollar and supported the  appreciation that we’ve seen over the last couple of months     The fourth point is that, in a number of emerging market economies, we’ve seen a   resurgence of certain sorts of financial vulnerabilities  We’ve seen across really a broad  array of these economies rising external debt spreads and rising CDS spreads  We’ve  seen falling equity prices and, for a number of these economies, downward pressures on  their currencies  On that last point, a number of the Asians have been intervening in the  foreign exchange market over the intermeeting period but have actually been intervening  to try to prevent their currencies from depreciating, which is a marked change from what  we’ve seen in the last couple of years     The fifth point is that the surprisingly strong performance of US exports that we’ve   seen appears to have continued through July  After the Greenbook went to bed, we got  the July trade data, and they continue to point to a fair amount of strength in the export  sector  It was particularly strong in the auto sector, but it was a broad-based strength  through July  Nevertheless, our view is that, given the rise in the dollar and the  softening outlook for foreign growth, we’re very likely to see some slowing in export  growth going forward     The final point I’d like to mention is that, also late last week after the Greenbook   went to bed, we received data on import prices  These data, really for the first time in a  long time, showed a marked deceleration in both material-intensive goods import prices  and finished goods import prices  Our forecast for a long time has called for a  deceleration in import prices in line with the projected flattening out of commodity  prices and a projected flattening out of the dollar     Now it seems that we’re at a point at which all those things that have been   incorporated into our forecast but we haven’t had a lot of evidence for are starting to  materialize  We have the dollar flattened out and, indeed, somewhat stronger than in the  last Greenbook  We have lower paths for commodity prices, and then the data that we  recently received showed an actual deceleration in core import prices, which gives us  some confidence that perhaps the rise in those import prices has peaked  I’ll stop there      Yes  Yesterday the PBOC cut its main policy rate 27 basis points  I guess   they felt that 26 would not have been enough and 28 would have been too much  [Laughter]  And   27 was just the right number  I’d say a couple of thoughts were there  One important point is that   inflation in China has decelerated significantly  In the spring they were looking at twelve-month   inflation rates of around 83 percent  The latest reading for August was 49 percent  So it’s clearly   on a decelerating trajectory  That has been driven by a marked decline in food prices  Earlier this   year, food prices were moving up at over a 20 percent rate, and now it is about 10 percent  So the   deceleration in prices; some concerns about where activity is going, particularly in the aftermath of   the Olympics; and signs of slowing external demand have given them the scope they need to cut   policy rates  Besides the cut in monetary policy, we’re also hearing reports that the authorities are   poised to implement fiscal stimulus if that’s necessary    The science of monetary policy  "
8568,2008-10-07,"  Since the last Greenbook, the economic indicators for the foreign   economies have generally surprised us on the downside, notwithstanding the fact that  our expectations in the Greenbook for foreign growth were already pretty grim  In the  euro area, measures of consumer and business sentiment have continued to retreat   Industrial production has moved down, and retail sales have been soft  Recent data for   October 7, 2008 8 of 30    the United Kingdom have continued to point to a mild contraction during the second  half of this year, and notably house prices there continue to fall  In Japan, industrial  production plummeted in August, recording its biggest monthly decline in more than  five years, and survey data point to further declines in business and consumer  confidence  Finally, in the emerging market economies, industrial production has fallen  in a broad set of countries, and exports have softened significantly     In light of these data, we now see foreign growth in the second half of this year as   likely to come in at a little less than 1½ percent, down ½ percentage point from our last  forecast, with these markdowns spread about evenly between the advanced economies  and the emerging market economies  We have reduced our projections for growth in  2009 almost as much  This weakening outlook for global activity has been largely  driven, as Bill has described, by a marked deterioration in financial conditions in both  the advanced and the emerging market economies  Since the last FOMC meeting,  equity markets have fallen sharply in numerous countries  Risk premiums on many  types of assets have risen, and conditions in short-term funding markets have worsened  further  These difficult financial conditions threaten the outlook for foreign growth  going forward both by weighing on sentiment in financial markets and by potentially  limiting the flow of credit to the economy     If there is any good news for me to report, it’s that the softening outlook for global   growth has continued to put downward pressure on the price of oil and other  commodities  Oil prices have been extraordinarily volatile over the last month, lurching  up and down in response to a number of factors, including the effects of the two  hurricanes, shifting expectations regarding global growth, and financial turbulence  On  net, as Larry mentioned, the price of WTI is down about $13 a barrel since the  Greenbook and down over $55 per barrel from its peak in mid-July  Prices for many  nonfuel commodities have fallen sharply since the FOMC meeting, including price  declines of more than 10 percent for copper, nickel, and rubber, and more than  20 percent for corn and soybeans  Headline inflation remains elevated in the advanced  foreign economies  Notably, UK inflation in August reached 4¾ percent, a 15-year  high  In contrast, the most recent CPI data for the euro area hint at some deceleration,  with inflation moving down from over 4 percent in July to 36 percent in September   Going forward, there are good reasons to expect inflation in these economies to abate,  given the recent sharp decline in commodity prices and emerging slack in their  economies  Inflation rates in the emerging market economies appear to be cresting for  similar reasons     In the midst of these events, the dollar has remained quite resilient, rising about   3 percent since the last FOMC meeting  In our view the currency markets earlier this  year had priced in expectations that the major foreign economies would remain largely  resilient despite US slowing  As the growth prospects for the foreign economies have  deteriorated, the relative attractiveness of the dollar has increased  This, along with the  sustained demand for dollar funding in global financial markets, seems to have buoyed  the dollar of late      October 7, 2008 9 of 30    Finally, given the weaker path of foreign activity and the stronger dollar, we now  expect export growth to be somewhat less robust than was the case in our previous  forecast and, consequently, net exports to be less supportive of US economic growth  over the next two years  Nevertheless, net exports are still expected to contribute a  positive 05 percentage point to growth in the second half of this year and about 03  percentage point in 2009  We are happy to take your questions now    "
8594,2008-10-28,"  In response to intensified global financial stresses, the central  banks of four major emerging market economies—Mexico, Brazil, Korea, and  Singapore—have recently expressed interest in temporary liquidity swap lines with  the Federal Reserve  For the reasons outlined in our background memo, which was  circulated on Friday, the staff recommends that the Committee approve these  requests  We propose that the lines be sized at $30 billion for each of these four  countries, similar to our existing lines with Canada, Sweden, and Australia  We  envision that these lines would expire on April 30, 2009, as is the case with our other  swap lines     We also recommend that these lines have several safeguards relative to our lines   with central banks in the advanced economies  Notably, even following initial  FOMC approval, the proposed lines could not be drawn on without further  authorization, and individual drawings would be limited to $5 billion  We  recommend that the FOMC delegate to its Foreign Currency Subcommittee the  authority to approve these drawings  The subcommittee would ensure that the dollars  drawn would be used in a manner consistent with the purposes of the swap  agreement  The central banks in these countries would also agree to publicly  announce the fact that they had drawn on their lines and the mechanisms that they had  used to allocate the dollar liquidity  These safeguards are designed to provide  protections for Federal Reserve resources and to ensure that the swap lines are used in  a manner consistent with our envisioned objectives  These safeguards, however, are  not intended to be so onerous as to discourage the use of the lines if the situation  warrants       We see the case for these swap lines as resting on three important observations    First, each of these economies has significant economic and financial mass  Mexico,  Brazil, and Korea are all large economies with GDP of around $1 trillion, and  Singapore is a major financial center  Given the structural interconnectedness of the  global economy and the financial fragilities that now prevail, a further intensification  of stresses in one or more of these countries could trigger unwelcome spillovers for  both the US economy and the international economy more generally  Our  interdependencies with Mexico are particularly pronounced  Second, these  economies have generally pursued prudent policies in recent years, resulting in low  inflation and roughly balanced current account and fiscal positions or, in the case of  Singapore, sizable surpluses  Accordingly, the stresses that these countries are  feeling seem largely to reflect financial contagion effects from the advanced  economies, including sharp reductions in risk appetite, rapid deleveraging by global  investors, and a drying up of liquidity in dollar funding markets  Third, there is good  reason to believe that swap lines with the Federal Reserve would be helpful in  defusing the economic and financial pressures that they now face  These lines would  promote financial stability by helping to ensure that financial institutions and  corporations in these countries have access to dollar liquidity  Dollar funding  pressures in Brazil and Korea appear to have intensified significantly  Such pressures  remain less acute in Mexico and Singapore, but the authorities there view these lines  as valuable protection should such pressures intensify, particularly over year-end  In   October 28–29, 2008 10 of 206    addition, the authorities in these countries have expressed the view that these lines  could provide a significant boost to confidence, although such outcomes are  admittedly hard to predict       I turn now to two questions that have been the focus of energetic deliberations   among the staff as we have formulated these proposals  First, is there some better  approach that we could recommend?  Second, what are the risks associated with  initiating swap facilities with these emerging market economies, or EMEs?     As for the first question, we could ask these countries to rely on their sizable   stocks of foreign exchange reserves  Across many contingencies, we believe that  these countries do have sufficient resources to address financial pressures on their  own  Consistent with this observation, they don’t have any immediate plans to draw  on their swap lines  In this sense, the lines serve as a backstop  However, in the  event of intensified stresses, we believe that it would be desirable for these countries  to able to meet the dollar funding needs of their institutions by drawing on the swaps  rather than by going into the Treasury or agency markets to liquefy their foreign  exchange reserves  Alternatively, we could ask these countries to go to the IMF   Tomorrow, the Fund is likely to approve a large, rapidly disbursing facility that might  be appropriate  That said, we see the IMF’s efforts in this area as broadly  complementary to those of the Federal Reserve  Meeting the potential liquidity needs  of these large countries would strain the available resources of the Fund  Conversely,  the Fund is much better placed than we are to judge the liquidity needs of smaller,  less systemically important countries  As an additional consideration, these top-tier  EMEs that we are recommending for swap lines are very reluctant to return to the  IMF  Given the strength of their policies, they no longer view themselves as clients  of the Fund and would prefer to go it alone rather than seek IMF financial support     We note that there are indeed risks associated with our recommendation  One   obvious concern is that the swaps might not be repaid  However, given the large  reserve holdings of these countries, their prudent policies, the weight they place on  good relations with us, and the safeguards built into the swap agreements, we judge  the risk to Federal Reserve resources to be very low  More notable is the risk that  approving these lines might cause us to be flooded with requests from many  additional EMEs  Nevertheless, in proposing lines with these four countries, we feel  that we have set the bar quite high  Their importance to the global economy and the  quality of their policies set a standard that few, if any, other EMEs can match  In  addition, the potential IMF liquidity swap facility might be helpful to us in limiting  the risk of a slippery slope, as additional countries that request lines with us could be  asked to go to the IMF  Similarly, European EMEs seeking swap lines could be  encouraged to approach the ECB      In assessing these issues, the staff has conferred with senior officials at the US   Treasury and the State Department  In both instances, these agencies emphasized the  global economic significance of Brazil, Mexico, Korea, and Singapore  However,  they also cautioned that expanding the swap lines beyond this group could leave us   October 28–29, 2008 11 of 206    increasingly vulnerable to a “pile on” effect, which might manifest itself either in a  large number of additional swap line requests or in political pressure  Given these  considerations, the staff would benefit from some signal from the FOMC regarding  its willingness to consider swap lines with other emerging market economies  We see  two broad options in this regard  First, the FOMC could indicate that it is not inclined  to establish swap lines with other EMEs  Inquiries from additional countries could be  forwarded to the IMF  Alternatively, the FOMC could emphasize that the bar for any  additional EME facilities is high and that swap lines would be extended only if the  case is seen as being comparable to that of the four countries that are being voted on  today  Under this second approach, the FOMC might consider granting the Foreign  Currency Subcommittee the authority to establish swap lines with the central banks of  other large and systemically important EMEs  Bill Bassett will now continue our  presentation       I very much agree with the thrust of the question—it would take a very   severe state of nature for us to sustain losses on these  We are protected by the full faith and   credit of our central bank counterparty  In addition to that, when we give them dollars, we take   their domestic currency  So I suppose, in some very extreme state of the world, one could   imagine that the loan that was made in dollars defaulted on the central banks, the central bank   chose not to make us whole, and the currency that was escrowed for us had depreciated   significantly in value  But I’d say that you are multiplying three very small possibilities,   particularly the last two, that the central bank would choose to default on us, and there would   October 28–29, 2008 18 of 206    have to be such a substantial fall in their currency that it would reduce the value of that effective   assurance or collateral or whatever you want to call it    Absolutely  These would function very similarly to the swap lines that   we have with the advanced economies  In addition, we are going to allow them to draw only   $5 billion at a time at the discretion of the Foreign Currency Subcommittee  When the Foreign   Currency Subcommittee makes the determination as to whether or not a drawing should occur, it   has the scope and the mandate to look broadly at what is happening in the economy and make   sure that the resources are going to be used in a manner that is consistent with the terms and the   expectations of the swap agreement    Yes, indeed  Maybe Trish and Bill want to jump in here as well  What   this means is that, in extinguishing any obligation that arises from the swap agreement, if the   central bank for some reason doesn’t pay us, we can take other assets on the books that are being   held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to extinguish those liabilities  Does that make   sense?  So if the Brazilians are holding some additional assets at the New York Fed that are   unrelated to the swap and they are not making good on the swap, we can draw on those other   assets to extinguish the obligations from the swap   October 28–29, 2008 19 of 206     They could do that  But any drawing under the swap agreement would   be no longer than three months, and some drawings would be much shorter  So they would have   to move very quickly, given the short nature of these transactions  But there are certain states of   nature that are so severe that we couldn’t rule it out    I agree    For what it’s worth, the ECB has entered into something similar to that   with the Hungarians, in which the Hungarians are able to repo to them long-term euro-  denominated stuff and get euros back    We do have a swap line with Mexico  It’s a standing swap line  It’s   $3 billion under the North American Framework Agreement  It’s the counterpart to NAFTA    Under that agreement, we also have a $2 billion swap line with Canada  Here we would be   adding a new temporary liquidity swap line, so it would be a new legal construct    In principle, if you were so inclined, you could probably just raise the   size of the existing swap line to $30 billion  However, we built in a variety of mechanisms and   safeguards in this proposal  In addition, the structure of what we’re putting forward is tailored   particularly to meet the kinds of challenges and liquidity pressures that exist right now  So in   some sense this one is structured to meet the challenges that the Mexicans are most likely to face   in the current episode rather than the more generic one that already exists on the books     Could I just respond to President Rosengren’s second question?    I think you put your finger on two very difficult judgments that we made   when structuring this facility  I don’t see the risk of creating stigma for emerging market   economies that are not in our swap network as being a first-order concern  It is broadly   recognized that the folks that we are recommending are larger, more systemically important, and   as well managed as anybody else  If you were sitting down to make a list—and the Fund has   recently done this—the economies that we’re recommending would be at the top of the list, and I   October 28–29, 2008 27 of 206    think that is recognized by essentially all observers  So I see what we’re doing here as really   ratifying perceptions rather than creating new ones     On the second point, the choice between the swaps versus the repos, that one is   particularly tricky  I very much agree that the repos would give us a little more security  On the   other hand, the swap framework gives the emerging market economies a little more flexibility    As to how they are going to proceed, as President Fisher mentioned, it also creates symmetry   between the industrial countries and the way we’re treating them and the emerging markets and   the way we’re treating them  Given the successes of many of these economies over the past ten   years, I see this as being an appropriate step  Nevertheless, I admit that the choice between the   swaps and the repos is a difficult one  Another thought is that the repo structure might provide a   bit more security, but we have tried to get that security through other ways—through tranching,   careful reviews, and so on    I would hope that initiating these swaps would reduce the probability of   bad outcomes in the emerging market economies  Certainly, if Brazil, Mexico, and Korea are up   against the ropes and experiencing significant financial stresses, my sense is that it would be an   environment in which many other EMEs would be experiencing negative spillovers  So to the   extent that we can backstop these major linchpins in the emerging market world, I see that as   having very positive effects for others  That would be one point  Second, the decision as to how   to handle Chile, if Chile comes to us for a swap line, I think is very much a policy decision for   the Committee to determine  As I said in the remarks, we as staff members would very much   appreciate some sort of signal from you as to whether you want to say four and that’s all we’re   willing to do, and everyone else—Chile, India, and South Africa—goes to the Fund?  Or is the   Committee open to having potentially a few other large, important emerging market economies   have swap lines with the Federal Reserve?  I see that as being a policy decision    Wherever you draw the line, there is going to be somebody who is just a   bit away from the line that says, “I am very similar to those folks”  I am reasonably comfortable   with where we draw the line  Here there is as much gap as you’re going to find  In my mind, the   next one for which you could make a case would be India  However, India’s financial system   isn’t as developed as is the case with these folks  They are not as integrated into the global   financial system as is the case with these, so there is a bit of space there  But these are   admittedly hard judgments, which we tried to flesh out regarding some of these issues in our   memo   October 28–29, 2008 29 of 206     Yes, indeed, we have  We have been approached by    October 28–29, 2008 30 of 206  552 USC (b)(4)  , and we have had very informal inquiries from a couple of other countries, including   552 USC (b)(4)     We have done everything we possibly can to discourage it    That’s right  We’re not advertising    A couple of thoughts  Certainly these home-versus-host issues bedevil   many, many discussions of banking issues right now  They are true in Mexico, as you suggested,   and they are true in spades in Central and Eastern Europe, where instead of US banks there are   European banks in the tension between the home and host  So these considerations are very   relevant and also exceedingly complicated   If the Bank of Mexico or the Mexican authorities move to address tensions in their   financial system, the standard that has been set by several Federal Reserve actions, the Brits in     the things they have done, and I believe a number of the other countries is to include subsidiaries   of foreign firms that are operating in that country  So, for instance, for the United States,   Deutsche Bank’s US subsidiary has had access to our various facilities, and that has been the   coin of the realm in the announcements today  So my feeling is that Banamex, which is owned   by Citi, would have the same access to these kinds of facilities as other Mexican institutions    Now, there is no guarantee of that, but that would be my feeling  Regarding the question of,   once a Mexican institution gets its hands on dollars, what happens to those dollars, my   understanding is that they can move around  In fact, in a discussion, Guillermo Ortiz indicated   that to date Mexican institutions were net suppliers of dollars to the United States rather than the   other way around    I would guess that it is a joint problem    As outlined in the memo and then also my remarks, the first is that we are   looking for economies that are large and systemically important  The second is that we are looking   for economies in which their policies have been strong and it appears that they are largely being   influenced by contagion  The third piece is countries for which we believe that the swap line might   actually make a difference     Now, let me just give you a concrete case of the third criterion because that’s a little more   abstract than the first two  Iceland came to us and requested a swap line of approximately $1 billion   to $2 billion, which would have been 5 to 10 percent of Iceland’s GDP—so it was fairly large   relative to the size of the country  But the liabilities of the banking system were on the order of   $170 billion, and the underlying problem was really that there was a loss of confidence in its banks    We came to the conclusion that a $1 billion to $2 billion swap line was very little ammunition to use   against a potential loss in confidence in this $170 billion financial system  For that reason, we as   the staff recommended against a swap line for Iceland   Those are the three conditions that we’d emphasize  Sort of subsidiary to that is that I think   it is very appropriate for all the European EMEs to report to the ECB for their liquidity needs  That   would further constrain the list of countries that we’d look at  As we work down the list of   countries, I think it gets easier to say “no” in that fewer and fewer of the countries can make a case   that they are large and systemically important  With the risk of creating stigma, some countries are   big, and some aren’t, and that’s pretty darn objective  Now, you can debate about, well, what’s big   and what isn’t and where you draw the line, but it just so happens that these three major economies   that we’re putting forward all have GDP of around $1 trillion  That seems like a reasonable line to   draw  Again, there’s an element of arbitrariness here, but any line you draw will have an element of   arbitrariness to it   October 28–29, 2008 33 of 206     Oh, I thought I got it  What was the first part?    Well, I guess I’m not sure I know exactly what you’re driving at  Are you   concerned that, by moving on these, we’re sending a negative message about the ones we’re not   moving on?      Our press release that we are negotiating lists, as clearly as one can in a   press release, the criteria that we were looking at—that they are large, well-managed, fundamentally   sound, systemically important countries  So we are trying to communicate that  In addition, in   conversations when these folks come to us—and especially if we get some direction from the   FOMC as to how you’d like to proceed on this issue—we can be very, very blunt with them in   telling them why the answer is “no” or “yes,” depending on which way the FOMC goes    We have already said “no” to some of those    Just to put some numbers on IMF lending capacity—total IMF lending   capacity is about $250 billion  To get even that high they have to call in some special arrangements   that they have with a variety of countries  The maximum capacity is $250 billion  So the   $120 billion that we’re proposing today would be essentially half of what the IMF could do  In that   October 28–29, 2008 36 of 206    sense I really see what we’re proposing as our taking off the IMF’s hands some of the largest   potential liquidity needs, which then allows them to focus on a whole range of additional countries    A related point is that I understand that, in an IMF executive board meeting today, the managing   director indicated that they are getting a fair amount of interest in this new facility  It really is a   different kind of facility, and frankly, even a week ago if you told me that the IMF was going to be   able to put this facility together in this quick a time, I would have said, “No way  There’s no way   that the IMF can move this quickly”  So it is about as good as we could expect and maybe even   better than what we could have expected from the Fund  I think that they are doing what they can to   minimize stigma  On the other hand, they don’t have enough lending capacity to really handle these   folks that we’re talking about today    No, and maybe the folks in New York want to talk a bit more about this    The transaction with the Swiss National Bank was a very special transaction that occurred outside   the typical constraints of the swap lines that we’d be agreeing to with these folks  In the swap lines   with these folks, they would have to tell us up front how they’re going to allocate the resources  We   would envision that it would be done in something similar to an auction, in a very transparent,   on-market sort of way  But it would not be that kind of a transaction, which was a special case in   order to help a particular financial institution   October 28–29, 2008 37 of 206     Again, we’re drawing lines here  I am not prepared to give these folks carte   blanche  That’s why we’ve added additional safeguards and additional governance structures to   these facilities  Maybe the Committee has a different view on that, but I wouldn’t be prepared to let   them do whatever they wanted with these resources    I’m earning my pay today    I don’t have details on that  As I’ve mentioned, I know that they have   created a facility with the Hungarians, a €5 billion facility  They were also approached by Iceland   at the same time that we were  I would speculate, but I don’t have any basis for that speculation,   that given the emerging tensions in Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Europe that they   probably are being approached, but I don’t have any details on that    Indeed    Yes, absolutely    Mexico is experiencing increased financial stresses, particularly in its   corporate sector, where recently some bad bets on structured finance products have emerged, and   Ortiz was very concerned about continued confidence in the Mexican economy  Now, that said,   from what he had to say, dollar funding pressures had not yet emerged, and he was emphatic that   October 28–29, 2008 39 of 206    they would not draw on these until the time that those funding pressures emerged or until the time   that they saw a significant further deterioration in conditions in their economy  He was very   specific about the fact that they would use their own reserves as their first, second, and third lines of   defense  "
8621,2008-12-15,"  Yes  We see the current account deficit, as Shaghil said, bouncing   between 3 and 3½ percent of GDP through 2009 and 2010  In the near term, you have much   weaker foreign growth and a stronger dollar, but that is offset by the lower level of oil prices, so   that keeps the current account deficit around the 3 to 3½ percent range    I would add that I think the ECB in particular has a real aversion to   policy activism  In fact, Trichet was on the wires this morning indicating that they are not really   comfortable with where they are right now  They may pause in January, and I think it really   would take a more severe outcome for activity in the euro area than what we have incorporated   in our forecast to get the ECB down to zero  Nevertheless, that is a risk  I would say that there   are downside risks here  I would put a higher probability on seeing the Bank of England or the   Bank of Canada go to zero  But as Shaghil emphasized, here we are basically just writing down   what we think they are going to do, and we generally follow the futures markets fairly closely    But it certainly would be a surprise to me if, over the next six months, we saw other major   central banks in the proximity of zero    The European banks are particularly exposed, much more so than US   banks or Japanese banks  A big chunk of that exposure is to central and eastern Europe, and as you   suggest, we see significant risks to the European banks as a result of that exposure  What makes it   even a little dicier is that exposure is concentrated in several countries, particularly Sweden, Austria,   and to a slightly lesser extent Italy  Recently there has been significant economic turmoil in   Hungary and Ukraine  The Fund has stepped in, and the EU has helped as well with large financing   packages  The latest one we’re watching very closely is the situation in Latvia, where the exchange   rate is significantly overvalued  The external position looks very, very dicey  The Fund is in there   negotiating a program  There has been a lot of back and forth about what should be done with the   exchange rate regime  The banking system also looks vulnerable—so what should be done with the   banks?  It is not exactly clear how all that is going to be resolved  My personal feeling is that, given   December 15–16, 2008 126 of 284    the risks—and the Europeans recognize the extent of the risks—if Latvia goes, it could blow out the   rest of the Baltics and then sweep around into Central and Eastern Europe and then feed back into   Western Europe  So I see the risks there as being of first order for the Europeans   Given that recognition, I think that the EU and major European governments are going to do   what’s necessary to make sure that the situation in Latvia stabilizes at least for a while  The end   game over the next several years is very much an open issue for a lot of these economies that were   in ERM-II and evolving into hoping to adopt the euro  I think that there are potentially some very   pronounced vulnerabilities and some painful adjustment that will need to happen in some of those   Central and Eastern European countries  So absolutely that is a major risk  It’s one we’re watching   as closely as we can  "
8665,2009-01-27," Thank you Given ongoing stresses in the global financial system  and the vulnerability of some key US institutions to foreign-currency funding  pressures, the staff has begun to assess the pros and cons of establishing temporary  liquidity swap lines that would allow the Federal Reserve to lend euro, yen, sterling,  and Swiss francs to US institutions These lines would be the mirror image of our  existing swap lines and would allow the Federal Reserve to respond to eventualities  ranging from a foreign-currency liquidity squeeze faced by a single US bank all the  way to a systemic shortage of foreign-currency funding among US institutions  We  raise this issue in today’s meeting in the spirit of bringing to your attention an issue  that we see emerging on the horizon  That said, we are still sorting through and  evaluating a number of considerations that bear on this initiative, and we would very  much appreciate your thoughts and guidance   One major money center bank has recently shown particular vulnerability to  foreign-currency funding pressure This institution’s huge presence in foreign  markets is reliant on secured and unsecured foreign-currency funding  The  vulnerability of its foreign deposit base and limited foreign-currency collateral has  been apparent on a number of occasions over the past several months  Indeed, just  last Monday, when US markets were closed, our bank supervisors had significant  concerns regarding the institution’s ability to access sufficient foreign-currency  funding There were similar worries during a particularly stressful period in  November  In each instance, the necessary financing was obtained, but the situation  nevertheless remains fragile  While this one institution is a focus of concern at  present, we cannot rule out scenarios in which other large US institutions also run  into trouble meeting their foreign-currency funding needs  There is a related risk that,  once one US institution showed pronounced vulnerability in this regard, other US  institutions might also then be viewed as vulnerable and that a broader foreign- currency liquidity crunch could develop              January 27–28, 2009 25 of 267  These observations suggest that it would be prudent for the Federal Reserve to  have the capacity to backstop the foreign-currency funding needs of US institutions   Establishing temporary swap lines with foreign central banks strikes us as a  straightforward way to achieve this objective  Such swap lines would ensure that the  Federal Reserve could serve as a lender of last resort in foreign currencies for US  institutions In particular, these lines would offer a reliable vehicle for providing  foreign-currency funding to US banks during times when US markets were closed  because of either time zone differences or US holidays  Our expectation is that  these new swap lines would be signed and implemented only if funding conditions  clearly warranted We do not recommend putting them in place on a precautionary  basis, largely because we are not certain how the markets would receive the  announcement of such facilities  Rather, the features of these lines could be  negotiated with our central bank counterparties, with the draft agreements then put on  the shelf to be approved and executed as needed   To ensure that these lines could be rapidly implemented in deteriorating  conditions, we recommend that the FOMC consider delegating authority to the  Foreign Currency Subcommittee to conclude such arrangements  There might still be  some announcement effect created by the reporting of such a vote in the FOMC  minutes, but it would probably not be seen as signaling the same urgency as an  announcement that the facilities themselves had been established  The authority  granted to the subcommittee in this regard would be symmetric to that already  delegated to the subcommittee to negotiate swap arrangements to allow major foreign  central banks to lend dollars   Three further issues are worth mentioning briefly  First, the legal structure of our  existing swap lines requires the Federal Reserve to deposit the foreign currency it  receives as part of the swap in an account at the foreign central bank  These new  swap lines would be symmetric to our existing lines, but they would allow the Federal  Reserve to lend the foreign currency to US financial institutions and require foreign  central banks to deposit the dollars they receive at the Federal Reserve  In principle,  our existing swap arrangements could be amended to allow us to lend foreign  currency But we would prefer implementing these new swap lines through a  separate and parallel set of agreements in order to reduce similarities to the old-style  swap lines that were used to fund foreign exchange intervention in previous decades   Second, there are other means that could, in principle, be used to get foreign-currency  funding to US institutions under stress  One alternative would be striking  agreements with foreign central banks for them to lend against high-quality dollar  collateral But central banks have been working on these procedures for some time,  and although progress has been made, not enough of these arrangements are in place  to address the existing vulnerabilities  In addition, foreign central banks may be  hesitant to lend to a troubled US institution during a period of stress, particularly on  the basis of collateral held outside their jurisdictions  As another approach, we could  simply require US institutions to sell their dollar collateral and obtain foreign  currency themselves in the foreign exchange spot or forward market  However, this  might be difficult or disruptive during periods of market stress and would leave               January 27–28, 2009 26 of 267  institutions vulnerable during times when foreign markets are open and US markets   are closed Third, the provision of foreign-currency denominated liquidity to the   foreign branch of a US depository institution would rely on the discount window   authority of the Reserve Banks, and some technical issues would need to be worked   through in implementing a lending arrangement along these lines      The staff is not proposing that you vote today to establish these new swap   arrangements, but we are highlighting this as an issue meriting your attention  We   also note that, if stresses in foreign-currency funding conditions persist, we may be   back to you—perhaps very soon (and perhaps even in the middle of the night)—   [laughter] with a request to move forward with these arrangements and the   corresponding delegation to the subcommittee  Thank you That concludes our   presentation, and we are very happy to take your questions    Correct   The risk profile would be different for exactly the reason you suggest  A   lot of the analysis on this particular proposal has been done just over the past few days, and that   is one reason that we are not presenting it with a fuller description and more detail  But we   certainly intend to continue to do that work, and as we make progress on some of these issues,   we certainly plan to circulate a memo to the Committee describing some of the other issues    We haven’t thought systematically about that issue  I mean, I could   guess—   But I think it would probably be better not to guess  Maybe Trish wants   to guess [Laughter]   Maybe Vice Chairman Dudley and Trish have some thoughts on this    There is a new dimension to think through—that is, who is bearing the   foreign exchange risk vis-à-vis our central bank counterparty?  And I don’t think the terms there   are going to be different But then, when we go on to lend that foreign exchange to our   commercial bank, there is a new dimension in thinking about foreign exchange risk   Well, it depends on which currency it is being booked in   We are still thinking through that point   That’s right The way that works is, when we do that swap, we agree to   unwind that swap at the exchange rate that prevailed at the time the swap was made  My   preference in these negotiations is that, for these other swaps, we would do exactly the same   thing vis-à-vis our foreign central bank counterparties   So they would still be bearing the foreign exchange risk  But in some   sense we are promising that we get back the dollars we put in and they get back the foreign   currency they put in Right?   Yes, that is right In some sense, the Federal Reserve and they don’t   really care because they get back their currency and we get back our currency   On the first question, you are absolutely correct that this particular   institution does have significant foreign-currency funding needs in some of the minor Asian   currencies, for example, and has experienced stresses in those  I think that is an issue that we   would need to ponder as to how to proceed on, and it was in the back of my mind in the sense   that in our presentation we emphasized euro, yen, sterling, and Swiss francs  Suppose it is a   minor Asian currency  Would we want to think about swap lines with some minor central bank   to allow them to have that currency, or is getting them yen enough?  Given market differences,   time zones, and everything else, is getting them yen going to be sufficient to be able to provide   the funding in some of the other Asian currencies? Those are issues that we are going to have to     January 27–28, 2009 34 of 267  spend a fair amount of time thinking hard about  I think maybe the second question is more for   New York   In each one of the disbursements under these lines, the Federal Reserve   and the FOMC have the prerogative to determine whether or not it is in our interest to go forward   with the swaps  So I think that we maintain a crucial governance role  If we come to the   conclusion that at some point the costs of this program or the costs of extending that dollar   liquidity outweigh the benefits, then we can start winding up the program  So I don’t think that   is right   The total outstandings are around $465 billion   Well, for what it is worth, our forecasts of the European economy and   European interest rates are not consistent with that scenario Market expectations are not   consistent with that scenario  I hope that is not what we are looking at   You are doing a good job   I think it is fair to say that, of the major central banks, the Bank of   England has been particularly concerned about the moral hazard sorts of issues and has moved   into these kinds of programs with great reluctance  The major feature that I see of this   announcement by the Bank of England is that now they can purchase outright stuff that they   were taking only as collateral My understanding is that this program is limited to AAA-rated   assets, and I don’t see them taking on as a result of this a huge amount, or really any, credit risk   under their balance sheet So I interpreted this as a relative modest step down the road toward   balance sheet expansion That’s my reading of it  We can look at it again more carefully and see   if we have different views at that point   The UK program more generally had some really aggressive features that didn’t involve   the Bank of England For instance, the government is now going to be guaranteeing the asset   side of the balance sheet as well as the liabilities side of the balance sheet for institutions and   those sorts of things that were part of the announcement  But I saw the Bank of England step as   more incremental, rather than some sort of significant quantum shift in the orientation of their   policy  "
8711,2009-03-17," The staff recommends that the FOMC establish swap lines with  major foreign central banks that would allow the Federal Reserve to backstop the  foreign currency funding needs of US institutions operating abroad These lines  would give the Federal Reserve the same capacity to act as a lender of last resort that  our existing dollar swap lines provide foreign central banks   This proposal involves two components  First, the FOMC would create a new set  of swap lines with foreign central banks  These new swap lines would be designed to  provide the Federal Reserve access to foreign currency liquidity  We suggest  establishing such lines with the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the  Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National Bank We envision that the lines with the BoJ  and ECB would be set at roughly $100 billion equivalent, and the lines with the BoE  and the SNB would be a little less than half as large  These central banks have  indicated that they are open to establishing such lines with us                       March 17–18, 2009 15 of 266  Second, the FOMC would need to create a mechanism to transfer the foreign  currency received in the swap with the foreign central bank to a US financial  institution We propose that you authorize use of the System Open Market Account  to conduct swap transactions for this purpose This transaction would be structured as  follows An institution that was facing severe foreign currency funding pressures  would approach its Federal Reserve Bank  The Reserve Bank would then assess the  financial position of the institution and the extent of the foreign currency funding  need If in the Reserve Bank’s judgment a swap was appropriate, the Reserve Bank  would initiate a request with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, which would have  delegated authority to approve swap draws  Requests for rollovers would also be  initiated through the Reserve Bank The Federal Reserve would swap foreign  currency to a US institution in exchange for dollars  The Federal Reserve would  charge the institution a fee (which would be equal to the foreign central bank’s policy  target plus an additional charge) and would also take a 3 to 5 percent security deposit  in cash This deposit would protect against a scenario in which an institution failed to  unwind the swap and in which the dollars that were received in the swap proved  insufficient to extinguish our foreign currency obligation to the foreign central bank   We anticipate that such swaps would be conducted at very short tenors, primarily  overnight through one week   While we would expect a US institution that faced difficulties obtaining  sufficient foreign currency funding in a market abroad to turn first to the foreign  central bank, we see three scenarios in which that option might not be available   First, an institution might have insufficient collateral at the foreign central bank to  meet the drain on its funding and be unable to mobilize sufficient resources on its  own, perhaps because the US payment system was closed or because the institution  was experiencing broader funding pressures  Second, the foreign central bank might  choose not to lend to an institution even in the presence of acceptable collateral; this  might reflect concerns about the institution’s underlying financial condition or  political pressures Third, the Federal Reserve might wish to provide foreign  currency funding as part of an effort, presumably coordinated with other US  authorities, to prevent a disorderly unwinding of an insolvent institution’s balance  sheet Such lending, of course, would be done in a manner consistent with the  constraints of FDICIA and other legal protocols   As I noted at the January meeting, one major US institution has shown particular  vulnerabilities regarding its foreign currency funding, but we cannot rule out  scenarios in which other large US institutions might run into similar trouble  There  is a related risk that once one US institution shows vulnerability in this regard, other  US institutions might also then be viewed as vulnerable and that a broader foreign  currency liquidity squeeze could develop In our view, roughly half a dozen major  US institutions have sufficient foreign operations to be vulnerable in this respect     These observations suggest that it would be prudent for the Federal Reserve to  have the capacity to backstop the foreign currency funding needs of US institutions   Establishing temporary swap lines with foreign central banks strikes us as a                        March 17–18, 2009 16 of 266  straightforward way to do this While there is a good possibility that these lines  would never actually be drawn on, they nevertheless would provide valuable  insurance against the risk of severe stress       One important issue that we have grappled with is whether the transaction with a  US financial institution should be structured as a swap using SOMA or as a foreign  currency denominated loan from the discount window  After considerable  deliberation and reflection, we were persuaded that the back-to-back swap structure is  the way to go The Federal Reserve traditionally conducts its foreign currency  transactions out of SOMA, and there is no precedent for discount window lending in  foreign currencies A key complication with the discount window approach is getting  the foreign currency from SOMA to the appropriate Reserve Bank, since only the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York has accounts at foreign central banks  In  addition, systems to record and manage discount window operations were not  designed to track loans in foreign currencies   By putting these swap lines in place, we would signal our intention to pursue best  practice in home–host relations  We would be prepared to provide liquidity support  to a US institution if the foreign central bank were reluctant to step in  This could  also give us increased negotiating leverage to expect foreign central banks to provide  similar support to their institutions operating in the United States   What risks do these transactions pose to the Federal Reserve?  The risks attending  the swap with the foreign central bank would be nil As with our dollar liquidity  swaps, there is no exchange rate or interest rate risk, because these parameters are  specified upfront And the foreign central bank is required to deposit the dollars it  receives in the swap at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, so there is no credit  risk As for the transaction with the US financial institution, the Federal Reserve is  protected first by the short tenor of the transaction  Second, the dollar holdings  received in the swap could be used to acquire foreign currency if the institution fails  to unwind the transaction  Third, if these dollars prove inadequate to repay the  foreign central bank fully—either because the dollar has depreciated or because of  transactions costs—the Federal Reserve will draw on the cash security deposit that  the institution has provided All told, we judge that Federal Reserve resources would  be well protected against any financial risks  We also note the possibility of moral  hazard—institutions may come to depend on the Federal Reserve to meet their  foreign currency funding needs, rather than arranging for sufficient funding in the  market or mobilizing their collateral for use at a foreign central bank  However, we  have structured these swaps to minimize this risk to the extent possible  In particular,  the size of the fee and the cash deposit should help ensure that the swaps are attractive  only as a last resort   Establishing these foreign currency swap lines requires FOMC approval—either  directly or through delegation to the Subcommittee  We envision that approval by the  full Committee would be followed by a press release within 10 days or so and, in any  event, would be reported in the minutes  As such, the establishment of these lines                                                                                March 17–18, 2009 17 of 266  would quickly become public knowledge  While the staff had previously feared that  a public announcement could generate a negative reaction from the markets, the  current weakness of confidence toward the banks may diminish this concern  Indeed,  an announcement that this backstop had been put in place could even enhance  confidence   If in the Committee’s judgment the announcement effects associated with these  facilities would be manageable, then you could authorize these foreign currency swap  lines at the meeting today  However, if you remain concerned about negative  announcement effects, then we recommend that the Committee delegate authority to  the Foreign Currency Subcommittee to approve these swap lines  This would enable  the announcement to be deferred, pending a time when draws on the lines would  actually be made  There might still be some announcement effects created by reports  of an FOMC vote to delegate this authority to the Subcommittee, but it would  probably not be seen as signaling the same urgency as an announcement that the  facilities themselves had been established  The authority granted to the  Subcommittee in this regard would be symmetric to that already delegated to the  Subcommittee to negotiate dollar liquidity swap lines    I conclude by noting that the Bank of Mexico has recently expressed interest in  drawing on its dollar swap line with the Federal Reserve  We are currently working  with our Mexican counterparts to better understand the situation in their economy and  how they would use the dollars  These discussions are ongoing, and we will keep you  posted as they proceed  Spence Hilton will now continue our presentation   Correct   Right   That’s obviously a profoundly important question, and let me just address   it at several different levels  In terms of the specifics of that particular institution, one of the   things that’s been a challenge for us is to get good data—for a range of such institutions  So it’s   hard to state categorically what this institution or other institutions have done with their balance   sheets over the last couple of months   But I do think it’s very telling that in mid-February the stresses on the financial sector   and the banks were, if anything, even more pronounced than they were in mid-January  Yet we   didn’t hear the same kinds of reports, and we didn’t observe the same stresses as in January,   which may very well point to exactly the phenomenon that you’re indicating here—that the   institution did things to reduce its vulnerability to these sorts of pressures  So I think that is   going on, absolutely              March 17–18, 2009 30 of 266  That raises the question of whether this sort of a facility would dull those sorts of   incentives As I said in my remarks, we’ve done everything we possibly can to structure this in   such a way that it would be attractive to an institution only as a very last resort—the fees that   we’re charging, the additional collateral, and so on and so forth  Nevertheless, we can imagine   instances where the drain on the foreign currency funding might be very intense, and even a   well-managed institution might have problems raising sufficient collateral and resources on its   own We can also imagine instances where the foreign central bank is not enthusiastic about   lending against even good collateral for an institution  The Bank of Japan, in particular,   remembers an instance from the late ‘90s when the Federal Reserve was not enthusiastic about   lending to Japanese institutions because of what were perceived as political pressures in the   United States, and they’ve asked us to consider the possibility that something similar might   happen to them, and they wouldn’t be able to lend to US institutions  So notwithstanding the   moral hazard risk, which, as I said, we’ve done everything we can in this proposal to attenuate,   we still see that there would be plausible states of nature where it would be prudent to have these   foreign currency swap lines in place   Yes   I would have to defer to the regulators  I don’t know if Trish has some   information           March 17–18, 2009 31 of 266  This is an issue I’ve actually spent a fair amount of time thinking about    Absolutely, it’s a concern For instance, one of these major institutions has a fair amount of   exposure to some of the secondary and tertiary emerging Asian currencies  But the staff simply   didn’t feel comfortable recommending the establishment of, say, 30 or 40 or 50 swap lines with   foreign central banks We see this proposal as providing a foreign currency backstop for these              March 17–18, 2009 43 of 266  institutions—a safety net of some stripe—which, hopefully, between giving them access to yen   or euro or whatever the case may be, and their dollar holdings, would enable them to respond to   stresses in some of these secondary markets  I note that there is a risk  We don’t see it as being   significant, but there’s a risk that these institutions might mobilize collateral from some of these   markets where there is liquidity support into some of these secondary markets; hence becoming   more dependent on our liquidity facilities But we didn’t see any way around leaving some   residual liquidity risk It’s a thorny, thorny issue   Mr Chairman, President Plosser asked several questions about the swap lines  Could I   go ahead and answer those?   First of all, let me underscore that we see these lines as being focused   primarily and exclusively on liquidity  What we have in mind in that third case is that an   institution has been declared dead and is out of business; we’re suggesting in that sort of a   scenario, it might be useful for the authorities to have access to foreign currency liquidity in the   process of winding up the balance sheet and ensuring an orderly wrap-up, consistent with all of   the legal protocols and so on We’re not advocating a loan to an institution that’s actually   insolvent as if it were a solvent institution   Your second question was on the discount window versus the SOMA approach or the   swap approach As I said in my remarks, it’s something we spent a lot of time deliberating  On   the one hand, there are certain aspects of this that have a discount window flavor  On the other   hand, there’s no history of the discount window doing foreign currency operations   On the other hand, SOMA is where we’ve done all of those foreign   currency operations, and at the end of the day, operationally, we just saw the discount window   approach as adding another layer of complexity  We had to figure out how to get the resources   from SOMA to the individual Reserve Banks in order to make the discount window loan  But   this was a very close call, and it really was an issue of zigging rather than zagging  From an   operational standpoint, we felt that SOMA was the better approach  Trish, do you want to   expand on that?   On your third question about the announcement effects, we freely admit   that there are uncertainties surrounding the nature of those announcement effects  On the one   hand, as you described, there’s a possible adverse reaction  On the other hand, at present it’s   really no secret that major US financial institutions are experiencing a range of stresses, so   moves by the central banking community to further bulletproof liquidity in the global economy   could be seen as a very positive thing              March 17–18, 2009 45 of 266  But I grant that there is uncertainty We don’t know exactly how it would be received    That is why we gave you this “proposal A versus proposal B” structure  And if the Committee is   concerned about the possibility of an adverse announcement effect or concerned that the   announcement wouldn’t have manageable effects, then maybe the best approach would be a   delegation to the Subcommittee; the Subcommittee could establish these lines closer to a time   when it looked like they were actually going to be drawn on   The other thought I have in response to your comments is, even though we’re likely   talking about only a half a dozen institutions that have these sorts of vulnerabilities, if adverse   circumstances arose, the implications could be very severe  So I think it behooves us to think   through the possibilities beforehand, and, as necessary, put in place mechanisms to address those   sorts of vulnerabilities to the extent that we can   It would appear in the minutes  But draft resolution B, which is the   delegation to the Subcommittee, is not nearly as specific as draft resolution A  This is just   saying that the FOMC delegated to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee the capacity to negotiate   these foreign currency swap lines—it doesn’t delineate the lines with the same degree of   specificity that the other resolution does In addition, it’s not saying that these lines are   established—it’s only saying that the Subcommittee has the capacity to establish them if it so   chooses So it’s not as specific, and our view, at least, is that it wouldn’t be seen by the markets   or by the world as indicating the same degree of urgency as an actual approval of the lines   would              March 17–18, 2009 46 of 266  My sense is that the pricing of our dollar swap facilities globally, and   particularly in Europe, is such that they had been attractive during times of stress  But as the   market has healed a little bit, they’re less attractive  Let me just be really concrete here  The   outstandings to the ECB, as of early December, were about $314 billion under the swaps   program  At the end of last week, those outstandings were down to $168 billion  So we have   seen a sizable—slightly less than 50 percent—drop in those outstandings  Similarly, global   swaps outstanding in early December were $582 billion, and at the end of last week they were at   $330 billion   So I think we’re seeing the program and the pricing work the way that we want it to    During those year-end pressures and with exceedingly high stress, this liquidity was very   attractive As the situation seems to ease a little bit, it’s not as attractive  I know that a number   of our counterparties have had auctions where they’ve seen significant declines in participation    Some that don’t have unlimited lines have actually seen some of their auctions undersubscribed    Here’s another example of the decline on a much smaller swap line  Australia was running about   $27 billion outstanding in late November and is now below $10 billion  So I think the pricing of   these facilities—and Trish may want to expand on this—has been done so that the incentives are   the way we want them to be  "
8737,2009-04-28," Like the domestic forecast, our outlook for growth in the foreign  economies is a little stronger than in the previous Greenbook—up about ½ percentage  point on average throughout the forecast period  We estimate that output abroad  contracted sharply in the first quarter of this year, matching the fourth quarter’s  7 percent drop We expect real GDP in the second quarter to contract a further  2½ percent at an annual rate—which, although representing some moderation in the  pace of decline, would still be the worst quarterly outcome in four decades were it not  for the plunges recorded in the two previous quarters  Our working hypothesis is that  foreign growth will gradually rebound, turning slightly positive in the second half of  this year before recovering more earnestly next year  Consistent with this forecast,  we believe that some early signs of stabilization around the world are starting to  emerge, although the evidence on this score is admittedly mixed   Your international exhibit shows some data that have informed our thinking  As  in the United States, equity prices around the world (the top left panel) have moved  up since the time of your last meeting, potentially suggesting that some severe  outcomes may now be seen as less likely  These gains in stock prices were led by a  rebound in financial sector equities More broadly, global financial stress appears to  have receded some  LIBOR–OIS spreads, CDS premiums, and corporate bonds  spreads have all posted declines The spot price of WTI has risen to around $50 per  barrel, up about $7 per barrel since the March Greenbook  Other commodity prices  have also increased, albeit by smaller amounts  In the case of oil, the rise likely  reflects OPEC’s aggressive production cuts of 3½ million barrels a day since  September  But with a broad array of commodity prices showing increases, the rise  may also signal a stronger outlook for global demand for commodities                        April 28–29, 2009 32 of 201  In the advanced foreign economies, the recent news on activity has been mixed   Industrial production, shown in the middle left panel, has continued to sink, and  unemployment rates have moved up more  The Japanese economy experienced a  particularly sharp decline in the first quarter, with GDP plummeting an estimated  18 percent at an annual rate, an even steeper drop than in the fourth quarter  For other  advanced foreign economies, the rate of contraction is estimated to have also  steepened in the first quarter, albeit less dramatically  However, some recent survey  data show signs of an incipient slowing in the rate of contraction  Purchasing  managers’ indexes and some other surveys have tended to edge up over the last  month or two These surveys remain below 50 and thus indicate further contraction  but at a slower pace  That said, the picture is far from uniform; for example, Japan’s  Tankan survey (not shown) sank in the first quarter to its lowest level on record   In emerging Asia and Latin America, we see a little more evidence that the sharp  drop in activity may be letting up  As in the advanced economies, most purchasing  managers’ index surveys suggest some abating in the rate of contraction, and China’s  PMI indicates that the expansion has resumed  Many of the sharpest declines in  output were in economies that were heavily exposed to the collapse in world trade   The bottom middle panel shows that exports in some countries have ticked up  somewhat or flattened out, although they are still at very low levels  To varying  degrees, industrial production has also bottomed out in China, Korea, Brazil, and  Mexico Perhaps most notably, China’s GDP release for the first quarter surprised us  on the upside, with growth rebounding—by our reckoning—to roughly 6½ percent at  an annual rate, up from just 1½ percent in the fourth quarter  We see this bounceback  as suggesting that the substantial stimulus that the authorities have put in place may  be working more quickly than we had anticipated  But we underscore our standard  disclaimers about the reliability of the Chinese data   At the time of the last Greenbook, our decision to write down a forecast that  called for the pace of contraction to ease during the second quarter was largely an act  of faith We are now a little more confident in this regard  In addition to the early  glimmers of hope in the data, governments and central banks around the world  continue to actively combat the weakness in demand with fiscal and monetary  stimulus  More central banks in the advanced economies have neared the zero lower  bound on nominal interest rates, and others have maintained or expanded their  unconventional measures  Central banks in emerging-market economies have been  able to lower their policy rates as well  Moreover, the recent commitment by the  G-20 leaders to increase the IMF’s lending capacity and the introduction of the  Fund’s new flexible credit line appear to have diminished the downside risks facing  the emerging-market economies   Based on these developments, the overall tone of our international forecast has  notched up from one of unmitigated terror in March to just very deep anxiety at  present Suffice it to say that we still see many risks  The recent data have been  mixed—with those ticking up only having done so for a month or two; financial                                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   April 28–29, 2009 33 of 201  market conditions are still fragile; and it remains to be seen whether the macro policy  responses that have been put in place will be sufficient to stem the ongoing declines  in private spending  Moreover, the recent outbreak of swine flu poses potentially  serious downside risks to economic activity, particularly in Mexico   The global recession is having a profound effect on US trade  We now estimate  that both exports and imports dropped an astonishing annual rate of 31 percent in the  first quarter, with imports more than 11 percentage points weaker than projected in  March Together these changes add 1 percentage point to US GDP growth in the  first quarter February imports were held down partly by production disruptions  associated with the Lunar New Year in Asia, but West Coast port data for March  suggest a rebound Auto trade, especially imports, should bounce back some   following North American production shutdowns earlier this year  That said, the  ongoing disruptions in the auto sector are likely to generate further fluctuations in  trade flows in coming months  Also, notably, the ISM series for export orders has  inched up from its December low   Since the March Greenbook, the broad nominal dollar has fallen roughly  3½ percent This depreciation has come  in response to a number of developments,  including the FOMC’s March announcement that it would ramp up asset purchases,  the smaller-than-expected cut in the ECB’s policy rate early this month, and signs of  diminished risk aversion—which have tended to support EME currencies  Despite  this depreciation over the past six weeks or so, the broad dollar is still up more than  2½ percent since the end of last year   Going forward, the decline in the dollar and higher foreign growth have raised our  projection for exports, and the stronger outlook for the United States has lifted our  forecast for imports as well But even after these upward revisions, the outlook for  trade is still quite weak, with exports continuing to contract through the third quarter  and import growth remaining soft  Net exports, after adding a little more than  ½ percentage point to the change in GDP in the second quarter, are projected to  subtract ½ percentage point on average in the second half of this year and in 2010   All told, while signs of stabilization might very well be appearing, they do not change  our view that the global recovery will most likely be slow and tentative  In the realm   of green shoots, our forecast is much more like a small potted plant or a vulnerable  asparagus garden than a large leafy tree  [Laughter] Brian will now continue our  presentation  "
8777,2009-06-23," We have seen a dramatic decline in the outstandings under our swap   facilities—from about $250 billion at the last meeting to about $120 billion now; and just one   other historical data point is that the peak was around $580 billion in December  My sense is   that this sharp reduction really is a reflection of healing in global dollar funding markets  I think   the policies that have been put in place with respect to IMF lending capacity have been important           June 23–24, 2009 32 of 261  in soothing nerves of investors globally, but I think that’s more for the emerging market   economies than, say, European markets, where the swap lines have been so important  In   addition, the ECB has some small swap lines with a number of European countries, but, again, I   don’t see them as playing significantly into the demand for dollar funding  The bottom line is   that healing in the dollar funding markets has been the key driver there   The Bank of England has moved at a pretty regular pace of about   £25 billion a month  One place where I think they do have a little bit of flexibility that they have   chosen not to utilize is in the composition of the purchases; they have the gilts approved, but they                   June 23–24, 2009 46 of 261  could also buy corporates and commercial paper, yet the vast majority of their purchases have   been in the gilts   There have been a number, I think, that have had to turn to their   treasuries to be recapitalized  I don’t have a lot of details about those experiences at my   fingertips, but it’s something that has happened before, and there are some precedents we could   look into   And I would bet that we could also find some examples of foreign central   banks that did have negative capital You know, it can be a little uncomfortable  For the cases   that I can think of, they have eventually gone to their treasuries to seek recapitalization, but I   think there’s a range of experiences out there with this that we can look at   Although a wide array of asset prices plays a role in our forecast,  the dollar holds a special place in the hearts of those of us in the International Finance  Division As shown in the top left panel, the broad real dollar has moved down                                 June 23–24, 2009 106 of 261  significantly since its peak in March  As displayed in the middle panel, the dollar has  posted large declines in recent months against many currencies of the advanced  foreign economies, or AFEs  The dollar has also depreciated significantly against  emerging market, or EME, currencies (shown on the right), which has prompted a  number of these countries, including Brazil, Russia, and several in emerging Asia, to  intervene in foreign exchange markets to temper the pace of their currency’s rebound  Notably, however, the dollar has essentially moved sideways since the US payrolls  release on June 5, as the less-grim-than-expected report pushed up the path of short- term US interest rates relative to those abroad   Although the dollar has declined substantially over the past few months, it still  has not reversed the sharp rise posted in the second half of 2008 and early this year,  as financial market participants sought refuge in US Treasuries  We believe that the  primary reason for the dollar’s recent depreciation is an unwinding of this flight to  safety, partly predicated on an improving outlook for the global economy  The  marked rebound in some previously distressed EME currencies is consistent with this  hypothesis In addition, as shown in the middle left, the spreads on BBB corporate  bonds have declined, most steeply in the United States, but elsewhere as well  And  global equity prices (shown on the middle right), despite retreating some in recent  sessions, have rebounded significantly on balance in recent months    In addition to an increase in risk appetite, some currencies—such as the Canadian  and Australian dollars and the Brazilian real—have been supported by a rise in  commodity prices The spot price of WTI oil (the black line in the bottom left panel)  has jumped to nearly $70 per barrel, up $15 per barrel since your last meeting, and  nonfuel commodity prices have increased about 10 percent on average  These rises  seem to signal an incipient increase in the demand for commodities, in light of  recent—and expected future—improvements in global economic conditions   Notably, the International Energy Agency and the US Department of Energy have  revised up their forecasts of global oil demand  And, as shown on the bottom right,  the Baltic Dry Index—a measure of bulk shipping rates—has recently moved up, in  line with a rebound in Chinese purchases of iron ore and other commodities   Some market commentary has also linked the dollar’s recent decline to concerns  about the US fiscal outlook and the extent of Treasury issuance  As seen in the first  panel of your next exhibit, US Treasury yields have recently moved up more than  sovereign yields abroad, but we see this difference as largely reflecting an unwinding  of flight-to-safety flows Moreover, although sovereign CDS premiums (the top right  panel) have increased some of late, they have not risen disproportionately in the  United States relative to other countries  Indeed, the dollar continued to depreciate  against the pound even after the United Kingdom was put on a credit watch by S&P  in mid-May  Other observers have attributed the dollar’s decline to anxieties about  future US inflation, but it is difficult to square this view with various measures of  inflation expectations, which seem reasonably well anchored—as Michael Kiley has  shown                               June 23–24, 2009 107 of 261  Your next panels focus on the US external sector  As shown in the table, we see  net exports adding about 1 percentage point to US economic growth in the current  quarter, with the decline in imports continuing to outpace that of exports  Thereafter,  net exports should subtract about ½ percentage point from growth in the second half  of this year and a ¼ percentage point in 2010, as the recovery of imports is seen to be  somewhat stronger than that of exports     The relative strength of imports reflects several factors  First, notwithstanding the  dollar’s recent depreciation, it is still up about 10 percent over the past year  In light  of the long lags in our trade equations, the exchange rate is likely to be a net source of  stimulus for imports and drag on exports for some time  In addition, as shown on the  right, with US and foreign GDP growth expected to proceed at roughly comparable  paces through the forecast period, the persistently higher income elasticity of US  imports—the so-called Houthakker-Magee asymmetry—should also boost import  growth relative to export growth   As seen in the bottom left panel, the current account deficit in the first quarter  narrowed to less than 3 percent of GDP, the lowest reading in a decade  However,  our forecast calls for the deficit to widen again, to about 4 percent of GDP by the end  of next year In addition to the relative strength of real imports, which I just  discussed, the run-up in oil prices plays a key role in this projection  As shown on the  right panel, the oil import balance—which had improved by $300 billion in recent  quarters—is poised to deteriorate          Your next exhibit examines the outlook for foreign activity  Aggregate GDP  growth abroad (line 1 of the table) contracted at an 8½ percent annual rate in the first  quarter, the sharpest decline on record  But recent data have signaled that the pace of  contraction slowed significantly in the second quarter and, indeed, have prompted us  to mark up our forecast  We now expect foreign growth to rise to roughly 1¾ percent  during the second half of this year and to around 3 percent in 2010  The recovery is  expected to be rather lackluster, as households and firms around the globe remain  conservative in their spending decisions and the flow of credit remains anemic as  financial institutions repair their balance sheets     In the advanced foreign economies, recent survey data, such as purchasing  managers’ indexes, are well off their recent lows and are now close to levels that  signal a stabilization of activity  In addition, a few pieces of so-called hard data for  these countries, including retail sales (the right panel) and industrial production (not  shown), seem to be flattening out   Consistent with these admittedly fledgling signs of stabilization, our forecast for  the AFEs (line 3 in the table) calls for economic growth to rise slowly from the first  quarter’s 7½ percent plunge to roughly zero in the second half of this year and to  nearly 2 percent next year  This forecast is a few tenths higher than in April, in line  with recent data and the improvement in financial conditions  The trajectory of our  forecast is also helped by a swing in the contribution from inventories in some                    June 23–24, 2009 108 of 261  countries, as firms have quickly drawn down their stocks in recent quarters   Monetary policy is another supportive factor  As you know, central banks in these  economies have cut rates to very low levels and are implementing unconventional  policy measures in an effort to stimulate economic activity   Fiscal stimulus—the bottom left panel—should also bolster activity this year  But  the fiscal boost falls off markedly next year in the AFEs, highlighting a risk that their  recoveries may stall if a rebound in private demand is not well entrenched   Moreover, labor market conditions in these economies are likely to worsen for a  while The middle panel shows projections of unemployment rates for the foreign  economies from a simple model that regresses the unemployment rate on GDP  growth and lags of both variables This framework indicates that unemployment rates  abroad are likely to continue rising until well into 2010 or even later, and European  policymakers themselves have expressed deep concerns about the near-term  trajectory of the labor market Consistent with these observations, our forecast sees  activity in the advanced foreign economies remaining quite soft, with their output  gaps (the right panel) only stabilizing next year and generally lagging the US  recovery   As shown in the table at the top of your next exhibit, GDP in the emerging market  economies (line 1) plunged at a 9¾ percent rate in the first quarter, including a  21½ percent drop in Mexico (line 4) GDP in these economies is projected to decline  slightly in the current quarter and then gradually accelerate, with growth reaching  4½ percent in 2010 This recovery is supported by a projected further recovery in  capital flows, continued stimulus from macroeconomic policies, and strengthening  global demand  The Mexican economy again contracted sharply in the second  quarter, depressed by the flu outbreak, but we see those effects as being quickly  reversed   The EMEs are showing some marked signs of improvement, especially China  As  seen in the middle left panel, China’s PMI has moved up to a reading that our  empirical work indicates is consistent with GDP growth of above 5 percent  As for  harder data, the 12-month growth of Chinese retail sales has continued to hold up  well, and that of fixed investment has risen to almost 40 percent, fueled by fiscal  stimulus and rapid bank lending  Also, as shown on the right, electricity production  and imports—two indicators that had shown marked weakness—have rebounded  vigorously of late All told, our sense is that the Chinese economy is in the midst of a  moderate recovery, but the extent to which China will become an engine of growth  for the region, or for the global economy more generally, remains to be seen   In other emerging market economies, signs of stabilization are also becoming  more apparent As in China, PMIs (the bottom left) have bounced back from their  lows in a number of emerging Asian and Latin American economies  Industrial  production (the middle panel) has decreased at a slower pace or even moved back up,  and retail sales (not shown) have righted themselves  This strengthening performance                                                            7 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 7)                          June 23–24, 2009 109 of 261  appears to stem in part from an improvement in exports (the right panel), which have  bottomed out or rebounded in many EMEs    Brian Madigan will conclude our presentation   We have reason to believe that these Chinese purchases are playing a   very special role here What is China doing with all of these commodities that they’re   purchasing? I think the answer has three parts  First, some of these commodities are actually        June 23–24, 2009 111 of 261  being consumed by Chinese firms in association with the fiscal stimulus that’s being put in place    Second, some are being used to replenish inventory levels  In the fall, when the Chinese and   global economy hit something of a wall, many firms just backed away entirely from commodity   purchases, and that is one of the reasons why the bottom fell out of the commodity market  So   those inventory levels are low, and they’re being brought back to normal levels  Third, I think   that there is some strategic purchasing going on in the Chinese economy right now    Commodities are cheap, and they’re pretty confident that at some point they’re going to need to   use them, so they’re buying things and stockpiling them   My sense is that, of those three causes, the first one is indicative of early stages of a   recovery in the Chinese economy  I think that’s probably sustainable  These inventory-based   explanations are less sustainable, so it wouldn’t surprise me if, over time, Chinese purchases   flattened out, or even came back from where they are today  Now, if that happens in the context   of a broader global recovery, less demand for basic materials from China would be offset by   increased demand from other countries  But I think there is a risk that the commodity markets   have gotten ahead of themselves and that the Chinese will stop buying at this furious pace, and   we’ll see a little bit of unwinding of the increases in commodity prices that we’ve seen over the   last few months  "
8804,2009-08-11," Since the June FOMC meeting, some encouraging signs have  emerged in the foreign economies  We now estimate that average growth abroad  edged positive last quarter, and we expect that it will rise to above 2½ percent in the  second half of this year and to 3¼ percent next year  Relative to our June forecast,  these projections are up 1 percentage point in the second half of the year and  ¼ percentage point in 2010  Given the remarkable depth of the recent downturn, we  continue to characterize the projected recovery as sluggish but not quite as sluggish as  we previously envisioned We also note that progress has been uneven across the  regions of the global economy  Asia has seen a blockbuster rebound, while in many  advanced economies and Latin America the declines in activity have continued,  although at a much reduced pace     In emerging Asia, Chinese GDP soared at an estimated 18½ percent annual rate in  the second quarter, driven by fiscal stimulus measures and accelerated bank lending   Strikingly, the increase in bank credit over the first six months of the year was equal                  August 11–12, 2009 53 of 165  to 25 percent of China’s annual GDP These hefty stimulus measures successfully  lifted domestic demand, with both investment and consumption moving up sharply   Chinese imports have also risen significantly of late, creating positive spillovers for  other countries in the region Boosted by Chinese demand but also by their own  stimulative macro policies, domestic demand in several emerging Asian economies  has revived of late, including in Korea, where second-quarter GDP moved up at a  10 percent pace  All told, we judge that emerging-Asia GDP expanded at a  12½ percent annual rate in the second quarter  Going forward, we expect economic  growth in the region to moderate to around 6 percent through the second half of this  year and in 2010 However, there are risks to this outlook  The apparent intention of  the Chinese authorities is to leave stimulative policies largely in place until external  demand recovers  The problem is that the available policy tools are mainly  administrative in nature and difficult to calibrate  If the present stimulus is removed  too abruptly, we could see a hard landing in the region  And if the stimulus is left in  place too long, the result could be an upsurge of bad loans, other financial  imbalances, or overheating economies  How this will all play out strikes us as very  much an open issue   Demand from emerging Asia appears to have resuscitated the Japanese economy   A rebound in exports and production fueled an estimated 4 percent rise in Japanese  GDP during the second quarter, following two double-digit quarterly declines  Going  forward, continued demand from emerging Asia and the gradual strengthening of  global activity more generally should allow the export-dependent Japanese economy  to grow at a rate of 2 to 3 percent through the forecast period   For the advanced foreign economies other than Japan, the pace of decline in the  second quarter appears to have let up some, but GDP by our reckoning still fell at an  annual rate of nearly 3 percent Here too, however, recent signs have been hopeful   Exports have halted their downward slide; confidence and activity surveys have  rebounded; and equity prices have continued to move up  Given these developments,  along with ongoing policy stimulus, we see growth in these economies edging back  into positive territory in the second half of this year and to 2¼ percent in 2010  This  gradual recovery is likely to be constrained by persisting financial headwinds—  particularly related to the still-fragile condition of major financial institutions in many  of these countries—and by further deterioration in labor market conditions  The  possibility that these factors may be more adverse than we now expect represents a  notable downside risk to the outlook    The spot price of WTI oil is currently around $70 per barrel, essentially  unchanged from the time of your last meeting  Although the stronger-than-expected  rebound in emerging Asia likely points to a firmer path of oil demand going forward,  oil inventory levels have increased further in recent weeks, and oil production in  Russia and several OPEC countries appears to be edging up     Concerns about the extent and timing of recovery have remained the primary  focus of policymakers in the foreign economies  Since your last meeting, major                        August 11–12, 2009 54 of 165  foreign central banks have largely extended their policy measures  The European  Central Bank in late June auctioned a mammoth €442 billion of one-year term  funding at its main refinancing rate, pushing overnight market interest rates down to  about 35 basis points  Additional one-year auctions are scheduled for September and  December, but the ECB has indicated that these auctions may be at an interest rate  above the main refinancing rate  In July, the Bank of Canada reiterated its  conditional commitment to keep its policy rate at 25 basis points until the end of the  second quarter of 2010 Finally, the Bank of England surprised markets last week  when it announced that it was expanding the size of its asset-purchase facility by  £50 billion The BOE plans to acquire the additional securities over the next three  months, which suggests a slowing in the pace of its monthly purchases from about  £25 billion to £17 billion We see major central banks leaving policy rates at their  current low levels through the end of next year  Given the gradual projected pace of  recovery in these countries and our expectation that headline CPI inflation will  remain muted, foreign central banks are likely to have ample room for maneuver in  unwinding policy stimulus   The somewhat better global outlook and a resulting increase in investor risk  appetite have led to a further 1½ percent decline in the dollar, as Brian Sack has  indicated Notably, the dollar is now near the center of its trading range over the past  18 months, down about 10 percent since its peak in early March but also up nearly  10 percent from the lows recorded during the first half of last year  Going forward,  we project that the dollar will remain on a modest downward trajectory, depreciating  at an annual rate of about 2 percent, reflecting ongoing financing pressures associated  with the current account deficit   Consistent with news around the globe, we are also seeing signs that US trade  may be bottoming out  Although real exports on average appear to have declined  further in the second quarter, recent monthly data are now pointing to a rebound  In  line with these signals, we expect exports to bounce back at a 7¼ percent pace in the  second half of the year and to expand 5¼ percent in 2010  Prompted by the weaker  dollar and the upward revision to foreign activity, we have marked up export growth  4 percentage points in the second half of this year and 1¼ percentage points next  year Similarly, we see imports expanding at a pace of roughly 7 percent in the  second half (boosted in part by a recovery in automotive imports) and nearly  5 percent next year (supported by the recovery in US demand)  Taken together, net  exports are expected to subtract about 01 percentage point from US GDP growth on  average over the forecast period, somewhat less negative than in our June forecast   The following point bears emphasis, however  Both imports and exports fell  sharply during the recent recession  The level of real imports in the second quarter is  estimated to be 20 percent below the previous peak, and the level of real exports is  down 15 percent While our forecast does incorporate some additional cyclical  rebound, over and above what our models would suggest, there is a risk that imports,  exports, or both could bounce back much more vigorously than we have written  down, with potentially sizable implications for the contribution from net exports to        August 11–12, 2009 55 of 165  US GDP growth That concludes our presentation, and we are happy to take your  questions   My sense is that there are some significant risks to the banking system   associated with this extraordinarily rapid rise in bank credit that we have seen over the last six   months Now, a good chunk of that lending was associated with the fiscal stimulus program, and   so in some sense it is at least being implicitly guaranteed by the government  Another piece of it   seems to be related to lending to regional and provincial governments  So, again, there is   something of a public guarantee  But I think, even over and above what we can link even loosely   to the fiscal stimulus, there was a substantial quantity of lending that happened  I personally find   it difficult to believe that that much credit could be allocated as quickly as we saw in the first   half of the year and for it all to be perfectly efficiently allocated  So my instinct here is that at   some point we will see some bad loans emerge  I think that is a risk  I think there is also ample   room to question how effective and efficient the Chinese banks are  On the other hand, you have   the Chinese government, which has ample resources  So my sense is that, yes, at some point   down the road we are going to see some financial aftermath of what has happened over the last        August 11–12, 2009 56 of 165  six months  But my sense is also that the Chinese authorities have resources to be able to   recapitalize and address and resolve these problems in their banking sector without its   necessarily being a first-order issue for the Chinese economy or more broadly for the global   economy   I think it is very much the intention of the Chinese authorities to continue   these policies until they see the pickup in external demand  Governor Tarullo used the analogy   at the last meeting of the Chinese being in a holding pattern, waiting for the global economy to   pick up, and I think that is exactly the right analogy  I guess what I am wondering and what I am   questioning is whether they can calibrate this stimulus, particularly the awesome monetary   stimulus, in such a way that they are able to build a bridge from where they are to the time when   global demand picks up and whether there might not be some significant imbalances that   manifest themselves between now and that point in time   One way to articulate this concern very concretely is that I very much doubt that six   months ago the Chinese authorities came to the conclusion that in the second quarter of the year   they wanted to put in stimulus such that the economy would expand at an 18½ percent annual   rate The fact that they got this outcome really emphasizes the blunt nature of the policy tools   they have If they overshoot in the second quarter, I see that there is a risk they may further   overshoot on the upside or significantly undershoot on the downside   So I just don’t fully see what the exit strategy is  Earlier this decade, people were very   concerned about a hard landing in China, and they were able to thread the needle  Maybe they   will be able to do that again  In fact, for what it is worth, that is what our forecast has written   down as a baseline against which to talk about these risks  So there is a chance that they will be   able to grow at 9 percent on average for the next six quarters or the next couple of years  But I   for one am very concerned  I see this rebound in China as really being the key driver of a lot of   what we have seen in the global economy, certainly in emerging Asia and Japan and even echoes         August 11–12, 2009 59 of 165  of it in certain places in Europe, such as Germany, where exports are picking up  So if the pace   of Chinese recovery steps down, we are looking at a much softer global outlook than we are with   a stronger China or a Chinese growth path similar to what we have in the forecast   Consistent with that, to their credit, through this period of softness and   external demand, instead of trying to depreciate the exchange rate, they have depended on   domestic demand and fiscal stimulus, and they are trying to do it themselves  So I would say   that is a step in the right direction  But then the question is, How committed are they, and at   what pace are they willing to pursue the deeper structural reforms that are going to be necessary   to support private spending and private consumption in China, such as developing financial   markets and social safety nets and that sort of thing?  "
8831,2009-09-22," The global recovery that began in Asia now looks to be more  broad-based than it appeared in August  Recent data indicate that activity abroad  expanded in the second quarter at a 1¾ percent pace, a full percentage point faster  than we had expected, with positive surprises in both emerging-market and advanced  economies  This outcome—along with improving data on manufacturing and trade,  further healing in financial markets, and the stronger US outlook—has led us to  revise up our projection of foreign economic growth ¾ percentage point in the second  half this year and ¼ percentage point in 2010   The emerging-market economies are likely to lead the recovery, with growth  averaging near 5 percent through the forecast period  Activity in the advanced  foreign economies should also pick up steam, rising from about a 2 percent rate  during the second half of this year to over 3 percent in 2011  The near-term global  expansion is supported by a turn in the inventory cycle, improvements in business and  consumer sentiment, and the ongoing effects of monetary and fiscal stimulus   Our forecast seeks to balance two competing considerations  On the one hand,  the remarkable depth of the recent recession and very low levels of resource  utilization provide scope for a snapback in activity as improving conditions unleash  pent-up demand  On the other hand, strong headwinds from lingering stresses in the  financial sector, weak labor market conditions, and expiring fiscal stimulus are likely  to restrain growth over the next two years, particularly in the advanced economies  In  response to these considerations, we have penciled in a recovery that envisions  foreign growth that is well above trend, but we also anticipate that significant slack  will persist through the end of the forecast period   In China, recent readings on industrial production, investment, and retail sales  point to continued strong expansion  Following new measures by the Chinese  authorities to moderate credit growth, bank lending slowed significantly in July and  August However, the authorities have issued assurances that their policies will  remain accommodative until a sustainable recovery is at hand  Until such time, the  authorities are likely to continue to struggle to strike the right balance between  constraining speculative behavior and maintaining an appropriately stimulative stance  of policy  As such, it remains to be seen whether the Chinese authorities will achieve  a smooth dismount from the extraordinary stimulus implemented in the first half of                          September 22–23, 2009 62 of 212  the year Growth elsewhere in the region continues to be buoyed by demand from  China, but domestic stimulus and rebounding private spending are also lending  support   Going forward, economic growth in emerging Asia should remain strong, at  around 6 percent, through the forecast period  But key risks include the possibility  that external demand may be slow to recover or that stimulative monetary conditions,  coupled with the relatively favorable outlook for the region, may trigger  unsustainable increases in asset prices    The contraction in euro-area GDP during the second quarter was much smaller  than expected, as the German and French economies showed positive growth,  supported by improved export performance  In addition, automobile purchases  surged as consumers responded to government incentives  With these incentives now  winding down, we expect euro-area consumption to weaken again, but a turnaround  in inventories, further gains in exports, and rebounding business sentiment should  fuel economic growth in the region of around 1½ percent in the second half   Thereafter, we see a moderate recovery taking hold, with GDP expanding at a  2-3 percent pace, but headwinds from weak labor market conditions and stresses in  the financial sector will constrain growth going forward   Recent signs also point to a near-term rebound among our North American  neighbors After several quarters of contraction, Canadian economic growth is  expected to rebound to 2½ percent in the second half of this year, as improved  conditions in the auto sector fuel a rise in exports and a strengthening in domestic  demand  The hard-hit Mexican economy, which over the past year has contracted  nearly 10 percent (its largest decline on record), now appears to be reviving as well   Mexican auto production was up sharply in August, and business sentiment is rising   In line with these improvements, as well as a reversal of economic drag from the  swine flu outbreak, the Mexican economy should begin to recover in the second half  of this year In 2010 and 2011, both Canada and Mexico should benefit from the  strengthening expansion in the United States   We expect that headline CPI inflation in the major foreign economies will remain  muted through the forecast period, with persistent slack preventing inflation from  breaking out on the upside and well-anchored inflation expectations keeping inflation  from dipping much on the downside  In this environment, the major central banks are  assumed to leave policy rates at their current low levels for quite some time  The  Bank of Canada has made a conditional commitment to keep its policy rate at  25 basis points through the second quarter of 2010  As such, we expect the Bank to  wait at least until the second half of next year to begin its liftoff  The Bank of  England, which last month increased its asset-purchase program by £50 billion (with  Mervyn King voting for an even larger increase), will likely refrain from tightening  until early 2011  And we believe that the ECB will also wait until 2011 to begin  raising policy rates                      September 22–23, 2009 63 of 212  The broad dollar has declined 1¾ percent since your last meeting, with an  appreciation against the pound and the peso only partially offsetting a sizable  depreciation against the euro and the yen  We project that the dollar will remain on a  modest downward trajectory, depreciating at an annual rate of about 2½ percent over  the next two years   Turning to the US external sector, nominal trade data for July pointed to a sharp  rebound in both imports and exports  In line with these data, as well as the projected  bounceback in automotive trade and the strengthening of US and foreign demand  more generally, we now expect imports and exports both to expand at roughly a  20 percent pace in the third quarter  Thereafter, rising foreign economic growth and  stimulus from recent and projected future dollar depreciation should fuel export  growth at an average annual rate of 8¼ percent through 2011, while imports are  expected to grow just a touch more slowly   Beginning with the fourth quarter, we have raised our projections for import and  export growth roughly 3 percentage points relative to the August Greenbook   Although this revision in part reflects the stronger outlook for US and foreign  activity, we have also factored in a more aggressive judgmental rebound in trade  As  of the second quarter, real imports were down 20 percent from their previous peak  and real exports were down 15 percent This cyclical downturn was much larger than  our models predicted  With the improved global outlook, we are now writing down a  bounceback that is also much larger than our models suggest, but which we believe  better matches the behavior of trade during past economic recoveries   Taken together, net exports are expected to swing from a positive contribution to  US GDP growth of 16 percentage points in the second quarter to a negative  contribution of about ¼ percentage point on average over the forecast period, just a  bit more negative than in our previous forecast   In sum, we are more confident about the projected recovery abroad than we were  in August, but much uncertainty remains about its breadth and durability  One  notable risk is that the boost from the turn in the inventory cycle may prove to be  short-lived and that consumption and investment spending may remain sluggish for  longer than we now anticipate Similarly, it is possible that the recovery in global  financial markets may have gotten ahead of itself, especially given continued balance  sheet stresses in major financial institutions  Finally, with high and rising  unemployment in many countries, intensified protectionist pressures and increased  trade barriers are an ongoing risk as well  Thank you, and we’re happy to take your  questions   Just briefly, I’d say that there have been probably three major factors that   have driven the upward revisions to our forecast since the March Greenbook, which was the   trough One is the very surprising rebound in emerging Asia  Economic growth in emerging   Asia in the second quarter was at an annual rate of  145 percent  There’s no way that we would   have seen that coming  In particular, the fiscal stimulus in China came on much more quickly        September 22–23, 2009 66 of 212  and powerfully than we expected A second factor that’s operating on our forecast, particularly   for North American countries—Mexico and Canada—is the markup in the US, which has a   very powerful effect, and to some extent the markup in emerging Asia  The third major factor   has been the much more rapid improvement in global financial conditions than we would have   expected So it’s one of the three major factors  I’m not sure exactly how we want to allocate it   across those three factors, but that’s roughly the order of magnitude   One other thought that I want to articulate is that I look at these headwinds as being a   factor that’s weighing on economic growth and affecting our central forecast, but, in addition, I   look at it as a downside risk—these headwinds may prove to be more debilitating than what we   factored into our forecast  Therefore, because of these headwinds, we have a slower pace of   foreign growth, particularly in the advanced economies, than we would otherwise; we also have   a distribution of risk that’s more skewed to the downside than would be the case without them   Yes   I would say yes, by a similar order of magnitude, but with the footnote   that perhaps the headwinds in some of the emerging-market economies are not as great because   their financial institutions have not been as affected by this crisis        September 22–23, 2009 67 of 212  Let me give some background  From July of 2008 through early March   of this year, the broad index of the dollar appreciated by about 20 percent  Since early March,   the dollar has given back about two-thirds of that strength  The story that we’ve told—and I   think it continues to be the most compelling story—is that that appreciation of the dollar was   driven by a sharp increase in risk aversion and risk appetite as people moved en masse into   Treasuries; then, over the last six months, as conditions have improved, there’s been an   unwinding of some of those risk-related flows, and the dollar has, accordingly, depreciated    We’ve also seen rather marked appreciations of a number of emerging market economy   exchange rates, which would be consistent with the story that folks are more comfortable taking   on risk   Now, specifically over the intermeeting period, we continue to hear this story about   increased risk aversion A lot of attention was paid to the bilateral rate with the euro—the dollar   did fall quite a bit over the intermeeting period against the euro—but there was an offset to that   due to an appreciation against the pound and against the Mexican peso  So all in all, the overall   move was relatively limited  Nevertheless, tone is tone, and we continue to pay attention to it  I   have to say that I firmly believe that the dollar is traded in a market, and sometimes it’s going to   go up and sometimes it’s going to go down   Ultimately, if the United States pursues sound policies, in my view, there will be   attractive investment opportunities here, and that will support the dollar over the medium term    But it’s our responsibility to make sure that those sound and strong policies are being put in   place So all in all, I’m not too concerned so far  But it’s something that we have to monitor           September 22–23, 2009 70 of 212  very closely, and we need to pay attention to what we’re hearing  Why is the dollar falling?  Is it   a lack of confidence in US policymakers, particularly on the fiscal side? You hear murmurs   from time to time that that’s a concern  So the fiscal situation is certainly something that’s   weighing on the dollar But, why is it going down?  It’s the tone of US policies, and it’s   imperative that US policies be able to deliver an array of investment opportunities so that we’ll   be attractive for international investors   Indeed  "
8859,2009-11-03," With the Federal Reserve’s temporary liquidity swap lines  expected to expire on February 1, the staff has assessed the case for putting in place a  set of standing swap lines Based on this examination, and as discussed in our  background memo, we recommend that the Committee establish standing dollar- liquidity and foreign-currency-liquidity swap lines with the European Central Bank,  the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank  Standing  dollar-liquidity lines would allow these central banks to access dollars, while foreign- currency lines would give the Federal Reserve the capacity to provide euros, yen,  sterling, and Swiss francs to US institutions  These lines would be precautionary in  nature and would be designed to serve as a backstop during times of stress  We  would expect that during normal times the lines would not be used     We propose that the limits on the new dollar lines be much smaller than those for  the temporary lines—$30 billion each for the ECB and the BOJ and $15 billion each  for the BOE and SNB This significant reduction in the size of the swap lines and in  the number of counterparties (from fourteen central banks to four) would seem to  provide a reasonable balance between the broad thrust of the Committee’s exit                 November 3–4, 2009 15 of 201  strategies and the potential utility of these lines in periods of stress  For the standing  foreign-currency lines, we propose that the sizes be comparable to those for the dollar  lines, which would also represent a significant downsizing   As envisioned, the lines would include sufficient governance features to ensure  that any use of swap line resources was consistent with the objectives and intentions  of the FOMC For example, the Federal Reserve could deny drawings to fund  intervention in foreign exchange markets  Establishment of the swap lines would  require an initial vote of the FOMC, with each line requiring re-authorization by the  FOMC on an annual basis  Initial disbursements under the lines could occur either  under the supervision of the Foreign Currency Subcommittee or require an additional  vote of the full Committee     We see the case for a small set of standing lines as quite convincing  First,  through the rigors of the crisis, the swap lines have proven useful in combating  financial stresses  Maintaining a small set of standing swap lines is the best way to  ensure that the lines are fully operational when they are needed  The routine  maintenance of standing facilities requires that technical expertise and operational  apparatus—both at the Federal Reserve and at foreign central banks—be ready to  activate at short notice In addition, coordinating policy decisions with foreign  central banks has the potential to be complicated and time consuming, so it’s  preferable to have as many as possible of these decisions negotiated in advance  Thus  we see the establishment of standing lines as being superior to just having  documentation “on the shelf”  Second, even if the lines are never activated, they  should help foster confidence in the robustness of the international financial system  and thus contribute positively to market functioning  Third, the swap lines have been  a powerful symbol of central bank cooperation The decision to create standing lines  would be seen as a signal that central banks intend to continue to work closely  together Fourth, the crisis has dramatized the remarkable extent to which financial  markets have become globally integrated The dollar swap lines expand the Federal  Reserve’s capacity to address funding pressures abroad and thus help to prevent those  pressures from spilling over to domestic markets  Finally, the swap lines foster an  expectation that home central banks will be called on to make judgments about the  financial health of their domestic institutions during times of stress  This should  enhance central banks’ incentives to keep careful tabs on the activities of their large  global institutions   The rationale for establishing dollar swap lines with the ECB, the Bank of  Japan, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank is compelling, given the  large dollar funding markets and globally active financial institutions in their  economies  And while we cannot perfectly foresee where or when US institutions  might face foreign-currency funding pressures, extending the Federal Reserve’s  capacity to act as a lender of last resort in euros, yen, sterling, and Swiss francs  strikes us as prudent insurance against a range of potential adverse scenarios     The decision to establish standing swap lines with only these four central banks  will no doubt disappoint some of our other existing central bank counterparties  But                                   November 3–4, 2009 16 of 201  our recent experience indicates that maintaining a larger network of swap lines  exposes the Federal Reserve to recurring “boundary problems”  Over the past year,  many foreign central banks have petitioned the Federal Reserve to establish  temporary swap lines with them  Given that we value our relationships with these  central banks, turning down such requests has at times put us in a difficult position   Our proposal sets a very high bar for the establishment of standing swap lines, which  should minimize such difficulties in the future   We propose that these lines be structured broadly—as the temporary lines have  been—with short-maturity draws and safeguards to ensure that the credit risk to the  Federal Reserve is nil In addition, the pricing structure for the swap lines would be  negotiated with an eye toward mitigating moral hazard by providing funds to  institutions at a rate that is attractive during times of stress but not attractive during  normal times  Notably, the pricing of the temporary dollar lines appears to have  satisfied this objective Total outstandings under these lines surged to over  $580 billion in December 2008 as the crisis intensified but have since dropped to less  than $35 billion as conditions have improved  We expect that the high bar for central  bank counterparties and the smaller sizes of the lines will also limit the extent of  moral hazard  Of course, if stresses emerge, additional swap lines could be put in  place and the size of the lines could be scaled up, but there is no guarantee that the  Federal Reserve and other central banks would actually choose to do so in any  particular case   The staff proposes that the standing lines become effective on the day that the  temporary lines expire, thus providing a seamless transition between the two types of  lines Given the continued healing in funding markets, our working assumption is  that the temporary swap lines will expire on February 1 as scheduled   If the Committee supports moving forward with standing swap lines, the staff  would immediately begin to negotiate the details of these arrangements with the  foreign central banks The staff would then ask the Committee to vote on a formal  resolution at either the December or the January meeting, depending on the pace of  those negotiations and other developments  We anticipate that the creation of the  standing swap lines would be publicly announced shortly following the meeting in  which the resolution was approved We would, of course, keep the Committee  apprised of developments influencing this timetable as they evolve   Finally, I turn to a brief discussion of our standing swap lines under the North  American Framework Agreement (NAFA)  These lines are relatively small, sized at  $3 billion for Mexico and $2 billion for Canada  The staff sees two broad approaches  for dealing with these lines  The first is simply to leave them in place in their current  form  Given their relatively small size, these lines are largely vestigial, so the  benefits and costs of maintaining them “as is” are both minimal     Another option would be to modernize these lines—changing their structure and  legal documentation to match more closely those of our other standing lines   Notably, the NAFA lines were established with the explicit purpose of promoting                        November 3–4, 2009 17 of 201  orderly conditions in foreign exchange markets, and they have a relatively rigid  pricing structure We would suggest refocusing the lines more directly on countering  dollar funding pressures This could be done by making their pricing more flexible,  consistent with the broad principles discussed above, and by increasing the sizes of  the lines to, say, $8 billion or $10 billion     The following points argue for modernization  First, the extent of North  American integration provides a special justification for these lines and a rationale for  treating Canada and Mexico differently from other countries  Second, our sense is  that officials in these countries would welcome this approach, and not enhancing the  lines might strain our relationships with them  Third, it seems more orderly and  transparent to have all our lines—both with the four foreign central banks and with  our NAFA counterparties—structured in a broadly similar way  Fourth, Mexico  already has an arrangement under the IMF’s flexible credit lines, so the swap line  would not be substituting for a relationship with the Fund   However, we also note some reservations  First, financial institutions in Canada  and Mexico are not globally active in the same sense as institutions in the economies  of our other four counterparties  Second, seeing that Mexico has a swap line, other  emerging market economies might request lines as well  Our substantial integration  with Mexico should provide persuasive responses to these requests, but it might be  better not to open this door at all  Third, the quality of Mexico’s economic and  financial policies and the stability of its underlying institutions are not yet comparable  to those of our four other counterparties or to Canada’s  On balance, the staff leans  toward a recommendation to modernize the NAFA swap lines, but this is admittedly a  close call We envision that any enhancements to the NAFA lines would be  implemented on the same timetable as that for the other standing swap lines  Chris  Burke will now continue our presentation   We don’t have a precise number, given some reporting issues for the euro   system, which would include all of the NCBs plus the ECB, but those dollar reserves are   somewhere on the order of about $150 billion to $160 billion  For the BOJ, it’s a bit over   $800 billion They were very, very substantial holders of dollar reserves  For the Bank of            November 3–4, 2009 22 of 201  England, it’s roughly on the order of $15 billion, and for the Swiss National Bank it’s around   $23 billion   I’m not quite sure     It seems to me that the major difference is that, in the one case, they   would have to sell off their holdings of government securities, which if you are thinking that this   might occur during a period of stress could be unsettling to the government securities market    What these swap lines do is allow these foreign central banks to have access to dollar liquidity   without actually asking them to liquefy their reserves   These are probably Treasuries  That’s what I was referring to  It may be   that during a period of stress you don’t want them to be selling off their Treasuries  That could   be disruptive to the market   That has been our experience over the last crisis, absolutely  But do you   want to bet that in every state of nature that’s the way it’s going to be?  You know, there are   risks, and we don’t know which way foreign preferences will go toward Treasuries at some   future time   My understanding is that it’s some of both   Through the swap lines Given the pricing structure of the swap lines,   getting funds through the swap lines has been relatively expensive  So if they have had a choice,   they haven’t gone to the swap lines   Through the interbank market?   I would assume so   That’s right Their capacity to be able to go into the market and access   reserves Obviously, there is a price component to that  But as we saw through the last crisis, as   the interbank market came under stress, the volume of transactions also dried up  So I think that,   in addition to a price component, there was a rationing going on in the market as well   Right And in particular, maybe some institutions that may not have   access to our domestic facilities  Nevertheless, as you recall early on in the crisis, these guys   were coming into the money markets in New York and creating volatility through their demands   for dollar funding In particular, early in the day they were demanding huge quantities of   liquidity and driving up the rate, and then the rate would crash at the end of the day  But it was   making Vice Chairman Dudley’s job extremely difficult  So there are important spillover effects   for us, and we point to this as one of the major reasons that it is important to maintain the   capacity to provide dollar liquidity to foreign markets    A couple of thoughts  Your general point is well taken  On the first point in   terms of the pulling back, the scaling, and so on and so forth, our view is that we need to have a   certain small number of swap lines in order to have the operational capacity to understand how they   work, to have thought through all of the legal issues, and also to have a good sense from the   Committee and from other central banks as to what the appropriate policy objectives of these things   are But from that relatively small set, if conditions require, it’s usually fairly easy to scale it out    So I’m not worried about— if we only have four and then the world blows up and we want to have   fourteen again— whether it is going to be harder to go from four to fourteen  No I would be   worried about going from zero to four, however  Ten years from now, the folks in New York who   did all the work may be onto other things or other positions, and just as was the case in this last                                        November 3–4, 2009 31 of 201  episode, we had to run around and pretty much figure these things out from scratch I actually think   that Trish has a few purple hearts that she earned in that process    Now, the flip side of this is that we gave them a swap line once, and if things get bad, we’re   going to give them a swap line again  I think that is a very reasonable presumption if a crisis erupts   in a year or two years  But if the next crisis is eight or ten years out, there is a lot of water under the   bridge The world looks a lot different, and it’s not clear to me that there is the same presumption    Now, the Committee at that point may want to look at it and come to the conclusion that, yes, we   want to give Korea another swap line, but I do not think there would be as strong a presumption as   if they actually had a swap line with us   So I do think there is some meaning in where we draw this set of counterparties  As I   mentioned in my remarks—but it is an important point—it is also very helpful to us in managing   our relationships with foreign central banks from here until the time of the next crisis  on Yes   I don’t have specific information about that institution  The motivation for   this proposal, however, is much broader and more generic than a single institution  Our expectation   is that these lines wouldn’t be used anytime soon  We do not have a single institution in mind  But   we do have a generic class of problems in mind in which you have a US institution that is   operating abroad that for some reason has either difficulty in mobilizing its collateral to use at the   foreign central bank’s window or a real possibility that the foreign central bank is unwilling to lend   to an institution with legitimate collateral  We have had conversations with various central banks—   one in particular—when they have said that, under certain circumstances, they wouldn’t be willing   to lend to our institutions  So these are very precautionary in nature, but I think that they respond to   a real class of problems that it makes sense for us to take out some insurance against    That’s right   Right  Particularly the counterparties, the size, and how to handle the North   American swaps with Mexico and Canada   Yes, absolutely  The memo that we put forward didn’t have a lot of   quantitative indicators for these economies  We’ve gone down that path in the past, and the   problem we have is that there is a whole range of different things—comparing apples and oranges                           November 3–4, 2009 54 of 201  That makes it very difficult to compare  But in this particular case, one of the reasons we came up   with the recommendation that we did is, as the Chairman mentioned, the large size of the financial   institutions from these four, and then the dollar funding markets in these economies clearly set them   apart from other potential counterparties  You really see a qualitative difference between the folks   that we are recommending and the ones that we aren’t  Given that there is such a gap, my sense is   that it’s not creating stigma in saying that the dollar funding needs and the size of institutions for   these four are different from those for the Koreans or the Mexicans  I think they very much agree   with that   Now, the justification for the North American ones is a little different  As the Chairman   mentioned, that has to do with the extent of our integration  If Mexico blows up, there is a high   probability that we’re going to feel some effect from that, or if the Canadians have some sort of   financial tension, there’s a high probability we’re going to feel that  That is a different kind of   relationship than exists with some of the Asian economies, even though we also very much value   those relationships   The other point that I think is worth making here, which also helps with the stigma point, is   that, over the last year, the stable of IMF facilities has expanded  In particular, they now have a   very attractive facility, the flexible credit lines, which Mexico has received, which is geared for top-  tier emerging-market economies and is designed to give them significant access to liquidity, frankly,   on more-generous terms and longer horizons than our swap lines would  So there are other   mechanisms out there in the global financial system to address these issues of stigma, including   what the IMF has to offer

8886,2009-12-15," The foreign economic recovery has continued to broaden and  deepen We now judge that real GDP abroad expanded at a 4¼ percent rate in the  third quarter The emerging market economies (EMEs) continued to lead the  rebound, with growth strengthening in the third quarter to a 9 percent pace  Notably,  the Mexican economy bounced back vigorously, as it shook off the restraining effects  of the H1N1 virus and as automotive production there resumed  Third-quarter growth  in emerging Asia stepped down from the 15 percent surge in the previous quarter but  remained near 10 percent, as activity in the region continued to benefit from policy  stimulus and the rebound in global trade   In the advanced foreign economies, real  GDP growth turned slightly positive on average in the third quarter, after five  consecutive quarters of contraction  But the bad news is that final domestic demand  remained quite sluggish in many of these economies, including the euro area, the  United Kingdom, and Japan   Fourth quarter data suggest that growth in the EMEs is moderating to a more  sustainable 5 percent pace, which we believe is likely to continue through the forecast  period We note that the vigor of the recovery in emerging Asia has kicked off  rebounds in asset prices in the region and led to concerns that bubbles may be  forming  While the city-states of Hong Kong and Singapore have seen marked  increases in real estate prices, property prices in other Asian economies are flat or up  only moderately, and forward-looking price–earnings ratios for equities are within  historical ranges Of course, we will continue to monitor this issue closely going  forward   For the advanced economies, we forecast that growth will strengthen from just  under 1 percent in the third quarter to over 3 percent by 2011  We expect that private  spending in these economies will eventually pick up, boosted by normalizing  financial and credit conditions, improving economic sentiment, and the ongoing  recovery in the United States The possibility that private spending in the advanced  economies might rebound more slowly than we now envision is an important  downside risk to our outlook, both for these economies and for export-dependent  emerging markets   This month marks the 20th anniversary of the peak of the Japanese equity bubble,  and policymakers there continue to struggle to find a formula that will allow the  economy to shake off its sustained malaise Japan was hit hard by the collapse in  global trade during the crisis, but the country is now recording a strong rebound in its  exports to emerging Asia, and its banks did not have the same exposure to toxic  financial assets that has plagued many other advanced-economy banking systems   Nevertheless, the prospects for Japanese recovery remain quite uncertain  After an  encouraging second quarter rebound, Japanese GDP growth slowed to a meager                      December 15–16, 2009 45 of 247  1¼ percent pace in the third quarter  Private demand continues to be soft, held back  by weaknesses in labor and housing markets  The recent strengthening of the yen is  another source of restraint, and headline consumer price deflation intensified to a  record 2½ percent in October   Apart from our concerns about the apparent intensification of Japanese deflation,  we expect that foreign inflation will remain well behaved through the forecast period,  averaging around 2 percent per year This projection is shaped by ongoing evidence  that inflation expectations abroad are generally well anchored and by our view that  economic slack will remain sizable in many countries, even at the end of the forecast  period In addition, in line with quotes from futures markets, our forecast calls for  commodity prices to be relatively well contained going forward  Since your last  meeting, the spot price of WTI [West Texas Intermediate] oil has fallen $10 per  barrel, to about $70 A portion of this decrease was unique to WTI, but last week the  prices of other grades of oil posted notable declines as well   We continue to watch for signs as to when the foreign authorities will withdraw  policy stimulus  On the fiscal front, new governments in Germany and Japan  announced measures that should give some small additional support to their  recoveries and that signal a continuing commitment to stimulative policies  However,  the potential constraints on fiscal policy were underscored by the credit rating  agencies’ recent moves to downgrade Greek sovereign debt and to place Spain and  Portugal on negative watch, in response to concerns about the sustainability of their  respective fiscal positions S&P [Standard & Poor’s] yesterday joined Fitch in  downgrading Mexico’s credit rating to BBB, citing the country’s diminishing oil  production, failure to expand its narrow non-oil tax base, and diminished prospects  for fiscal reforms during the second half of President Calderón’s term   As for monetary policy, the Bank of England increased its asset-purchase facility  by £25 billion, and the Bank of Japan introduced a three-month lending facility   Although the European Central Bank announced plans to begin winding up its  exceptional liquidity support facilities, markets seem to have pushed back a bit the  expected start of monetary policy tightening by the ECB and other major central  banks Our forecast calls for the Bank of Canada to begin tightening policy in the  second half of next year and for the ECB and BOE to follow suit in early 2011  We  anticipate that the BOJ will keep its policy rate at 10 basis points through the end of  the forecast period   The foreign exchange value of the dollar fell through the month of November but  has since rebounded vigorously on stronger-than-expected US data  On net, the  dollar is little changed since the last FOMC meeting  The dollar’s moves against the  yen were particularly marked, as it traded briefly in late November as low as  85 against the yen, prompting market chatter that the Japanese authorities would  intervene to forestall further appreciation of their currency  The dollar subsequently  rallied, closing above 89 against the yen, down less than 2 percent over the  intermeeting period  The dollar also declined against the Korean won and the                 December 15–16, 2009 46 of 247  Mexican peso, but moved up against the euro, the Swiss franc, and the Brazilian real   Relative to its peak in early March this year, the nominal broad dollar index is down   12 percent, but it still remains roughly 7 percent above its 2008 trough  Our forecast   maintains the working assumption that the real broad dollar index will depreciate at   roughly a 2 percent pace on average over the next two years    Last week, after the Greenbook went to bed, we received the October trade data    Exports showed greater-than-expected strength; the gains were broad-based, but   particularly large for capital and consumer goods  In response, we have marked up   our projection for fourth quarter export growth by nearly 4 percentage points to a   robust 16 percent clip Imports also surprised on the upside, albeit to a lesser extent    The upshot is that net exports are likely to add ¼ percentage point more to GDP   growth in the fourth quarter than we anticipated in the Greenbook, bringing their   contribution to ½ percentage point    Going forward, export growth should proceed at about a 9 percent pace through the next  two years, stimulated by declines in the dollar and the ongoing rebound in foreign activity   Import growth is likely to be a bit slower, in the ballpark of 7½ percent, supported by the  US recovery but restrained by headwinds from the dollar  Because imports grow from a  higher base, however, the contribution of net exports to US GDP growth is expected to be  roughly neutral over the forecast period   Thank you  That concludes our prepared remarks   We’re happy to take your questions  "
8915,2010-01-26,"  It came back quickly    Our outlook for the foreign economies is now brighter than we   expected at the time of the June chart show  The global recovery broadened and   became more established in the second half of last year, with growth taking hold in   both the emerging-market and advanced foreign economies  We estimate that total   foreign GDP (line 1 in the table) rose at a 2¾ percent rate in the fourth quarter,   moderating some after a 4½ percent rebound in the previous quarter   Going forward, the foreign economies should continue with this moderate   recovery, expanding at an average pace of about 3½ percent this year and 4 percent   next year  We anticipate that persistent stresses—including from difficult labor   market conditions and deteriorated fiscal positions—will weigh on private spending   and keep output in many countries well below potential  But the forces supporting   recovery should be sufficient to ensure that the recovery does not stall   Broadly in line with these expectations, foreign inflation (line 12) is seen to hover   around 2 percent through the next two years  As shown on the right, our forecast for   inflation is predicated on a leveling-out of oil and other commodity prices, following   their surprisingly sharp rebound over the past year  One notable risk is that the   ongoing recovery may continue to push commodity prices higher, with consequent   upside pressures on global inflation  An offsetting risk, however, is that prevailing   slack may weigh on prices to a greater extent than we now deem likely     Recent indicators have pointed to generally vibrant demand in the emerging-  market economies (EMEs)  As shown on the middle left, Chinese industrial   production has continued to power ahead, and a recent surge in exports has made   China the world’s largest exporter  Other emerging Asian economies (the middle   panel) have also seen a solid rebound in exports and industrial production  In Latin   America (on the right), Brazilian production has bounced back vigorously from its   year-end 2008 low, and other indicators for that country also point to strength  In   contrast, the rebound in Mexican production has been comparatively tepid, but   Mexico’s expansion is likely to gain steam going forward, in step with the US   recovery   The advanced foreign economies (AFEs) are also recovering, but at a more muted   pace  In Japan (the bottom left panel), exports have recently recorded a solid   rebound, but household spending remains soft  Going forward, we see the Japanese   economy expanding at a 2 percent rate, slightly above consensus, but still implying an   output gap of roughly 5 percent of GDP at the end of next year and continuing   declines in consumer prices  Given the sustained deflationary pressures that are afoot   January 26–27, 2010 104 of 260    in the Japanese economy—nominal GDP has fallen nearly 10 percent since the first   quarter of 2008—there is a compelling case for the BOJ to ease its policy decisively    Moving to the right panel, the pace of activity in the euro area appeared to decelerate   at the end of last year, with retail sales continuing to edge down and industrial   production still not showing much vigor                 As shown in your next exhibit, our leap of faith—and indeed a linchpin of our   outlook—is the assumption that private final demand in the AFEs will strengthen   over the forecast period, even as support from fiscal stimulus and inventories abates    We see private demand growth gradually rising in the euro area, Japan, and the   United Kingdom, in line with improving financial conditions, strengthening   sentiment, and ongoing support from monetary policy  Private spending in Canada is   likely to continue to expand briskly, supported by strong global demand for   commodities and the ongoing rebound in the auto sector     Strained fiscal positions are one unfortunate legacy of the crisis and a notable risk   to the recovery  As shown in the middle left panel, fiscal stimulus measures,   financial sector rescues, and the recession have led to steep rises in debt-to-GDP   ratios  As such, fiscal retrenchment—and the drag on economic growth that this   implies—will be unavoidable  But getting the timing of this retrenchment right is   likely to be challenging  Moreover, markets may push countries with fiscal   imbalances to consolidate more rapidly or more substantially than we have assumed   in our baseline  Ireland has already announced deep fiscal cuts in response to such   pressures  And revelations of Greece’s enormous budget deficits have driven up   sharply the spread on its sovereign bonds (the green line in the middle panel)  By this   metric, the contagion to other potentially vulnerable euro-area countries, such as   Spain or Portugal, has remained limited to date  If a full-blown debt crisis does erupt   in Greece, there seems to be little consensus in Europe as to how it should be   managed and, hence, might expose deeper divisions among euro-area countries   As shown on the middle right, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England are   expected to begin raising rates in the second half of this year, whereas the ECB will   wait until early next year  Our best guess is that the BOJ will keep its policy rate   close to zero forever, [laughter] but at any rate through the end of the forecast period    We note, however, that recent inflation data for the United Kingdom and Canada   have come in above our expectations, highlighting that the risks around our policy   rate assumptions are now two-sided   Difficult conditions in labor markets are also likely to exert a drag on the recovery   in the AFEs  As shown in the bottom left panel, these countries have seen a much   shallower decline in employment than that in the United States, in part reflecting   public payments to firms to keep employees on their payrolls  On the flip side,   greater labor hoarding has implied sizable declines in productivity (the right panel) in   contrast to the substantial increases seen in the United States  This labor hoarding   will likely impede the pace of hiring, and hence of household spending, through the   recovery  An unsettled issue is to what extent these declines in labor productivity are   January 26–27, 2010 105 of 260    purely cyclical versus reflecting longer-term scars associated with the crisis, which   would suggest lower levels of potential output going forward                  The sources of growth in the emerging-market economies are more difficult for us   to parse out  That said, there is little doubt that domestic demand in China (the top   left panel in your next exhibit) is barreling ahead, with both investment and   consumption expanding briskly  Domestic demand in other EMEs also appears to   have bounced back rapidly in the second half of last year  Growth in these countries,   as in China, has been supported by policy stimulus and by temporary boosts from the   inventory cycle  Our forecast calls for domestic demand in the EMEs to moderate   this year, as a strengthening in underlying private demand allows the authorities to   begin withdrawing policy stimulus  However, we continue to believe that a durable   rebound in the EMEs is likely to depend importantly on a recovery in private   spending in the advanced economies   As highlighted in the middle left panel, the generally favorable growth prospects   for the EMEs, along with improvements in global financial conditions, have driven a   sharp rebound in capital inflows  This, in turn, has stoked concerns that asset-price   bubbles may be forming, especially in emerging Asia  The middle panel shows that   forward-looking ratios of equity prices to expected earnings have risen, but such   ratios remain within historical ranges  And, as shown on the right, while Hong Kong   and Singapore have seen property prices rise sharply, particularly at the high end of   the market, prices in other Asian economies appear to be flat or up only moderately    All told, we are not convinced that asset bubbles are emerging in earnest, but we will   continue to monitor this closely   In response to strengthening economic conditions and some recent upside   inflation surprises, major EMEs are moving to tighten policy  As displayed on the   bottom left, restrictions by the Chinese authorities on certain kinds of lending   successfully reduced the pace of credit growth during the second half of last year    However, loan growth surged again during January, reportedly prompting the Chinese   authorities to impose more-aggressive tightening measures on several banks  And   earlier this month, the People’s Bank of China surprised the markets (and us) by   raising its reserve requirements 50 basis points  Finally, we expect the impetus from   fiscal policy (the right panel) to diminish markedly this year in China and to be a drag   on growth in other major emerging-market economies   Turning to your final international exhibit, in the weeks since the favorable   November employment report (and despite the less impressive report for December),   the dollar has moved up markedly against the euro  This rise has been driven both by   increased optimism about the prospects for US growth and by uncertainties about   the outlook for the euro area, reflecting both soft incoming data and mounting   concerns about fiscal problems, particularly in Greece  The dollar is also up some on   net against the yen and a number of other currencies   January 26–27, 2010 106 of 260    Even after these gains, however, the real broad dollar index (shown on the right)   is still down about 5 percent since the time of the June chart show  As we have noted   previously, much of this decline appears to reflect normalization in risk appetite    Broadly consistent with this hypothesis, the green line in the middle left panel shows   that US residents have resumed their purchases of foreign securities after pulling   back during the crisis  In contrast, private foreign purchases of US securities (the   red line) have remained anemic on net, as rising acquisitions of US equities have   been largely offset by sales of debt instruments, particularly corporate bonds               4 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   As reported in the table, US exports and imports both expanded at a double-digit   clip in the fourth quarter as they continued to bounce back from their crisis-induced   lows  Going forward, the recovery in foreign and domestic output should be   sufficient to ensure that trade growth remains healthy, at a pace of around 9½ percent   for exports and 8½ percent for imports  Exports receive an additional boost from the   dollar  These projections imply that the contribution from net exports to US GDP   growth will be negligible on average over the next two years  As seen in the bottom   left panel, real exports and imports should both be at or above their pre-crisis peaks   by the end of 2011   Finally, as shown on the right, we project that the current account deficit will   hover around 3 percent of GDP through the forecast period  Longer-term simulations   of our models indicate that annual dollar depreciation of roughly 2¼ percent in the   years beyond the forecast period—a touch less than we have assumed for this year   and next—would be sufficient to close the current account deficit by 2020  Brian   Madigan will now conclude our presentation    That is a pronounced risk  I think that the key question we have a very   hard time getting our hands around, given data limitations, is all of the stuff that was shipped to   China over the last year, how much of it has gone into inventories, and how much of it has   actually been utilized  Our thinking about this issue and how we reconcile continued increases in   global demand, on the one hand, and global GDP with this flat commodity path, on the other, is   that, first, there was an element of inventory accumulation that occurred last year  As those   inventories get replenished, the demand would come down, holding all else equal  But that is   offset by continued growth, so we have some shifting in the nature of the demand that is going   on   Then the second thing is that if we really believe that, both for oil and other kinds of   commodities, there are some supply-side effects that are likely to come on line over the next few   years  For instance, we were told that the copper industry by historical standards is at a   January 26–27, 2010 111 of 260    relatively low level of capacity utilization  So we are hoping—and it really is a hope because we   don’t have the data that we want to confirm this—that there will be a different mix of purchases   with less inventory replenishment during the coming year and that we will see some supply   responses, and for that reason this futures path with flat commodity prices will materialize  But I   think our track record on forecasting commodities shows that any forecast we write down there   has considerable uncertainty around it, and my instinct is that there is more upside than downside   risk to our commodity prices outlook now    There has been some reversal  Nevertheless, our broad nonfuel   commodity-price index is up roughly 15 percent since early October, with most of those gains   concentrated in metals and agricultural raw materials  Food has been very bouncy  We have had   a huge harvest, and there is a lot of downward pressure on prices there; also, some idiosyncratic   stuff with beverage prices  But “some commodity prices” would be consistent with the facts    Right  The index that I was making reference to—we take an IMF index,   and we reweight it based on US consumption  "
8939,2010-03-16,"  Economic activity abroad has continued to gain steam, but the   pace of recovery across regions remains uneven  Foreign GDP growth in the fourth   quarter came in at 4¾ percent, nearly 2 percentage points stronger than we had   expected  Notable upside surprises were recorded in Canada, Latin America, and   through much of Asia  However, concerns about the ongoing stresses in Southern   Europe, the slightly softer outlook for US activity, and our judgment that the fourth-  quarter rise reflected in part a temporary boost from inventories have all tempered   any inclination to mark up our forecast  As such, we continue to expect foreign   growth to average about 3¾ percent through the next two years, with a small upward   revision in the first half of this year and a modest downward revision thereafter  We   anticipate that private final demand will gradually firm, as financial headwinds   continue to subside, labor market conditions improve, and monetary policy remains   accommodative   The global recovery continues to be led by the emerging market economies    Recent data suggest that China’s economy is expanding at a near double-digit pace,   driven by solid domestic demand and firming international trade  With inflation now   moving up, the Chinese authorities will continue to tighten policy in the months   ahead, with particular emphasis on keeping credit growth in check   The recovery also appears to be strengthening in Latin America  The Brazilian   economy has been buoyant, with some confidence indicators reaching all-time highs    And in Mexico, fourth-quarter activity surged at an energetic 8½ percent rate,   reflecting strong manufacturing output and rising exports to the United States—in   line with the continued recovery in automotive trade  Going forward, we expect   Mexican growth to step down to a still solid 4 percent pace, broadly in line with the   forecast for the United States   In the advanced economies, growth prospects are more mixed  Canadian   domestic demand remains strong, with GDP projected to rise 3½ percent on average   over the next two years  Growth in Japan may finally be getting its footing    Supported by strong exports to Asia, Japanese GDP expanded solidly in the fourth   quarter, and recent data have been encouraging  Nevertheless, with persistent   March 16, 2010 37 of 146    deflation, nominal GDP back to 1991 levels, and public debt approaching 200 percent   of GDP, Japanese policymakers face some daunting challenges                    Ongoing stresses in Greece and other Southern European countries are weighing   on the outlook for the euro area  Greek spreads over comparable German bunds   remain elevated but retreated some following the Greek government’s announcement   of sizable fiscal cuts designed to narrow the budget deficit by 4 percent of GDP this   year  The introduction of these measures also appears to have greatly improved the   prospects for financial support from other EU countries  Given these developments,   we are hopeful that the financial stresses in Greece will now gradually abate    However, this outcome is far from certain and, in any event, the planned path of fiscal   retrenchment is likely to restrain Greek activity severely over the next several years   Triggered by the ongoing stresses in Greece, financial markets have become   increasingly attuned to sovereign risk  While to date these concerns have been   principally focused on Southern Europe, there are other countries in the world that   face a troubled fiscal outlook  If market pressures were to force a broader group of   countries to consolidate their budget positions sharply, the negative impulse to global   growth could be substantial  Increased anxieties regarding sovereign risk also could   create stresses for the global banking system—both through banks’ direct holdings of   sovereign credit and through higher funding costs and increased macroeconomic   uncertainties  Recent developments have also highlighted some key weaknesses in   the institutional infrastructure of the euro area, including the limited capacity to   provide conditional financial support to a stressed member and the lack of any sort of   streamlined and transparent decisionmaking apparatus     Recent data for the euro area have been generally downbeat, with GDP rising at a   meager ½ percent pace in the fourth quarter and more recent indicators also indicating   little momentum  That said, the latest release of industrial production data, which   came in after the Greenbook closed, was more encouraging  These data showed a   record increase in January and pointed both to stronger first-quarter GDP growth than   we had envisioned in the Greenbook and to an upward revision for the fourth quarter     Activity in the United Kingdom expanded at a disappointing 1¼ percent pace in   the fourth quarter  We expect that ongoing balance sheet pressures in the household   and financial sectors and strains from prospective fiscal retrenchment will weigh   heavily on UK activity through the forecast period   Increased concerns about the outlook for Europe have led us—and the markets—  to push back the timing of rate hikes by the Bank of England and the ECB  We now   anticipate that the BOE will remain on hold until early next year and the ECB for a   couple of quarters longer  In contrast, we continue to expect that the Bank of Canada   will lift off in the second half of 2010  Other industrial country commodity   producers—notably, Australia and Norway—have already started to hike rates    Likewise, several emerging market economies have also begun to tighten monetary   policy, and others are expected to start soon   March 16, 2010 38 of 146             The dollar has risen slightly on balance since the last Greenbook, gaining more   than 4 percent against the euro and 8 percent against plummeting sterling  The   decline in the UK currency reflects growing concerns over the country’s fiscal   outlook and a rise in political risk, as polls increasingly suggest a hung parliament   following the May general election  But the dollar is down some against the   Canadian dollar and several major EME currencies, in line with the strong recent data   for these countries  Going forward, we continue to project that the broad real dollar   will depreciate at roughly a 3 percent annual pace, similar to the January Greenbook    Our projected paths for oil and nonfuel commodity prices are also little changed from   the last Greenbook   The January trade data, which we received after our forecast went to bed, were   well aligned with our expectation that net exports are poised to subtract only   01 percentage point from growth in the first quarter  Thereafter, exports are slated to   rise at roughly a 9 percent pace, supported by stimulus from the dollar and the   ongoing recovery abroad  Imports should increase at a slightly slower 8 percent rate,   in line with strengthening US activity, but from a higher level  Together, these paths   imply a slightly negative contribution from net exports to US GDP growth on   average over the forecast period  This contribution is little changed from the previous   Greenbook, as the negative impact of the higher dollar is balanced by the softer   outlook for US growth  That concludes our presentation  We’re happy to take   questions  "
8963,2010-04-27,"  The number that I’ve seen is around $90 billion for the gross CDS   outstanding  The net is only about a tenth of that, from what we hear  It’s hard to get a   comprehensive accounting of that, but it doesn’t seem, on either a gross or a net basis, to be a   first-order concern  It looks like roughly a third of the CDS were written by US institutions,   April 27–28, 2010 14 of 206                   and I guess that a sizable share was written by Europeans  We understand that the Greek banks   themselves have sold some CDS exposure, but we don’t have a comprehensive accounting of   that    The recent news from abroad has been dominated by a crescendo   of market anxiety regarding Greece  What seemed several months ago to be a   manageable set of problems is now on the verge of metastasizing, and European   authorities still have not been able to marshal a convincing response   April 27–28, 2010 66 of 206                                  On April 11, after months of delay, European governments announced a   €45 billion support package for Greece in conjunction with the IMF  In principle, this   package was sufficient to ensure that the Greek government could meet its financial   obligations over the next year  The package nevertheless did little to boost   confidence, as it became clear that disbursements would require parliamentary   approval in some countries, including Germany, and as questions arose regarding   Greece’s willingness to accept IMF conditionality   The situation intensified further late last week  Eurostat indicated that Greece’s   budget deficit in 2009 was actually 136 percent of GDP, somewhat higher than   previously reported  Reports also emerged that—including the government’s off-  balance-sheet swaps—the debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of 2009 may have exceeded   120 percent  In response, the Greek 10-year sovereign spread surged to 600 basis   points over German bunds  Subsequently, the Greek government formally requested   financial support from the European Union and the IMF, but spreads climbed further   today, to over 670 basis points, on news that S&P had downgraded Greek debt three   notches to BB+ (or junk status), which puts Greek debt on par with Azerbaijan  (I   should note that the two-year Greek spreads, which Brian Sack cited in his   presentation, are higher and have risen even more than these 10-year spreads that I’ve   noted)   The European authorities are now focused on constructing a set of measures   sufficient to stabilize confidence  We have been told on a confidential basis that an   enhanced financial support package is being negotiated, with an eye toward locking   in financing for several years  To buoy market confidence, these funds would need to   have transparent disbursement mechanisms and be readily available  In particular,   Greece has €9½ billion of debt payments due on May 19 and will need access to   outside support by that time  Such a package would also need to be accompanied by   progress in negotiating a credible adjustment program with the IMF  Given that there   is no scope to adjust the nominal exchange rate, the Fund is reportedly calling for a   15 to 20 percent decline in Greek real wages over the next several years as part of a   program to invigorate the country’s lagging international competitiveness   But even with a sizable financing package in place, the situation in Greece will   remain tenuous  The government is aiming to reduce its budget deficit by 10 percent   of GDP or more over the course of the next three years  Implementing such a   program will require exceptional discipline, which to date has not been the hallmark   of Greek economic policy  Moreover, the program’s internal consistency is open to   question—such rapid fiscal contraction could weigh heavily on economic activity and   tax revenues and thus fail to deliver the desired improvement in the budget deficit   There are also deeper questions about the sustainability of Greece’s debt burden    Several years ago, investors were happy to hold the country’s debt at razor-thin   30 basis point spreads over German bunds  In this respect, the stresses in Greece are   a delayed manifestation of the same mispricing of risk that has driven the global   April 27–28, 2010 67 of 206                   financial crisis  A key question for debt sustainability is where these spreads—and   hence Greek yields—will eventually settle  By our reckoning, a stringent and   sustained fiscal adjustment program, paired with average debt yields of around   5½ percent, would just stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio at 140 percent  And such a   scenario would imply a debt service burden of over 7½ percent of GDP, which is very   heavy by historical standards  While our sense is that the European authorities still   consider a restructuring of Greek debt unthinkable, it ultimately may prove   unavoidable            I turn now to the question of potential spillovers  As outlined in our Greenbook   box, banks in a number of European countries—most notably France and Germany—  have meaningful exposures to Greece  But the larger shocks would likely occur   through confidence channels and a related pulling back from sovereign risk  The   most vulnerable countries in this respect are Portugal, Ireland, and Spain, all of which   ran budget deficits last year at or near 10 percent of GDP  Of these three, Portugal is   the most vulnerable, with a 10 percent of GDP current account deficit and   government debt of around 80 percent of GDP  Consistent with this observation,   S&P this morning also cut Portugal’s rating from A+ to A−, noting that the   government could struggle in coming years to “stabilize its relatively high debt ratio”    Imbalances in Ireland and Spain appear to be less pronounced, and economic   policymakers in these countries seem to have greater credibility  As for spillovers to   the United States, our models suggest that the key channel of transmission is likely to   be through exchange rate appreciation, to the extent that stresses drive safe-haven   flows into the dollar  That said, we also cannot rule out the possibility that full-blown   disruptions in Southern Europe could generate stresses for a whole range of other   countries that struggle with large fiscal deficits, potentially including the United   Kingdom and the United States   In recognition of the fact that there is still a world beyond Greece, I will conclude   by making several remarks about international developments more generally  First,   economic data received since the last FOMC meeting generally point to continued   recovery abroad  We now estimate that foreign GDP in the first quarter expanded at a   4½ percent pace, nearly a percentage point stronger than we had expected in the   March Greenbook  This stronger outcome was due in large measure to a 30 percent   (annual rate) bounce in Singapore’s notoriously volatile GDP data and yet another   quarter of double-digit economic growth in China  Going forward, foreign growth   should step down to about a 3¾ percent pace through the rest of this year and next    This forecast incorporates a slightly stronger near-term outlook for the Asian EMEs,   which is offset by a reduction in our projections for the euro area  Although recent   data for the euro area have held up surprisingly well, and our baseline forecast   envisions that stresses in Greece will gradually abate, we judge that increased   uncertainties in Southern Europe will weigh on activity in the region for some time   Second, the spot price of WTI oil has risen about $2 per barrel since your last   meeting, and nonfuel commodity prices are also up some, led by sharp increases in   the prices of metals and lumber  The rise in commodity prices appears to reflect the   April 27–28, 2010 68 of 206                   ongoing global recovery, especially in emerging-market economies  Indeed, for oil,   recent data from the International Energy Agency show that demand in the EMEs,   particularly in China, has been even stronger than previously thought  Increases in   commodity prices over the past year or so have lifted inflation rates around the world,   but we expect foreign inflation to move back down by the second half of this year, in   line with a projected flattening out of commodity prices                   3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   The jumping off point for the dollar in our current forecast is just slightly weaker   than in March, as increases against the euro and the yen offset declines against the   Canadian dollar and a range of emerging-market currencies  Our forecast continues   to call for the Chinese authorities to begin a gradual appreciation of their currency   against the dollar during the next couple of months  In addition, other emerging   Asian currencies are now expected to appreciate more rapidly than we envisioned in   March, consistent with the strong growth outcomes in that region  On net, we expect   the broad real dollar to depreciate at roughly a 3½ percent pace over the forecast   period, slightly more than in the last Greenbook, with this depreciation coming   disproportionately against emerging market currencies   Finally, I note that US exports are projected to rise at a 9 percent pace through   the end of next year, boosted by a declining dollar and the ongoing recovery abroad    Imports should expand at just below that pace—though from a higher level—as the   US economy strengthens  Taken together, these projections imply a contribution   from net exports to US GDP growth that is roughly neutral through the forecast   period   Brian Madigan will continue our presentation    I think that even today we saw increased evidence of that metastasis with   the downgrade in Portugal  Let me give just a little bit of a time line here  I think that the   Europeans are hoping for a package to be announced in early May, within a week or so, and that   would be voted on by the European Union and by the IMF executive board a week after that,   which would make it strategically after the May 9 German state elections, which would then put   money in the hands of the Greeks so that they would be able to make their €95 billion payment   on May 19  My sense of the most likely outcome is that things will go reasonably smoothly over   the next several weeks and Greece will get the money without any further blowups  This is   what’s incorporated in our baseline forecast   April 27–28, 2010 74 of 206                   Nevertheless, there are lots of risks  The Germans have not been willing to commit   categorically to supporting a package  Other European countries have said, “Well, if Germany   hasn’t quite gotten around yet to voting for the money, we’ll make it up and make sure that the   Greeks have the €10 billion”  So there are all sorts of different ways it can blow up over the next   couple of weeks, including the possibility that the Greeks and the IMF don’t have an agreement    But I would expect it would go reasonably smoothly over these next six weeks, with all sorts of   downside risks associated with it; then, over the course of months—probably not years—people   would start doing real hard analysis on the debt-sustainability issues   At some point, the Greeks are going to have to make a firm, firm commitment to this   fiscal adjustment package and have some social cohesion on it, which they don’t have yet—  they’ve been rioting in the streets in Athens and criticizing the finance minister and others for   going forward in this direction  If Greece doesn’t get social cohesion on this issue, then I think,   at some point over the next six months or so, the situation would deteriorate and blow up    Maybe the Chairman heard something different over the weekend, but at least in my   conversations and in what I’ve read, the Europeans at this stage are not at all willing to entertain   the notion that a debt restructuring is probably in the cards on this one    In terms of the transmission, my sense is that Portugal is very vulnerable    They have big fiscal deficits, relatively large debt-to-GDP ratios, and I think there’s a perception   that they have not yet taken the situation sufficiently seriously and put into place a rigorous   adjustment program to address the fiscal problems that they face  I see Portugal as being quite   vulnerable  In contrast, I think it would take a very strong wind for this thing to spill over into   Spain  Spain is much larger  It doesn’t have the imbalances  It has been influenced by the   global financial crisis and is experiencing a severe recession, but underneath it, I think that   there’s pretty much universal respect for the Spanish policymakers   With that said, if things did move from Portugal and Greece into Spain, then at that point   it would get brutal, and let me give you one parameterization of that  Western European bank   exposure, including the CDS, to Greece is about $240 billion  To Portugal it’s about   $290 billion  To Spain it’s almost a trillion dollars  So if it hits Spain, I think what we have is   not just a Southern European crisis, but we also have a more generalized sovereign risk crisis    At that point, I’d say that there’s some probability that it could move across the channel to the   United Kingdom and perhaps become a broader problem  I see in this a firewall between the   Portuguese and the Spaniards  If the crisis blows over that firewall, then it could get much more   severe    I know the maturity structure on Greek debt  It’s about eight years on   average, which is the only reason this thing hasn’t been even worse  I don’t know off the top of   my head the maturity structure for Spain, but that’s something that’s knowable, and we can get it   to you quickly  "
8987,2010-05-09,"  I am indeed    That is  We are having consultations with staff at the foreign central   banks and essentially dusting off the technical apparatus that we used when the swap lines were   functioning  Our sense is that we could certainly do an announcement tonight and that we can   agree on some common language with them  That would allow them to do auctions probably by   Tuesday, and then the disbursement of any auction funds would probably be by Wednesday or   Thursday of next week  So if it’s the will of the Committee, our sense on the technical side is   that we can move pretty quickly with this    People are very, very nervous  In terms of specific policy   announcements, people are waiting for the press release from Ecofin  Nobody had as much   information as you just articulated to us  One point that came up several times in the meetings   was that European participants noted that the real risks to their banking systems are tied into this   sovereign stress  Their banks are holding sovereign instruments; the increased funding costs for   the sovereigns are passed through in the increased funding costs to the banking system; and,   perhaps most importantly, the stressed sovereigns are reducing the capacity of governments to   provide a backstop for the banking system  So they see the heart and soul of the stresses on the   banking system as reflecting these sovereign stresses rather than some sort of previously existing   balance sheet problems    My feeling is that our primary source of surety is the goodwill guarantee   that these major central banks give us that they will make good on unwinding the swap  Now, if   the euro were to fall substantially, that would result in our euro holdings being worth less than   the swap value of the dollars  One protection we have against that is that these are relatively   short-term transactions  In the past, we have not taken steps like trying to do margins or mark to   market or that sort of thing    Yes    That’s right  That’s the primary source of surety  Even if the euro falls   and becomes worth less than the dollar, the ECB is still contractually obligated to repay us  So   the decline in the value of the euro would be important only in the state of nature where the ECB   had defaulted, and we would put essentially zero possibility on that    I think that that would be at the discretion of the Committee  But in the   past these maturities have ranged from overnight, to one week, to one month, out to three   months  And we’ve tailored the maturity of various auctions to meet the perceived liquidity   strains that existed in the markets  Ideally, we’d continue to have that kind of flexibility to   determine the tenor of the swap funds based on market conditions    In response to the first question, it would be the case that these funds   would be restricted to be used for liquidity purposes  They wouldn’t be available for foreign   exchange market intervention, as was the case with similar kinds of contracts that prevailed   when we had the swap lines in place before, with similar kinds of safeguards to keep the funds   from being used for that purpose    Brian actually has these data     We have never released swap agreements to the public  It could be done,   but we’d probably want to look them over very carefully first, just for the sake of transparency   and clarity    Yes, that’s right  We had what was called offset rights with the emerging   market economies  That meant that we could attach anything that they were holding at the New   York Fed in the event that they failed to unwind the swap that had been contractually agreed   upon  We haven’t had that with the advanced economies, with the ECB and the like   May 9, 2010 25 of 42              Yes    The recent data for Europe, particularly for Germany, have been   surprisingly strong  I think the characterization by President Evans is right on  For the Germans,   particularly, their export machine is getting cranked up, and they’re doing a lot of exporting to   emerging Asia and to some of the oil-producing countries   I very much share your view that there are risks to all of them moving together to do   fiscal consolidation and that this would ideally be a time when the Germans were taking steps to   strengthen their domestic demand and provide a buffer for the necessary, unavoidable fiscal   consolidation that has to go on elsewhere in the euro area   All in all, I would say there’s a reasonable chance that the Germans would be able to   avoid recession, but, if everybody moves together on fiscal consolidation, I would expect to see   some not very good growth numbers coming out of Europe over the next number of quarters   May 9, 2010 28 of 42              That’s right  We had temporary liquidity swap lines with both of them at   the same time that we had the NAFA lines  And it didn’t create any operational or   communication or other kinds of problems  "
9012,2010-06-22,"  This is a really, really tough question—it throws us into a truly Knightian   world, and I’m not quite sure how to parse out all the pros and cons  My gut instinct is that, at   some point over the next three to five years, the Greeks are going to have to restructure their   debt  I don’t expect them to leave the euro area, and my intuition for that is that leaving the euro   area would be even more disruptive for them and for their economic relationships than the debt   default would be  I think that they’ve seen over the last decade that they benefit from deeper   integration into Europe and the backstop that that provides  I don’t think that it’s in their interest   to leave, even if it would provide a temporary boost to their competitiveness  Now, one can also   argue that maybe Europe is going to decide they don’t want them anymore, and they’re going to   develop new institutions to give them the capacity to eject a member—again, we’re in kind of a   Knightian world of all sorts of different options  But I would put a fairly high probability on an   eventual restructuring—at some point beyond the end of the forecast period, as Chris said  They   have enough money committed now to get them into 2012, but I really would not put a lot of   weight on a country leaving the euro area—probably less than the 20 percent weight that Brian’s   survey yielded  "
9038,2010-08-10,"  According to the advance NIPA data, net exports subtracted an   estimated 2¾ percentage points from economic growth in the second quarter  I wish I   could say that we had seen this coming  But sadly, this outcome is a full   2½ percentage points more negative than we had projected in the June Tealbook  (I   am taking pride in the fact that we at least got the sign right)  While real exports   barreled along at a 10 percent pace in the quarter, just a touch stronger than we had   expected, real imports are estimated to have surged nearly 30 percent, their fastest   quarterly growth in more than 25 years  This increase was broad-based and included   a large rise in capital goods imports, in line with the strength of US E&S investment    While the release of the June trade data tomorrow morning will no doubt bring further   revisions, the import data to date have shown no signs that the appetite of the US   economy for foreign goods has faded in recent months   More generally, we see the strength of imports in the second quarter—as well as   the ongoing vigor of exports—as a continuation of the cyclical rebound in US trade    Both imports and exports fell during the financial crisis more rapidly and more   substantially than our models predicted and have bounced back in a similar fashion    Incorporating the second-quarter data, real imports have now retraced nearly two-  thirds of their 20 percent crisis-driven decline, while real exports have recovered   more than four-fifths of their 15 percent drop  The upshot is that, going forward,   trade is likely to grow somewhat more slowly than it has over the past year   Specifically, we see import growth moving down to roughly a 5 percent pace in   the second half of this year, reflecting some payback from the second-quarter surge   and drag from the dollar, which has depreciated about 3 percent in broad real terms   since the last FOMC meeting  In 2011, imports should expand at a 6½ percent rate,   as the US recovery gains steam  Export growth is likely to be somewhat stronger   than import growth, hovering in the 8-10 percent range, supported by the solid   expansion abroad and stimulus from the dollar  Taken together, net exports should   add just under ½ percentage point to US GDP growth on average through the second   half of this year and be about neutral next year  We certify that these projections for   net exports will be within 3 percentage points of the actual outcomes   I should say, “I hope we can certify” [Laughter]   August 10, 2010 15 of 160             For many of the foreign economies, the pace of economic growth seems to be   cooling some, in line with our expectations of a sustained, but moderate, global   recovery  In emerging Asia, GDP growth in China and in Korea stepped down in the   second quarter, albeit to still strong rates; and elsewhere in the region, higher-  frequency indicators, such as purchasing managers’ indexes, have eased a bit  In   Brazil, the growth of industrial production has slowed as the government has   unwound fiscal stimulus measures  And the recent softening of US growth will   likely be echoed in a slower second-half pace of expansion in Mexico and Canada   Markets have shown some uneasiness about these signs of moderation abroad,   particularly regarding the outlook for China  Policy tightening measures in China do   seem to have tempered the pace of activity there more quickly than we had expected,   leading us to edge down our forecast  But the authorities have shown a remarkable   ability in recent years to keep the economy on an even keel, successfully navigating   between the twin risks of overheating and hard landing  At present, we see scope for   policy stimulus, if needed, to maintain economic growth at roughly an 8½ percent   rate through the forecast period  In addition, with Chinese housing prices recently   leveling off and credit growth having slowed, financial stability risks there may be   diminishing  Notably, central banks around the world seem to have taken the signs of   cooling global activity in stride, with many moving over the intermeeting period to   reduce slightly the degree of monetary accommodation   Europe has been an important exception to this picture of near-term moderation    UK GDP surprised sharply on the upside in the second quarter  And, even more   striking, euro-area PMIs and economic sentiment measures have risen through July,   and industrial production has trended higher, defying my admittedly grim   expectations  In light of these data, we now estimate that real GDP in the euro area   rose 2¾ percent in the second quarter, up a percentage point from our last forecast    This near-term strength has been concentrated in the core economies, especially   Germany, where exports have risen at a rapid pace through June, benefiting from the   rebound in global trade  The weakening of the euro during the first half of the year   seems to have provided some support to activity as well  However, the euro’s   appreciation over the intermeeting period—including a 7 percent rise against the   dollar—will limit this support somewhat going forward  In contrast to Germany,   indicators for Greece and Portugal underscore the much weaker performance of those   economies that are undergoing forced fiscal consolidation   Financial conditions in Europe also appear to have settled some  Two significant   risk events—the ending of the ECB’s first one-year long-term refinancing operation   and the publication of the EU-wide bank stress tests—passed without disruption,   leaving stock markets modestly higher and risk spreads on sovereign debt generally   lower  Investors also seemed to take comfort from favorable earnings reports from   European banks and from several oversubscribed government-debt auctions by   vulnerable euro-area countries    While there is certainly scope to question some aspects of the stress tests, the   information released during this exercise—especially details on bank holdings of   August 10, 2010 16 of 160             sovereign debt—has enabled analysts to gauge for themselves the extent of capital   shortfalls, with the range of resulting estimates well within the capacity of European   governments to absorb  Since the completion of the stress tests, funding conditions   for more vulnerable European banks have thawed some, but we see little evidence   that private investors are poised to open their checkbooks to recapitalize these   institutions  Although the stress tests have provided some confidence regarding the   asset side of the European banks’ balance sheets, much uncertainty remains regarding   the liability side of their balance sheets and their funding strategies, as well as the   medium-term profitability of some banks’ business models    Given these upbeat macro data and somewhat less strained financial conditions,   we have revised growth prospects for the euro area up slightly  In addition, our sense   is that tail risks for the region have eased noticeably  That said, we continue to expect   that euro-area growth will be muted, averaging just 1¼ percent through the end of   next year, as the continent contends with an uneven road to fiscal consolidation and   the banks struggle to repair their balance sheets   All told, our forecast for the foreign economies is little changed since the last   Tealbook, with the small upward revisions to Europe largely offset by modest   markdowns elsewhere, most notably in China  We continue to see aggregate growth   abroad stepping down from above 4½ percent in the first half of this year to a more   sustainable 3½ percent pace through the forecast period  Although the recent data   seem broadly in line with our projection for a continued—but moderately paced—  recovery abroad, we are now at a pivotal point in the cycle at which private domestic   spending in many countries will need to strengthen to offset diminishing stimulus   from inventories and macroeconomic policies  Moreover, the softer near-term   outlook for the United States is a salient concern for some countries that have relied   on considerable support from external demand thus far  We will watch closely to see   whether private spending across the globe rebounds as projected  Thank you, and   we’ll be happy to take your questions    I think so  Stock markets are up generally a little bit  Longer-term bond   yields are down generally  How to interpret that, I think, is an open issue  On the other hand,   commodity prices are up a little bit and, in certain soft commodity classes, prices are up a lot due   to the drought  But, in general, I think we would still say the situation is slightly more   accommodative and more supportive than before    I think an important addendum from the global perspective is that, with   these developments in Europe, our perception—and I think the market’s perception—is that   August 10, 2010 21 of 160             there’s less tail risk out there  That might also be somewhat more supportive of financial   conditions    Less downside tail risk    For example, six weeks ago we were worried about some sort of a near-  term apocalypse in Europe, which now seems much, much less likely  "
9061,2010-09-21,"  The broad dollar index is only slightly stronger than in our last   forecast, but foreign exchange markets have nevertheless been the source of some   fireworks  On September 15, the Japanese Ministry of Finance intervened   unilaterally to weaken the yen, which had approached record nominal highs against   the dollar  The Japanese authorities purchased $25 billion, their largest one-day   operation in history, and the yen depreciated about 3 percent against the dollar in   response  Since then, the yen has held steady at about ¥85½ per dollar  Coming so   soon after Prime Minister Kan’s victory in his party’s leadership election, the   intervention and its timing clearly had political overtones  That said, the operation   seemed to surprise market participants, mainly because it was Mr Kan’s defeated   rival who had vigorously advocated intervention     In justifying the intervention operation, Japanese officials argued that the rising   yen was reducing the competitiveness of exports, driving down equity prices, and   weighing on business sentiment  They also emphasized the need to ensure that there   were “two-sided risks” in the market  On the other hand, the yen was not particularly   strong in real effective terms; recent moves in the yen seem reasonably well   explained by the evolution of interest rates and shifts in risk appetite; and Japanese   exports have been expanding at a solid pace   Turning to US trade, real exports of goods and services grew at a 10 percent rate   in the first half of this year and should continue at that pace in the second half    Imports, on the other hand, exploded in the second quarter, posting 33 percent   growth, even faster than the estimate that I reported at your August meeting  Import   growth in the second half of the year is projected to fall back to just 4 percent,   reflecting payback from several factors that lifted the second-quarter number,   including a perplexing seasonal adjustment procedure for oil imports  Notably, the   July trade data showed a contraction in imports, broadly consistent with this   projection  In 2011 and 2012, imports are likely to strengthen, in line with the   projected US recovery   September 21, 2010 22 of 151             Driven by the surge in imports, net exports in the second quarter subtracted a   staggering 3½ percentage points from real GDP growth  As imports fall back to a   more sustainable pace, we expect net exports to contribute ½ percentage point to   growth in the second half of this year and to be roughly neutral thereafter  Strong   export growth—supported by a depreciating dollar and a moderate foreign   recovery—should about offset the contribution from imports, which expand more   slowly but from a larger base   The strength of the recovery abroad surprised us in the second quarter, with real   GDP growth rising to nearly 6 percent, a percentage point stronger than we had   estimated in August  Activity in the euro area continued to show remarkable   resilience, with GDP expanding at almost a 4 percent rate in the quarter and the   German economy—boosted by strong external demand—recording its most rapid   quarterly growth rate since reunification  Not to be outshone by their advanced   economy counterparts, the emerging market economies collectively grew at an annual   rate of almost 10 percent in the second quarter, with activity in Mexico posting a   particularly sizable gain   Indicators for the third quarter, however, point to a deceleration in foreign   activity, broadly in line with our expectation of a moderate recovery abroad  In   emerging Asia, PMIs in a number of the smaller economies have moved down   markedly in recent months, and their exports and production have slowed  Early in   the intermeeting period, Chinese indicators for July also posted softer readings but   generally bounced back in August, with industrial production, retail sales, fixed-asset   investment, and the PMI all posting gains  All in all, we see growth in emerging Asia   stepping down from its double-digit first-half pace to about 4½ percent in the second   half of the year, with growth rising slowly thereafter  This outlook is just a bit   weaker than in the last Tealbook  While there is a notable risk that the recent data   may be signaling a more pronounced slowdown in emerging Asia than is seen in   these projections, we expect that private domestic spending will help support the next   stage of the region’s recovery, as stimulus from the rebound in trade and inventories   abates  And many of these economies have scope to use expansionary policies to   stimulate economic growth if the recovery falters   In the euro area, indicators for the third quarter have been mixed  Manufacturing   PMIs edged down in August, and the most recent readings on industrial production   have been flat  Retail sales and consumer confidence, however, came in stronger than   we had expected  Looking ahead, we see growth in the euro area moving down to   around 1½ percent on average through the end of next year  This projection is a bit   stronger than in August, in line with our reading of the recent data  We continue to   expect that banking sector stresses and fiscal turmoil will restrain the pace of   recovery   Notably, we are also seeing significant divergence within the euro area  As I   mentioned, German economic growth boomed in the second quarter, but Spanish and   Portuguese GDP eked out only modest gains, and a 7 percent contraction in Greek   GDP furthered the country’s apparent slide from advanced economy to emerging   September 21, 2010 23 of 151             market status  We judge that even if Greece adheres to its fiscal adjustment program,   further steps will need to be taken to address its debt sustainability problems  Such   steps could include a modification in the terms of its debt held by the official sector,   the provision of additional funds from European or international institutions, and a   restructuring of its obligations to the private sector  Our forecast maintains the   working assumption that such steps can be taken without disruptions for the euro area   as a whole   That said, news out of Ireland has taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks    Ireland’s two largest banks reported sizable first-half losses and sharp increases in   their nonperforming loans  In addition, the authorities announced a large capital   injection for Anglo Irish, the third largest bank  Still severe economic conditions, in   particular falling house prices and a drop in nominal GDP of nearly 20 percent over   the past three years, threaten to weaken the banking system further  While the   government has moved resolutely to address these problems, the banking system is   very large relative to the economy, and these efforts have raised concerns about the   sustainability of the resulting fiscal obligations  S&P now estimates that the gross   cost of resolving the banking sector’s problems could surpass 50 percent of GDP   (excluding future recoveries) and, accordingly, has notched the country’s credit rating   down from AA to AA-  The thorny challenge of how to support large banks in small   countries, which manifested itself most starkly in Iceland, is a notable risk to both   global financial stability and the foreign outlook   In sum, we expect foreign growth to slow from the 6 percent second-quarter pace   to about 2¾ percent in the second half of this year  Growth abroad should then rise to   a little under 3½ percent in 2011 and 2012, as financial stresses wane and private   spending firms  This outlook has been revised down some since August, reflecting   the slightly softer outlook for emerging Asia and the weaker path of US activity    While our forecast envisions an anxiety-soothing, soft-landing scenario for foreign   growth, we recognize that the risks around this outlook are high  In addition to   concerns about the durability of the US recovery, our projections for activity abroad   could be pulled down further by banking or fiscal stresses in Europe, a disappointing   performance of private demand in emerging Asia, or—in the wake of the Japanese   intervention and with Congress now considering trade sanctions against China—an   increase in protectionist pressures, trade frictions, and beggar-thy-neighbor policies    Thank you, and we’re happy to take your questions    I know that over the years Japan has been referred to in those terms, and   maybe Greece is raising them a notch    I don’t have that at my fingertips, but that’s something that we do follow,   and we can get you an answer to that  "
9105,2010-11-02,"  Friday’s advance NIPA data indicate that the US economy is   clinging tenaciously to its role as the world’s importer of first resort  [Laughter]  Net   exports now subtract a hefty 2 percentage points from US real GDP growth in the   third quarter, compared with a roughly neutral contribution in the September   Tealbook  Exports were softer than we had anticipated, expanding at only a 5 percent   pace  And imports continued to show remarkable strength, climbing 17½ percent,   after an expansion of more than 30 percent in the previous quarter   Given that US consumption, E&S investment, and inventories during the third   quarter also came in stronger than was expected in the last Tealbook, the surge in   imports may reflect a post-recession rebound of domestic spending in categories that   are particularly import-intensive  As such, we are sticking to our story that the recent   pace of import growth represents a robust but essentially one-off bounceback from   the recession-induced trough  Our forecast for the current quarter thus has imports   falling back some—and export growth picking up—causing net exports to add nearly   1¾ percentage points to US growth  But this story can be stretched only so far    Following the third-quarter surge, real imports are now very close to their pre-crisis   peak and, in fact, are somewhat above the level predicted by our trade models    Further upside surprises would send us back to our desks to rethink our views   Going forward, the external sector features prominently in the upward revision to   the US outlook, as David has noted  We expect import growth over the next two   years to settle at roughly a 6 percent rate and to broadly mirror the contours of the   projected US recovery  We see exports expanding at a pace of around 8½ percent   through the forecast period, up nearly 1 percentage point from the previous forecast   This stronger projection for exports is largely the result of our lower path for the   dollar  The broad nominal dollar is down about 3 percent since the September   Tealbook, with market commentary attributing much of this decline to anticipated   large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve  As we outlined in a Tealbook   box, our analysis of the response of the dollar to previous LSAP announcements—as   well as simulations using our large-scale models—suggests that an LSAP that   reduced yields on 10-year Treasuries by 25 basis points would trigger a depreciation   of the dollar somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 to 3 percent  In light of these   estimates, our best judgment is that an LSAP of moderate size has now been priced   into foreign exchange markets  Of course, any such estimates are highly uncertain    Looking ahead, we see the dollar depreciating at about a 2½ percent pace in each of   the next two years, with this depreciation coming disproportionately against the   emerging market currencies   November 2–3, 2010 30 of 238             In line with the recent decline in the dollar, as well as stronger readings on global   oil consumption, the spot price of WTI has risen to $83 per barrel, up more than   $6 since the last Tealbook  Prices of nonfuel commodities have also risen, with   factors in addition to the dollar playing a central role  For example, recent news from   the USDA of a weaker-than-expected harvest has pushed up corn prices, and supply   concerns have caused cotton prices to rise sharply  Given these upward moves in   nonfuel commodity prices, coupled with the direct effects of the lower dollar, prices   of imported core goods are likely to rise at an annual rate of 4½ percent this quarter   and next, before moderating to increases of 1¾ percent in the middle of next year               Growth in the advanced foreign economies appears to have slowed to around   2 percent in the second half of this year  Consumption and trade data are coming in   soft in Canada and Japan, and activity in Europe is moderating but continues to be   resilient in the face of ongoing concerns about the peripheral countries  We expect   growth in the AFEs to remain lackluster in 2011, at around 2 percent, and then to   edge up to 2½ percent in 2012  Although further normalization of financial   conditions and progress in repairing balance sheets will help raise private spending,   growth will increasingly be weighed down by fiscal consolidation, especially in   Europe   In recent weeks, several advanced-economy central banks have leaned toward an   easier path of monetary policy  The Bank of Japan did so explicitly by cutting its   policy rate a bit further, committing to hold the target rate near zero until inflation in   a 0 to 2 percent range is “in sight,” and announcing an asset-purchase program worth   about $60 billion  In addition, markets pushed back expectations for when policy   rates would be tightened by both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, the   latter of which is actively debating the possibility of further asset purchases  Notably,   additional action by the FOMC could very well be the tipping point that would lead   the Bank of England, and perhaps the Bank of Japan as well, to implement significant   further easing measures  In contrast, our friends at the ECB—although unlikely to   raise their benchmark policy rate any time soon—seem intent on winding up their   unconventional operations, despite persisting vulnerabilities in Greece, Portugal, and   Ireland   In the emerging market economies, the prospect of further quantitative easing in   advanced economies has been a source of considerable angst  Our counterparts at   EME central banks have openly complained that surging capital inflows are driving   up domestic asset prices, causing their economies to overheat and putting unwelcome   upward pressure on their exchange rates  Data for EME-specific mutual funds and   US portfolio investment abroad show that inflows to the EMEs have risen over the   past couple of months to relatively high levels  The situation at present does not seem   to pose any first-order risks either to these economies or more generally, but sustained   inflows of this magnitude could eventually become a cause for concern   Largely in line with our expectations, real GDP growth in the EMEs appears to   have cooled from its robust 8 percent pace in the first half of the year to just over   November 2–3, 2010 31 of 238             3 percent in the second half, as the inventory and trade cycle has matured and policy   has begun to tighten  We project that EME growth over the next two years will rise   back to around 5 percent, supported by continued growth in China—where recent   data have pointed to strength—and the projected recovery in the United States  This   path of EME activity rises only a bit above our rough estimates of potential output,   but increased inflation pressures or imbalances in certain countries or sectors are   clearly a risk, especially given the recent rise in capital inflows                  To date, EME central banks have responded to these developments by some   combination of tightening monetary policy, stepping up intervention in currency   markets, imposing additional capital controls, and allowing some appreciation of their   currencies  The People’s Bank of China unexpectedly raised its lending and deposit   rates for the first time in three years; and the central banks of Chile, Singapore, and   Taiwan also tightened  Both Brazil and Thailand announced new measures to   discourage portfolio capital inflows in an attempt to ease pressures on their   currencies   However, the drivers of increased capital inflows are more fundamental than just   divergent stances of monetary policy  These flows reflect market expectations that   the cyclical rebound in the EMEs will be more robust than in the advanced economies   and that the long-term prospects for the EMEs are likely brighter as well  But if such   views prove correct, at least some EMEs should be capable of absorbing greater   exchange rate appreciation  This, in turn would bring a rebalancing of global demand   away from economies that are running relatively hot and toward the rest of the world    The result would be a more balanced and sustainable global recovery  In contrast,   EME policies geared at continued reliance on external demand—and repression of   domestic spending—are likely to result in subpar global outcomes, as private demand   in the United States and other advanced economies is unlikely to be as robust as it   was before the crisis   Gretchen Weinbach will now continue our presentation    Let me back up  In the second quarter, the 33 percent surge was broad-   based across all classes of imports, and it was particularly skewed towards automotives and   capital goods  But the third-quarter numbers that we’re getting are somewhat less about   automotives, though they continue to be about capital goods  We’re also seeing some strength in   consumer goods, which is a very important piece of information  But in general, both quarters   have been fairly broad-based    Yes    I would say that we’re certainly hearing a lot of hue and cry, and that   over the last couple of months we’ve seen a significant pickup in capital flows to EMEs  But, at   this point, we don’t see widespread problems with currencies being overvalued, we don’t see   widespread problems with asset bubbles, and we don’t see widespread problems with inflation   and economic overheating  If flows were to continue at this significant pace for an extended   period of time—and I don’t know how long that is; I don’t know if that’s 6 months or 12 months   or 24 months—certain problems might emerge   That being said, it’s also important to put all of this in a broader context  As I   emphasized in my remarks, I see a lot of this happening independent of any decision that this   Committee makes  It’s true that these flows are partially in response to interest rate differentials   and policy differentials, but also, independent of what we’re doing, the emerging markets are   November 2–3, 2010 37 of 238             enjoying a very strong cyclical rebound, and the data over the intermeeting period were, if   anything, a bit on the stronger side for them  Beyond the near term, these countries structurally   are very attractive targets for investment  So, given the cyclical and structural challenges, I think   there is an increased burden on the emerging markets to put in place robust policy responses to   capital flows, and I think they’re moving in that direction—they’re responding in a variety of   different ways with a variety of different policy tools  There’s no simple answer, but I feel that   they’re making progress  At this stage I’m not pushing any panic buttons, but we’ll continue to   watch very closely    I would put Japan in a much different category and a much different   situation from these robust, dynamic emerging-market economies  My feeling about the present   valuation of the yen is that it is high if looked at from a two- or three-year perspective  When   you look at the real effective yen relative to where it has been over the last 10 or 15 years, it’s   very close to the middle of the range, and Japanese exports this year have been reasonably   strong  I think that the dynamism in Asia is a much more important issue for Japan and its   external competitiveness than whether the yen is at 85 or 90 or 82 or whatever    Well, Canada tightened during the intermeeting period, but our best   guess now is that Canada is going to stay put for a year or so—that’s what’s incorporated in our   November 2–3, 2010 38 of 238             forecast and that’s what we’re hearing from the Bank of Canada  I would be surprised, as I said   in my remarks, if the ECB moved  Regarding the Bank of England, I personally put more than   50–50 odds on it implementing further accommodative measures over the next six weeks or two   months  And I think that, once the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England moved, there   would be intense pressure on the Bank of Japan to do something more  It comes out every few   months with incremental measures that are slightly more accommodative, but I think there would   be pressure on it to do something in a significant fashion  I can’t think of changes at any other   major central banks  The Sveriges Riksbank also tightened over the intermeeting period but   emphasized uncertain global conditions, so it seems that it may be in a “stay put” mode; and the   Reserve Bank of Australia actually just tightened, which I take as a very positive signal about   conditions in Asia  "
9130,2010-12-14,"  Our feeling was that six months is a good chunk of time  It gives the   Committee ample governance of it so that six months from now we can sit down again and   reassess  But I very much share your view that it’s unlikely that this crisis will be completely   behind us after six months, but it might make sense at that point to want to reassess and   reevaluate whether you want to extend the swap lines    My guess is that six months out there will still be a lot of uncertainties,   and a lot of the arguments that we’re putting forward today about the swap lines providing a   backstop will probably still be legitimate  But the sense of the staff was that it made sense to   give the Committee another “bite at the apple,” so to speak, six months out and make sure that   you still wanted to extend it  Certainly, the staff is not opposed to a longer extension if that’s the   preference of the Committee  We’d be comfortable extending 9 months or even 12 months out    Our intention is to keep the whole process of the extension as low-key as   possible, and our hope is that the announcement will be taken in stride by the markets as   something reassuring and as a reminder that this backstop is in place  During periods of   intensified market stress, we’ve come out with announcements coordinated with other relevant   central banks using joint language, such as, “we, the central banks, announce today,” etc, etc, in   an effort to shift market conditions and increase confidence  In this instance, at least from my   perspective, conditions in dollar funding markets are less roiled than I would have expected,   given the stresses that we’re seeing in the sovereign debt markets  So we’re going to try to   remind the markets that these swap lines will still be there, and we’re going to keep the   announcement as low-key as possible; our hope is that this would be very reassuring and very   soothing to the markets and to market confidence    Exactly  That’s why we’re bringing it to the Committee today rather than   at the January meeting  We were concerned that, if we waited until the January meeting, then, as   the deadline grew closer, the markets would start to worry about whether the swap line was   going to be there or not  We wanted this to get resolved well in advance of any such concerns    It could go either way  On the one hand, you could say, well, it would   give the markets confidence that these swap lines are going to be there for an extended period of   time to provide support  On the other hand, the markets could interpret it as a sign that the   central banks are very worried about dollar funding conditions  So I think that’s more a policy   judgment    We’ve done extensions of varying lengths  Six months wouldn’t be   unusual  So the markets wouldn’t respond to that and say, “Oh, they’re doing something they’ve   never done before”  If we go nine months, that wouldn’t seem unusual either  If we did a full   year, it would be the longest we ever extended or put them in place    Six months is a typical approach    Yes    I’m not sure   December 14, 2010 17 of 127              I wouldn’t    Developments in peripheral Europe have been a source of much   anxiety over the intermeeting period  Through the first weeks of November, markets   were roiled by concerns about mounting losses and large-scale deposit flight in   Ireland’s banking sector  Left with few alternatives, the Irish authorities agreed to an   external assistance package, which included €45 billion from the European Union and   €225 billion from the IMF  These resources should be sufficient for the Irish   government to meet its funding needs for the next couple of years and to backstop the   banking system  Nevertheless, even with this package in place, the sustainability of   the country’s debt remains in question  A continued commitment to disciplined fiscal   policies and a further stabilization of conditions in the banking sector both seem   necessary to avoid a restructuring   December 14, 2010 23 of 127             After the announcement of the package for Ireland, a strong sentiment of “who’s   next?” pervaded the markets, with Portugal and Spain seen as the leading candidates    But spreads also rose noticeably for Italy and Belgium, both of which have elevated   debt-to-GDP ratios  Market tensions eventually calmed some after the ECB’s   announcement on December 2 that it would extend its special term-refinancing   operations through the first quarter of 2011 and following reports that the ECB had   stepped up its purchases of Irish and Portuguese debt            A key concern is the extent of the vulnerabilities in Portugal and Spain  Portugal   suffers from labor market rigidities and other structural problems that severely   constrain growth and consequently raise serious doubts about its medium-term fiscal   outlook  Reinforcing these concerns, the government’s implementation of its fiscal   consolidation program has been lagging  Moreover, market unease about the   Portuguese banks’ large exposure to the government’s debt has left the banks highly   reliant on ECB funding  Given these vulnerabilities, we believe that Portugal is likely   to require a bailout package  By our reckoning, around €60 billion would be needed   to cover most of the government’s cash flow needs for several years and to provide   support to the banking system  Such a program should be conditioned on enhanced   fiscal discipline and, most important, on structural reforms to improve the country’s   growth prospects   We are somewhat more hopeful about Spain, but—given that its economy is   nearly twice the size of Greece’s, Ireland’s, and Portugal’s combined—the   consequences of full-blown turmoil there would be much more severe  Spain’s   deflating housing bubble has created balance sheet problems for the regional savings   banks (cajas)  But the country’s large internationally diversified banks are generally   still seen as healthy, and its fiscal situation is stronger than that of the other   peripherals  Indeed, in our baseline debt sustainability exercises, Spanish debt tops   out at a relatively modest 75 percent of GDP, which leaves some wiggle room for   either larger-than-expected losses in the banking sector or higher-than-anticipated   borrowing costs   We believe that it will be necessary for the European authorities to adopt crisis-  management policies along the following lines  First, building a firewall around   Spain should be a central objective  To extinguish any doubts about the adequacy of   resources available to support Spain, as well as Portugal, the European authorities   need to earmark another €200 to €300 billion, in addition to the roughly €375 billion   of available EU and IMF resources  Second, a rigorous stress test and a capital   backstop to fill balance sheet holes are necessary to address lingering worries about   the European banks  The challenges here are significant, however, as a credible stress   test will need to consider severe and potentially unsettling scenarios, including   write-downs on some sovereign exposures and further declines in real estate prices in   certain countries  Third, the ECB needs to continue with its accommodative policies   and bond purchase program  Finally, the peripheral countries should move forward   with their fiscal consolidation efforts and with structural reforms to strengthen   medium-term growth  Our forecast envisions—perhaps optimistically—that the   December 14, 2010 24 of 127             European authorities will manage to take these (or similar) actions and that such steps   will be sufficient to keep the crisis contained               Some observers have called for even more comprehensive crisis-management   strategies  One such approach would be an EU sovereign debt sustainability exercise   with required haircuts if a country’s debt were deemed unsustainable, perhaps   coupled with an EU guarantee of the country’s post-haircut debt stock  Such an   approach would address market concerns about sovereign sustainability, but could   create other problems  Judgments regarding debt sustainability are notoriously   difficult  Greece’s debt burden is clearly unsustainable, but such assessments for   Ireland and Portugal are much murkier  In addition, the prospect of imminent   haircuts could kick off market runs and create uncertainties about the financial   viability of entities holding the debt, including European banks and potentially the   ECB   Spillovers from the recent stresses in peripheral Europe have been largely   contained to date  Core euro-area economies have continued to record solid   economic growth, and the deterioration in global financial markets that we saw in the   spring has generally not recurred  But a further weakening of conditions would pose   notable risks  While the direct claims of US banks on peripheral Europe seem   manageable, US banks have potentially sizable market risk exposures to the   peripherals  Moreover, the US financial system has significant claims on core   European borrowers and would be hurt if the crisis spread more broadly  Finally,   should Spain come under attack, the crisis might potentially snowball into a broader   run on sovereign debt that could affect Italy, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and   perhaps other countries as well  With this warm thought in mind, I would ask all of   you include in your letters to Santa a request for a quiet and crisis-free holiday   season   Turning now to the rest of the global economy, we have been struck by the firm   tone of the recent data  For example, activity in Germany, which accounts for 30   percent of euro-area GDP, has remained surprisingly resilient  Retail sales surged in   October; confidence and PMIs rose in November; and the weaker euro will help fuel   Germany’s export machine  Chinese trade—both exports and imports—jumped up   further in November, and every indication is that the Chinese economy is humming   on all cylinders  In response, the authorities there are now moving with increased   vigor to prevent overheating  In other emerging Asian economies, a marked rebound   in November PMI data suggests that activity in the region is strengthening along with   China  Consistent with these observations, the International Energy Agency recently   marked up its 2010 forecast for global oil consumption, while demand for   commodities more generally appears firm  And readings on foreign inflation have   surprised us on the upside, reflecting a recent acceleration of food and energy prices    Notably, however, core inflation abroad has remained more subdued   Of course, there are still a number of soft spots out there  But, taken together, the   recent data generally point to a moderately paced recovery abroad, in line with our   December 14, 2010 25 of 127             expectations  As such, our forecast for foreign activity is little changed from the   October Tealbook, with growth this quarter coming in at 2¾ percent and then   strengthening to 3½ percent by 2012  Indeed, a striking feature of our forecast is that   the modal outlook is still reasonably hopeful, even as the stresses in peripheral   Europe have markedly increased the tail risks         Finally, trade data for October, which we received last Friday, showed a notable   pickup in US exports, again pointing to solid foreign demand  Imports, however,   were softer than expected  For the fourth quarter as a whole, we see exports   expanding at a 10 percent pace, but imports are poised to contract sharply, reflecting   problems with the BEA’s seasonal adjustment for oil and some payback after two   quarters of extraordinary strength  We now see net exports adding 2½ percentage   points to GDP growth in the fourth quarter, about ¾ percentage point more than in the   Tealbook  Over the next two years, real exports should increase at an 8¼ percent   pace, supported by solid foreign demand  With the dollar up just slightly since the   last Tealbook, the lagged effects of the dollar’s previous declines should also provide   support  Import growth is projected to gradually rise, moving above 6½ percent by   2012, in line with the US recovery  All told, we see net exports making a small   positive contribution to US GDP growth over the next two years  Thank you, and   we’re now happy to take your questions    There are several channels  Let me just highlight two that I think are   important  One is that the Spanish banks have substantial exposure to Portugal  So if conditions   in Portugal were to deteriorate significantly, and credit quality were to decline correspondingly,   that would be a further hit on the Spanish banking system  And it really is the case that the   banking system in Spain is the point of vulnerability  There are two separate issues regarding the   Spanish bank vulnerability  The first is the cajas and their exposure to the falling real estate   December 14, 2010 26 of 127             market  How much more is that real estate market going to fall?  The second issue is just how   rock solid are BBVA and Santander, the two biggest banks that compose almost half of the   Spanish banking system by assets?  To date, their CDS premiums are somewhat elevated relative   to other institutions, but not significantly so  And if we start seeing signs of significant softness   in those two institutions, it would be grave   Second, I think there’s a sentiment channel and a demonstration effect, namely, that, if   Portugal comes under stress, that will cause people to be more risk averse and more worried   about what else is going on in peripheral Europe and could trigger a pullback  I think it’s very   likely that Portugal is going to need a program, and I think that’s why it’s imperative that the   Europeans move now to get the funds in place, so it’s clear that they can support Spain, if   necessary    If things got bad in Europe, I wouldn’t want to rule any possibilities off   the table, including the scenario that we looked at in June  I’d say the reason that the spillover   was somewhat less pronounced this round is simply because, to date, in this episode relative to   the spring, the financial market feedback effects have been less  Maybe there has been some   financial market adjustment or repositioning by US financial institutions  So far, at least, we   haven’t seen the same intense effects in the United States  One particularly notable difference is   that in the spring we saw very substantial declines in US equity prices, whereas US equity   December 14, 2010 27 of 127             prices over the intermeeting period are up a little bit  But that’s something that we’re obviously   watching very closely, and the situation could change very quickly to much more intense   spillovers and sympathy effects in US markets, similar to what we saw in the spring  "
9184,2011-03-15,"  The factors shaping our international forecast are of nearly  biblical proportions  We are grappling with the effects of droughts, floods, wars, and  earthquakes  As such, it is safe to say that the confidence bands around our  projections are even wider than usual   As you know only too well, oil prices have risen sharply since the last FOMC   Early in the intermeeting period, concerns in oil markets mounted as unrest in Egypt  intensified, eventually toppling the country’s long-standing regime, and as the unrest  spread to other countries in the region  World oil prices then spiked more than  $10 per barrel in mid-February, as violent civil conflict in Libya disrupted an  estimated 12 million barrels per day of oil production (about 1½ percent of global  output)  Although Saudi Arabia has reportedly increased its supply to make up some  of this shortfall—and oil prices have retreated some over the past couple of days in  response to the uncertain situation in Japan—WTI is still trading this morning only a  bit below $100 per barrel   By our reckoning, the increase in oil prices not only reflects the disruption in  Libyan production but also the possibility that civil strife in other countries, such as   March 15, 2011 18 of 165              Algeria, Yemen, and Oman, might reduce global oil supplies further, although  OPEC’s remaining spare capacity of roughly 4 million barrels per day could temper  the blow from such disruptions  In the unlikely event that unrest spreads to Saudi  Arabia itself, threatening its 10 percent share of global production, the rise in oil  prices would be almost unthinkable   Although soaring oil prices grabbed prominent headlines, many other commodity  prices continued to rise sharply in the weeks immediately following the January  FOMC meeting  These prices were pushed upward by the same combination of  rebounding global demand and commodity-specific supply constraints that had been  at work through the previous six months  However, since the mid-February spike in  oil prices, which poses a notable headwind for global economic growth, our index of  nonfuel commodity prices has stopped rising, with a number of key commodities— including  copper, nickel, soybeans, and wheat—posting declines   Of course, the key question is where do commodity prices go from here?  According  to the futures markets, which shape our forecast, commodity prices are likely to  flatten out over the next couple of years  But in the spirit of full candor, that’s what  we said at your January meeting and, admittedly, at many meetings before that   While we no doubt will be wrong again, let me suggest that the flat futures path, in  this instance at least, provides a useful benchmark  Food prices have been driven  upward by various droughts, floods, and other weather anomalies over the past year   These effects were exacerbated by the decision of several countries to build  precautionary food reserves or restrain exports  Assuming weather patterns  normalize, supply conditions should improve over time  Indeed, some food  commodities now have downward-sloping futures curves  Metals prices have been  driven upward by relentless growth in Chinese consumption, which now accounts for  over 40 percent of global metals use, up from about 15 percent a decade ago  Given  recent evidence that Chinese growth is coming off the boil, and with global  investment in the mining sector now on the rise, there is good reason to expect a  moderation in metals prices over the medium term  As for the oil markets,  geopolitical uncertainties are casting a long shadow, but we see plausible scenarios in  which these tensions abate without further disruptions to global oil production  In  addition, OPEC’s sizable excess capacity should continue to provide some near-term  buffer against sustained price spikes  Over the longer term, the high level of oil  prices should eventually elicit new supply, reduce industrial and household demand,  and lead to changes in technology that facilitate further economizing    Stoked by the rise in commodity prices, headline consumer price inflation abroad  has surged to nearly a 5 percent pace, with the advanced economies and the EMEs  both posting sizable increases  Here at home, the increases in foreign inflation,  coupled with higher commodity prices and the recent depreciation of the dollar, have  worked together to drive up US core import price inflation to an estimated  7½ percent rate in the current quarter  Going forward, we see both foreign inflation  and increases in US core import prices slowing later this year, in line with the  projected flattening of commodity prices   March 15, 2011 19 of 165              Even so, several foreign central banks have recently expressed heightened  concerns about inflation risks  For example, President Trichet, at his latest press  conference, surprised us by signaling that the ECB is likely to hike rates soon  And  recent vote tallies from the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee suggest  that a hike may be imminent there as well  In addition, a number of emerging market  economies, including China and Brazil, tightened monetary policy over the  intermeeting period  We anticipate that many EMEs will remain on a tightening  trajectory, as they seek to tame the risk of overheating  All told, we now see foreign  central banks removing monetary accommodation at a somewhat faster clip than we  had expected in January   Recent readings on foreign economic activity have come in above our  expectations  Industrial production and PMIs in the advanced economies have been  upbeat  Monthly indicators for the EMEs have generally also surprised on the upside   Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan represent a devastating human tragedy,  which could get significantly worse if the affected nuclear facilities are not stabilized   In response, the Bank of Japan has moved to reassure markets by providing  substantial liquidity and doubling the size of its asset purchase program, but the  Nikkei has nevertheless plunged more than 15 percent over the past two days  The  overall effects of the 1995 Kobe quake on output were limited, but the eventual scale  of this episode is impossible to judge and its ultimate impact on the overall trajectory  of Japanese economic activity—and global activity—remains highly uncertain   Our Tealbook forecast saw foreign GDP growth of roughly 3½ percent in the  current quarter, a little stronger than in our last forecast  Going forward (and  assuming that disruptions to Japan’s economy are not long-lived), we see foreign  activity continuing to expand at about a 3½ percent pace, with growth in the EMEs  hovering around 5 percent and the advanced economies expanding at about a  2¼ percent pace  These projections have been marked down a bit from January,  reflecting our judgment that higher oil prices and tighter monetary policies abroad  will create some modest additional headwinds for the global recovery   Over the weekend, European leaders surprised the markets by announcing  reforms to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), including increasing its  effective lending capacity to a full €440 billion, allowing the EFSF to purchase bonds  in the primary market (in the context of an adjustment program), and lowering the  charges on borrowers  The leaders also announced a framework to tighten  surveillance of fiscal performance, competitiveness, and labor market conditions in  member countries  In response to the announcement, debt spreads for European  peripheral countries fell roughly 20 basis points   While falling short of a “Grand Bargain,” these announcements strike us as a  meaningful step forward  In particular, the expansion of the EFSF’s lending capacity  goes a good way toward putting a credible backstop behind Spain and Portugal,  which we see as a critical requirement for stability in the region  The next key  milestone in the process of rebuilding market confidence will come with the release   March 15, 2011 20 of 165              of bank stress test results in June  Suffice it to say that we will continue to monitor  these developments closely   Our outlook for the foreign economies, along with our projection of a moderately  depreciating dollar, should fuel real export growth of more than 9 percent in 2011 and  2012  Folding in the January trade data that we received after the Tealbook closed,  we expect real imports to bounce back this quarter, expanding more than 11 percent,  but then to move down to a pace of around 5 percent through the forecast period  Net  exports, after subtracting ½ percentage point from US GDP growth last year on  average, are expected to make a small positive contribution of about ¼ percentage  point this year and next  Notably, we see the current account deficit narrowing to  2¾ percent of GDP by the end of 2012  With the higher path of oil prices, the oil  import bill will widen some, but the solid pace of export growth should push the non- oil trade balance to essentially zero by the end of next year  Thank you, and we’re  happy to take your questions    Given the rapidly moving events, any answers to those questions are still   highly speculative  If they’re able to quickly get a handle on this situation, and it is similar to   what we saw with Kobe, then I would say those kinds of effects would be minimal  But if the   situation continues to escalate—for what it’s worth, that seems to be the message we are getting   from the Nikkei  Following the Kobe quake, the response was very similar to what we saw   yesterday in equity markets  But then there was a modest bounceback, rather than the 10 percent   plunge  So it seems to me that there is a lot of concern  If anything now, the risks are tilted to   the downside  Substantial disruptions there would require substantial rebuilding, and as you   suggest, would probably put some downward pressure on commodity prices in the very near   term when they weren’t being imported there  But over the medium to long run, as they were   rebuilding, it could be a substantial upward impetus    Our reading of the output gap in the euro area is somewhere between   3 and 3½ percent of GDP  Certainly, our feeling is that that would be a factor weighing on   underlying inflation in Europe  The spike that they are seeing is very much driven by various   kinds of energy prices  Underlying inflation, core inflation there, is running about 1¼ percent    Absolutely  That figure that I cited was for our estimate of the euro area   as a whole  Now, the ECB may have a more narrow assessment of how much slack there is, but   German unemployment is down relative to before the crisis by 2½ percentage points, while   Spanish unemployment is up 10 or 12 percentage points  So there is a dramatic difference   between the peripherals and particularly Germany    Which bit?    We also see a fair amount of slack in the United Kingdom  Our view is   that it’s been special factors that have driven up UK inflation—depreciation of the pound, taxes,   March 15, 2011 25 of 165              energy price increases, and so forth—but we have been telling that story now for quite some   time, and the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England has been telling that story for   quite some time  I think all of us are getting a little bit uncomfortable as to whether there may   not be something more there with the inflation story as headline inflation reaches the 4 percent   range  My reading of the breakevens for the United Kingdom is that I do see a gentle upward   climb in those breakevens, and I think there maybe has been a little bit of increase in inflation   expectations  They have a very complicated monetary policy conundrum there  I think it’s   striking that at their last meeting they got dissents on both sides  They had two folks who were   dissenting for tighter policy, and one who was dissenting for easier policy  They are in a very   difficult situation    I’m not sure we have a state counterpart to Spain, for instance, but there   is a fair amount of variability in Europe, and there is a fair amount of variability across the US   states    Yes, sure, if you go down there, but then the counties would be a smaller,   more concentrated geographical area than one of these countries, with the possible exception of   Luxembourg    That’s a broad question  Obviously it’s one that we’re struggling   mightily with  Looking at the path of oil prices and other commodity prices over the past   March 15, 2011 27 of 165              decade, it does seem like there’s a trend there, and I think we could go back over the various   Greenbooks and Tealbooks over the last 10 years, and essentially each time the staff has said,   “It’s going to flatten out”  One point here is that we have looked far and wide for other   frameworks that would dominate the futures markets, and we haven’t found anything better  We   present the futures markets in our forecast as a useful intellectual benchmark  I would say that if   the Committee’s view is that prices and the risk to oil are skewed upward relative to what we’re   writing down, the Committee is free to incorporate that into its deliberations, but we are just   trying to provide an intellectual benchmark that’s defensible and coherent for oil prices  That   said, we’re continuing to look, and over the next six or eight weeks we are going to look even   harder than we ever have before, into other ways and other approaches that we might use to   forecast oil prices and other commodity prices  In particular, it strikes me as if there might be   something about China’s share in the global economy that might be useful to us in doing these   forecasts  As you say, it’s a dilemma; it’s a challenge  Obviously, as asset-like entities,   commodity prices are very, very hard to forecast, and consistent with that, the essential random-  walk nature of the futures forecast is more or less what you would expect for that kind of a thing    Right    As I noted, we have looked at a variety of other approaches and assessed   their forecasting power and also their biasness or lack of biasness in forecasts, and we have not   found anything that dominates the futures curves  The way we’ve characterized the futures   curves, and I think it’s the correct characterization, is that they are not very good, but they’re at   least as good as everything else that we’ve looked at so far, but we’re going to continue to look    It’s also true that if you look at the disaggregated futures curves, as you’ve indicated, you get   heterogeneous stories for heterogeneous commodities  For instance, as I mentioned, right now   many of the food commodities, given these weather shocks, are expecting declines going   forward, and that seems to be a perfectly plausible, perfectly reasonable expectation  It’s the best   we’ve got  There are underlying stories that are useful in helping us think through what is going   on in these markets  We’ll keep looking    In some sense, that is the random-walk nature, that these whole paths are   typically moving around just for the spot price The question is how much in addition to a   random walk we are getting from the futures curve  It is just a little bit    Yes, that’s right, how much additional predictive power do we get in the   futures curve relative to the random walk  And the answer is, it’s a pretty darn close call  I think   that is consistent with your point that it is the movement of the up and down of these curves, but   that that movement is generally being determined by what’s going on in the spot market    Right  The question is, can we find a better benchmark to condition the   forecast on  I think that’s the question, which may or may not have better RSME kinds of   properties or better biasness or unbiasness properties  But are we conditioning the forecast on   the right set of assumptions?  My guess is that I’m going to come back at the next meeting and   say, “Look  Here’s the futures curve  This is what we’re conditioning on”  We want to keep   looking, but I’m not naïve about it either  I agree with what you’re saying   March 15, 2011 30 of 165               You’re pressing me here  My expertise in meteorology is limited    Right  There are numerous anecdotes  In addition, we are being affected   by “La Nina” kinds of developments, which have been extraordinary and unusual, and it is   reasonable to expect that they are going to normalize in coming years  We have been in touch   with the USDA and others so that what we’re saying is consistent with what other agencies are   saying, what other analysts are saying, and the broad view of the markets  "
9209,2011-04-26,"3  Even as recent readings on economic activity in the United  States have surprised on the downside, data for the foreign economies have come in  somewhat above our expectations  With the notable exception of Japan, industrial  production and PMIs in the advanced economies have generally remained upbeat   And monthly indicators for the EMEs have also shown strength  We now estimate  that foreign GDP rose at a 4 percent pace in the first quarter, nearly ½ percentage  point more than in our last forecast  Looking ahead, we see foreign growth in the  current quarter dipping to 2¾ percent, down more than ½ percentage point from  March, mainly reflecting the effects of the Japanese earthquake  Thereafter, growth  abroad should recover to a 3½ percent pace, as the rebuilding process in Japan  commences, supply chains normalize, and strong growth in the emerging market  economies continues   Given the favorable expected performance of foreign activity, coupled with  continued projected depreciation of the dollar (mainly against the emerging market  currencies), we see net exports making a positive contribution to US GDP growth of  roughly ¼ to ½ percentage point on average over the forecast horizon  Notably, our  forecast implies that the trade balance excluding oil imports will turn positive in 2012  for the first time in two decades, marking an important milestone for US external  adjustment                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Sheets are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   April 26–27, 2011 95 of 244              In addition to the tragic human dimensions of the Japanese earthquake and  tsunami, the disaster also damaged physical capital amounting to roughly 3 to  5 percent of GDP, including 10 to 15 percent of the country’s electricity generation  capacity  While most large Japanese factories have resumed production, they are  generally operating at levels well below normal  In addition, production of certain  specialized components, especially those needed for some high-tech and automotive  products, remains offline  This shortfall in specialized parts has disrupted production  chains not only in Japan, but also around the world, including—as David has noted— in the United States  And it is unclear whether the power grid will be able to meet  peak electricity demands this summer, making a resumption of rolling blackouts a  further risk for production  All told, we expect Japanese GDP to decline at an annual  rate of 3½ percent in the current quarter, down 5 percentage points from the March  Tealbook  Going forward, rebuilding efforts should eventually spur economic  activity, leaving the level of GDP by the end of next year only slightly lower than in  our last forecast  But suffice it to say that the risks—including the ongoing problems  at the Fukushima power plant—are both substantial and skewed to the downside   In the euro area, the authorities continue to make uneven progress in their efforts  to resolve the region’s fiscal and financial stresses  In the days before your March  meeting, European leaders agreed in principle to increase the lending capacity of the  European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to a full €440 billion, a crucial step  toward putting a sufficient backstop behind Spain  However, these negotiations have  subsequently stumbled, and implementation may not be achieved until well into the  second half of this year   As a more encouraging development, the IMF on April 1 activated its expanded  New Arrangements to Borrow, which increases the fund’s available lending capacity  from roughly €130 billion to €300 billion  Not all of these resources can—or  should—be used to fight crises in Europe, but the fund now has additional resources  to finance programs for the peripheral countries should the need arise   Also in early April, the Portuguese authorities—faced with sizable debt  repayments over the next few months and soaring financing costs—requested an  EU-IMF assistance package, which will likely be sized at somewhere around  €60 billion to €100 billion  Assuming that this program is successfully concluded, we  see this move as an important step forward, as it reduces the risk of a full-blown crisis  in Portugal, which could in turn create contagion for Spain and the other peripherals   Over the past couple of weeks, the possibility of Greek debt restructuring was  highlighted by public statements from German officials, including the Finance  Minister  ECB officials sharply countered, arguing that a restructuring would have  devastating consequences for both Greece and other countries in Europe  Our  analysis has shown for some time that Greece’s debt burden is unsustainable, but we  do see a case for delaying the restructuring for a while longer in order to put in place  a more compelling firewall around Spain and to provide scope for other countries to  decouple from Greece  In any event, as Brian Sack has noted, debt spreads for  Greece and Portugal spiked upward during the intermeeting period, while those for   April 26–27, 2011 96 of 244              Italy and Spain were little changed  This apparent decoupling is an encouraging sign,  but there is still much work for the European authorities to do  Two key steps are,  first, as I noted earlier, the expansion of the EFSF and, second, the successful  completion of bank stress tests in June   The paths of oil and non-fuel commodity prices in the April Tealbook are on  balance little changed from those in March, as prices declined sharply in the  aftermath of the Japanese earthquake but subsequently rebounded  However, just as I  was getting ready to take a victory lap to celebrate the accuracy of our forecast, the  price of oil moved up appreciably late last week  With this further upward lurch, the  spot price of WTI is now nearly $7 per barrel higher than in the March Tealbook   This increase has largely reflected the continued disruption of Libyan production   Contrary to earlier reports, recent evidence suggests that Saudi Arabia has not  increased production to offset this shortfall  Indeed, last week the Saudi oil minister  stated that the Kingdom’s production was down 800,000 barrels per day in March   The rising trajectory of commodity prices has pushed inflation higher in countries  around the world, prompting monetary policy tightening by many central banks   Notably, despite the ongoing turmoil in the periphery, the ECB in early April nudged  its policy rate ¼ percentage point higher, in response to headline inflation well above  its 2 percent ceiling and solid performance among the core countries (particularly  Germany)  The Bank of England has not yet moved, but with headline inflation  hovering at 4 percent and signs that inflation expectations may be drifting upward, we  expect a hike there as well over the next few months  In addition, many EME central  banks have continued to tighten monetary policy in response to concerns of  overheating  These moves have been coupled in some cases with moderate currency  appreciations, and in Brazil, Indonesia, and Korea with additional capital control  measures, as capital flows into the EMEs appear to have picked up again in recent  weeks after showing softness through much of this year   As promised, the International Finance division has launched an intensified  research program examining the behavior of commodity prices  Although this is very  much work in progress, I would like to provide you with an early look at what we are  finding  To date, we have confirmed the broadly held view that, relative to a random  walk, the forecasting properties of the futures curves are typically limited, at best   However, we have also found that during times when the futures curves exhibit  considerable slope (such as when the economy is emerging from a recession), futures  prices have often contained meaningful predictive information   Perhaps more importantly, we are also getting a better handle on how movements  in underlying fundamentals—and, in particular, how surprises in those  fundamentals—influence the evolution of commodity prices  The exhibit that I have  distributed to you focuses on this issue  The top two panels of the exhibit document  what you already know well  Futures markets were surprised again and again by  higher commodity prices over the period of 2003 to 2008  In each of those years, the  futures curves for both oil (on the left) and copper (on the right) suggested flat or  declining prices going forward, even as spot prices continued to march upward   April 26–27, 2011 97 of 244              But my colleagues David Bowman and Joseph Gruber have observed that these  upward surprises in commodity prices came in step with corresponding upward  surprises regarding the strength of emerging Asian economic growth  As shown in  the bottom panels, consensus forecasts of the long-term growth rates of industrial  production in China and in the rest of emerging Asia also were consistently revised  upward over this period  As we have noted previously, these emerging Asian  economies accounted for much of the increased consumption of oil and other  commodities over the past decade  In addition, on the supply side, forecasts of world  oil production and copper extraction have tended to surprise analysts on the  downside, falling short of projections over the past decade  This work underscores  the role of fundamentals in explaining commodity prices, but it also finds that  movements in commodity prices are driven by surprises in growth, more than by the  pace of growth per se  This suggests that it may be fruitful to adjust the futures  curves to account for differences between staff forecasts of global growth, exchange  rates, and other relevant variables and the private forecasts that implicitly underpin  these curves  We have not yet fully tested whether this approach would in fact  produce commodity price forecasts that have improved forecasting properties, but it  would at least yield projections that were directly conditioned on the staff’s outlook   We plan to have more to say about these issues by the time of the June FOMC  meeting  Fabio will now continue our presentation    I think it’s a variety of factors  The difference in mandate and   perspective may be a bit of it  But the real challenge for the ECB is the heterogeneity of   performance and what the ECB Governing Council is trying to do is trying to balance this   The   German economy is just absolutely performing at an extraordinary pace  Unemployment there in   February actually fell to 63 percent, so they are getting to a point where unemployment is almost   3 percentage points lower than when the crisis started  And Germany is 30 percent of the   euro-area economy  So you have the vast majority of that economy performing at a pretty solid   pace and where slack is more limited  And then you’ve got a fraction of the economy that is   struggling in extraordinary ways  But, you know, putting that into perspective, Portugal, Ireland,   April 26–27, 2011 100 of 244              and Greece together amount to roughly 6 to 7 percent of GDP in the euro area  So it is very   small; it’s just a small fraction of Germany   We have looked at this by a variety of metrics, and it seems like where they are is   reasonable based at least on one benchmark Taylor rule  So I think that the differences really   equate to differences in economic conditions between the United States and the euro area  But   then I think, as a secondary factor, there are some differences in perspective and mandate that   also are having an effect    Okay  Well, to answer your second question first, our ability to measure   global slack is very, very limited  We do our best; we have some benchmark estimates, but there   are huge confidence bands around our estimates  But our sense is that right now activity for the   emerging market economies is pretty well close to what our best guess of potential is  And for   what it is worth, we have sort of massaged some of the IMF estimates  That said, our estimate of   slack and what the IMF is seeing are not that different  For the major emerging market   economies, output is approaching potential  Then, as I described, the situation in Europe is that   the vast majority of that economy is performing pretty well, but then you’ve got this   extraordinarily soft spot where, frankly, I don’t even know how to begin to think about what the   output gap is—in Spain, for instance, where you’ve got a 20 percent unemployment rate, or in   Ireland  I do believe that there’s a fair amount of slack in the United Kingdom, but, on the other   April 26–27, 2011 101 of 244              hand, you’ve got offsets there with inertia in the inflation process that I don’t fully understand    And then, Canada seems to be performing very strongly   So my sense is that, for the global economy as a whole, there is still a little bit of slack   mainly in certain industrial countries, but the global economy is performing very well, and the   amount of slack is diminishing    Chinese inflation has been creeping upward  The latest reading was   5½ percent, 12-month change, which is higher than what they are comfortable with  The   Chinese authorities are moving their monetary policy, both interest rates and reserve   requirements, as well as a number of the quantitative tools that they have—maybe these days we   would call them macroprudential instruments; previously, we would have called them   interventions in the economy [laughter]—to try to rein in credit  And it seems like that they are   having some success  So our baseline forecast for China is one where the Chinese economy   slows to 8 or 8½ percent, and inflation comes down some, but, as you point out, I would say   there are both upside and downside risks around that forecast  It may be that the economy   doesn’t slow as much as we think it will, and then the authorities will really have to put on the   brakes  That could generate an outcome there of sharper slowing than what we expect   April 26–27, 2011 102 of 244              That said, the Chinese authorities have been faced with these kinds of problems a number   of times over the last decade, and each time have been successful in guiding the economy onto   the smooth-landing course, and that is our expectation again  If something different happened   there, then our outlook for the global economy would be quite a bit different  We really are   getting to a point where China is becoming another engine of global economic growth, and   without it we would have a softer global outlook than what I’ve discussed  "
