860,1990-08-21," Your answer on the defense spending is that the increment is less than a couple of Texas S&Ls, presumably?   I'd like to get some insight, Dave, into your view of consumer spending You mentioned that the second-quarter retail sales were a lot better than we initially had thought and that one reason was that when you start from a small enough base it looks a lot better when it comes up to--I guess it was minus 9 for the quarter and was marginally positive in July You mentioned in the projection that household real consumption will fall but not quite as much as the reduction in real income Why did you make that assumption and how do you feel about the impact of this event on consumer confidence and whether consumers view this as transitory or more permanent?   What are the chances that this, on top of the other shocks we've had to consumer confidence in residential real estate values and the like, really could cause consumers just to put their pocketbooks away for a while?   But do you think that evidence would be roughly consistent with what you forecast in the Greenbook or marginally more pessimistic or--?   I think it's pretty reasonable that people might not want to buy a car   My views on the nature of the economy, pre-oil shock, are pretty consistent with what everyone else has described I would consider it marginally gloomier than last time, but with no really clear evidence of a recession, and brighter than the gloom that pervaded after some of the statistics that were released a few months ago I guess we're still pinning our hopes on exports Looking back over six quarters, if you ignore the first quarter of 1989 drought distortions, we have had roughly six quarters of maybe 14 percent GNP growth That should be the equivalent of a couple of quarters of negative 1 percent recession with the rest of them in the mid 2 percent range and you would think that it should have produced slack We don't see a lot of evidence of slack in the economy but we do see some Capacity utilization has edged down some and it's only high in a couple or three industries, such as mining and primary metals Unemployment has increased and employment has fallen The real mystery is what happened to the 600 thousand to 1 million people who left the work force Clearly, if they were in the work force and if the latter had grown at the rates we saw in the 1980s, unemployment would be above 6 percent I think they are legitimately out of the work force because we don't see the pressure on wages And we see other evidence in the labor statistics, such as aggregate hours worked, that suggests there is not a lot of slack  So, overall, I think we've seen very little progress on inflation It is true that the June CPI number, which upset so many people, had the owner's equivalent rent in it suggesting that home costs were going up pretty rapidly at a time when other things suggested they were going down That was true in July as well, but it was not the only factor in July; there were other concerns in July You can't help but believe that nearer term the recent months of slow growth in money and credit should start to have an impact But I would say at this stage that I see no hard evidence of progress From these levels of GNP growth I'm also not that confident that if we saw a downturn we could do much to catch it in time, which is why I think we need to look ahead and think carefully about the future My initial view of the oil shock was that it was not such a massive event In terms of the increase in the price of oil it is perhaps 50 percent In the early 1970s, oil prices increased by four times and  -29-    8/21/90 -30-  in the late 1970s by two or three times This seemed a lot smaller, although the news media tends to equate it with those two [earlier] events And I think the 1970s conditions were far different Certainly, we're going to see higher CPI numbers As Governor Angell mentioned, these will be the highest we've seen essentially in the [last decade] and in fact the highest we've seen since the last time an oil shock happened One of the reasons we didn't see higher numbers in the 1980s was because we didn't have oil shocks in the 1980s It's still not a very pleasant prospect; and it comes on top of not very much progress before this in the CPI The staff estimates a moderate impact on inflation, perhaps 1-1/2 percentage point higher CPI numbers, and a transitory impact I guess that's consistent with the notion that there is some slack in the economy The economy is pretty weak and money and credit growth have been slow It's not too likely that this would feed into some generalized inflation  Yet the bond markets reacted quite negatively to this--and around the world, I might add The reaction was pretty similar in bond and stock markets in the major industrialized countries US long bond yields went up 50 to 60 basis points, and it's hard to reconcile a transitory impact on the CPI with 30-year investors in some crude sense saying 30-year inflation is one half point higher They are responding not so much perhaps to the projected median inflation rate as to the small probability that the high consequence outcome is letting inflation get out of hand I also believe some important part of the higher yields is a real risk premium associated with the uncertainty and the disruption in real economies Investing in 30-year bonds is simply riskier in a world when small countries can disrupt large economies at will That disruption risk had been there in the 1970s We went through the entire 1980s without one of these events; indeed, we went through the entire Iran-Iraq war without one of these events The cold war ended and now all of a sudden we have real instability, which I think people will offset with a real risk premium There are some arcane measures which document the volatility The implied volatility on bond options has gone through the roof There are technical factors in the bond market When you have this sort of uncertainty the hedges come undone; it's more expensive to be a 30-year investor Peter mentioned the problems with the auction And it's not clear to me that some of the other markets that didn't have the auction problems went up quite as much One way I try to conceptualize the oil shock impact is to assume that it hadn't happened but that instead we had a budget deal which involved a $10 a barrel tax on oil with half of the proceeds given as foreign aid to oil-producing countries It seems to me that the inflationary impact of that sort of budget deal in some crude sense should be roughly the same as what we've seen But I suspect the markets would have responded far differently And it seems to me that difference in response has a lot to do with the uncertainty and the potential for future disruptions of this type So, I wouldn't read--   I think the yield curve is going to be more steeply sloped for some time to come because of an uncertainty premium in it What bothers me most is the impact on the real economy This is a contractionary event People are poorer; they have less money to spend; their wealth is reduced Because the magnitude of the impact    8/21/90  is not that great in terms of the percentage increase in prices, the impact in the Greenbook is relatively small--less than 1 percent reduction in GNP And we don't have a lot of GNP to give up now; we come out projecting 5 for the fourth quarter, which is a pretty small margin of error I've already alluded to my major concern in this area, which is the fragility of consumer confidence I'm a little concerned that we may see the increase in the saving rate that Governor Angell talked about if we start a shooting war over there I'm also concerned that we haven't thought a lot about how this is likely to end We discussed it a little here The outcomes aren't that encouraging from the point of view of consumer confidence We could be lucky enough to have an efficient coup But when you think about the scenarios, it leads to a pretty sour mood This on top of an already fairly weak economy suggests to me that there's certainly a possibility that the contractionary consequences could be greater than projected in the Greenbook  I'm still a little concerned about the slow growth in money and credit We have had very low growth in the past four or five months, including last month, despite the absence of RTC activity I guess growth is picking up in the first couple of weeks of August, as we apparently have scared people back into money Money market mutual funds have gone up and we're apparently exporting currency again at a rapid pace Obviously, some of it could be demand; but there also is some fragmentary evidence on the supply side The lending officers survey continues to show tightness; and finance company lending went up pretty dramatically recently, which is consistent with the notion of some borrowers having to search for alternatives to bank credit I'd be particularly concerned about where the low investment grade borrowers are going The junk bond market is gone; the banks are not forthcoming You don't see the substitution effect in the commercial paper market; high-grade credit has gone down as well The other concern I would have is the fragility of the banking system If we have a sharp downturn, we could have some real problems there and the FDIC could have some real problems as well So, I see a fairly weak picture to begin with--with this shock making it weaker--and with the certain prospect of higher numbers on the CPI as inflation works itself through, the specter of a real possibility that the consumer could pull in his or her horns This presents us with a difficult dilemma for setting policy; people have extended their pity on our tough dilemma What concerns me is that I think it's likely to get more difficult before it gets easier As the numbers actually start to go into the CPI and as the impact on the consumer becomes clearer, the policy options down the road may be at least as difficult as the ones we face now "
861,1990-08-21," I would support the proposal, although I'm leaning more in the camp with Vice Chairman Corrigan and President Boehne Without this [Middle East situation] I think a case could be made for some easing, especially if money and credit growth had not picked up a little in August It still bothers me when we go through a period of months with low growth in money and credit because history suggests difficulty a bit down the road I would agree that in the current setting stability is important I do think, though, that there are some risks in waiting and that it's not likely to be a lot easier down the road What concerns me most is that we might find ourselves in a position where we're trying to play catch-up, requiring larger moves, which would make me uncomfortable because of the risk to stability I believe there's great merit in gradualism Also, looking down the road, I would suggest that at some stage it wouldn't be too bad an idea to get the market used to somewhat more movement in the fed funds rate instead of the assumption that it's chiseled in marble That's something we should think about as well But in the current climate I would support ""B"" asymmetric toward ease "
919,1990-10-02, Would there be a benefit in going to a range from our point estimate? Or would that just-- 
920,1990-10-02," Mike, I was interested in the general tenor of your presentation, which was ""We are projecting two consecutive negative quarters but we don't really believe it very much""   There are no hard data to support it   True, you talked about new orders, which looked fairly depressing Also, you could make the point, which you made, that the purchasing managers index would be rather consistent with your forecast, it seems to me As for consumer spending, August--the first post-oil-shock month--didn't look too great and some of the third quarter will be [what happened in] July But again, the auto sales really are holding up even in September Yet the forecast has been lowered for the fourth quarter by 1-1/2 percent and for the first quarter [of 1991] by a little over 1-1/2 percent based upon apparently no hard data supportive of it What did you see that fed into such dramatic changes, despite the fact that the hard data didn't really compel you to do it?   So, if we reduce the oil [price] forecast to where it was in the August Greenbook that would account for most of the--  -15-    10/2/90   Do you see hard evidence of the credit market constraint?   May I ask a related question on the [projection]? We have now gone through six quarters with GNP growth averaging a little over 1 percent And capacity utilization, it seems to me, hasn't come down that much We have talked about why unemployment hasn't gone up so much--because of the participation rates What's your view? Is this about what you'd expect a 2 percent drop in capacity utilization?   Could one explanation be something analogous to what happened in the labor market, in the sense that the labor force hasn't grown as rapidly as we expected? Perhaps the capital stock has not been growing, in fact   Thank you   I generally agree with the staff's forecast I think we're facing a stalled out economy that is likely to dip for a quarter or two into negative territory I'm a little less optimistic, as a number of people are, on the [prospects for a] consumer-led pickup in 1991 First, that assumes oil prices are going down as the major impetus; we'll see what happens there I also worry more about further erosion of consumer confidence, given the fragility of the banking system, new taxes both on the [state] and federal levels, continued real estate value problems, and also just the experience of a recession People haven't seen one in 8 years and many of them were not adults at that time I also would sign on to what most people have said about attitudes I would just make one additional point President Corrigan mentioned asset values falling I think we also have to take into account the fact that debt ratios of individuals and firms are relatively high And with the economy slowing, a lot of them are facing the prospect of servicing debt Before, there was an easy way out you could sell the house at a higher price or you could split up the firm and sell [parts of] it off I think it's not a cheery prospect facing those constraints and living with them; there is some sense that the good times are gone in a lot of markets  I'm also a little less optimistic on the export side, due primarily to concern about the growth of foreign economies It seems to me that when you see the stock index in Japan go from 39,000 to 22,000 that is not bullish Germany also has had a reduction of 30 percent in stock prices pretty recently I'm concerned about the oil impact in eastern Europe Obviously, Canada and the United Kingdom are not in great shape, but the dollar should help I would just perhaps be a little less optimistic overall on the pickup We also don't see the momentum to a downturn; we don't see a free fall I think Ed is exactly right the world has changed in some sense, and maybe we will not see the typical inventory cycles of the past Instead of seeing a momentum to the downturn, we have seen a ratcheting down, it seems to me We had a near-term growth path of 1 to 1-1/2 percent and it was disrupted by the oil price shock  I also agree with Mike Kelley on the budget deal I think it is contractionary While it is an embarrassing spectacle to see one of these made like sausages into law--and this one isn't law yet either--it does have some real taxes and some real cuts in it Mike Kelley mentioned the enforcement agreements What they have in this in effect are little decentralized Gramm-Rudman sequester constraints by categories of spending defense, domestic spending, and the like And if more is spent than the budget allows on those categories, in 15 days you go into a sequester And by the way, those detailed Gramm- Rudman constraints last for a couple of years and then go back to more macro constraints And on entitlements and revenue bills there is a constraint that they must be pay-as-you-go or there is sequestration So, I am encouraged by the discipline they have tried to build in; even the rough discipline of Gramm-Rudman, I think, has been  -34-    10/2/90  beneficial I wonder if we would have had even this without that By the way, I think the markets responded positively to the budget deal, although they were lucky to have a day in which oil prices came down! [Laughter]  On the inflation side, I agree that no real progress is apparent I continue to believe that the right approach is a stable monetary policy and I think we should see slack opening up I think that's essentially what we should do; about all we can do is to maintain a moderately restrictive stance I also continue to think that we're not in the 1970s scenario and that if we do [maintain that stance] there is little realistic danger that the oil price shock will get generalized into inflationary expectations, especially given the state of the economy  My real concern continues to be the credit markets It's not at all clear to me that we are maintaining a constant stance It seems to me that with the slower projected growth in economic activity and constant short rates, it's hard to avoid a conclusion that monetary conditions may have tightened The budget deal at the margin is more contractionary than we projected in the Greenbook And even though a couple of people have mentioned that the monetary aggregates are back on their growth paths, that's due almost exclusively to the growth in two components--currency and money market funds The core components of money continue to creep along and that has been going on for seven months From the beginning of 1990 through the third quarter, savings deposits have grown at 3/4 of a percent annually; small time deposits have grown at 3/4 percent; large time deposits have contracted by 8 percent; other checkable deposits have contracted by 1/2 of a percent; money market deposit accounts have grown at 4-1/4 percent, but that growth was mainly in February and March; and demand deposits have rebounded 2-1/2 percent So, the reason M2 and M3 are back on track is because of the rapid growth in currency--much of it for export, which I think is not much related to economic activity-- and money market funds Money market funds this year have grown at 12 and 22 percent for the two categories Again, I think the increase in money market funds is not responding to increased economic activity nor is it likely to engender greater growth It's responding to problems in the stock market At the margin it does increase credit, but it increases credit to a specific segment of the economy investment-grade institutions, and the Treasury and commercial paper markets Indeed, the SEC has a rule out, as you may know, to restrict investment of money funds in below A1/T1 paper Now, to be honest about it, it's really not fair to cut out a couple of categories But it does seem to me that when you look at the recent reaction of money market funds--and we can understand what's going on in currency and the consistency of all the other core money categories and the persistence of this very slow growth at well below our lower range-- that there is a concern that money is growing more slowly than we projected and endorsed  The final point I would make in this vein, which has been made by a number of other people, is something new in the condition of the banking system There have been well publicized concerns about the FDIC fund, which is projected to be $10 billion at the end of the year and then perhaps go into single digits Insurance fees on banks have increased from 8 basis points to 19-1/2 basis points in a little    10/2/90  over a year and the prospect is that they will go higher as will the capital ratio   It's 23 basis points in the budget deal, which brings in $4 billion over 5 years This is not what we talked about earlier in the summer; it's not [the limits on] loans to one borrower; it's not examiners' zeal It is a lot of big losses in a lot of institutions Commercial real estate problems are evident throughout the banking system Community banks, small regionals, large regionals and money center banks all have significant investments in commercial real estate I think we will have several more quarters of bad news while the accounting reality catches up with these institutions More generally, I think we're in for a protracted period of retrenchment in the banking industry both to deal with the asset quality problems to build capital, as Jerry mentioned, and also to figure out how to be profitable in the new world I think all this has translated into higher funding costs for banks, lower stock prices, and bank debt yields at junk bond levels And it seems to me inescapable that these sorts of pressures in the banking industry have shrunk or restricted credit Specifically, I would be concerned that they have limited credit to a very large portion of the economy, those small businesses and large businesses that are not investment grade I'm less concerned about the investment grade institutions; they have the public market to go to It's difficult to make a case that the rest of the economy has an easily accessible alternative source of funds I look at insurance companies; they're not doing so well One can see some of the impact on finance companies But if we do have this contraction in the banking industry, it certainly has to have tightened conditions for a major portion of the industry  So, I think we're currently facing a stalled out economy, which is projected to dip into negative territory What concerns me on top of that is the increasingly tight credit market conditions With the lags in the process, I think we do have a risk of turning a mild downturn into a fairly ugly situation I agree with Dick Syron that herein lies the potential for a cumulative deterioration I'm more concerned about this problem this time than last time--first because the economy has weakened; secondly, because the core components of money don't seem to be picking up; and finally, and most importantly, because the pressure on the banking industry seems to have tightened and the tourniquet has been turned an extra notch I would still believe in a stable policy I'm just concerned that what we are getting is one which is more constrained than what we projected, endorsed, and would like "
921,1990-10-02," Make it economic not political   I support the proposal I also agree that the best way to deal with this situation is to try to keep a stable policy I think that's what we should do and about all we can do And that's what this proposal seeks to do I also agree that it's useful to get the market attuned to a little more flexibility in the fed funds rate and to get market participants to think some about the difference between the monetary policy stance and a specific interest rate I also think the timing is right Given the lags in the process, if we wait much longer, we run the risk of this credit situation producing some real damage six months from now and turning a mild downturn into something that could be more severe The dollar is a concern Looking at the alternatives, the alternatives are perhaps not too kind to the dollar as well, if we were to have a more severe downturn and trouble in the banking system So, I don't see any easy way out for the dollar, given the situation we face In terms of the size of the move, the long-bond market has come down about 40 basis points and I think following that roughly in magnitude would be consistent with a stable policy of monetary restraint "
983,1990-11-13," As a factual basis In the recent refunding, how did the foreign demand hold up and also how did individual purchases hold up?   What percentage appearance did they put in would you say?   And the individuals?   I have a question also on the collateral issue If we had a major problem with a large banking institution, would that affect our collateral [against Federal Reserve notes]?   And barring that, we get through February before we bottom out again?   Thank you   But this is for money market mutual funds that don't want to mark to market and that want to be allowed to use that cost plus basis and keep the unit values The rule is no more than 5 percent A-2/P-2 paper and the maturity has been shortened to 90 days   Yes "
984,1990-11-13," Let me just pick up on this I know we started some of this this morning [Secretary's note The reference is to a briefing of the Board of Governors by its staff] We have a strange phenomenon because the auto experience is a good example of the producers having cut back even though the hard sales data are not down And it sounds as if most of the evidence is that the producers have decided, just as our staff has decided, that demand is going to be down so they started laying people off and started not producing My guess is the result will be that demand will be down   Well, presumably some of the people laid off will now decide not to be quite as aggressive as they might have been   Can we talk about the snapback as well, just to clarify that? The logic is oil prices went up and that shattered  -18-    11/13/90  consumer confidence And then when they come down consumer confidence will be reconstituted with about the same lag and there will be someone around to finance the increase, this snapback effect, in the second quarter of next year   In fact, it did seem like the budget experience was a second impact on consumer confidence   The markets have not been marking up the probability of war but certainly in the political rhetoric and in troop movements there is some suggestion that maybe the probability has gone up a bit What is the staff's--   What is your current scenario of what happens in the event of a war?   Yes, economically   But we haven't had many recessions during wars   Thank you   Well, I think we have a recessionary psychology in full bloom It has captured the staff and also most business people as well as consumers Even though the hard evidence is not in yet, everyone is behaving as if we're in a recession It interests me that in the lending officers survey the primary reason given for tightening credit standards is the condition of the overall economy Presumably, that was just after the third-quarter GNP number of 18 percent was released I think the evidence is fairly clear that the staff is pretty much right this time As Jerry Corrigan mentioned earlier, it is a curious recession It breaks a number of the rules-- not only the rule that we usually expect a precipitous spike in inflation and an inverted yield curve That may be sufficient for a recession but it apparently is not necessary Another rule we've broken, which has been mentioned a number of times, is that we see no inventory accumulation problem; maybe that's a thing of the past if  -34-    11/13/90  people take a different approach toward inventories and we now have the technology to back up that approach The other thing which may be curious about this recession is that we may go through it with an unemployment rate that is right around what we used to consider full employment In October the unemployment rate stayed constant despite the weakness in the report because the labor force dropped by about the same amount as jobs dropped I think we'll probably not break that rule, though, and that unemployment will drift up But it's pretty much a full employment recession, so far at least All those signs would suggest that the recession should be relatively mild because we don't have the imbalances in inventories and we haven't had the spike in interest rates It also suggests that maybe we can make some progress on inflation As the staff mentioned, we have a number of pieces of good news there I think it's instructive that commodity prices still show no real signs of taking off Most of the indices we follow are lower than they were last week, last month, and even last year once you take out the energy prices So, given the increasing slack in the economy, maybe we're making some progress there, although it probably would take quite a few months to convince us that we really have made any progress It's just better than going in the opposite direction  I tend to agree with the sentiment of a number of people that the real problem is in credit markets I'm concerned with how below investment grade companies get credit We've seen some widening of the spreads; default rates are up in corporate bonds and I think they're going to continue to rise, especially as the big bulk of junk bonds ages and gets to the age where default rates typically go up It is true, as Tom Melzer mentioned, that we can see people going to alternative paths when bank credit is not available Commercial paper issuance has gone up and finance company lending has increased markedly That I think is hard evidence of tightness in bank lending I wonder, though, whether those channels are sufficient to meet all comers Generally, we see a lot of evidence of below investment grade, medium grade firms, having difficulties I think it was Peter who mentioned that the spreads between high-yield bond indices and Treasuries are now 1200 basis points, which is up from about 400 basis points Still, I think the greatest reason for concern is financial institutions I see weakness across the board, not only in the banking system  Another thing Peter mentioned is what's going to happen at the end of the year We continue to hear stories that institutional investors are going to go to great lengths not to show banking securities on their year-end statements, which could give us some interesting times We've talked a lot about the banking system, but if you look beyond the banking system you see developing problems in virtually all other types of financial institutions The ""good thrifts,"" if that's not an oxymoron, have exhibited deteriorating profitability in the third quarter Insurance companies are suffering from asset quality problems It may be that Equitable has closed on Peachtree Center, but people are closing in on Equitable as well Securities firms are also not in great shape and are under quite a bit of pressure There's excess capacity; there's simply no business out there in mergers and acquisitions or in underwriting They have some trouble with asset quality with some bridge loans and the like Maybe some of those things are getting taken care of, but we hear even the best investment banks complain about skittishness in the suppliers of  -35-    11/13/90  capital to them; we've heard a lot of that from some of the best ones The health of the finance companies who are called upon to increase their lending is also being called into question And even the government sponsored enterprises [are having problems] Freddie Mac, as you might have noticed, has had some difficulties with multifamily housing; Fannie Mae has tightened standards; and Sallie Mae also has had some difficulty So, when you look across a broad range of financial institutions you see weakness; and you see a system which is not in good shape to provide credit to people who need it and who are worthy of it These sorts of trends are clearly understood by the capital markets The long rate has come down substantially, reflecting the slowdown, perhaps 50 basis points or so And quality spreads for these financial institutions have widened, giving evidence to the problems there In terms of the monetary aggregates I see seven months where M2 has grown a little less than 3 percent So, I tend to believe that monetary policy has remained reasonably tight over the full [1990] period Going from the fourth quarter of 1989 it's still above 4 percent; but M2 growth was 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989 and 6-1/2 percent in the first quarter of 1990 When you average together the last six or seven months--maybe that's still not long enough--even if you take all the components of M2 together, that aggregate has not been growing very rapidly So, when I look at it, I agree with the projection of a mild downturn; I also agree that there's a great risk that the downturn could become much more severe and longer in duration, given the weakness of the financial system I also think there's a credible case that some lowering of short rates would improve the financial health of these institutions and perhaps at the margin also loosen up some credit and produce a growth rate in the aggregates that would at least creep back into the lower range of our accepted policy "
985,1990-11-13, I support it; I think it's fully consistent with the reduction in long rates that we've seen   How about 1/2?   Don't you think people will read that as M2  targeting?  SPEAKER(?) As a change 
1042,1990-12-18," I was most impressed with Lee Hoskins' report that in the middle of this environment they're building auto plants in Lexington, Kentucky, which shows you the resiliency of the American people You didn't mention Was it Toyota or Nissan? [Laughter]   Toyota My view is generally in agreement with the staff's forecast Producers seem to have cut back almost in advance of the cut in consumer spending, keeping inventories lean And I think that puts the economy in pretty good shape for a rebound in the spring It may be a bumpy landing rather than a soft landing I'm not quite so sure that consumer confidence, Humpty Dumpty, can be reassembled as quickly as it is in the Greenbook The pessimism is still rampant; I think Martha's correct on that I got a call from a former student who is a partner in They just had a meeting of their national partners and the overwhelming view there was that we had entered a deep and long recession That doesn't seem to be entirely consistent with the somewhat better than expected retail sales data and orders data, so there's still this gap Perhaps it has just been a long time since people have seen a nationwide recession, so they don't remember what it feels like and it's pretty scary and they don't know how to get through it Still, I think there is the potential for this rebound The stock market thinks there is; it doesn't appear to be quite so pessimistic as the public Indeed, if we have a resolution in the Gulf, if the bad news on financial institutions becomes old news, and if the banks start to go for the profit, I also believe there's a potential for consumer purchases that have been deferred The autos that people are driving are reaching very old ages in terms of the average for autos People still aren't going to buy in the current environment, but at some stage we might get a rebound I think the real estate problems are more troubling and long-lasting in terms of the wealth impact of that reduction [in value] I still speak from the perspective of a New England homeowner We also have several sources of stimulus in place moving in our favor The oil prices have started to come down and I hope they'll continue; the dollar is down; there is monetary ease--long interest rates, not just the short rates, have come down fairly substantially over the fall  Financial fragility continues to be a concern Publicity about it seems to be unending in virtually all areas Jerry mentioned insurance companies; I would just mention one industry that has yet to hit the news but conceivably could and that is the mutual fund industry If you look at junk bond mutual funds, high yield bond mutual funds, they've done an extraordinarily good job of managing through this collapse in the junk bond market However, over the past several months a number of them have allowed their redemptions to run their cash reserves to precariously low levels Given the illiquidity in the market, if one of them should have to suspend redemptions, very quickly I think all of them would be under pressure They're a tiny part of the market It's not significant from an overall point of view, but I think it would get publicity and perhaps have an impact on other mutual funds--bond funds, money market funds, and the like I wouldn't suggest that monetary policy can do anything about that, although it would be nice to have liquidity and a lot of credit availability in that case But I do think there is a potential for a  -24-    12/18/90  series of negative surprises in the finance area, which does not bode well for confidence  More generally, though, the concern is Who is going to finance this rebound? Where is the financing going to come from to fuel the rebound? If you look across the board, the non-RTC thrifts reported very large losses in the third quarter Most of that was in the group that is targeted for RTC action But even the good thrifts, it seems to me, about broke even Insurance companies are under pressure due to asset quality, and they also have a great need next year to refinance a large volume of maturing GICs, guaranteed investment contracts So they're going to be under some pressure; it's not clear they can expand lending Finance companies have been taking up a lot of the slack and growing at a rapid pace Business loans by finance companies started the year at about $250 billion and they're closing in on $300 billion That compares with $600 to $700 billion in business loans at commercial banks, so it's still not too large I wonder how long they can continue to grow and take up the slack at this pace Commercial paper also took up some of the slack Again, nonfinancial commercial paper is only about $150 billion, so presumably they can't take up all the slack But commercial paper issuance, after growing rapidly in August, September, and October, collapsed in November presumably due to credit quality concerns as marginal credits decided to take down their back up lines from Japanese banks, which probably accounts for some of the fed funds anomalies in that period  I think there's little evidence of a credit crunch for investment grade companies You only have to look to the bond issuance in November, which was up very dramatically; but none of that involved below investment grade issues One wonders who is going to finance the segment of the market that is below investment grade Banks have been the traditional source I thought that the bank credit supply conditions were likely to ease in January The logic was that a lot of these banks want to show a good risk-based capital number on that year-end statement, and that is done by investing in mortgage-backed securities and governments, not loans I thought that would tend to free up And there is the point that Jerry mentioned The fed funds rate has come down quite a bit without the prime changing At some stage those competitive juices have to start flowing, and I thought it would happen pretty rapidly in the first part of the year I'm a bit more pessimistic now for a number of reasons First, I'm pessimistic in the sense of thinking that this credit supply [situation], including bank credit conditions, is likely to extend into the new year There is a growing concern and publicity about the bank insurance fund Now, it's accepted that there will be some sort of recapitalization paid for by the industry I think there will be a period of uncertainty and banks may continue to hold back until they see how that issue is resolved in terms of how much they're going to have to pay and in what form they will have to pay I also think the FDIC will start to resolve some of these institutions that it may have delayed until the new year The Treasury report on banking reform when it comes out, probably in the first week of January, may well call for some fairly dramatic changes, which will result in a lot of debate in Congress That again might be the type of thing a banker would look at and say ""I think maybe I'll hold tight for a bit instead of moving out aggressively"" Obviously, we still can have some bad news in the fourth-quarter results on asset  -25-    12/18/90  writedowns at banks And even an issue like mark-to-market for banks is going to be debated, I think, in the early part of next year The proponents of mark-to-market will argue very loudly that banks are misrepresenting their assets and misleading investors And those sorts of arguments are not the type that are likely to lead to increased confidence in the banking system So, on balance, there may be some easing of the credit supply condition, but I don't think we're going to return to normalcy until a number of these issues--such as the bank insurance fund and having some of these problem institutions resolved and off the street--are resolved, probably later in the spring  We can't control a lot of those issues We can't take responsibility for junk bond funds But we should have responsibility for money I continue to be bothered by its anemic growth We did have blips in M2 in August and September but the overall pattern continues to be one of slow growth M2 growth was 32 percent in the second quarter of 1990, 31 percent in the third quarter of 1990, and I think we're projecting about 2 percent in the fourth quarter This is no monetary shock, but it is a squeeze I would say So, while the real economy seems to be feeling its way--however depressed people are--through this downturn in a manner which in my opinion has the potential to produce a rebound, I do think the slow growth in money and credit is not good news in this environment and does not augur well for achieving that rebound in the spring "
1043,1990-12-18," What interest rate elasticities do we assume for money demand, roughly speaking?   Yes   And empirically that works very well My impression was that the theoretical models had much lower elasticity   And in the past the model fit the data pretty well When did it stop fitting the data pretty well?   Okay   I support the recommendation I think we have allowed the fed funds rate to come down gradually this fall and more rapidly recently as market rates also have fallen more rapidly We've yet to see the full impact on M2 Still, M2 seems to be decelerating a bit And I think there's ample room to continue at least this marginal decline It is true that I've only seen Don's forecast errors on one side, but there's always the possibility that it will turn around   So, I support the recommendation "
1102,1991-03-26," I guess Ed was getting at what I wanted to ask which is not the number but What conceptual basis is there for determining an appropriate balance? Could we start with that and then think about what that means in terms of numbers?   It does seem to me that we're kind of at sea unless we can think a little more precisely about the conceptual basis  -10-    3/26/91   As an aside, how much have we lost over the past six weeks in value?   Not intervention What is the change in market value in the past six weeks?   Is it $5 billion or something like that, would you guess?   And we will report that? So, it's the same order of magnitude as 3 or 4 big S&Ls? "
1103,1991-03-26," Well, we are in an interesting period and I have a few observations on the issues The first question is inflation and our fears Are there fears that inflation is reigniting and is it reigniting? I think the economic logic is clear and supports the opposite case, given the increasing slack we have; I see no signs of trouble in the commodity prices or movement in the dollar Despite the recent revival of M2 growth, we're coming off a long period of slow growth; in seven out of the past ten months, M2 growth has been less than 3 percent The labor costs data, one of the toughest components of inflation, is behaving remarkably well And even the inflationary expectations in the surveys are down somewhat So, I think everyone should agree that we're making substantial progress on inflation The only thing that doesn't agree with that is measured inflation itself, which keeps chugging along apparently oblivious to the inescapable economic logic We've had a couple of pretty awful months and there are stories especially about the postal rates and the excise taxes and the like Many people would argue, especially for those special cases, that government-induced increases are not part of the inflationary process But the problem is that they are They respond in part to the increases in labor costs and they also feed into the inflationary process So, I think it's a little difficult to ignore  The markets may also be getting concerned about inflation Long bond rates are up about 35 basis points since the last meeting Our Board staff argues that that is an increase in real rates rather than an inflation premium, and they point to a broad array of market data consistent with that analysis, including the stock market data, the junk bond data, the dollar, and commodity prices And everything is suggesting increased probabilities of an imminent turnaround Even on March 19th, when the CPI number was released, the housing starts data were released the same day and the dollar went up, which is rather inconsistent with a lot of fears of inflation Some people believe another reason the long rate went up was not only because of the notion of a turnaround but also because the CPI numbers might keep us from easing Peter has already talked about the bond market's reaction to our 1/4 point ease a couple of Fridays ago, March 8th In those three stories I think there is a fair amount of confusion Some people said that maybe we had gone too far, but at least as many people seemed to say the fact that we cut the fed funds rate and didn't cut the discount rate signaled that this was the end of the easing When I talk to people on the street, there's still a fair amount of confusion over exactly what signal we're trying to send with the fed funds rate on top of the discount rate even though operationally it may work okay I think the most compelling thing that happened that day, though, was that the Michigan survey leaped with a 20 or 30 percentage point increase So, it's difficult to make much out of that, and I'm comforted by all the market data that say inflation is under control To me the most troubling aspect is to look back for seven years to the beginning of 1984 and see that core inflation has been stuck at between 4-1/2 and 5 percent, which makes one wonder whether a short and shallow recession can really do the  -36-    3/26/91  job The logic is pretty persuasive but one thing we're going to have to face, if we get a string of these, is that the bond market itself will stop buying the story and start looking at the numbers I'm sure we're all prepared for that  In terms of the real economy, again, everything looks great The war is over; oil prices are low; consumer confidence is back; money is growing; and all markets are signaling a rebound To turn this logic into reality, we need consumers willing to spend and bankers willing to lend I share some of the opinions expressed by others that while we're seeing confidence go up, there's a question of whether it will stick and an even greater question of what sort of lag there is between that confidence and the actual spending On the down side, when confidence collapsed in August, it was really a couple of months before spending collapsed I doubt if it will be much faster on this side of the hill Moreover, this is the first national recession we've had in eight years Many young working Americans have never had the experience of worrying about their job security and I wouldn't be surprised, as Governor Angell also indicated, if consumers much like banks and corporations don't step back and spend some time building some equity before returning to their old ways And it is true we have some drags on the process, including the unemployment situation I would also agree with Dick Syron about the state and local government situation; when you look across the country, by some measures 28 of 50 states have pretty severe problems That's likely to be an overhang In terms of hard data, one thing is clear Americans did not celebrate victory by buying a new car  In terms of the hard data, we are staring to get some uptick Clearly, the most encouraging area is housing Even the February data in housing, of course, could be the effect of global warming because we did have a warm February and that's the most highly correlated thing with housing starts and, I guess, existing home purchases I see one potential problem, though, with a housing-led recovery And that's this question of whether the banks will finance homebuilders, because I don't think there's anyone else around to do it Not many builders have access to the commercial paper market I don't see insurance companies or finance companies financing construction And, I submit, we'll find out whether we have a credit crunch or not-- whether it's on the demand side or a supply constraint With the commercial real estate disaster fresh in their minds and with many builders financially weak or bankrupt, capital-thin bankers are going to be asked to finance a new round of real estate development And, again, the logic looks pretty encouraging as well The banks are in much better shape now and we've seen them raising capital They haven't been lending so much yet; but if we expect homebuilding to play a major role, pretty soon we will be going through existing inventories and we will see whether they can get that financing  One important piece of evidence that many people have mentioned, which is consistent with a return to more normal conditions in the banking industry, is the growth of the monetary aggregates It looks as if we finally have the engine of money growth jump-started It may be idling at a rate that is a little high and we may need to adjust the choke a bit After ten months of slow growth, it's encouraging to see the pickup, but there is a question of whether it's going a little too well  -37-    3/26/91  There is another factor that weighs on the other side of the growth in the aggregates and that's the behavior of the dollar As mentioned, since the last meeting the dollar on a trade-weighted basis has essentially retraced all the ground that it lost during the war It stands about where it was the middle of last summer, though still down from its heights of last spring I view the increase in the dollar as something that should have a contractionary effect; it should weigh against inflationary pressures and should reduce the risks of an overly robust economic rebound In other countries people view a strong currency as equivalent to monetary tightening Indeed, Charlie Siegman mentioned that, in effect, it is equivalent to an increase in interest rates or that to offset it we would have to reduce rates So, my view of the increase in the dollar is that we have the opposite of the situation in August, September, and October when interest rates were steady and rising and the dollar was falling, which helped cushion the decline in the economy I think we are now in the opposite situation where the dollar can be viewed as a partial counterbalance to concerns about too rapid growth in the aggregates, a rekindling of inflation, and a rebound that is too buoyant The Greenbook assumes the dollar will fall back from its 11 or 12 percent appreciation to a 4 or 5 percent gain; I guess I'm not so sure When I look at the position of the US economy and political system coming out of this war and when I look at the troubles in Germany, eastern Europe, and Russia, with the rest of Europe wired together through the exchange rate mechanism, and the prospect of lower growth and lower interest rates in Japan, just the uncertainty in these areas versus the situation in the United States makes it not unlikely that the dollar will maintain its gains and might appreciate a bit more And I view that as a risk to the upturn and as insurance against inflation  So, in summary, I'm pretty much about where Governor Angell is On balance, I'm a bit more pessimistic than the Greenbook on the timing and strength of the rebound due to the strength of the dollar and the lag in the transformation of consumer confidence into consumer spending as well as a couple of other overhanging risks such as the financing of the housing side and the state and local government side I can't be too pessimistic since I've spent most of my career as a financial economist and I believe in markets And the staff has pointed out to me that every market indicator known to man, woman, or beast is flashing a clear signal of imminent economic rebound I didn't quite see those signals on the other side when the economy started down, but at least that should temper our pessimism "
1104,1991-03-26," An increase in the middle of a recession; [have you] looked at it?   This is the first you see?   It's like a yield curve predicts and rebuilds--   I support ""B"" symmetric, and I think we may well get Governor Angell's 5 percent nominal GNP as it is, although it's still not inconceivable to me that we may need a gong "
1150,1991-05-14," On the 30-year bond auction I noticed a messy tail and light coverage How much of that had to do with this botched bid problem?   But the tail wouldn't have been there?   We don't have an automated auction system!   How about the noncompetitive bids?   Okay, I thought there was some sense that they had ticked up a bit "
1151,1991-05-14," I'm hopeful that the economy is pretty much on track for bottoming out this summer or in the third quarter The evidence does suggest that it is contracting at a slower pace We see that in the industrial production numbers, employment data, the purchasing managers' report, and maybe even in the retail sales numbers There continue to be things that bother me Paralleling what Mike did, I have a list of moderating influences on the strength of the upturn; it started out with only the debt overhang and commercial real estate as the two factors I've added financial fragility--although maybe I can retire that one--higher unemployment, state and local government problems, the higher dollar, weaker foreign economies, and now some inventory concerns in some sectors So, the weight of these moderating influences is becoming a bit heavier  It also seems to me that the Greenbook story this time in May versus March is a little less satisfying; it may be more accurate  -18-    5/14/91  But it is unlike the old story, which had a starring role for the consumer to lead us out of the recession--propelled by increases in real income as oil prices dropped, a wealth effect out of the increase in stock prices, and a rebound in consumer confidence It has been four months since the market rebounded, four months since oil prices collapsed to pre-war levels, and two-and-a-half months since consumer confidence rebounded And now in the May Greenbook we're projecting consumer spending to grow not nearly so fast as we were projecting it in the March Greenbook Obviously, consumer spending grew a bit faster in the first quarter The saving rate remained low but personal income didn't grow Governor Angell asked what will take the economy a leg down; I guess I'm wondering what will take it a leg up I wonder if there's enough impetus in this new story to get us moving In the new recovery script, the consumer takes a less prominent role and we project these three factors to lead to the recovery homebuilding, inventory accumulation, and capital spending It seems to me that each one is promising and each one has some question marks  There's every reason to be optimistic that the housing rebound is real The issue remains that of translating housing sales into housing construction I think there's reason to be optimistic when one sees the volume of debt and equity issues by commercial banks bolstering their capital positions It is clear that banks are going to apply higher standards in lending to homebuilders, but maybe with improved capital conditions they will not extinguish the housing upturn I'd say there are still some questions, though, on the translation of the home sales into homebuilding  On inventory accumulation, I wonder how much we're going to get out of this Companies either have moved or are in the process of moving to a fundamentally different philosophy of inventory management; they now have improved information technology to implement a philosophy involving very tight management of inventories I think businesses will seek to maintain very lean inventories when the economy turns up There has to be some contribution from inventory accumulation when they stop cutting inventories, but even when there's a little wind in the sails from some other source, I wonder how much contribution we're going to see out of inventories  I feel about the same with respect to capital spending I see little in the orders data to suggest optimism or little from talking to the sour executives that Vice Chairman Corrigan talks with I think we're more likely to see capital spending in response to a recovery lag the recovery rather than lead it or be coincident with it It is encouraging to see the volume of stock and long-term debt issues by corporations Most of that, though, is going into shoring up balance sheets, which is a good thing; not much of it is getting through to capital spending Still, the availability of ample long- term funds on good terms should encourage some capital spending for the competitiveness reasons that Mike alluded to, or at least limit the decline in capital spending I tend to think we'll have to see a pickup in demand first before we see much [impetus from] capital spending  So, it does seem to me that the story is a little less convincing than last time I have a little less confidence in the upturn since we have no reliable lead actor to replace the consumer Again, it may be more accurate, but it's not quite as simple a story  -19-    5/14/91  And I think waiting around while the consumer flunked his screen test for this recovery may be one of the reasons why there is some increased gloominess, at least in the business community It may be just the executives of large companies that Governor Seger mentioned at lunch on whom the international situation--the higher dollar and weaker foreign economies--is having an impact I think there continues to be the worry that as we wait around for this [upturn] there will be some atrophy in consumer confidence as it retreats toward the real numbers rather than spending rising to meet confidence The discount rate move a couple of weeks ago was useful in injecting a little optimism into the picture and in demonstrating that the Federal Reserve is still in the game And I think precipitating the prime rate reduction was a help Still, when I look at the markets, I'm pretty reassured The markets still seem in pretty good shape, although they may be down a bit And they represent not only a forecast of recovery but a contributor to it--not only with the elusive wealth effect but also, as Jerry mentioned, we see them freeing up debt capacity, including short-term debt capacity That means companies will be in good shape to respond to increased demand, should that demand ever arise  We've also absorbed a fair amount of bad news in the market another round of bank insurance fund bad news and some insurance company bad news among those companies that specialize in high-yield bonds There continues to be some skittishness in the long-term bond market It made some progress and then drifted back some, although it is still off a bit, obviously, from the peak of over 9 percent in the fall I tend to think that if you invest in 30-year bonds, you need some real convincing on the inflation side The people who bought 30- year bonds in 1965 at 4 percent own them today or were fired and the new portfolio manager owns them So, it's not surprising that after seven years of core inflation at 4-1/2 percent it will take some time  I agree with the sentiments expressed that we have the potential for substantial progress in reducing core inflation and that we should be careful on that front There has been some deceleration in the monetary aggregates, which Don was talking about Some of that was warranted to bring them more in the middle of the ranges When I look at the interest-sensitive components of M2--money market deposit accounts and savings accounts--they are still growing at a very rapid clip and, if anything, at a too rapid clip Of course, time deposits have been dead in the water ever since I've been here The deceleration in Ml is accounted for by currency and demand deposits and there are plausible explanations--special factors associated with April I don't see at this stage a serious risk of M2 growth decelerating to an unacceptably slow rate, but in this environment we ought to keep that in mind just as we should the other side as well We still have a good bit of stimulus in the pipeline We see its effects in the buoyancy of markets and the rebound of residential housing And as the prime rate has been reduced, I think we may see it more broadly  Overall, I guess I'm a little more concerned than last time about the path of the real economy; I swallowed the March Greenbook whole and this one is a little less digestible However, the markets look pretty good and I think the policy looks pretty good, despite my queasiness This is probably a time for patience, but it's also a time for vigilance as well I think we should stand prepared to keep  -20-    5/14/91  things moving in the right direction if necessary The lengthening list of moderating influences--the reduced forecast of consumer spending, somewhat slower M2 growth--suggest to me less risk of an overshoot in the current environment And the current environment reminds me of a sailing analogy When you're sailing and you try to tack, which means to turn in a very light wind, what you do is push the tiller over to the other side of the boat and you shout as confidently as you can ""hard-a-lee,"" which means ""we are turning"" Then you wait and wait and hope a little puff of wind comes along and grabs the sails and moves you off in the right direction I think we have pushed the tiller and we are in the waiting phase The only reason I hesitate to use the sailing analogy is that I'm a notoriously poor sailor and, when I try to tack in light wind, about half the time I end up dead in the water drifting backward But we have a much more experienced crew on this ship, I'm sure! "
1201,1991-08-20," I think it would be useful in this second stage of research to define the problem pretty carefully in terms of what we're trying to achieve It is true that everyone recognizes a stable funds rate is not a stable monetary policy What has been difficult to convince people of is that a change in the federal funds rate may be an unchanged monetary policy That is a bit more difficult    8/20/91   Yes, everyone buys the first   We haven't been able to write QED after the second one It does seem to me that we also lose some information when we don't allow markets, in some range, to tighten and loosen on their own So, part of the research should be to think about, at a very practical level, how we've achieved what we think is a mistake now I feel pretty uncomfortable picking a fed funds rate out of the dark and also with this process of two types of changes in the fed funds rate, one being a change in policy and the other not being a change in policy With that narrow sort of definition of the problem as well as the broader definition of the policy of [unintelligible] the question of reserve targeting and targeting to price levels at a broader objective level   I think Tom raised an interesting point If you look at the context here, this is not a recitation of long-term goals; it is the implementation of policy for the immediate future--in the intermeeting period--that we are focusing on And that's why it's so useful to have the flexibility to signal that there's a near-term concern like the stock market or, if the dollar should collapse, that in the near term there is special emphasis on that That's a fairly rare circumstance, but it's nice to have a device already in place to deal with it In thinking of what to do in default when we don't have that, I like the notion of considering it once a year with the targets to establish what sorts of things we look at in the intermeeting period in normal times But I think we'd have less flexibility if we didn't have language here to guide the intermeeting period focus; and then when we have one of these events, it's a more jarring change somehow just to interject exchange rates or credit market conditions and the like [in the directive] So, I guess I would prefer having a standard list that we would consider for the next year, ie what would be the kind of default issues we would look at Price stability would be number one, but we then also have there the mechanism for  -14-    8/20/91  signaling concerns It is different, though, than the longer-term objectives because we're really talking about what we might focus on in the immediate future   Yes, we could just write it out I think it might be useful first to state what in normal times are the issues that we look at, and this would be a nice simple concise way If we had a clearly conceptualized approach to this, it wouldn't bother me if this showed up in tables I think it's a concern if it shows up in Fed watchers' tables when we aren't focusing on it and don't have it clear in a gut sense "
1202,1991-08-20," Where do we stand on our inventory scenario? What happened in the second quarter and what do you think is happening now?   You have in the Greenbook for the second quarter a negative $21 billion [for inventories] What was in the advance number--negative $16 billion or something?   Coming into this weekend I [would have] agreed with much of what has been said around here We had a pretty weak recovery, one with clear upward impetus in the industrial sector and in residential housing, but one that in some sense had not taken root in the way that Ed Boehne described with his cumulative reinforcing process and one characterized by this dissonance between the anecdotal data and the industrial production data If you think of the dynamics of this recovery, you can understand some of this dissonance because if you talk to a manufacturing plant executive, he or she is increasing production not because sales have jumped but really because inventory is too lean At some stage the cessation of inventory liquidation is going to cause manufacturers to start increasing  -32-    8/20/91  production even though sales haven't improved very much That's not likely to make that executive feel very comfortable In spite of the fact that the industrial production numbers are going to look better and are going to give thrust to the economy, that increase in production is not responding to an immediate, visible upturn in sales And I think we're not likely to get good anecdotal data in spite of the fact that the industrial production numbers show that [production] is going on  The second stage, of course, is that the higher production should give rise to higher income and then to higher sales and then these folks should cheer us some It's pretty clear from the anecdotal data that there's not a lot of evidence that the second stage, which I would consider the reinforcing self-feeding process, is really taking hold So, there is reason for concern The argument that the industrial production numbers indicate that things are going pretty well is easy to make from our marble enclave here in Washington and harder to make if you're on the front line But this is the tone I would currently whistle while walking through this graveyard [Laughter] My view is that we're not far off track; we may be marginally off track But there is concern about this process taking root There's also concern about the waves of bad news that hit everyone about the financial system; even the BCCI and Solomon Brothers publicity contributes to the climate, though it probably doesn't have much of an impact on too many people We continue to have weak credit growth Money growth has been weak for over a year I wouldn't be concerned by 3-1/2 percent M2 growth at this stage But it seems to me that in the last couple of months the bottom has really fallen out and I am concerned about that rapid deceleration; even Ml decelerated pretty dramatically in July I think Don's analysis did suggest that money matters, and I believe the central bank should take responsibility I agree with Jerry that a prime concern is the supply side or the intermediation side You can add the insurance companies to the list of sources of finance that are not likely to be helpful to below-investment-grade businesses So, there continue to be concerns --in my mind concerns that perhaps [extend] a bit [beyond] the real economy  Now, when you layer this weekend's events in the Soviet Union on top of this, it seems to me that those events are also clearly contractionary When I go down my list of channels of influence, we have the possibility of reduced confidence by consumers and businesses The Iraqi invasion last August was met by a historically large collapse in consumer confidence [The current situation] is a bit different, but at least at the margin it can affect confidence, which can affect spending by consumers on durables and capital spending by businesses It's going to have to hold the possibility for lowering export growth, as the European economies are affected We've already seen a higher dollar--maybe a little less higher today than it was yesterday--and this again is a contractionary factor [There may be] higher oil prices with the possibility of a reduction in Soviet supply; and a marginally higher long-term rate, which we saw at the end of the day yesterday, is a response to increased uncertainty The world is a riskier place to invest long term for 30 years than it was at the beginning of the weekend and there are more incentives to stay short and liquid and there may be marginally lower stock prices as well Defense spending might be a plus; it's also  -33-    8/20/91  true that the political process involved in increasing defense spending has some risks of its own to the budget deal  When I total up this list, it's clearly contractionary on virtually every component But compared to the Iraqi invasion, the event is clearly a lot less dramatic in virtually every component In confidence the Iraqi event confronted Americans with the immediate prospect of the commitment of US troops and also revived the memories of the oil shocks of the '70s The Iraqi event also produced much more dramatic increases in oil prices, in the long bond rate, and a much larger decrease in stock prices Though the events of the weekend are clearly contractionary, their cumulative weight adds probably only marginally to the outlook; it is more likely to produce a downward deflection in the slope of the recovery rather than tipping the economy into recession as the Iraqi affair did The resilience of the financial markets in absorbing this shock yesterday is consistent with this assessment Of course, when I say it's going to deflect the slope of the recovery, I have to admit we don't have much slope to work with, and I think it does heighten some of the downside risks The real risk is that this is only the assessment of act one, and this is not likely to be a one-act play Indeed, this is only the beginning The episode is not over and we're virtually guaranteed to have future shocks as the situation is resolved or at least stabilized When you consider the critical condition of the Soviet economy, the possibility of civil war, the still formidable military strength of the Soviets both in conventional forces and with 30,000 nuclear devices, it's pretty clear that this has the potential to deteriorate into a situation which is at least as damaging to our economy as the Iraqi war  So, from the [perspective of a] first analysis, these events seem clearly but only marginally contractionary It does has the potential for more serious consequences When we add it all up, I think we have a pretty problematic situation to begin with and this adds somewhat to the downside risks and increases the tail of the risks on the down side It is worth noting, as I mentioned, that the markets over here at least responded quite well to the first round yesterday It's not clear the markets need our help at all in responding to this As people mentioned, long rates also have come down almost 50 basis points in 2 months in the face of good but by no means very impressive inflation numbers and this should help the economy We made a move a couple of weeks ago, which should also help But as Governor LaWare noted, it has yet to dislodge the prime rate It could be that this event might actually increase the growth of M2 by increasing the demand for liquidity, but I would not be any surer how to interpret that than I am the current improved situation  The big factor is that events are just beginning to unfold and it's very important to assess the shape and pattern of events as they start unfolding very rapidly I don't think we should wait until we have hard evidence of a faltering economy before we consider another move, given the lags involved We have to anticipate; it would be nice to get ahead of some of these contractionary forces But I think it will be most useful to see the early returns out of this episode the confidence surveys, the new orders for capital goods surveys, the stock market behavior, and the money figures as well There's certainly a lot of noise in the system now And even though I do feel that the downside risks have been marginally  -34-    8/20/91 -35-  increased and the potential for larger problems has been increased pretty substantially, I think it's useful to wait until the noise settles down a little and then anything we decide to do might be more clearly heard "
1203,1991-08-20," I think there is a legitimate case for making a move now, but perhaps there's a somewhat more persuasive case to stay asymmetric toward ease and assess the impact of the last move The lower long rates may have some impact, and if we can get some returns from them as events unfold, our moves may have a bit more impact later on So, I would support asymmety toward ease, although it seems to me the way things are shaping up that the probability is pretty high that we will have to move again I would also marginally prefer version I, under the same logic that Governor Kelley and Tom Melzer mentioned We have a strong tradition of no change in this directive, as you pointed out But it does reduce our flexibility marginally I could easily live with version II, but I would have a marginal preference for version I "
1253,1991-10-01," I don't have much to add on the real economy We expected a moderate recovery and we're getting no better than that  -23-    10/1/91  There still is some sense that it hasn't really taken root, although the evidence is pretty clear that we're getting a manufacturing rebound I had some sense from the anecdotal evidence that this recovery may have lost some of its steam in late summer That certainly happened in the housing area, but--as both Mikes mentioned-- the recent retreat of mortgage rates might rekindle that faint flame Consumer spending appears to be holding up, again growing with moderate growth in income From the real side what concerns me is that after this manufacturing recovery and the inventory side of it, it remains difficult to identify the sources of final demand that are going to move the economy forward The government sector remains bleak Perhaps we can expect an uptick in business spending next year; attitudes are not too encouraging, but they never are And on the consumer side, consumers can only spend at the modest rate of income growth So, I think the final demand side late this year and early next year is a concern  On the financial side, I still see some weakness It's true that the public capital markets, the investment grade sector, look fine As the long bond rate has come down, bond issuance has picked up smartly The stock market has been marking time for six months now; still, we're getting a fairly healthy volume of new stock issues For below investment grade businesses--small and medium-size firms, which are the growth sector of the economy--I still think conditions are [poor] Demand is certainly weak; at some stage demand should be picking up I wonder why we hear so much about credit constraints if they're not out there In the beginning, I thought it was commercial real estate developers; I would assume by now most of them are broke and not able to complain! The jury is still out on the capacity of the system to satisfy loan demand should it ever arrive because I think banks are focusing on increasing capital, working out problem loans, and rationalizing operations with mergers One way I would [phrase] the question confronting us on the financial side of the economy is Are monetary conditions tight or easy? You can pick your indicators here M2 conditions look tight, with unprecedentedly slow growth in M2 We've discussed some of the issues there What would concern me most is the credit side and less so the portfolio side Ml growth continues to look healthy; maybe it has tailed off a bit, but it continues to look healthy We have little confidence that M1 is related reliably to economic activity Some would suggest even that the reliability of the M2 relationship could be called into question Look at credit growth Conditions also look tight; but, again, that could be demand If you look at interest rates, we've brought short- term rates down substantially, as has been mentioned, and that looks like ease Of course, it's real rates that matter and with CPI inflation of 5-1/2 percent in 1990 and looking at perhaps 3-1/2 percent in 1992, real rates have fallen less over this last year than nominal rates So, there has been less ease than would be apparent just looking at the rates Real Treasury bill rates are higher than they have averaged over the long sweep of history Over 60 years the real T-bill rate has been zero Currently, it's probably 1-1/2 or 2 percent, although it is probably marginally lower now than the rate that prevailed over much of the '80s It's roughly in the same order of magnitude as the '80s; of course, the '80s was a different environment, characterized by growth in credit demand  If you're interested in stimulus to final demand, you might look at real rates paid by final borrowers; perhaps they matter If  -24-    10/1/91  you think of real rates faced by bank borrowers, they would still seem to be pretty high As Chairman Riegle pointed out the other day, the last time the discount rate was 5 percent, the prime rate was 6 percent, not 8 percent as it is now It is true that over the last year the federal funds rate has fallen 300 basis points; the prime rate has fallen only 200 basis points in nominal terms; and the real prime rate has fallen even less With respect to real consumer bank rates, I would suspect that we've had little, if any, easing in those rates; maybe they've come off in nominal terms a bit, but I doubt if we've seen much easing in those rates in real terms And it's not clear why we should expect much stimulus from that source So, it does seem to me that the financial system is inherently tight currently and is not transmitting our easing actions fully through to final borrowers I think one sees this if one looks at money growth, credit growth, or real rates, which for many borrowers still appear high  We are concerned about flagging final demand out there in a couple of quarters It could be that in this environment we may need to offset some of this inherent tightness; and lower rates may be necessary for the ease to show through to final borrowers and produce the stimulus we would normally expect from our actions thus far I realize this argument applies most forcefully only to a segment of the financial system the banking system, and perhaps insurance companies in an institutional system However, those without access to the capital markets do constitute a significant sector of the economy in terms of size and I think in importance in terms of stimulated growth And even in the capital markets, we must recognize that real rates have fallen less than nominal rates I would also mention parenthetically here the point that Mike Prell made based upon Ted Truman's work that the rise in the dollar this year has also offset much of the apparent ease So, the bottom line is I wonder just how stimulative policy has been I fear that it might be tighter than we have intended I also feel that at the current stage we continue to receive data consistent with weak recovery We've made a couple of moves in the last six weeks and these have been well received by the long bond market and precipitated the reduction in the prime rate So, it may be wise to continue to assess developing responses to these actions before moving again I hesitate in part because I wouldn't like to miss that opportunity that Governor Angell mentioned I do think, though, that if the economy sinks into recession early next year, that would not be helpful to pursuing our ultimate goals So, I do see risks in waiting too long for the financial system to ease on its own We may need to do more to offset what I see as an inherent tightness, if we're concerned about this issue of the level of final demand later this year and early next year "
1254,1991-10-01," ""B"" asymmetric "
1304,1991-11-05," First, I think we shouldn't schedule FOMC meetings around quarterly auctions   I tend to agree with Wayne's analysis, although I think we should be aware that there is potential damage here The concern I would have is the 30-year auction, because that price is no longer being set by people at the margin On auction day, Thursday, they will rip open the market and reach deep within it to sell $12 billion worth of bonds and, when you do that, that marginal buyer is sometimes a fairly aberrant personality If there is skepticism about our move, I don't think we would see that on Friday so much because, again, they are trading at the margin And we just are more vulnerable and at risk of getting a sloppy auction and doing some damage to the long-term rate I think that happened a bit in April, and there have been some other examples as well Even recognizing that risk, I still would come down with Governor Angell "
1305,1991-11-05," Well, I agree with Governor Angell that we don't have much risk of a typical recovery here What I would like to see, though, is confidence that we at least have a sustainable recovery I guess I do agree with the basic diagnosis that we're experiencing a gradual wringing out of the excesses of the '80s and that that is imparting downward pressure on growth We've seen those excesses, and people are talking about an asset [deflation] in real estate Expectations of inflationary home prices have collapsed, and    11/5/91  I agree with those who think that that has had a profound impact on consumers since that's probably the single most important component of their wealth And I do agree that the leverage also was an excess One can see the way corporations are using the current equity market to [deleverage] Consumers not only have been reducing their debt, but their leverage has robbed us of the excess bench capacity to spur a recovery So, we don't have that force And I believe all this comes home to roost in financial institutions, which financed these excesses We've seen this most dramatically in the collapse of the S&L industry; but it's also in banks, insurance companies, and finance companies, all with varying degrees of exposure to these structurally troubled areas of commercial real estate, unleveraged loans, and junk bonds The public capital markets in my view adjusted quickly and brutally to these excesses The stock market collapsed in '87; the junk bond market disintegrated in '89 But even after that period, the momentum of excess continued in financial institutions, and their retrenchment out of this is slower and more painful They're still in the process--it was not only in 1990 but even in 1991--of recognizing and dealing with asset quality problems and pulling back to raise capital ratios and asset quality We see this in the shrinking of financial intermediary credit at the same time that public market debt is growing We also see it in slower M2 growth  I think that much of the force of our easing to date has been absorbed by this retrenchment process instead of fostering spending The ease in long rates and the rise in stock prices resulted in large new issue volumes, but the proceeds are not going to business spending; they're going to clean up balance sheets The ease in bank funding costs has gone into the healing process of increased margins, and mortgage rate reductions have gone increasingly into refinancing to reduce home [mortgage payments] We can't avoid this retrenchment process, but I think we must take into account these retrenchment pressures in setting our course And our current stance has not been consistent with our earlier forecast of moderate sustained recovery, at least in my view That earlier forecast had two engines of growth First, sustained recovery in housing of modest dimensions and secondly, this inventory-led increase in industrial production These two developments, housing and industrial production, were supposed to spur income growth and consumer spending with business spending coming in later In my view, it's pretty clear that the forecast is not being fulfilled The housing market, after advancing since early this year, has at best flattened out and is likely declining despite lower interest rates Industrial production, after growing for four straight months, has been dead in the water for three straight months The leading economic indicators also have flattened out and the momentum that was in evidence in mid-summer is now gone And sentiment has turned increasingly sour  With the importance of the consumer to our economy, I think we have relatively little room for error in the current situation With industrial production and employment not growing, income growth will be minimal with a low saving rate and deteriorating consumer confidence We've already seen it have an impact in the housing market; we've had long-term mortgage rates coming down dramatically over the last several months and yet the housing market is going in the opposite direction [of what one would expect] I think that's the impact of confidence There is a real risk in this environment and a potential for the momentum in this massive economy to turn down  -23-    11/5/91  Business confidence is also increasingly sour, reflecting the deterioration of the recovery And I fear there is power in negative thinking [Earlier] the momentum was generated in part by an exogenous shock the military success in the Persian Gulf It raised confidence, which increased stock prices and bond prices and reduced oil prices This time I see no such positive shocks on the horizon, although I wouldn't rule that out I would agree with those who think the economy is vulnerable to a negative shock, and there are some potential ones in the financial sector So, I have difficulty with the current [Greenbook] forecast [in terms of] understanding what is going to pull the economy out of this deceleration and place it neatly back on the track in the second quarter of '92 That is perhaps where I differ a bit from the Greenbook  As for policy in the current environment, we need to weigh against these retrenchment forces and the deteriorating confidence in order to return to the track of this summer's Greenbook forecast Since these are contractionary forces we are responding to, I see little risk to the inflation reduction program Indeed, the current environment has been characterized by an extended period of slow growth of M2 and slow growth of credit If you take one-year inflationary expectations right off the Michigan Survey and compare them to one-year bill rates, real rates are higher than they were last year at this time So, I don't believe monetary policy is too easy It is true that we've done three easing moves recently, but two of those--or I guess more than two--are already included in the Greenbook forecast There are some arguments against making this adjustment Some would argue that lower rates may not be especially effective If so--if you think they're not going to affect the economy--they should not be especially harmful or risky to inflation Despite doubts in every [bout] of economic weakness, I believe that monetary policy works And I think a significant reduction in rates would help the housing markets and the stock and bond markets and would facilitate the [deleveraging] process, which ultimately must give way to business spending I think it would help banks; it would precipitate a lowering of the prime rate and allow the pass-through of lower rates to final borrowers while still retaining the margins needed for the adjustment process Ultimately it would help with consumer durables as the average age of autos reaches historical levels The quality of domestically produced autos has improved substantially, and I think we'll have a pickup from that as well Also, I think a move would cause the dollar to give up some of this year's gains and that would have an impact on exports My view is that a move at this time would also help confidence; I don't think it would frighten people It's pretty clear to me from the confidence surveys or the public opinion polls that consumers and business people alike perceive the deterioration in the recovery The frustration is that they see nothing happening that could turn the situation around They see no response And if we respond in a discreet and visible way, I think that would be supportive to confidence, not frightening It is true that we might be accused of responding to what Mike Kelley calls the drumbeat from the White House but since that drumbeat is constant [unintelligible] all is quiet up the street   And when they say this ease came just after a drumbeat, I would say How does that distinguish that day of the week from any other day of the week? I do think there is some risk of dissipating the impact of our moves with continued small moves, and I wonder if we continue on this path whether we're going to have much of a ""gong"" left to ring So, I think the time has come to make a move and to lean visibly against this ill wind before it blows us seriously off course The risk to policy if we wait is that the force of economic momentum could well turn down and confront us with much more difficult policy situations down the road in 1992 "
1306,1991-11-05, I would favor a 1/4 point cut now and also asymmetric language because I believe the risks are still very much on the down side We're playing catchup 
1361,1991-12-17," I also can read the tape and support this I do agree with Governor Angell that it's useful to have a mechanism to signal special concern He mentioned the exchange markets; there might also be a case where the stock market is weak or financial institutions are very weak and we might want to signal that that's a concern As Bob Forrestal said, we still could do that I think this is an improvement overall, though, and I would support it "
1362,1991-12-17," Well, I think the economy is dead in the water with no forward momentum or maybe drifting back a little but with no momentum there as well I can't really quarrel with the Greenbook forecast for the fourth quarter or the first quarter For the second quarter of next year the Greenbook has 26 percent real growth in GDP We haven't had a quarter like that in over 3 years If we get it, it could be perceived as a boom and might be disorienting to people! [Laughter] I think that second quarter is where it is difficult to see what is going to happen The Greenbook puts an emphasis on the inventory cycle and on a rebound of consumer spending as the saving rate falls Since I've been here I haven't been impressed with our ability to predict inventories, but the logic is there for the inventory side The consumer rebound is difficult for me to see when I think of the environment next year where the media will have a couple more negative quarters to work with We will have a political debate which will aspire to divisiveness and may achieve it I think there is serious downside risk for a stalled economy The most obvious one, and the one I would be most concerned about, is that if confidence continues to be a problem, with the prospects for the political debate and the media hype, these fears will lead consumers  -18-    12/17/91  to increase their saving rate And since they are 60 or 70 percent of the economy, that could propel us downward pretty quickly  There are many other downside risks for next year, not only the fiscal policy foolishness Already perhaps the speculation about an investment tax credit could be sufficient to freeze capital spending plans for a while And, of course, we have large banks on the precipice as well as maybe a couple of industrial companies as well There are international events So, I see a little more risk on the down side And, of course, underlying all of this is the continuing pressure from this retrenchment process, the balance sheet adjustment process, which it seems to me in retrospect has been going on for three years The recent third-quarter GNP number, which has now been wiped from all of our data, was revised to 2 percent We thought it was going to be revised up That 2 percent real growth in GNP was the best quarter since the first quarter of '89, and I think it was the first quarter of '89 that was biased upward by drought effects So, the compound growth rate over these three years from the first quarter of '89 to the first quarter of '92 as projected is 1/4 percent annually; essentially, we've had three flat years So, I think the contractive pressure of this retrenchment process is strong; it's durable and it's stubborn I see no evidence that it's on the brink of exhaustion  Can monetary policy help? I think it can and has One wonders where the economy would be without the easing actions we've taken I believe the easing we did last year helped lift the economy out of the more traditional recession--the traditional Gulf or oil- price-related recession--which was superimposed upon this longer-term adjustment More recently, I believe the moves we've made since August have helped stabilize the housing recovery and also have arrested the free-fall in M2 growth and put it back into the lower end of the range But it seems to me the important role for monetary policy in the current environment is in facilitating this adjustment process itself Monetary policy has raised stock prices It has produced the issuance of equities, which has helped in the de- leveraging It has decreased bank funding costs, which allows banks to create this margin that will help in building their capital The reductions in the prime rate have reduced the debt burden for firms and consumers because a lot of home equity loans are tied to the prime rate And, of course, mortgage refinancing has also reduced homeowners' debt burdens Even though much of the force of monetary policy has been absorbed in this balance sheet adjustment process, I don't view it as wasted energy This is important work for monetary policy; it is necessary and indeed unavoidable work There is no way monetary policy can short-circuit those adjustment processes, and we shouldn't try to rekindle the excesses I view a role of monetary policy as advancing the day in which consumers, businesses, and banks can turn to future growth So, even if we don't see it immediately giving rise to real spending, I think it is still having a beneficial effect  Where are we in terms of monetary stance? I think there are some positives here We have moved [down] 125 basis points on the fed funds rate since August; we have moved 75 basis points in the last six weeks M2 growth is once again positive and has moved [up] into the lower end of the [Committe's long-run] range The dollar is down It's still not as low as it was last year at this time, but it is  -19-    12/17/91  lower than the Greenbook forecast That is offset a bit by the softness in the foreign economies The stock market, despite a few shudders, has held up; the market sees no double-dip One might make some argument on that as well, but at least it's up there The yield curve is still steep People are betting real money that rates are going to be higher in the future, and the quality spreads in the debt market also have remained relatively narrow The housing market appears to be holding up Consumer confidence is very low, but it's still well above the lows of last October and still well above where it was in the 1982 recession At least on the Michigan survey that is true; the Conference Board [index] is somewhat lower I think the recent round of easing and where we stand now has been sufficient to keep the economy from turning down and to keep it from gathering momentum on the down side But it has left the economy pretty much at a standstill against these forces of retrenchment and I see the downside risks overhanging next year's environment  I think we need to be moving ahead; it would be useful to accelerate the balance sheet adjustment process and offset its impact Moreover, I think it's now safe to say that reports of M2's death were highly exaggerated It was only a flesh wound We saw M2's weakness in the summer and now we see weakness in the real economy, even though other aggregates were giving more positive signals We have seen M1 grow at a healthy rate, but we haven't seen that associated with healthy [economic] growth I wonder--and maybe Don Kohn can answer this later--my general impression on M1 is that it is growing a bit more slowly than our models would expect, given the reduction in interest rates This time around we have no exogenous shocks; we have no oil price increases or wars; we basically just have to recognize the force of this retrenchment And in this environment my view is that we ought to look for consistent monthly growth of M2 in the upper half of the range I also continue to think that with a prime rate of 7-1/2 percent, given outside analysts' forecasts of near-term inflation in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range, real rates to final borrowers remain high at 4 percent over prime The real prime rate doesn't look like easy money to me  So, in conclusion, I still think we need an adjustment in policy to acknowledge and incorporate the downward pressure from this retrenchment process and help the economy move ahead I don't view this as aggressive counter-cyclical policy but rather as an attempt to achieve a monetary stance that will both facilitate this adjustment process and have a little left over for growth I don't see potential damage to the objective of reducing inflation We don't have high M2 growth We don't have high credit growth If you take the federal government out, credit growth is quite anemic And we don't yet have a federal funds rate below the expected inflation rate In last summer's Greenbook, we were satisfied with the disinflation path implicit in 3 percent real growth Now we have a few quarters of flat or negative growth and I can't see the risks in returning to the 3 percent path If we don't move, I think we risk instability  How do we make the adjustment in monetary stance? My feeling is that it may be time to reconsider the pattern of moving in an incremental approach and making the smallest moves possible I'm concerned that this may dissipate the impact of our actions and not have the signalling effect I'm also getting a bit concerned about the way the market is responding to the easing pattern rather than  -20-    12/17/91  perhaps to economic fundamentals They think we ease on employment reports and before [Congressional] testimony They're predicting policy easing rather than focusing on the fundamentals, it seems to me And I wonder how much benefit there is to making another fully anticipated minimum size policy move We had academic consultants in the other day and one of them said, in effect ""It's time to get this mule's attention"" I doubt that another 1/4 percentage point tap on the mule's head is likely to do much It may be time to figure out where we want to be and get there and make a stand So, I still think we need an adjustment in policy, but in view of the lags I believe we should try to get the work done ahead of the uncertainties of next year I would like to be in a position where we would have the expectation that we would not have any easing to do next year--to be essentially in a symmetric position We do have to save some ammunition for emergencies, but I'd rather make the bulk of the adjustment in a deliberate manner than gradually dribble out 1/4 points with the perception that we have a lot more to go I'd like for us to be in a confident position to say the Fed has done its part; M2 is growing; real rates are not high  My guess is that there is not a unanimous consensus on this; indeed, I think we have done a lot lately We might consider at this stage waiting a bit and doing nothing--waiting a few weeks to break the pattern of ease and to let the market think about economic fundamentals We could wait until the data are more convincing and then in our own time, for our own reasons, implement a discrete, significant, adjustment If the data don't convince us, we can stand pat or move another 1/4 point I think a few weeks one way or the other will not make a lot of difference I certainly would not oppose a move now because I think we ought to have a lower rate, but I might prefer waiting until we have something to communicate rather than simply to move another fully anticipated 1/4 point In my view, we don't have much room left and we ought to make every move count So, even though I think we should make a move, if there's not agreement, it might be useful to break the pattern of a slow slide and step back and wait to make a significant move when we feel comfortable with such a move Obviously, I wouldn't vote against another small move, but on balance I would be comfortable waiting until we have the confidence to make a symbolically louder move   It's a crowded District! "
1363,1991-12-17, I support your recommendation I think it's the right approach in the current environment   A hard asymmetric 
1415,1992-03-31," Well, I agree with President Melzer and Chairman Greenspan on this issue The pattern has been one of [average] Treasury maturities increasing since the '70s and System holdings decreasing in maturity And that means the public holdings have increased substantially [in maturity] Now, I don't think it's an especially good idea to wander around in maturity issues, whether it's our holdings or Treasury issues So, I think there's a strong argument to figure out where we want to be I'm not very comfortable with discretionary action or anything that could be perceived as discretionary action to move along the maturity structure to affect rates, especially in this environment One only has to look at the way the markets responded to this innocent little reserve requirement cut we did a few weeks ago to document Tom Melzer's assertion of cynicism in the market So, I think it would be a bit difficult to pull off here, and we ought to be very careful It's hard to communicate what we're doing But I think it would be useful to stop the wandering and determine what makes sense as a maturity structure and implement that And I think that's what Peter's memo does "
1416,1992-03-31," Well, I guess the consensus is that we have the makings of a recovery with this strong consumer spending It's nice to see that spending reinforced by the increase in confidence [reported in recent] surveys This morning the Conference Board reported an increase in March to 54 from 47 percent, the largest jump since the Gulf War I think the issues that Mike Prell laid out are worth reviewing because we were in this position last year and things didn't work out Will this year be different? There are a lot of positive signs on the durability or sustainability issue There's ample evidence that we've made progress on this 3-year depressant of the deleveraging process with the improvement in corporate balance sheets Interest coverage is looking more like it did in the mid- or late '80s than it did in the early '90s Consumer installment debt to disposable income is down to where it was in 1985, so we've rolled that back; and we're reclaiming the decade on consumer indebtedness I think mortgage refinancing has helped a lot And the banking system is clearly in much better shape to support [growing] demands should they ever come about So in this [unintelligible] we seem to be poised to abate at this time There is also this issue of pent-up [consumer] demand Measuring it against the late '80s raises the question of how much of that was real demand or conspicuous consumption, but I guess we'll find out There's also the possibility of pent-up demand in business spending--replacement spending and capital equipment spending that has been postponed And most fundamentally from our perspective, what is different this year is the  -24-    3/31/92  fact that rates are much lower now; the fed funds rate since last summer has come down 175 basis points And the dollar, despite its recent rise, is still substantially below where it was last summer  On the negative side compared to last year, Governor Angell and President Corrigan and others have mentioned that exports look less encouraging given the deterioration in western Europe and Japan, and I would share that view Consumer confidence, despite the recent gains, is still well below levels of last spring And last year we were looking at what I thought were lean inventories--of course, one can never tell until a few months later whether they were lean or not --and now we have a little overhang And the employment picture continues to be weak There's concern over what we'll see in the upcoming report So, I think an issue is Where does the income growth come from for sustainability?  A number of people have mentioned the issue of long rates, and that's an important input into the environment The Board staff has been doing a lot of work looking at that 30-year bond and trying to figure out what is causing its yield to go up One way to think of a 30-year bond is that it is composed of 30, 1-year forward rates implied by the yield curve That allows us to look at these forward rates, which we can back out of the yield curve, and see where the pressure is coming from The Board staff has done this I think they've come up with some interesting results The 1-year rates expected to prevail 20 or 25 years out in the future haven't changed much at all in recent years In fact, they are about where they were in the early '70s So, we haven't seen a big shift in long-term inflationary expectations or long-term expectations of rates at least What has pushed the 30-year bond around has been the movement of the short- and intermediate-term rates The first three forward rates account for 25 percent in weight of the overall 30-year coupon, and the big increase in these 3-year rates has driven up the overall 30-year rate In fact, the increase in the forward rates in the first 5 years of the overall 30-year structure accounts for virtually all of the increase in the long rate When you look at it, that increase is pretty dramatic As you recall, all these rates responded well to our cut in December and then rates bottomed out in January and started up Those 3-year forward rates have gone up 150 basis points; and if you look at the 1-year rate today it's 4-3/4 percent The forward rate in year two is up to 7 percent and by year three the market is expecting in some sense an 8 percent 1-year rate Then it levels out at about year five at 8-3/4 percent So, the way to think of it is that the market is expecting very large increases I don't know if they heard Governor Angell's talk on this, but they're expecting very large increases in rates in the very near future And the weight of that is pushing up overall long rates as well I think it's worth asking why people would expect that; I think there are three possible explanations First, they expect inflation to increase; secondly, there's this fiscal argument, a fiscal crowding out; and third, they expect a recovery that is a lot stronger than perhaps the Greenbook forecast  I think the inflation explanation is not very satisfying because when these rates turned around in early January the dollar was also rising and the price of gold was falling off In the survey evidence that Mike mentioned, the Michigan survey, inflation expectations continue to fall The 1-year inflation expectation in  -25-    3/31/92  March was 33 percent whereas last October it was 47 percent Even the 5- to 10-year inflation expectation last March in the Michigan survey was a little over 6 percent and now it's about 4-1/2 percent So, I think it's hard to ascribe this expected increase in short- and medium-term rates to a rekindling of inflation  The deficit argument, as President Jordan and others have mentioned, is a better explanation First, if one looks at the timing of these rate increases, they really turned around in early January when the budget was released and this so-called bidding war started And as the probabilities of a big fiscal package have gone down, we've seen some easing of those rates But what I think has happened is that in the fall of 1990 many participants in the market saw a budget agreement that they thought held the promise of a multi-year disciplinary mechanism, a pay-as-you-go mechanism that finally was going to work And that confidence has come unwound this year In this town there's more hopelessness on the deficit issue than I've seen in years because there's a feeling that these structures--whether it's Gramm-Rudman or the new structure--simply aren't working The 1990 structure worked flawlessly and we've had no new spending initiatives Despite the fact that pay-as-you-go has worked, the deficit continues to rise So, I think that's a major factor And the other factor, which Jerry alluded to earlier, is the interaction of the deficit and the strength of recovery because, with the deficit out of control, there's relatively little private savings left over to finance a recovery And that implies that when those demands occur, rates and the dollar have to rise to [accommodate them]  I think we can usefully ask what we can do about this situation if the market is expecting big deficits and any private demands to push up rates dramatically While we can usefully ask that question, the answer on monetary policy fundamentally is that there is nothing that we can offset if the deficit is going to be out of control We can't offset the increase in real rates We could accommodate it, and this is the secondary risk that might be included here But I don't think we would do that because we understand the problems there So, there is some concern about the contractionary impact of this; and certainly at the margin it's something we have to think about in the overall mix even though fundamentally it's not something that monetary policy can cure I don't think it's inflationary expectations; rather it's these factors  When you pull all this together, I think we have a positive cast here to the economy I do worry about it some Since January a number of elements have shown at the margin some tightening of [financial conditions], including the increase in the dollar even though it's well below where it was last year Medium-term rates have been moving up; the short-term inflation expectation is moving down; and, of course, there's the falloff in M2 growth We had a couple of good months of M2 growth, held up primarily by Ml growth, compensating balances, mortgage repayments, and the like Now, measured from the fourth quarter, we're down to about 4 percent M2 growth which, as Governor Angell mentioned, is below the midpoint If we look over longer periods of 6 months or 9 months or a year, again, we're very low in our ranges I had held the expectation that we would be above the midpoint for awhile And we find ourselves here once again in this position of having to depend upon the velocity increase to bail us out, to make the Greenbook forecast come true So, I think that's  -26-    3/31/92  something to be a bit concerned about And as people have mentioned, growth in credit also remains slow We ought to be sensitive to the risks of a second false start, which I think are fairly substantial in terms of confidence, the fiscal actions, and the monetary pressures On balance, I think the reading is more positive But because of the consequences of a second false start and the slowdown in M2 growth, we still need to be sensitive to the down side "
1417,1992-03-31," There's no question in my view that the forecast risks are far more balanced this time I agree with what others have said about the consequences of the downside problem being more severe, and I think it's a good idea to be asymmetric with the current uncertainty in the markets and the aggregates I would also like to mention Tom Melzer's point, which is rather interesting, that last year it was the Treasury bill rate that was leading the fed funds rate down and this year it is the reverse So, I think we have some interesting times ahead of us Governor Angell mentioned our problems with the foreign central bankers [My response to them] is to point out our record of very low growth in money over a long period of time I don't have much success with that!   Well, it's a lingering problem If you look at the record--to pick a time let's say over four or five years--it is pretty impressive that there is this lingering suspicion And one feels it [in discussions with foreign officials] as we go around the room We can look through all the economic fundamentals currently, whether it's commodity prices or slack or the dollar going up, and we're in pretty good position Yet this is something we're going to face, I think, for a long time until we wring [inflation] out And I don't think it can be wrung out until we go through a recovery and show at that time that we've come out of this without going too far On balance, I still prefer to stick with asymmetric   That's from the fourth quarter base, not from December? "
1472,1992-05-19," It's worthwhile for us to give some thought as to what is the appropriate balance, where we should start and stop, and how far we should go I know that's difficult, but as we move forward I think that's something that we should start to confront "
1473,1992-05-19," I guess I have nothing especially useful or new to add I generally agree with a lot of what has been expressed I think we have a weak recovery And as I understand the Greenbook, the recovery is projected to be fueled by growth in consumption driven by growth in income The only difficulty is identifying where the growth in income will come from I guess the answer is sort of everywhere and nowhere Everything grows a little and the whole juggernaut gradually moves forward and momentum will carry us It seems to me that the concern about sustainability is really the fact that we can't point to an engine driving this Perhaps we thought it was going to be residential housing; I think there's evidence that the steam is coming out of that And there are still concerns about losing steam especially if the first-quarter growth rate turns out to be 4 percent and the second quarter is 2 percent; that might have some impact on confidence It is encouraging that consumer buying attitudes, as John LaWare mentioned, in all three of the major categories of the Michigan survey have steadily strengthened But the overall confidence index is still below where it was in the summer through September, though that's still progress When I look at the picture, I don't see much that is robust on the real side or the financial side, but there is relatively broad-based progress in terms of moving forward And, with the ample slack in production resources, echoing a little of what Jerry Corrigan was saying, I don't see too much risk on the up side The economy still has an adjustment to make on defense spending, in state and local governments such as California, and in commercial real estate; we still have some further financial adjustment to go as well I think Bob Parry is probably right The economy could easily be stronger with growth above 3 percent, but the consequences of that sort of upside risk would not bother me much  It is discouraging that after the long period of slow economic growth and many years of slow money growth we haven't made more progress on inflation I should point out that I think we've only had significant slack in the economic system for a little over a year and a half now When I came on the Board the unemployment rate was 5-1/2 percent and capacity utilization was 85 percent or higher It is also interesting to note that inflationary expectations as measured by the Michigan survey in the near term continue to come down gradually; but it is still true that core CPI is 4 percent, where it has been for eight years I think it is probably deeply embedded  On the financial side, short rates in real terms look low now and less low for lending to bank customers because the prime rate is  -28-    5/19/92  6-1/2 percent; it still has the margin built into it and consumer rates have that margin as well So, I think we still have something of a dichotomy where I see easy conditions on rates in the financial markets and somewhat tighter conditions in the intermediated markets I think it's fair to say that the yield curve is still very steep, and it's not clear to me that this is driven by inflationary expectations It's pretty clear that people are betting big money that rates are going to be a lot higher in a year or so And I think it's not at all unlikely, even if inflation doesn't re-emerge when credit demands re-emerge, that we will be joining the global village of high real rates just as everyone else has high real short-term rates We're really the outlier in the world, and it's primarily because we have such weak loan demand  As far as M2 is concerned, I'm certainly not here to praise it; I thought we buried it last summer but someone dug it up again I'm fully prepared to accept the notion that the traditional relationship between M2 and GDP has been distorted by weakness in the financial system associated with restructuring Just because the traditional relationship is altered does not mean that a sharp deceleration of M2 conveys no useful information Obviously, I'm a bit biased by this coincidence last summer We've only had a handful of months in recorded economic history where M2 has been negative or zero We had one last July and then August and September were essentially flat In the fourth quarter, we did get some deceleration but now in March and April it is negative Clearly, the traditional relationships don't hold, but dramatic decelerations still make me nervous Now, since the RTC has shut down temporarily, M2 should snap back smartly, presumably And we're over the tax season I don't know how much comfort to take in Tom Melzer's observation that the relationship holds only over a long period of five years I tend to conclude from that that we're going to have five years of stagnation some time in the future The only other thing I would add to the M2 debate--other than saying that it's a mystery and I'm less concerned with it being low than with the deceleration--is that it's not only M2 that is weak and not only M2 and M3 that are weak but L is weak It's not just intermediated liabilities that are weak Domestic nonfinancial nongovernmental debt is, I would suggest, about as weak as it has been in any period we've recorded Even when you throw in the government, who is usually a dependable borrower, it still looks relatively weak So, my view is that with projected GDP growth in the second quarter of 2 percent, with 1 percent of that coming from autos and 1/2 percent from inventories, without a dependable engine to keep the momentum going, with this weakness in credit pretty much across the board, and less concern for capacity to overshoot at this stage, I still think the most prudent stance is to remain sensitive to the risks of losing momentum   So, with 4 percent inflation we're looking at zero real M2 growth? "
1474,1992-05-19," He might also compile our estimating accuracy over the past few years!   Well, using Jerry Jordan's model, I would have to prefer asymmetric toward ease with the T-bill rate well below the fed funds rate With that model I wonder a bit how we get a clear view of what the Treasury bill rate really is other than a prediction of what we're likely to do next And I do agree in general with the notion that we are going to have to think very carefully about real rates as we go through this process However, I simply don't see the loan demand picking up again And I don't think it's just M2; it's total debt, as the Chairman mentioned, as well So, I would prefer asymmetric toward ease in this environment but I would support symmetric along with the stance of monitoring developments as we roar through this 2 percent quarter! [Laughter]   He's asymmetric to you!   It shows our problem "
1525,1992-08-18," You mentioned the housing starts figure, and I thought you mentioned that the permits looked pretty good   Okay   It looks pretty flat; maybe the multifamily [permits] were up a bit What other evidence do we have? We've seen the big refinancing boom pick up in July again How about actual purchases and starts? Do we have anecdotal evidence that we may be getting something going here?   Okay   The recent data on home sales really reflect decisions of a couple of months ago?   Thank you   I would agree with the notion that has been expressed by a number of people that we're probably stuck in the same old ditch for a while, rocking back and forth trying to gain the momentum to escape the gravitational pull of this deleveraging phenomenon I don't really have a serious argument with the Greenbook, although there is the question of the timing of our escape from this I do wonder whether or not we are in a lurching pattern with two steps forward and one step back as opposed to a steady progression and gradual acceleration I don't know how to write down a lurching pattern in the forecast That's the difficult part, so I wouldn't argue with that I tend to think the next lurch is likely to  -29-    8/18/92  be a bit forward, although I'm not so certain about that given the political climate But I wouldn't be surprised to see third-quarter [GDP growth] a bit better than 2 percent following the reduction in long bond rates and our [interest] rate cuts We have another round of mortgage refinancing going Even if housing activity hasn't picked up, we've already seen some revival of retail sales, especially the discretionary GAF category So, we might have a little better third quarter than the Greenbook projects I still think we are likely to be stuck in the range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent growth for the foreseeable future until these balance sheet adjustments are sufficiently far along to allow sustained growth in spending or until this upward ratcheting process pushes employers beyond the limits of increasing production hours and overtime and into some hiring and some income growth We continue to have the logic of pent-up demand waiting allegedly in the wings to be unleashed But on the other side we also have the risk of cautious consumers increasing their saving rate At this stage we have very little rigorous insight into how long we will be stuck in the sluggish growth rut or the trajectory on which we will emerge  We are getting some G-7 companionship, as Ted mentioned, in this condition Some countries are climbing out of recession into sluggish growth and others are descending from healthy growth It is interesting to see the process of convergence among the G-7 nations with real growth in '92 converging in most countries to 1-1/2 percent, inflation at around 2 to 3 percent, and unemployment in the 8 to 10 percent range And just as we have no US sector to provide an engine, we seem to have no G-7 country as an engine Fortunately, we're making progress on that, which might be useful at the margin  Focusing on the near term, I do think we have another shot of stimulus in the pipeline as reinforced by the reduction in the long bond rate, which has descended barely through the lows of early January The dollar has also descended So, near term we have some stimulus This could be just another pig in the python working its way through the system which, once digested, will leave a hungry economy in need of another feeding That is the Arkansas version of the Chairman's seize-up model! [Laughter]   They have a lot of pigs! [Laughter] So, it's unclear at this stage whether that is what is going on or whether we are getting on a more stable recovery [path]  I do agree that the disinflation trend is starting to take hold Two years ago, as I mentioned last time, the unemployment rate was 5-1/2 percent and manufacturing capacity utilization was 83 percent Unemployment didn't break out of the 5 percent range until the fourth quarter of 1990 and capacity utilization didn't break below 80 percent until the first quarter of 1991 So, we've had about a year and half of this slack and I think it's taking hold We see it not only in the numbers on wage inflation and the CPI and PPI, but we see it in consumer attitudes I think there is a new ethos of bargain hunting which has reflected on business in a healthy way I would agree with the comments that businesses are gradually, and I would say grudgingly, accepting cost-cutting and productivity improvement as the status quo and a steady-state approach to business, rather than  -30-    8/18/92  restructuring and a brief painful period followed by price increases as the way to go So, I think that is good news Commodity prices also continue to exhibit no signs of price pressure Gold attempted a brief breakout recently, you might have noticed, but then collapsed I think we're likely on the threshold of some real progress here and, again, the reduction in long-term rates suggests this as well I would point out, though, that despite the consumer bargain hunting, inflationary expectations among consumers as expressed in surveys such as the Michigan survey have not come down much Those expectations are still very high in the 3 percent range, at around 39 percent And the 5- to 10-year inflation expectation is about 5 percent, so that's still relatively high  In terms of the market view of inflation, our 10-year rate, which is the international long rate, is now only 6-1/2 percent It's 150 basis points below the German 10-year rate of 8 percent and that looks pretty good Unfortunately, the 10-year rate is influenced by the shape of that yield curve and is heavily weighted by the short-end rates included in that So, our 10-year rate is weighted down by the short end; the German rate is weighted up by their short end If you look at the 1-year implicit forward rate 10 years out, the German rate is about 7-1/2 percent and ours is about 8-1/2 percent So, our 10-year forward rate viewed at the end of that 10-year period is still about 100 basis points above the German rate So, on consumer inflation and in the capital markets we may have a ways to go  I think it would be interesting to try to assess the current stance of monetary policy While that's interesting, I don't have much insight into it There's not much new to say I view real short-term rates as low, as around zero I wouldn't quibble with a view that they were marginally negative If we do get more progress on inflation expectations, we may revisit that issue to see whether there isn't a case for an adjustment of nominal rates, but I would not make such a case now M2 in the current environment is very little help We have attained some insight into the distortion caused by the yield curve, and it seems to me we can adjust analytically for that distortion by in effect adding back the M2 that has been pulled out of the yield curve to see what a corrected M2 would look like If you do that exercise, you find that this corrected M2 still has been growing probably at 2 to 2-1/2 percent since the fourth quarter; it's still near the lower bound So, that distortion does not explain all the slow growth, nor would I believe that all that disintermediation yield curve effect is benign I think it may have some impact The credit channel I believe is important, not just the money channel You can also, of course, just add back the growth of the [institution-only] money funds; that would get M2 growth up to about 4 percent When I look at those figures I don't see a case [for arguing] that we're too easy in those terms A more direct approach is to look at nominal GDP targeting; we have been experiencing and are projecting very low growth in nominal GDP Still, it seems to me that it's very hard to make a case that there's compelling evidence the economy is constrained by an overly restrictive monetary stance or lack of liquidity or rates that are too high So, I think it's quite difficult to gauge effectively the stance of policy Perhaps this does lend credence to the Chairman's alternative model of an economy responding to liquidity shocks rather than to a stable relationship with the monetary stance in a traditional sense  -31-    8/18/92  The other thing I would say is that in this environment I would agree with those who continue to argue that there are concerns about going too far I don't believe we have the ability to pursue aggressive fine-tuning effectively or to respond to a blip in the unemployment rate and avoid a bad quarter That may sound odd since we've come from 10 percent down to 3-1/4 percent on the fed funds rate; that sounds like contra-cyclical policy But I think the economy in the late '80s was growing rapidly, fed by debt and leveraging; and that process went into reverse to deleveraging and financial contraction And it's wholly appropriate for the nominal rate structure to decline dramatically just to maintain an appropriate stance of monetary policy, which is not overly restrictive but is still consistent with progress toward price stability I think that is what we've done in that adjustment We haven't yet gone too far If we do go too far, with the long and variable lags in monetary transmission mechanisms and the unreliable navigational aid of M2, we obviously risk losing an opportunity it has taken years to earn So, that's something to be wary of  A final reason to be concerned about our near-term policy is the long list of potential shocks and risks in the current environment Bob Black presented the litany of restraints I'd just like to mention some of the potential shocks and risks We have military situations--potential military action in Iraq and Bosnia- Herzegovina--fragility in markets in Japan, weakness in the economies, markets, and foreign exchange relationships in Europe, and in the United States we have the dollar, the election, and of course the stock market Moreover, I'm not at all sure we are completely out of the woods with regard to some of our large financial institutions So, one argument is that these are downside risks to be concerned about; another is that we might save a little ammunition Overall, the early returns on the July move are encouraging, especially in terms of the response of the long-term rate and another round of refinancing under way, which can help reduce [financial] burdens and accelerate the adjustments I think we should continue to learn about this unusual economic environment, to do research into the forces at work here, and to work at understanding them I would also argue that we need to be mindful of the risks, and I agree with those who suggest that the risks remain tilted toward the down side "
1526,1992-08-18," I think ""B"" asymmetric is the appropriate stance given the current environment and the changes we've seen I tend to support the stronger asymmetric stance "
1571,1992-10-06," We should probably do that!   On this issue, just a word on the perspective of the dollar being weak Some have suggested that it has held its value pretty well against commodities, but that's not really my area   We're running out of candidates for engines to pull the economy out of this One which reappears--you mentioned it and it is one of the few pluses in the outlook--is the prospect that the long bond rate might fall another 75 basis points or so as we move through next year Supposing in the post-election period it became fairly obvious that the prospects of a large fiscal package were quite high How would that be reflected in the long bond rate in the forecast?   Indeed, last year during the first-quarter debate [on fiscal packages] the long bond went up 60 basis points  -13-    10/6/92   Or at least we wouldn't get the 75 basis points decline; rates would stay constant   Don't you think the other forecasters will catch up in a few weeks once they grind through all the latest data?   Three percent for 1993?   Looking at the data--they've been pretty well discussed by a number of people--it's clear that our annual fall- winter swoon seems to be in full flower; it seems to be an annual event   Actually, one could say 1990 was not a walk in the park To me the data coming in are pretty consistently negative I thought the September employment report was worse than the August one because of the collapse in hours and the implications for personal income, spending, industrial production, and the like And virtually all the indicators for the real economy at least seem to be pointing south The Greenbook has translated this into 1 percent growth, roughly speaking, in the fourth quarter We can't really do anything  -32-    10/6/92  about that fourth quarter to speak of here, although we might think about the implications of the fourth quarter on attitudes and spending as we move into the quarters we can affect  The question has been raised a number of times The Fed has gone from a fed funds rate of almost 10 percent in '89 to 3 percent now and where is the impact? I think there has been an impact One can see it most clearly in the broad statistics on the banking industry; when you look at the entire industry compared to the fall of 1990 I think it has improved dramatically As Ed Boehne pointed out, though, there is a segment--and that segment is an economically significant one--which is finding this period quite difficult We don't need to go through the statistics, but I asked at the briefing the other day about the market value to book value ratios for the top 50 banks In December 1990, it was about 85 percent; they were showing 85 percent of book and now it's 150 percent So, I think there has been a big improvement there I believe the corporate restructuring is going quite well In fact, corporations are issuing commercial paper again, which suggests that they are moving right along The consumer side is the difficult side because consumers, unlike banks and corporations, can't issue equity And they have a long, tough process They've reduced debt burdens but it's not clear to me that the principal of the debt has been reduced So, I think there have been benefits but primarily in cushioning this process and moving it along One only has to look at the experience of economies that are going through this de-leveraging process without the benefit of a responsive monetary policy The UK would be a prime example; they've had more than two years of negative growth and 10 percent unemployment There are a number of economies like that, and I think there but for the grace of monetary policy goes the US economy Indeed, when you look around--we had a staff review of the industrialized economies around the world--the United States looks like the fastest horse or the best horse on a very sloppy track, and it's getting sloppier all the time I think monetary policy can be credited with the fact that we haven't had a very severe situation here I know all of this is cold comfort, but I think it's hard reality, and I'm glad I'm not running for election in this campaign We just have to admit that this restructuring process is severe, persistent, and long-lived and, indeed, for a consumer with excess debt, there's no quick and easy fix It just takes a long time of diverting resources to pay it down People are comparing this with short-term cyclical adjustments [but] as has been suggested, the process is long and severe And other countries are learning that as well  The next question is Would additional rate cuts have any substantive beneficial impact? It seems to me that there are sound reasons for believing additional actions would be beneficial-- beneficial to the growth of M2, which is still weak We'd certainly get another prime rate cut We're right on the cusp of a prime rate cut, and I do not expect that to unleash a wave of borrowing and spending It may be helpful to reinforce this recent very modest uptick in borrowing, but most pertinently it would reduce the debt burdens on firms and on individuals who have home equity loans tied to the prime rate Moreover, those who analyze the outstanding stock of mortgages at different interest rates project that a lowering of rates would ignite yet another significant round of mortgage refinancing And, of course, the market expects and seems to have priced in  -33-    10/6/92  additional action, so it wouldn't surprise anyone I might add that just because I believe the next shot will be a potent shot does not necessarily mean we should fire it Indeed, I'm not so sure about the [potency of the] shot after that and it might be nice to have a potent shot around I think the timing of any additional action is difficult  While the real economy is clearly decelerating and the deceleration has momentum, we do have a substantial slug of ease in the system The fed funds rate is down 75 basis points over the past three months As Governor Angell pointed out, the 30-year bond is down 50 basis points The 10-year rate is down 100 basis points in the last three months The dollar has fallen We've seen some pickup in M2; even with a yield curve adjustment, it's still probably below our lower bound, but that deceleration has stabilized And we have the slight hint of a pickup in credit demand Business loans at banks and at finance companies, commercial paper, and the debt aggregate all have shown some stirrings Now, of course, this could simply reflect a financing of the modest backup in inventories, but I would hope that is not the case So, we have some stirring in both money and credit growth and we also already have a refinancing boom in full flower now both in the corporate sector and in mortgages So, I think we do have some countervailing financial force already at work against the real economy And there is risk in moving in the current environment on the currency side as the dollar has fallen to new lows So has the long bond rate So, I think it's difficult to argue that this has ignited inflationary fears or flight of foreign investors so far But if we should move, I would acknowledge that there is some risk of destabilizing the dollar The hot money speculators are bulging with profits from their European escapades And if they did start an attack, who would stop it? Who would stand in the way of a run on the dollar? The Administration has not evidenced any strong concern over a weak dollar Central bank intervention has not been impressively efficacious in recent weeks, to understate the situation So it seems to me that there is some chance, however remote, that we could have a problem there, and that would be disruptive I agree with Tom Melzer that it might be difficult to get the genie back in the bottle because this [move] would be one which would infect the bond and stock market And that argues for a little caution So far it hasn't affected the bond and stock market as far as I see And, of course, there are other potential shocks and uncertainties looming in the pre- and post- election periods All of this argues for [some] caution and saving a little ammunition  There is also, of course, the very real risk of going too far This will turn around some day I have no persuasive evidence to support that statement [Laughter], but I do believe this will end Given the lags associated with monetary policy and the risk that headwinds could become modest tailwinds, we should not overreact to pessimism on the real economy Nonetheless, given the weakness in the real economy and the need to reinforce weak growth in money and credit if the current trends continue, we likely will be confronted with a persuasive case for a rate cut Indeed, I think the case is fairly persuasive now The timing and execution are difficult I tend to think it has been quite useful that we haven't moved in the past few days Nevertheless, there's some danger in being too cute on timing and losing momentum--and the momentum we have in the aggregates is real--and risking a severe deterioration We may be able to avoid a    10/6/92  rate cut if things start to firm; the timing of additional action is difficult and we need to discuss that In my own mind the appropriate policy stance is clear We ought to lean very hard toward additional action and be prepared to ease if confronted with more disappointing forward-looking data   I think there's a sufficient case for ease now but I can support [""B""] asymmetric In terms of what information to focus on, I think it will be useful to focus on money and credit flows and how those develop   I think there's a case for ease now but I--   I would go ""B"" asymmetric   ""B"" asymmetric   Yes   Yes   He [talked] me into it "
1634,1992-11-17," What is the benefit from that?   Well, I'm pretty much opposed to everything! In my opinion, it ain't broke, so I agree with Tom and Si and Bob I think the memorandum of discussion would be a good idea, but I don't see how we could keep it from FOIA or keep it from Congress if Congress requested it We somehow can't resist giving [bank] exam data or anything else So, even if they said it was going to be [released with a lag of] five years, I wouldn't believe them I do think it's an attempt to politicize the process--to identify and hold responsible those who have ""politically incorrect"" views  There is this notion of openness and the public's right to know There is this bias and voyeurism, which is becoming a constant in popular culture by a self-serving media as well as Congress But the notion of protecting the deliberative process is in the Sunshine Act; it's in FOIA When I was at Treasury, deliberative papers were exempt from the process When the President meets with his advisors on foreign policy or on economic policy, those deliberations are done in private And as you pointed out, Congress [conducts] its caucuses and negotiations [in private] I think one can see the difference in open versus closed Board meetings The quality of discussion and decisionmaking, because of the sensitivity of issues and market sensitivity, is far different when we have an open meeting versus a closed meeting So, I think this is entirely defensible under existing concepts, again against their bias  On the issue of early release, first, I'm also very skeptical of the notion that this would blunt political criticism We have a new Congress and a new Administration, and I don't like sending the signal that we're in the mood for change and that we're malleable I think we're in a pretty strong position starting out with those people It's a particularly poor idea to do something unilaterally-- to volunteer to turn ourselves in or to plead guilty At least we ought to make them work for it a bit! And it's too early in the season for gift-giving [Laughter] Releasing the policy record early I think would rob us of the asymmetric option There may be an argument that we've overused the asymmetric option, but that ought to be confronted directly  I also don't like the idea of announcing a federal funds rate change I don't like making announcements We're not good at making announcements First we have to be good at making the right decision and then we have to be good at PR The last time we really tried this was with the discount rate cut last December We said that it was going to be the last cut and that it was enough to sustain the recovery Since then we've cut the federal funds rate 100 basis points and the discount rate 50 basis points, and I don't think that added to our credibility The Bank of Japan always does this and they're ridiculed for it We have moved the federal funds rate a lot more than we've moved the discount rate I think one of the reasons  -64-    11/17/92  is because we make an announcement with the discount rate When we move the fed funds rate, it ends up on the financial pages; when we move the discount rate, it ends up on the front pages I agree with Governor Angell that we ought to keep our options open I would like to see more flexibility in the federal funds rate I don't know exactly why it is that making an announcement would reduce the frequency [of such actions], but I feel the evidence is pretty clear that it would So, my sense is that the process works pretty well We have a pretty good record of accountability, and I think that's why we receive so little criticism and why this has not been coming up as a big issue And it's not really just one Congressman To a large extent it is one staffer resurrected from that era in which this was an issue So, I think the right approach to take is to try to figure out what is best and not try to respond to pressure My view is that the current process works well "
1635,1992-11-17," Well, to follow on Tom's line of thought, the smoke has cleared We have three quarters in the books and the average growth for the first three quarters of 1992 is a shade under 2-1/2 percent And we've learned that the third quarter may be revised up to 3 percent, which would put us right at 2-1/2 percent   Or more I would submit that this is better than most economists expected at the beginning of the year It's certainly in line with our Humphrey-Hawkins forecasts and exceeds my Humphrey-Hawkins forecast It's also certainly better than the recent performance of other G-7 countries that are going through this adjustment period Indeed, 2-1/2 percent growth is even marginally better than potential It may be very depressing to the electorate to think about 2-1/2 percent growth, but over the long term perhaps we can raise the potential But [we can] point out that at least it's at that level Unemployment is down about 1/2 percentage point, although that has been pretty flaky and, of course, the performance is moribund compared with a traditional recovery I think it's because the underlying structural dynamics are far different and it's not especially valid to compare it to a traditional cyclical episode and inventory cycle This is simply a slower balance sheet adjustment process We've made measurable progress, as we've talked about, on that adjustment process but it's probably not yet completed As a result, I would agree that the immediate outlook is for slow growth We've had this lurching pattern between 1-1/2 percent and 3 percent quarterly growth Several weeks ago I would have thought the next lurching would be down toward the lower end of that range--at about 1-1/2 percent The data we've talked about here--the wide ranging data from retail sales to confidence numbers to industrial production --all suggest a bit more near-term strength than I would have expected a few weeks ago There's also this notion of a post-election upturn in confidence I would agree with Governor Lindsey in that I'm not confident that that's going to have much of an effect We saw in the UK that even with their post-election euphoria, which did lift the markets, consumers found they couldn't pay down their excess debt with confidence So, in general, I wouldn't argue with the Greenbook forecast of 2 percent for the fourth quarter, although I think it may be a bit stronger if anything Despite this ratcheting pattern, I think we are gradually, painstakingly, building a base of higher growth and are slowly emerging from this economic lethargy  The financial data in my view are consistent with this conclusion The firming of credit demands one can only call marginal, but at least it's there Consumer installment credit increased for the first time in my recent short memory And domestic nonfinancial debt, excluding the US government, has accelerated from growth under 2 percent a month on an annual basis to a bit over 3 percent That's nothing to write home about Short- and intermediate-term business credit has shown some strength as well That is in keeping with this slow, gradual pattern And M2 growth continues its gradual strengthening In the last three months it has grown at a rate above 4 percent; for the year its growth is only marginally below the low end of the range If one were to adjust it for the yield curve effect of flows to bond funds, it would be within the range; but then I    11/17/92  wouldn't know exactly what that would mean One could say the velocity increase is better established now and I'm equally confused about what that means Of course, we have no shortage of liquidity Ml growth has been 20 percent the past two months and 14 percent for the year I think both the economy and M2 may take another swoon especially with long rates up 30 to 50 basis points since September, the dollar higher, and the outlook for foreign economies much weaker than it was several months ago Of course, then there's the uncertainty associated with the fiscal stimulus This is likely to mean higher interest rates in the near term and maybe a slowing of the adjustment process and then, followed with a considerable lag, the fiscal stimulus Still, I think the prospects remain favorable for gradual improvement even in this uneven pattern  I thought it might be useful to look at where we are on inflation because I'm a bit concerned that we're likely to hear a lot about the drag on the economy that comes from the shift to a low inflation environment or low inflation regime I hear a lot of this in international discussions as well Despite last month's disappointing CPI, we've made very notable progress Core CPI has decelerated from 5-1/2 percent in the late '90 to early '91 period down to about 3 percent We've have commensurate reductions in the PPI and ECI; commodity prices are soft And if there's measurement bias in the CPI, actual inflation could well be in the 2 percent range So, on actual measured inflation, we seem to be relatively close to closing in on price stability The prospects for continued progress also look good on all measures, whether you talk about slack or money growth  Unfortunately, the Chairman has defined price stability for us as a condition in which inflation is not an important factor in economic decisions, and I think that's a correct definition But in economic decisions it's not always actual measured inflation that is important; it's inflationary expectations that feed into investment decisions, into the long rate, into labor negotiations and the like How have we done on inflationary expectations? Not well In the Michigan Consumer Survey, consumer inflation expectations for 5- to 10-year horizons have held steady like a rock at roughly 5 percent during this period Not only has it not come down appreciably but the level is probably double the level of recently measured inflation The resiliency of inflationary expectations also is apparent from the still relatively high level of long rates, which includes a premium that I think is above recently measured inflation and the outlook for future inflation I think this is understandable We've had 4 to 5 percent inflation since 1983; it's deeply imbedded in expectations; it will probably take more than a few good quarters to get it out of there So, despite the progress in reducing inflation, we haven't made much progress on inflationary expectations yet and that's necessary to achieve the benefits Moreover, I believe the dissonance between actual inflation and expectations creates difficulties of adjustment which affect the real economy I was at Tom's board meeting and one of the business people said--he put together a couple of comments--in effect that the employees base wage demands on inflationary expectations and he didn't feel he could pass [the higher wages] through [to prices] Businesses have to pay higher long-term rates Consumers, watching their home prices fall and their net worth fall with them, are not enamored of disinflation which they may view as deflation  -15-    11/17/92  So, the frictions associated with adjustment to the low inflation regime are in part responsible for the recent increase in criticism of price stability as the appropriate goal of monetary policy It was very popular in the 1980s when the economy was growing and after [the rapid inflation of] the '70s Now, we hear a lot of talk that a little inflation is not only not bad but beneficial I hear this talk around town from noted economists looking for jobs! We've seen recent articles questioning price stability in Business Week and the Economist, and I noticed in today's New York Times an article talking about the evils of deflation It's also apparent that it's under some threat Inherent in the gravitational pull of expectations is the risk of reverting to the 4 percent inflation that we've experienced for almost a decade That would be unfortunate since we've paid much of the price to get inflation down and many of the benefits are ahead of us, secured only with inflationary expectations In my view we're facing the critical period here with an improving economy, the prospect of fiscal stimulus, and very rapid growth in Ml which could turn into rapid growth in M2 and credit And I think we're entering a period of tension, a battle between actual inflation and expectations, with pressure to revert to 4 to 5 percent inflation and fulfill those expectations  So, near term I think it's important to be vigilant and guard against another swoon in M2 growth But we also need to be wary of the risks on the other side When this does turn around, it could turn around quickly and we could risk losing the hard-won gains we've achieved and we could be back at ground zero very quickly In particular, in terms of the upside risks, one can posit a scenario with the economy gradually improving to the 3 percent level next year, with the headwinds diminishing, with years of pent-up demand coming into play, and with a large fiscal stimulus that I think this Administration was elected to do I think the stimulus package will be augmented by pent-up demand in Congress That's likely to hit in late 1993 on top of an economy at 3 percent growth with credit demands picking up, turning narrow money into broad money and credit growth And it's not inconceivable to me that in late 1993 into 1994 we could have an unsustainably strong upturn that could pretty quickly eat away our sense of slack I view that as the medium-term problem, not the near-term problem I still would acknowledge in the higher long rates, the higher dollar, and the weakened world economy the downside risks in the current environment But we may soon be moving into the position where the upside risks could become paramount It does concern me that the new Administration and Congress still view this economy as one that is in recession, as if we had negative GDP growth It is important for us to keep in mind that we're at a 2-1/2 percent growth level and I think that argues for caution at this juncture "
1636,1992-11-17," In the mid-'70s For 10 years they had underestimated inflation   Media bias   On the ranges, I would prefer a cut [in the M2 range] to 2 to 6 percent, with a 4 percent midpoint I don't view that as the ending point in this long process I view it as where we are in the process now With a midpoint of 4 percent I'm thinking of inflation in the 1-1/2 to 2 percent range and real potential in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range A midpoint of 4 percent looks appropriate, given where we are in this process of moving toward price stability I know we may have a little trouble hitting it, but I think we should manage policy to try to hit the range rather than vice versa and I think we'd be pushing it a little if we went beyond that I like the orderly process  In terms of when to cut, I think the appropriate time to cut was last July That was the routine time The Fed cut [the M2 range] for the following year in the summer of '88 and in the summer of '90; and the summer of '92 was the time to cut it again We didn't cut it because of uncertainty about M2 It seems to me that [M2] is better understood now; I feel more comfortable with a decision to cut I don't think we're going to learn anything more I view it as more than technical The disinflation trend is much better established now than it was in July in my view, despite the recent CPI; and I think it's time to confirm that disinflation trend, secure it, and lock it in I do think it would add to our credibility if we were to go through another period of faltering M2 and cut rates if the economy should deteriorate There are a lot of political judgments with regard to the timing Some might view it as a bit sneaky to do it after the election with Congress out of town It might be more  -38-    11/17/92  orderly to do it in February If we do it in February, it will come in the face of the new Administration and its proposals on fiscal policy and might be viewed as a signal that we plan to offset those But my overall view is that this is a long-term range and a long-term strategy and it ought to be done above the fray; I like the strict rationale we used last July that then was the time to cut except for the uncertainty about M2 I view this as cleaning up old business, so I would have some preference for doing it now  As for the near term, the coordinated cut has some appeal, although it's not clear to me that the assessment of the economy I've heard around here gives a consensus for a reduction in the federal funds rate Still, I would prefer the asymmetric language The near- term negatives in my view are still quite pronounced and I think we ought to hold steady When we went to symmetric language in the spring of this year, I don't think we looked very good when second- quarter growth was decelerating from 29 to 15 percent I don't like the sense of flip-flopping, and it seems to me the upside risks further down the road have increased We've been through this increase in long rates and have seen the impact a number of times before and I think the very near-term risks, moving into the first half of next year, suggest that we not flip-flop at this time So, I'm for 2 to 6 percent and ""B"" asymmetric  There is an argument on the width of the range that Gary Stern raised My view is that we've had trouble enough with this and that there may be an argument for widening the range   We shouldn't vote it down   We could vote to consider it "
1689,1992-12-22," Well, I don't have much to add I agree with Larry that we've had a great year; we didn't know it   We didn't appreciate it We only learned about it in the last week or two, but we should take the next week off and celebrate I agree with Governor Angell that we should think about why we had such a good year It's certainly not money growth; the economy has been growing on velocity increases, whatever that is And it's certainly not employment growth either; the economy has been growing on productivity increases So, as best I can figure out, the economy has been running on fumes so far in '92 I don't think the numbers have changed much from what we expected earlier in the year even with the ups and downs So far growth for the year is only 26 percent, which is pretty good; and we probably will do a little better than that I suppose one of the motivating factors could be the election psychology One would hope that it would turn out better here than it did in the United Kingdom and other places where they've had that phenomenon I suppose there is the upside risk that Jerry    12/22/92  mentioned of sound budgetary policies at the federal level I guess I have a lot of confidence that that's not too great a risk [Laughter] We do seem to be lifting ourselves gradually out of the mire I see nothing robust even in these latest numbers and no real signs yet that we may be approaching an overly robust upturn The risk is that, despite the slack the staff talks about, we don't have nearly so much slack as after the last recession when unemployment was 10 percent and capacity utilization was probably 70 percent In terms of sustainability, I'll feel a lot more comfortable when we do get employment growth; also, some money and credit growth would be nice We probably have had some marginal tightening from the dollar and from the increase in short- and intermediate-rates as near-term inflationary expectations have fallen I also think the reduction in long rates could well be reversed very quickly once we see the character of Congress's pent-up demand for spending as this process gets started To me one of the interesting things we're going to have to face is the coming collapse of M2 growth again In February, the next time we meet, we could well have had two months of zero M2 growth and once again be back in that debate over what sort of policy we're following at the time we decide on next year's ranges I would just conclude by saying that we should take the rest of the week off and celebrate a job well accomplished! "
1690,1992-12-22," I support ""B"" symmetric and look forward to the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony when this becomes public at a time when we have had two months of zero M2 growth and are lowering our ranges! But I think, clearly, it's ""B"" symmetric We seem to be ascending toward an orderly growth path It's not at all inconceivable to me that the current rate environment is unsustainable If we do have a period of disinflation, bringing inflation expectations down and real rates up, I think it's more likely that we will need adjustments And obviously, if European rates come down, the dollar is likely to go up The ultimate target here is a [sustainable] rate environment In my view we ought to think about getting ahead of that with some modest adjustment if we see signs of trouble rather than risk waiting, in which case I think we really might need what my colleague, Mr Angell, has suggested So, ""B"" symmetric "
1744,1993-03-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman The topic is our subcommittee proposal for creating a new document called the ""Minutes of the FOMC"" The genesis of this proposal comes from the recent Senate Banking Committee hearing in which two senators, Senator Mack and Senator Riegle, stated that the Federal Reserve didn't even produce minutes for the FOMC I think to some of us this episode made it abundantly clear that the public, including important public policy officials, has very little appreciation for the quantity and detail of the material that we already release So, the subcommittee proposal would be to assemble in a convenient and easily accessible form, appropriately titled as minutes, all the information currently released on an FOMC meeting As you know, we issue the policy record with a press release But the Minutes of Actions, the other information currently produced, are simply placed in our FOIA office and are not accompanied by a press release; and they elicit very little public demand  So, the specific proposal is to release a merged document consisting of the Minutes of Actions and the Policy Record along with an Executive Summary under the title ""Minutes of the FOMC"" The hope would be that this approach would underscore the quantity and detailed nature of the information we make available The subcommittee feels that these materials do constitute and are appropriately described as minutes in the context of the use of that term by other organizations, both public and private So, there would be no change in the timing of release or in the nature of the contents of the document under our proposal Our suggestion is to initiate the proposal with the release this week of minutes for the February FOMC meeting As mentioned in the document, the February meeting minutes will be somewhat longer due to the organizational votes, but we thought it would be appropriate to start with the new annual cycle So, I would open for discussion the subcommittee's recommendation that we do this in the form described in our memo of March 17   I guess the reason we used the word ""minutes"" is because we think these are minutes as they include the Minutes of Actions and the Policy Record In terms of changes in timing, based upon the discussion the Committee had last time we did not propose any change in the timing This [new procedure] may focus people's attention more on the timing Norm, what are we proposing to do with respect to an explanation of what's going on?    3/23/93   Jerry   Tom   Mike   Yes, and the Committee has steadfastly opposed newness in most proposals It is true that this would represent a step forward in trying to communicate, and in its basic form our proposal is not supposed to be that It's supposed to be a better organization of what we do now and a better labeling to make it more accessible to people I think that's a useful distinction Si   Al   It's my understanding that we still will meet and consider issues as they come up It will be interesting to see what response, if any, there will be to this change Perhaps it will sharpen the issue of release time We will continue to test those issues With respect to the explanation, I think it would be useful if we had Joe Coyne's description available to people so we all sing from the same hymn book on that   The thing that seems inconsistent with future economic weakness explaining the long bond performance is the stock market and the quality spreads as well We have seen tightening of quality spreads both within investment grade and also among the below investment grade issues, and that's quite inconsistent with the notion of impending recession and doom "
1745,1993-03-23," In my view the economy is doing fine The way I view the capital market environment is that the performance of the long bond market suggests that participants are not looking for unsustainable robust growth and accelerating inflation As I look at the stock market it suggests to me that stock market participants are not expecting recession Again, the quality spreads would also raise questions there All this adds up to moderate growth in my view The reduction in long rates should sustain housing and business fixed investment We're starting to break through; there's some progress on employment in many parts of the country There is still plenty of  -22-    3/23/93  uncertainty with respect to the fiscal policy package and even more uncertainty about the health care package And, of course, there are nagging concerns about protectionism, Russia, and our trading partners I see many of these uncertainties posing risks down the road in '94 and '95 In '93 it looks to me as if the benign capital market environment we have should provide enough momentum We have the lowest interest rates in several decades and the stock averages are within whispering distance of their all-time highs despite the hits taken by drug companies and biotech companies and multinationals So, I view all of this as pretty consistent with moderate growth  With respect to inflation, we've made quite a bit of progress over the last couple of years and the underlying fundamentals suggest the likelihood of continued progress in gradually reducing inflation There is ample slack in the economy both on the labor side and in terms of capacity utilization Competitive conditions still seem tight We've seen no sign of an unsustainable surge in activity or in supplier delivery times, or other sorts of measures We have very subdued money and credit growth still Even M1 has decelerated, so there seems to be little monetary thrust to inflation So, I think we would all agree that the underlying fundamentals appear to be in place to sustain a continued gradual trend toward disinflation The only thing that doesn't agree is measured inflation itself, which seems to show signs of rising from the grave, apparently oblivious to the fact that the Greenbook has pronounced it dead! It's not just the two consecutive core CPI numbers we've had But in three out of the past five months core CPI has been 1/2 percent and over the past six months core CPI has been 4 percent We've had 4 percent inflation over the past six months versus 33 percent in the 12 months ended in December It's still early but, based upon these data, it's hard to convince oneself that we're safely gliding on the Greenbook path toward continued gradual disinflation It may be hard to reject the hypothesis that instead we're on the Blue Chip highway of a gradual return to 4 percent inflation Core PPI in the last two months was 41 percent and in the last three months 36 percent The purchasing managers' inflation diffusion index, which had been below 50 for many months, jumped above 50 last month Expectations survey data remain high It is true that the implied forward rates have come down on the 10-year bond, but so have foreign rates And the implied forward rates remain 200 to 300 basis points above those in Germany and Japan, and commodity prices are twitching The CRB is up; lumber prices are up Presumably this is due to the housing recovery, the spotted owl, and perhaps the paperwork requirements of FIDCIA! I'll leave more detailed analysis to my colleagues I think there's some reason to be troubled by these trends All of this could be an anomalous blip which will soon succumb to the disinflation forces described in the Greenbook Indeed, we've had a couple of these episodes before, most notably in the early parts of '91 and '92, which were swamped by the trend and soon forgotten What's different this time? It's already a bit longer-lived, six months at 4 percent It's not just a first- quarter phenomenon In the third quarter of '92 core CPI was 38 percent, which followed two quarters of 25 and 28 percent So, this may be a little more; it has some commodity price increases attending it and a growing economy now Still, I must admit that the notion of a reemergence of inflationary pressures is not confirmed by many other indicators such as precious metals; gold and other metals appear dead in the water The ECI appears well behaved and wage increases are unlikely to swamp productivity gains, so that should assure that unit  -23-    3/23/93  labor costs [will remain] in line And I can't detect inflation fears in the long bond market Of course, I don't think the long bond market foresaw the disinflation So it seems to me, given the relatively high implied forward rates, that the long bond market 5 to 10 years out may have been looking at 4 to 5 percent inflation during this entire period  I do think at some stage that we may have to decide how seriously we want to take this index, the CPI--whether we want to take it very seriously or mechanically in a price level targeting sense The Greenbook says not to worry Core CPI after all the hand wringing will come in at 31 percent in '93 and 27 percent in '94 And the market appears not to take the CPI seriously We know the index is not perfect; we've seen it made much like sausages and laws, which causes us to lose some respect for it Still, there is some bottom line credibility to measured inflation It's difficult to rebut with economic arguments saying it shouldn't be that high but it has been And there is some risk in putting our faith too long in economic fundamentals Before the next FOMC meeting we will receive two CPI numbers If those are poor, we will be facing a 6- to 8-month trend, an embedded trend, of core CPI in the range of 4-1/2 percent to perhaps close to 5 percent And I think that will raise significant concern that after all the progress of the past two years we may be back to where we started A more mechanical perspective that we might think about is If the near-term inflation outlook is really 4 percent or higher, as it has been over the past six months or so, then a 3 percent federal funds rate looks a bit low in terms of real rates It's hard to reconcile this with the negative M2 growth so far this year, but I think we should think about it If the Greenbook is right and we're really looking at 3 percent inflation, that's roughly a zero real rate; but if inflation is really 4 percent, as it appears to have been, then perhaps that's a significantly negative real rate  When I add this up I can't find a lot in the way of clear convincing evidence to be concerned about We have as many well behaved inflation indicators as misbehaving indicators Still, I'm slowly developing the uneasy feeling that if these trends are sustained for not too much longer, we're going to be forced to confront the difficult issue of whether we're satisfied with a return to 4 percent inflation--it may have arrived by the time we face this-- and whether that 4 percent inflation is consistent with our objectives Perhaps we're not there now but I'm increasingly concerned that the day is rapidly approaching when we will have to confront this issue There is a risk of getting behind the recognition curve I must admit that I don't relish confronting this issue in the current political environment I'd hate to have a national referendum on the issue much less a local referendum on it, but I do have the sense that, obviously, in some fundamental sense this is the job for the central bank And I'm getting increasingly uneasy that we may have to go to work soon   You can take other things out, too "
1746,1993-03-23," First, with respect to the rate adjustment, there's not only the question of tightening to restrain inflation; there's also the question of aligning the rate with what might be considered the observed rate of inflation, which has been 4 percent for the past 6 months, and 6 percent for the past 4 months It seems to me that there is some possibility that we've eased in real rate terms as this inflation rate has gone up; so, that's something to think about In general I am concerned that if we get a couple of bad [inflation] numbers, the market will respond And the market will also start to wonder whether we're still on the job I don't feel comfortable putting our faith in a quirky index with no persuasive economic logic as well as indicators on the other side There is some risk in putting [our faith] in fundamentals in the sense that we may reassemble in May and look back, if we do have a couple of bad numbers, on almost three quarters of an imbedded trend in core CPI at 4-1/2 percent But at this stage I would support the Chairman's judgment to ride this out a bit longer before responding and therefore hold off I don't know that there's much advantage in trying to signal with an asymmetric directive; we might as well make a judgment as we go along here So, I would support ""B"" symmetric and the alternative language   The last six months   Alternative language? "
1798,1993-05-18," With respect to the real economy, my sense continues to be that we're on a path of moderate growth I don't really see a change in outlook with the mean between 2-1/2 and 3-1/2 percent, but with individual quarters ranging from perhaps a bit below 2 to a bit above 4 percent The first quarter is pretty well explained, it seems to me, by the weather and the pullback from the surge in consumption We had a similar phenomenon last year As for the employment situation, I know there is a lot of negativism around it; but unemployment has come down from the peak last summer of 77 percent to 7 percent And even California's unemployment rate this last time came down to 86 percent; it had been up around 10 percent When I look at the monthly payroll numbers, I find it difficult to get too depressed The monthly average payroll growth in the third quarter [of last year] was 25,000; it was 85,000 in the fourth quarter, 147,000 in the first quarter of '93, and it eased off to 119,000 in April The overtime is at record levels and the employment gains are running at more than double what they were in the second half of last year So, I think this bodes well for durability and sustainability Auto sales seem to be holding up; the housing starts numbers were good this morning; there may be an inventory adjustment Confidence certainly has fallen back from the euphoria of late last year but it has stabilized at levels well above where it was, say, in October So, I guess people are buying housing and cars It's hard to become too convinced that we're headed for another serious swoon On the inflation watch, to paraphrase an old Ronald Reagan TV ad, last time the question was Is there a bear in the woods? As far as I'm concerned the inflation bear has been sighted--not by our staff I might add! [Laughter] I think they should not be allowed near the woods; I fear for their health  Well, it's a curious phenomenon we've been going through the past [several months] Perhaps it's a blip; it's a very long blip if it is a blip Now, I suppose there are many hypotheses I won't bore you with my own personal list It's not especially useful to have arguments saying this [upturn in inflation] can't happen with this set of economic fundamentals because that's pretty articulately rebutted by the fact that it has happened and has persisted for a number of months I feel pretty much the same way about the notion that basically the economy has to slow down for inflation to slow down It has been slow and we've had rising inflation I suspect inflation is driven mostly by expectations That's one of the reasons there's not so much talk about it; it's roughly what people expect  I do think we can affect inflationary expectations, at least in the market Since I think we have 4 percent inflation, I now see a couple of issues The first is whether a 3 percent federal funds rate is appropriate in this environment And, secondly, are we satisfied with 4 percent inflation? To focus on the first question, the more immediate question, I think no one is proposing instituting a restrictive policy to actually try to get on top of inflation in the  -35-    5/18/93  sense of positive real rates The only question that I can see is whether one might partially adjust the nominal rate to reflect the reality of higher inflation, leaving real short rates still lower than those prevailing last year But at some stage we're going to have to think about whether 4 percent inflation is something we want  I thought in the latter part of last year that there was some chance that if inflation continued to decelerate we could hold a 3 percent federal funds rate--that that would be sustainable The perception was that inflation was 3 percent and falling Now I have very serious doubts as to whether a 3 percent federal funds rate is sustainable It seems out of line; it seems to violate some basic tenets of common sense The last time we had a 3 percent federal funds rate was in 1963 This is not a 1963 inflation environment When one looks around the world today, the only other 3 percent short rates observed in captivity are found in Japan And their economic environment in terms of fundamentals is clearly as sluggish as ours, if not more so But we are not in a Japanese inflation environment Their inflation is on the order of 2 percentage points below ours Obviously, we had a lot of opportunity to choose a federal funds rate 1 percent below the inflation rate last year and chose not to do it I would suggest that the result of the negative real short rates in the 1970s was not pleasant So, I rather doubt that anyone parachuting into this economic environment would choose a 3 percent federal funds rate Now, perhaps real short rates don't matter, at least in a weak economy We certainly instruct the weak economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union that the one thing they have to do is to get that nominal rate at about, or a little above, the inflation rate We certainly felt that significantly positive real rates made a lot of sense in late 1990 and early 1991 [even] with negative real GDP growth because of concerns about price stability However, without the aggregates to guide us, I think it's also a pretty visible and simple measure which people may focus on I wish we had the aggregates to guide us; we don't know what is happening to the hypothetical, shadow M2 I suspect it may be growing pretty rapidly, given the volume of funds going into the stock market It is true, clearly true, that we don't understand the transmission mechanism well But I don't believe the lack of thorough understanding should lead us to ignore what seems apparent to me namely, that 3 percent short rates seem quite a bit out of line So, I don't have a lot of doubt that we're going to feel that the 3 percent needs changing The question is one of timing, and my argument is for sooner rather than later  The concern is that as people start to look at the recent inflation performance, it stands in direct contradiction to our publicly stated objectives It also stands in visible contrast to the FOMC's inflation forecast of 2-1/2 to 3 percent issued only a few short months ago in February If we stand by while measured inflation shreds our publicly stated convictions and forecasts, the concern I have is that the long rate will continue to rise As Governor Angell mentioned, we've already lost 25 basis points As inflation concerns fester, I think long rates will move on up And in my view perhaps the market needs a signal that we're not going to allow this to get out of hand, that we actually do care about inflation and that this caring goes a bit beyond just the rhetoric We lagged the market on the way down and I thought that conserved credibility But in the opposite direction if we wait until we're dragged up by the market, I  -36-    5/18/93  think that will extinguish credibility A measured response could limit the damage on the long end of the market To me this is important not just for long-term concerns but for near-term growth as well The only component of the current environment that is stimulative or conducive to growth is the capital market environment and in particular the long bond rate My concern is that, with rising inflation unchallenged by the Fed, the long end could deteriorate quite rapidly Ultimately, it's not up to us whether we tighten or not The markets are going to tighten on the long end as people focus on the inflation and start thinking about it And that's going to have whatever impact on the economy higher long rates will produce We can't do anything about that What we can do, and about the only thing we can do, is to try to limit the deterioration in the long end by indicating that we're on the job I think the long rate would likely move up a bit if we made a measured move But if credibility matters at all, somehow at the end of the day when all the dust settles the capital market environment and growth prospects should be better compared to a situation with Fed inaction  So, I think a lot is at stake not only the credibility [of] long-term success but the capital market environment [of] near-term success The risk of waiting too long is that market participants will start to focus more and more closely on inflation They will look back not just to the beginning of the year but to the fourth quarter as well They will look at our forecasts and our statements, and the market will start to price in concerns and hypotheses about Fed inaction And I believe this could do serious damage not only to credibility but to long rates, [including] mortgage rates, and to the near-term outlook  To summarize, I do see a changed environment There is no compelling evidence of any change in the outlook for growth; I think we're still sort of in the middle there We have a very different inflation environment than the one we thought we were in, one in which inflation has been running much higher And the question is Does the same federal funds rate of 3 percent make sense with no material change in the outlook for growth, which is the way I see it, and an environment of much higher inflation? It seems to me that if it made sense in the old environment, it doesn't make sense in the new one And my preference would be to face up to this sooner rather than wait until the market takes it out of our hands "
1799,1993-05-18," What's been happening to M2 plus flows to funds?   Thank you   It has gone up 25 basis but not entirely due to this, necessarily   The argument was that it's better to move from a symmetric directive, that there's nothing to be gained from--   We have to tell them what the fed funds rate is!   Yes, we noticed   I was going to make the point that President Corrigan made I think an asymmetric directive captures at the minimum where we should be And I see no down side from it; we can only look good If things get better, it says at least that we were concerned about [inflation] and were focused on it It also says the same thing, as Jerry mentioned, if things get worse If we don't have [an asymmetric directive], then I think it says that somehow we were not attuned to or did not recognize the situation   It's event driven  -45-    5/18/93   And I think it's worse if inflation gets better because then, looking back, people will wonder Shouldn't they at least have been on watch? Again, I just see no down side Last time perhaps there was a down side in the sense of alerting people I don't think it affects process at all but instead will communicate, though not for quite a while But it will communicate the right things   I agree with what Gary Stern said I guess I'm less concerned than Ed Boehne is about the notion that we might be viewed as trigger happy We haven't been close to a trigger in months This may be temporary, but seven months is a pretty long temporary time as far as I'm concerned It is true that we wouldn't be restraining anything or countering anything if we moved because I doubt that we would get ahead of inflation since it has already moved But at least we might be catching up in the sense of reflecting the higher inflation in nominal rates When we talk about moving a small amount, we ought to be realistic about what sort of potential impact it could have on the economy I don't think there's anything sacred about 3 percent rates The yield curve has been upward sloping for quite a long time now, since people have been expecting higher rates And the real short rate would still be negative and lower than it was last year So, I wouldn't be opposed to moving now At least we should be asymmetric We ought to be clear on the risk of waiting too long here, and that risk is that we will have to make precipitous moves down the road And if you want to think about the consequences for the economy and the flak we're going to receive if we wait a bit long, I think it's useful both for signalling and also for execution that we be asymmetric now "
1850,1993-08-17," Mr Chairman, I would nominate for the position of Vice Chairman a person amply qualified to fulfill the recent Irish tradition, even if he speaks clearly, Bill McDonough "
1851,1993-08-17," What about Medicare?   I wanted to make sure you had included that   Thank you, Mr Chairman I appreciate that tax instruction from Governor Lindsey, since I guess the date just passed for extensions!   The thing I've noticed on the tax return is that box at the top where it says if you check this box $1 will go to the presidential election campaign fund and it will not increase your taxes I'd like them to take the rest of my taxes from wherever they get that! And the other provision I think we should have is that every Congressman should be required to fill out his or her own return to get the flavor for it  I think the economy has been pretty well discussed, no pun intended The '93 GDP has been revised down because the first half was weak We had a weak second quarter, a weak first half With growth in the first half at a rate of only a little over 1 percent, it's difficult to be too enthusiastic about this kind of performance It looks a little better, maybe, if we average the fourth quarter with the first quarter and think of that as one And it might look even better, although not so much on the Greenbook forecast, if we take the second quarter and the third quarter together, but I will withhold judgment on that Certainly, when we look at the second quarter more closely, it is a more positive picture Spending did hold up quite well Despite all the talk about consumer pessimism, consumer spending advanced at almost a 4 percent annual pace; the personal saving rate dropped again And we continue to hear the talk about business pessimism concerning spending and hiring Business fixed investment advanced at a 13 percent annual rate in the second quarter amid this pessimism And payroll employment, which I continue to hear is very weak, is running at a 2 million job pace for the year, double the number of jobs added last year, which in my view has to provide some measure of downside protection Even if the jobs aren't great, the unemployment rate is almost a percentage point lower than it was last year at this time It's 68 percent or 685 percent; and ex- California it's 64 percent but I guess that's unfair The recent evidence on housing is a bit mixed, but on balance it suggests some acceleration in the housing expansion The Mortgage Bankers Association survey of purchase mortgage applications is very positive as are homebuilders' assessments of current sales Even though starts  -20-    8/17/93  were down a bit this morning, permits were up a bit; and it seems to me that for the first half of the year starts were up about 10 percent over last year  So, I think the hard evidence is still consistent with moderate growth, and we've had six quarters [averaging] 2-1/2 percent Nonetheless, there are perhaps a few clouds on the horizon or at least hints of haze that have appeared on the scene The first is this auto story We have had a little easing in the auto sales And I think this is the first sign in hard spending data of perhaps something going on Now, there is a special story--the inventory shortage It's also true, as I think the staff has pointed out, that non-auto sales seem to have picked up if we look at the control category I must admit that this is an extreme form of product substitution If you can't find the car you're looking for, you buy a sofa   I don't have to answer that! Still, I think the auto easing may be the first sign of something going on The other warning sign continues--   Yes We've now had four or five consecutive reporting periods where auto sales have backed down a bit I think there's enough noise going on and enough parts of the country under water and the like to take that too seriously But before auto sales were a positive [factor] People were buying cars and it was something that refuted concern And this, it seems to me, is the one thing that has backed off a bit  The other thing is that both consumer and business confidence continue to recede on surveys What is new in the Michigan survey is that the decline is concentrated in consumers' assessments of current conditions, not vague fears about expected conditions which had propelled the earlier declines Now, the current conditions index is still about 10 points above October of last year, but it had held up pretty firmly until very recently When I total it up I still see self-sustaining momentum of moderate growth And if the last six quarters were 2-1/2 percent, it seems to me it ought to average a bit stronger than that  The fall in long rates should reinforce this momentum and should cushion, if not entirely offset, the fiscal drag Another thing we haven't talked much about is that the deleveraging head winds continue to diminish even to the extent that some have started to note--and we picked this up in a number of different settings--signs of the beginning of speculative excess in stock prices, especially the weak stocks [We've seen] very low IPO volumes, the lowest in 15 years, low quality spreads on bonds, and very low spreads on junk bonds And all of this has occurred without the realistic prospect of robust growth, which usually accompanies these sorts of developments Some people also suggest, and it may be less likely in my view, that financial institutions' attitudes toward lending may have been easing up a bit We can see things like land prices starting to get a little  -21-    8/17/93  better We talked about this yesterday at the briefing The Chairman pointed out that so far at least there is not a lot of evidence of net credit flows to fuel these speculative concerns But I would point out that these factors do provide coincident indicators of easier conditions in the financial system  With respect to inflation, I think there are two useful perspectives the path of contemporaneous inflation and the medium- to longer-term outlook With respect to contemporaneous inflation, what a difference a meeting makes! The last time I said the good news was that inflation had been low two out of the past three months; now it's four out of the past five months As Al mentioned, the core CPI was 24 percent over the past five months compared with 46 percent over the previous five months Inflation in that 10-month period since the end of the third quarter of last year is now 3-1/2 percent This pattern of acceleration and deceleration over that period of a couple of quarters is also generally reflected in most of the broad- based inflation measures and even reflected in commodity prices, albeit over a different timeframe as you'd expect And I think this is consistent with speed effects interacting with expectation effects Indeed, I wonder whether speed effects are inherently ""expectative;"" it may not be two separate things going on there If this is the good news, I think the bad news is that inflation apparently has settled down in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range That is somewhat higher, perhaps 1/2 percent or so higher, than we would have expected earlier this year; and that keeps alive this medium-term issue of the alignment of rates  The Chairman said nothing about targeting real interest rates, and I would agree that they're not simply amenable to targeting I think looking at real rates provides a rough conceptual framework which provides insight on some things, one could say, at the edges of it When you look at that issue today you still see that rates look pretty low The Board's staff has these simple models suggesting that short-term real rates are 2 to 3-1/2 percent below a neutral stance, where a neutral stance is defined as their estimate of the equilibrium real rate One shouldn't ask about the standard errors!   Yes, they estimate real rates currently 2 to 3-1/2 percent--   Percentage points   --below their estimate of the equilibrium real short-term rate, which is currently zero   And they estimate the real short rate equilibrium may be 2 to 3-1/2 percent--with a standard error of 5 percentage points! [Laughter]  -22-    8/17/93   Which has shifted it around I would not suggest that there's any precision here I think it does suggest that by historical standards rates continue to look pretty low With the possibility of some net fiscal drag from the budget deal, even net of the lower long rates, a stance on the accommodative side of neutral seems not inappropriate The question is how accommodative and to what extent we might be asking for trouble down the road Certainly, since inflation has receded there's no evidence of harm currently--no compelling evidence of damage yet, of building pressures of credit flows gathering momentum even though we might have some of these speculative excesses in financial asset pricing Still, the absence of currently observable pressures doesn't give me too much comfort [given] the policy lags We saw how quickly slack can disappear in the second half of last year And once the pressures are truly observable and supported by fundamentals, it's pretty late in the game, requiring more precipitous adjustments and risks and economic adjustments as well  So, looking to the medium term, I still think it's in everyone's interest to achieve a sustainable stance, one which supports economic growth but does not seem destined to require substantial adjustment timed with flawless precision to avoid instability I think we're good, but I wonder how good we are in timing that We may be very, very fortunate and back into such a decision if inflation continues to collapse I think more likely than not we have a bit of work ahead of us Now, overall, I do think this episode has been useful and quite successful I don't know that I would go so far as to suggest that the upturn in inflation has yielded to the stinging lash of an asymmetric directive That may be a little extreme However, I do think we've educated the markets here; one need only read the assessments of economists and market participants and perhaps look at the record low 30-year implied forward rates to demonstrate that we've educated the market It may strain credibility to suggest we've educated the political system; I wouldn't suggest that We may have made some inroads there as well, though; at least the message has been delivered All involved seem to have a better understanding of the Fed's attitude toward inflation, our commitment to price stability; they understand that we do not find 3-1/2 to 4 percent inflation acceptable Even though no shots were actually fired, I think we laid down some useful groundwork in this episode  I'd just close by saying that it may be a bit more tricky in the months ahead The upturn in inflation and our response, as Tom mentioned, likely preempted talk and expectations of Fed ease to offset the budget deal With inflation now ""under control"" at 3-1/2 percent, a very weak first half, and a budget deal enacted in law, I feel that sort of talk is likely to emerge I've already heard some talk about monetary gridlock The Fed on hold for a year while the economy inches along While Congress and the Administration have done their part, some may look to us now So with the backdrop of an already very accommodative stance in my view, looking medium term the risk is that that may entail [difficulties] down the road And with a new cloud or two drifting onto the economic horizon, I safely predict an interesting period ahead  -23-    8/17/93 "
1852,1993-08-17," We did it last year   We did it in '92, maybe in May; we went symmetric for a time after being asymmetric   Yes, and then once the second-quarter [data] came in and unemployment went to 78 percent we went symmetric   Just a technical point In your discussion of real long rates, you were not talking about the nominal rate minus the observed inflation rate, correct?   Over that 30-year period!   Yes, it has to be the same duration So, what we're talking about is something that is completely and entirely unobservable?   It's tough to go out 30 years in a survey! There is a routine just to take the long rates and subtract off the current inflation rate   Yes   Yes, it means something Some people use that as the real rate and it is important to keep that straight So, given that recent inflation has been about 3 to 3-1/2 percent and certainly the average over the past 10 years has been 4-1/2 percent or so and the average over 20 years is worse than that, probably embedded in the 30-year rate is an expectation higher than the current inflation   Yes, they're 5-year maturities   And the guy who is now at Dreyfus--   He doesn't do [a survey] anymore?   That's 10 years?  -31-    8/17/93   We have no CPI link, bond, or instrument that we could [use to] back out the implied--   Okay   Thank you   Well, first on the rate response, I think it's not all that clear that the market is responding negatively to the information, even short term Our staff did an analysis of nine information releases, and I think they proved that when evidence is released in the market that the Fed is likely to raise the federal funds rate, short-term rates go up This astounding result was [unintelligible] and it has proved conclusive It's less clear what happens to long rates with these nine events, especially if we look at the forward rates So I think we might take a look at that and not read the summary of it because the way I see it 10-year forward rates 7 days after were off 10 basis points And the 1-year forward rate was up 12 basis points Now, I know they're declining rates It's also biased by one or two events But I think that question is a bit up in the air  -36-    8/17/93   Yes   Well, it's not clear to me that you'd expect that because you are reducing long-term inflation expectations but you might be increasing the long-term real rates   Don, how do we do that? [Laughter]   You're right, but it should come down It is not apparent to me that one would necessarily see that in the instantaneous response of traders, with all due respect to traders It may depend more on their inventory positions This is worthy of study The best information comes out early [unintelligible] releases Once you get expectations and people leaning, all you're talking about is differences in what happens versus what people anticipated would happen   You also get the other sort of signalling effect, that this suggests that the economy is stronger   Particularly in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, some people concluded that this was the first time policymakers in Washington had admitted that we were not on the edge of an abyss, holding our breath that at any time this growth could fall away Anyway, that's an interesting topic We had the same thing on the other side If we are that concerned [and] cutting rates, doesn't that mean things are really weak?   The bottom line is that I, too, prefer returning to symmetric at this time In my view there's no question, though, that the probability we will tighten in the intermeeting period is greater than the probability we will ease in that period It comes out to two epsilons versus one epsilon! Unfortunately, neither probability rises to the absolute threshold that warrants an asymmetric directive in my view If we went asymmetric it would be purely cosmetic For me the last two asymmetric directives have not been cosmetic, the last one in particular With two months of CPI and PPI and the ECI and the other quarterly data to be published during that intermeeting period, if the bulk of that data had come in very disappointing, it would have been a compelling case in my view for a move I don't feel the same way this time As a rule, I don't like cosmetic directives and in general do not favor trying to jawbone markets I think directives should reflect an accurate portrayal of our assessment of the situation and of the probability we are going to find it necessary to move in the intermeeting period So, I agree that we should declare victory, at least temporarily  I do see two problems The first is this feeling that we are asymmetric medium term But that's not what the [operational paragraph of the] directive is about The second problem is that this could be viewed as a negative signal, as Governor LaWare noted Indeed with a weak first half, the budget deal, and no inflation problem--officially now--some will choose to portray the move to symmetry as renewed concern about deterioration in the economy I'll also make a wild prediction that before long there will be talk of the need to ease, to do our part as part of this process I think it's a bit tricky I agree that how we portray this is important; [it should be portrayed] as a response to a deceleration of inflation which has reduced the possibility that we're going to have to move in the intermeeting period I would say that it's important [to do that] without backing away from the groundwork we've laid concerning the importance of continued disinflation So, while I still have this viewpoint over the longer term, I do agree that the appropriate stance today is to return to symmetric "
1899,1993-09-21," We've probably talked enough about the model, but I thought I'd kick it a few times as well What bothers me is not just that it's sort of transparently nonsensical and violates enormous evidence which has been accumulated on the way markets work, [including] market efficiency I don't think one needs too extreme circumstances to realize that the model may capture what is happening over some period But it can't be what is happening [now] I take it that if we continue to run this model, with the backward-looking nature of the model, as you say, the long rate pierces 5 percent And I've noticed Michigan mean inflation expectations have often been around 5 percent, so basically it is a real possibility in this model that it will drive long real rates negative   But the expectations in the market are a little different than ours   What I was going ask is this Short rates roughly track inflation, so suppose you included with the model some    9/23/93  measure of inflation and the formation of inflation expectations Would that take all the predictive power away from the model? Essentially what we've gone through is a period of gradually falling inflation expectations, with a little turn up, but associated with an upward movement in short-term rates and then a reduction and again a gradual [unintelligible] If you had some model of inflation expectations to see whether this interest rate model has anything other than that driving it, what would you get?   The reason I say it's nonsensical is because it doesn't make logical sense You know you can take the short rate to zero and it's not going to work You get ridiculous answers out of the model   Plus there appears to be a lack of evidence on the way markets incorporate the data that are available, which makes one think that what it is picking up is some other process When one hears what people talk about when they set long rates, they talk a lot about inflation over long periods of time So perhaps it is somehow capturing that process It may be a good model which implicitly is capturing this inflation expectations process It seems to me a little questionable when we start to reach these levels; when you project that going forward for a couple more years, you run the danger of getting pretty interesting [results]   Of course, it's not inconceivable if we get inflation down to the level that we had in the early '60s, which was 1 percent on the measured CPI   Yes, then you can move that rate on down I would just say that it's not clear that is what is driving--  -10-    9/23/93   Well, why is it that all the survey data show the opposite?   But that's another theory that I don't know if we want to get into as well   I knew you were going to say that! The only other thing I would say is that if you look at the '70s, a period in which perhaps short rates weren't appropriately set to track inflation, you might separate what was going on to see whether it was a formation of inflation expectations or this backward-looking model   Well, Larry Lindsey talked about neighborhoods and Bill McDonough talked about the world; I guess that leaves relatively little in between, although there are a lot of things in common Bill McDonough suggested that some of the problems have to do with the and I have no doubt that that's the case; but  That's probably not all of it I think it has a lot to do with the nature of this environment in which it's just a very difficult political job, and no one has been very successful because of the adjustments we're going through and the economic sluggishness And we've had it far better than most countries Patience with political systems has already run out, and numerous incumbent governments have fallen Just to extend Ed Boehne's intuition, I would be a little concerned if the patience were to start to run out with central bankers around the world Central bankers have done a pretty good job during this period We have had a pretty impressive turnover in leadership in the world's central banks, with a lot of the seasoned, very credible personalities moving on  Turning to the domestic side, I see very little new information to alter the views that I've stated a number of times The revisions in the GDP data reinforce my view that the forces of moderate expansion seem well entrenched One can certainly see this for the last six quarters--the last year and a half--which have  -30-    9/23/93  averaged 3 percent real growth The last four quarters have averaged 3 percent It is true that 1993 is weaker; we'll wait nine months to see what it really is, just as we had to do with 1992 as Governor Angell pointed out I think the patternthis year is in part due to the unsustainably robust fourth-quarter 1992 growth of 57 percent It was natural to have a pullback in the first quarter If you take those two quarters together, there was still 33 or 34 percent growth; they are still on this moderate path But [the swing] created an inventory adjustment problem, which affected the second quarter and meant that was only about 2 percent; but still PCE in the second quarter and final sales grew more than 3 percent The forces seem to be there  And I see no shocks to knock us off this--even the fiscal package--given the offset on interest rates and given the rather modest structural reduction in deficits The third-quarter Greenbook projection is again for meager growth, 12 percent I think that is about what it was last year at this time--maybe precisely what it was --for the third quarter of 1992 In fact, in the September 1992 Greenbook the projections for both the third and fourth quarters were between 1 and 2 percent as we headed into a 4-1/2 percent half I'm not suggesting that's going to happen I would suggest that even in the Greenbook's forecast the underlying forces of expansion seem to me to be well in place Consumption is projected to grow more than 3 percent; business fixed investment is continuing to grow at a reduced but still healthy pace Housing growth is expected to pick up and I think accelerate in the future Even with slow exports and government spending, final sales are projected to continue to grow at roughly a 3 percent pace The low growth in the third quarter projected in the Greenbook is due solely to adjustments inventory adjustments, crop losses, and the auto inventory adjustment So, it's an odd picture We could have the first three quarters of 1993 come in at 13 percent Yet, when I look at it underneath--the bottom line numbers--the underlying growth in demand seems consistent with moderate growth in the future roughly of the same order of magnitude that we've had in the past  It seems to me that sentiment as measured by the Michigan survey has plateaued at a level well above that prevailing in October of last year In October we were just headed into a 57 percent quarter, you'll recall And the current conditions are also above that entire fourth quarter of last year It is a little troubling that the longer-term outlook continues to sour in the Michigan survey August payroll [employment] was weak; the overall employment data still seem to reflect steady though gradual improvement Initial claims continue to ease; the strong hours suggest pent-up labor demand I continue to hear that payroll jobs are weak; they've grown by 17 million in the last 12 months and 12 million in the last 8 months And the household survey, once you make the adjustment, seems to give the same sort of picture even though it uses an entirely different methodology  So, I think this is all consistent with steady momentum Diminishing deleveraging head winds have been replaced in part by fiscal drag but countered by substantial easing in the capital market environment, and the dollar has eased some as well It's interesting that the long bond yield has come down 50 basis points in the last month Real long-term rates when you use the Michigan long-term  -31-    9/23/93  inflation expectations or the Philadelphia one are starting to get to quite low levels On inflation, I think Governor Phillips is right; the PPI has performed remarkably well; it's up only 7 percent over the entire 12 months Of course, ex tobacco it's up 2 percent! So, smokers are approaching price stability! [Laughter] I think the health care plan may well take care of that It is down a bit ex tobacco and maybe that's not quite fair But I think it is clear that even with that adjustment we have made some progress The higher- than-expected CPI we had recently for August did remind us that the bond markets still notice these things; they backed up a bit Core CPI for the year to date is up at a rate of 33 percent, the same as for the 12-month period and the same as it was at the end of last year It's an interesting 12-month period, though, because it consists of the most recent 6 months with core CPI at 25 percent and the previous 6 months at 4 percent I think this pattern of a run-up in inflation that we saw is easier to understand with the revised GDP numbers when we realize just how explosive growth was in the latter part of 1992 and why people might have tried to return to passing through 4 percent price increases And once it was clear that growth was going to moderate, the increases didn't stick It's not at all clear to me where we go on inflation now Commodity prices are again subdued only if we include oil prices They still show a bit of an upward pattern without oil prices Now, the Administration has inflation flattening and turning up gradually despite ample projected slack It stabilizes once the slack has disappeared, but while there's plenty of slack in the economy inflation continues up   Well, it's interesting that they appear to suggest that our current interest rate environment is unsustainable because they do show interest rates increasing to levels above the inflation rate pretty quickly next year Next year they show a Treasury bill rate above the inflation rate and then moving on up Again, with the slack, I don't see why we shouldn't expect the disinflation trend to be re-established I think that should be our objective and I hope we will get there Of course, rates are still quite low now, both short and long rates I think the financial system has eased and that monetary policy is doing what it can do to support growth We're still pumping out the liquidity M1 growth is 12 percent and is projected at 11 percent for the year M2 plus bond and stock funds has accelerated to 6 percent growth in the second quarter and 7 percent in the third quarter Governor Phillips mentioned that nonfinancial, non-government debt has gradually increased; it's growing at a rather moderate level So, I think we're still sort of pushing it I see no convincing evidence that we've gone too far By the time we see such evidence, we'll probably be a bit late So, I feel there's very little new to add The economy still seems to be on track and I think we still will likely face some challenges on monetary policy, and we should try to stay focused and conscious during this period "

1960,1993-11-16," They're old jokes   And I assume the Archivist agrees that that would be appropriate?   I have several questions With respect to the subpoena you mentioned, what does the process in the House require--a simple majority of a quorum?   Okay, so what is a quorum?   So it's 50 percent, so it takes a little over--   It takes a little over a quarter of the Committee You mentioned that in the House this subpoena authority has been delegated to all committees In no case has it been delegated to an individual chairman?   Okay   But in theory, a committee could delegate it to the chairman?   Okay Just as a technical point Have we received any correspondence or request for this material from any other member of Congress or other government officials?   Mostly scholars?   They're interested mostly in '76 and '77?  -18-    11/16/93   Okay In talking with the Archivist, what is the process in other parts of government where sensitive information and transcripts are kept routinely, as they are kept presumably by the National Security Council or the like?   When?   It has to be turned over in 30 years?   Do we know what the State Department does or what the White House does? What is the process in White House meetings with senior staff discussing sensitive foreign policy or economic matters?   Okay Finally, I'd like to explore your thinking, Mr Chairman, of going forward with an MOD versus some sort of edited transcript Of course, we do have a long history of MODs and we would link into that But I wonder if an edited transcript does not have the sense that it's less sanitized, more dangerous to release, easier to defend I suspect that in the National Security Council's deliberations and the like transcripts exist; that seems more like the sort of thing other sensitive parts of government would have whereas an MOD to me sounds a bit more sanitized, safer to release It sounds a bit like minutes--not that I think this is a big difference--and might be marginally harder to defend when they come after us, as they will Was there any special reason for recommending an MOD as opposed to something like an edited transcript going forward if in fact, as I take it, the substance of it would be exactly the same?  -19-    11/16/93   So that's not based upon any strong opinion?   With the edited transcript we might provide some sense that we're being more forthcoming even though it conveys the same information as the MOD Okay, thank you   Most everything has been said, but I think the key objective is to try to create a situation going forward which does not compromise the deliberative process I don't think the options are very attractive, but I thought I'd put it through one last reality check just so we're aware of the consequences of what we're doing As I see it, going forward, it's unrealistic to believe that either an MOD or edited transcripts with attribution of views can be protected Even with legislation--and we've talked about that--it can't be  -35-    11/16/93  protected from Congress Especially when we start to raise rates Congressional critics can subpoena it We've seen it even with the legislative protection on examination reports There are criminal penalties if examiners release information; Congress can get it And by the way when [the subpoena] happens, I think the objective will be to identify the agitators And then I think it's not unrealistic to expect that members of Congress might write letters to individual Committee members who expressed strong views and perhaps call them to testify; they will basically zero in and apply pressure  Obviously, I think this would do very substantial harm to the deliberative process Even at the Board we have open and closed meetings now and the quality of the process is quite different just as it would be here, I suspect The quality here would change, even if it didn't change immediately It would just take one of these episodes The future is a long time and I think this is quite certain to happen I feel safe in saying it's quite certain to happen because the future is a long time and I can't be disproved! If you think about it, first of all the character of some of these [Congressional] committees is changing through time, and changing in a way which I think makes it more likely or easier to get a subpoena And if one thinks about the rate scenario we might be facing in the near-term future, much less what the Fed went through in the late '70s and early '80s, as soon as we start doing MODs or edited transcripts for release going forward basically the deliberative process is put at risk And the die is cast when that happens It's very difficult to try to put a stop to it once it gets going; and sooner or later it will be compromised, although I suppose we can try to fight  Is there any way to avoid this? Ideally I would like a process in which we're not harboring secrets because I think the harboring of secrets in our files--documents which are kept secret for years--is an irresistible attraction to political opportunism It gives us the bad image of having things to hide And there may be no politically feasible way to avoid this My first preference, clearly, is to have a process of extensive minutes--enhanced minutes which capture the full discussion, including all the issues and all the arguments but without attribution And I'd release it immediately, six weeks after the meeting, or whatever time it takes to produce it I think this could be managed under the Federal Records Act Basically we would have no taping but we would have note-takers The note-takers also would have to avoid giving attribution Now, in the political process when you compare that--basically the full discussion [in the form of enhanced minutes without attribution] produced very quickly--with an MOD and the promise of a full discussion with attribution later, it seems to me the only [significant] difference is the attribution And the only reason why one would prefer the attribution is to bust open the process and find out who's doing what early on And that certainly may be the objective of some of our harshest critics But it's not clear to me that the bulk of Congress would favor that, especially because I've seen very little interest in this issue  Now, maybe it's unfeasible to try to do that given where we are today, but at least we ought to consider the stakes Given the stakes, it seems to me it might be worth a try Essentially we have to believe what we're doing now is sufficient or else we wouldn't have been doing it all this time So one consideration is Shouldn't we  -36-    11/16/93  try to enhance that to have a shot at least at a sustainable process going forward instead of going with an option which I think forever puts the deliberative process at risk? I am willing to accept that this may not be feasible I must say it's unfortunate that we seem to be willing to do this in response not to a broad-based Congressional criticism or public outcry on these issues but in response essentially to the harangues of very few critics That's not a healthy precedent Nonetheless, I am willing to accept reluctantly the summary judgment that we have no chance of protecting the process But we ought to go into it with our eyes open because once we start this process, it seems to me highly likely that sooner or later it will be busted open And then I think the process will be damaged I also would support consideration of a change in the timing of the release of the directive I think [the delayed release] does us much greater public and political harm in terms of perceptions than possibly its value I think it's time to reweigh those pluses and minuses  Now, if the enhanced minutes idea is simply not feasible, I would prefer for the past just edited transcripts with [a lag of] at least five years For the future I generally agree with what a number of people, including Tom Hoenig, Ed Boehne, Mike Kelley, and Bob McTeer have said I don't see a lot of difference between an MOD and an edited transcript It's an issue of quality versus the ability to defend the thing In terms of quality, maybe I don't have enough experience with an MOD to recognize its superior quality I wouldn't feel strongly, but I don't see why we would want to differentiate ourselves from these other agencies by having an MOD And I do think at the margin that an edited transcript would be easier to defend I would prefer to try to defend it for five years rather than three Again, I don't see why we can't make this--   Forward and past [I'd favor] five years I think we ought to link it to the same sorts of considerations that must be weighed in similar discussions with respect to foreign policy issues and other issues If it's a transcript of a meeting, it seems to me that we ought to be able to defend something like five years I could live with three, but I think we have to be realistic about it It will be three until the going gets tough and then it will be immediate And then I think we have a real problem especially when one looks around at how other central banks operate It's an unfortunate situation we're in I would be willing to go along with, and would have a marginal preference for, the edited transcripts going forward   Yes  -37-    11/16/93   Well, my view on attribution is that if you want attribution, you dissent But--   Yes, any time anyone wants attribution themselves it seems to me they can dissent, have a concurring statement, etc, etc   Yes, I know, we haven't; but we have at Board meetings   One issue is whether it would satisfy a particular critic, and my guess is it would not But a broader question is would it essentially satisfy FOIA--   My first choice would be [releasing] both; and I could accept either raw or lightly edited   I would say ten and five   We can't protect the raw transcript from FOIA   Enhanced minutes first; edited transcript second   Yes, the same as what we have now except that we probably go further--   I got three MODs first   Four edited transcripts first   Well, that's four Committee members   No My view of it is that it wouldn't but it would capture every issue and argument--   It should have all the substance in it that an MOD or edited transcript has but without attribution   I think we could vote on whether you'd like that sort of [document] or an MOD or an edited transcript and that would dispose of it   Well, [the current minutes] are pretty close to enhanced   I would suggest that we take the current minutes in which we have gone a pretty long way [in covering the meeting discussion] and go as far as we can in the same way--in other words, just talking about the issues and arguments and not doing a detailed MOD Basically the argument would be that we've been going in the right direction; we believe that this is sufficient or else we would have been doing something else   That would shut off the tape in the sense that we'll simply take notes The notes will be without attribution so the staff can produce the minutes The minutes are released There is some sense maybe of an improvement over the current practice in terms of the amount of information in there, but essentially it is in line with the current practice And I think it has not harmed the process at all to release those ideas   Well, couldn't we vote on that sort of process, which is essentially an expansion of the current process, or vote on an MOD?  -53-    11/16/93   So, no secret materials basically?   [We might first] have a vote between this question of something like minutes that we release quickly or an MOD or edited transcript--those two options--which is essentially your attribution versus non-attribution question   Putting it that way may--   At the December meeting or the Humphrey-Hawkins meeting so we can explain it? [Laughter]   That's actually an advantage of the delay   And tell that to the Committee   Yes, if the argument-- "
1961,1993-11-16," In my view we have moderate growth, as we've had for 2-1/2 years now The last seven quarters have averaged 3 percent and the last four quarters have averaged almost 3 percent So I conclude we have 3 percent growth even though we may have fits and starts It's pretty clear looking back that the initial force of monetary ease clearly went to financial repair and it's increasingly evident that we're turning the corner or have turned the corner from  -79-    11/16/93  repair to renewed spending We now see a very traditional pattern of interest-sensitive spending emerging business investment spending and consumer spending on durables and housing I think recent data and the market response to them do raise the question of whether there is evidence of a significant acceleration of growth Based upon currently available data I see no convincing evidence of a significant shift in the underlying mean, although there may be some increase My underlying mean is a bit higher than the Greenbook's, more like 3 percent It is true that strong consumer spending has outstripped income growth and that's unsustainable and has been for many quarters now That raises the question Bob Forrestal raised, and which we talked about at the Board a while back, which is the question of measurement And Al raised this question of whether people may be feeling a bit more secure about their job prospects or their job security and their sense of permanent income, and then there are the wealth gains in the markets But I don't think we have the potential for explosive consumer growth as we did in the early '80s  There is one real change in my view and that is that mortgage refinancing has given way to housing investment That is something that's new It's long overdue and I doubt that it alone is enough to take us off the track here There remains the ample supply of contractionary influences, the usual suspects But more generally, one interesting thing to assess is this economic climate Up until now despite the recovery, my sense is that consumers, businesses, and financial institutions have remained chastened and cautious And there is some evidence, such as what Bob McTeer just reported on, that that's starting to change now I do think we'll probably register a very strong fourth quarter We did last year But so far at least I'm not ready to shift up my mean fundamentally although it's clear that mean is already a bit above potential Why this sharp bond market response in recent weeks? Very little has happened We had third-quarter growth of 28 percent and the bond market changed It is true that we anticipate a strong fourth quarter We've had three or four strong quarters in the past two years, but we've never had an anticipated strong quarter; fourth-quarter growth was 57 percent last year but no one expected it so we couldn't enjoy it This is the first quarter that I can think of where--  SPEAKER(?) A rally   Right And we're still not so sure but there is some of that anticipation Of course, just a few weeks ago we had abject pessimism on the economy and euphoria in the bond markets One obvious factor is just the bond market dynamics of [people saying] we've had a long good run in the long bond, let's capture those gains before the end of the year and not be a pig I think the other factor is this truncation, perhaps temporarily, of a pessimistic tail of assessments Despite 2-1/2 years of growth this is a Rodney Dangerfield recovery It's never gotten any respect; it has been denied, criticized, or bad-mouthed through the full 2-1/2 years, and this has been fed recently by the weak first half of 1993 I think the recent data make it increasingly difficult to sustain an outlook of economic deterioration The recent evidence confirms that the expansion, though it is moderate, does appear durable and sustainable It may be slow but it appears at least to people in the markets less fragile, less likely to be punctured by tax increases or fears about health care And rather than creating a realistic expectation of very  -80-    11/16/93  robust growth, this confirmation tended to extinguish the pessimistic tail of distributions, and the market responded to that  There is also talk of Fed tightening in the markets as there were fantasies of Fed ease just a few weeks ago when everything was terrible Should this market reaction be a concern to us? Al mentioned it I don't think sustained moderate economic growth should be a cause for concern I agree with Jerry that we shouldn't be opposed to growth Rapid money and credit growth could portend trouble; we don't have that in my view, not yet at least, although M1 is still strong Economic growth crashing against resource constraints would certainly concern the staff, but we still have our measure of slack And the investment boom and productivity growth suggest the prospect for growth without those concerns And again, growth so fast that businesses and workers feel free to seek price and wage increases, the possibility that Bill McDonough mentioned, would be a cause for concern I think evidence [of that is not apparent]; for example, if you look closely at the purchasing managers' reports, the price diffusion index is still below 50 percent My sense is that competitive conditions remain tight although there's a possibility of this sort of speed effect if we have two good quarters Inflation still seems to be on a marginally downward path The fundamentals, including a disinflationary world economic environment, support the prospect for some additional progress And those fundamentals at least would suggest some more progress than the Greenbook is projecting, as Bob Parry mentioned, given the outstanding slack  Having said all of that, I still believe we maintain an accommodative stance Because of the long lags associated with inflation it is necessarily our job to look into the future If we wait until the inflationary pressures are established and evident, it's pretty late in the game Mike Prell gave the upside scenario; with capacity utilization already at 82 percent, we might not have much room left especially because I think growth next year could easily be 3 or 3-1/2 percent Moreover, though, I think our objective ought to be to continue to make progress on reducing inflation--core inflation has run 3 percent over the past 12 months--in order to secure a sustainable low interest rate environment and the associated benefits In my view our objective should not be simply to avoid a re-acceleration or an upturn in inflation I think there's a real payoff not just from stabilizing inflation in the 3 to 4 percent range but in moving lower  Finally, I do think we should take these markets seriously The long bond rate has moved up 40 basis points There's a legitimate question as to how long we should wait if the long bond rate continues to move up--how long we should artificially constrain the short end If the bond rate does move up, we're going to have to consider whether a move on the short end might be necessary and beneficial to confirm that we're on the job and to limit the damage of inflationary expectations on the long end After all, this is still an investment- driven expansion, dependent on the long rate for its thrust So I think we ought to be sensitive to the risks associated with maintaining an accommodative stance too long, including the lost opportunity to secure lower inflation But it does seem to me that it's relatively early in the game The long bond rate is up 40 basis points but it seems to have stabilized and it's still 30 basis points below its level last summer after the budget deal passed So it went  -81-    11/16/93  way beyond the budget deal period And, of course, we've had very little increase in the implied forward rates in the long end of the curve; much of it is intermediate  Nonetheless, when considering when to switch from accommodative to neutral I would note that the current favorable outlook for stronger growth does provide a credible environment in which to consider such a move at a time when I think many people would suggest the risks are on the up side I will also simply say that it's worth noting that the Administration forecast is, of course, for short rates to go up above inflation next year Thank you "

2028,1993-12-21," Thank you I think the developing pattern of incoming data continues to confirm what we all recognize Head winds continue to diminish We haven't heard a lot about head winds lately And a traditional pattern of interest-sensitive spending seems to be well entrenched and is fueling sustainable moderate growth led by business investment, consumer spending on durables, and especially housing I don't see significant risk of an overly robust growth rate because of the remaining much discussed drags on the economy, the usual suspects that Mike and John have mentioned I think these concerns are getting a little long in the tooth Is there anyone who doesn't know that taxes have gone up? We don't have much longer to flog that one But I do think those [drags] limit the up side somewhat However, I don't see any significant chance of economic deterioration absent a shock This thing has momentum; the economy has grown at a rate of 3 percent for 8 quarters now Growth has averaged 3 percent for 2 years So it is true that consumer spending has been sustained at unsustainable levels now for many, many quarters; and if it continues to be sustained at unsustainable levels, we might get a hint that we're not measuring it correctly and that the people who suggest that there are a lot of self-employed people and small businesses who are not being captured [may be right] The notion that during the uncertain job climate of 1992 and 1993 people would just feel confident about spending a lot more than they're making when we see that they don't feel confident enough to buy houses and the like despite record affordability just seems inconsistent It seems much more likely to me that the income is there  Regardless, [though] one can talk through the so-called slowdown in the first part of this year and the pickup, if we have a mean of 3 percent growth and we have average variability quarter-to quarter around that rate--we've had less than average variability--we will see quarters below 1 percent and above 5 percent I think the mean is 3 percent The Greenbook thinks it's 2-1/2 percent But we'll never know with this sort of variability, fortunately So I don't think it's possible to predict quarter-to-quarter variability We had retail sales growing in the fourth quarter of '92 at 12 percent That was unsustainable; even I would admit that So in the first quarter it pulled back You take the two quarters together and growth was 33 percent The second quarter had an inventory adjustment [but] we had consumer spending continuing to grow This quarter has an inventory adjustment in the opposite direction It's pretty clear in my view that the data have confirmed the durability and sustainability of the economic growth process and I'm getting a bit tired of holding my breath after two years  Since I believe much has been clarified by the last several months in the sense that we've had another one of these normal sorts of variations, I think it is time to take stock and see where we are It has been about 17 months, almost six quarters, since we lowered the federal funds rate to 3 percent; we actually [lowered it] 75 basis points during the summer of '92 I think it's worth reviewing the basic rationale for moving to a 3 percent federal funds rate, the lowest funds rate in almost 30 years I was a junior in Fayetteville High School the last time we had this federal funds rate We've had real short-term interest rates of approximately zero, if not marginally negative, during much of this time As I recall, the basic rationale was to take out insurance against the down side--to weigh against the risks in the summer of '92 of deterioration of the  -24-    12/21/93  fledgling recovery It worked The downside insurance paid off Comparing then to now Then we'd had six quarters prior to the third quarter of '92 where real GDP growth had averaged only 1 percent; the last six quarters have averaged above 3 percent Mike mentioned overall capacity utilization At the end of the second quarter of '92 it was 79-1/2; now it's 83 As Mike mentioned, the peak in the last cycle in the late '80s was 848, and it's 83 now Unemployment in the summer of '92 was 77 percent; it's down to 64 percent now--better say that quickly--   Yes, it's 65 percent using concurrent seasonals But it's down well over a percentage point in the last year and a half We might ask where it might be a year and a half from now I know it has come down in the last year and a half by over a point and we might think about that I know there's going to be a measurement change, which will kick it up, and I don't think we should be misled by that The factory workweek and factory overtime both stand at post-World War II highs All of this with the near-term growth outlook portends continued growth in employment, so I see the possibility of lower unemployment So I guess a lot has changed in a year and a half We've gone from an uncertain recovery to what is now an expansion which, if not mature, is at least an adolescent And all signs suggest it is on secure footing I think the market risks and perceptions have changed as well Last summer when the stock market was at record levels and we had a weak first-half GDP performance there was concern that the market was getting ahead of economic fundamentals Now, six months later, the market has gone essentially sideways for half a year The economic outlook has caught up with the market Against the current backdrop of a 5 percent fourth quarter and improved confidence in economic growth next year, I no longer hear the scare stories about market fragility, which probably means it's now that we should worry But there is a sense in which the economic outlook has filled in underneath the market  In short, the world has changed; the federal funds rate has not changed The downside economic risk has diminished substantially if it has not been extinguished entirely The death of downside risks has, in my view, taken with it the basic rationale for the very accommodative monetary stance in place now for a year and a half We no longer need the potentially costly insurance against downside risk that we needed in the summer of '92 When you compare the environment --the conditions that motivated us to go to 3 percent--I simply think the performance of the economy, currently and prospectively, no longer justifies this accommodative stance As the world has changed, the time has come over the next several months to begin the process of moving toward a neutral, sustainable stance, one appropriate for a growing economy with much diminished downside risks I do not see convincing signs of accelerating inflationary pressures at this time And I would not favor taking out insurance against the up side by moving to a restrictive policy of high real rates Of course, we know there are long lags associated with inflation and with policy actions If we sit with a very accommodative policy until inflationary pressures are clearly visibly embedded, we know it will be very late in the game It will be too late And a very restrictive policy will then be required We can look at the late '80s with a 10 percent funds rate and a recession [that was needed] to turn that one around  -25-    12/21/93  So, I think we have to be aware of a false sense of security, of getting into inertia and sitting with an accommodative policy long after the rationale for that policy has disappeared, made obsolete by progress in the economy Rather than let the inertia produce wider swings in policy and in economic activity and political pressures and result in considerable risk to our objective of sustained progress toward price stability, I think the better path is to start to move policy toward an even keel while there is still time And I think this would help secure a low inflation environment, low long-term rates, and sustained economic growth Simply put This is our job in my view I would not pretend to suggest that this policy journey will be entirely pleasant; but unfortunately this, too, is our job  Of course, beginning to move from accommodative to neutral would surprise no one I think it is the consensus forecast of private economists that short rates will move up moderately next year It is expected by the markets and implicit in forwards and futures prices; and regardless of the rhetoric, it is the Administration's official forecast I would not favor an immediate change in the thin markets with year-end pressures; this was helpful in December of '91 when rates were coming down It might not be so helpful in the opposite direction Nor would I favor a change linked to statistics on economic growth or unemployment Nor do I see a compelling case for going to asymmetry now since the move is not in my view dependent on, or potentially triggered by, the receipt of data in the intermeeting period That would be the criterion I use for directive bias--if I'm waiting for a piece of data here As we move into next year, I think the Committee should debate this issue and make a careful assessment of the progress and prospects for the economy And if we reach a consensus, as I hope we shall, we should perhaps take the first step at a meeting as a carefully considered marginal realignment of the stance of policy rather than as a response to specific incoming data  In sum, when I look at the economy I see a much changed economic environment from the one we faced in the summer of '92 The only thing that hasn't changed is the federal funds rate In my view the concerns that led us to establish the 3 percent federal funds rate are no longer present The rationale for an accommodative stance is no longer valid and the time is fast approaching to begin the realignment of policy from the accommodative stance appropriate for a struggling uncertain recovery a year and a half ago to a more neutral stance appropriate for a sustainable expansion, which we have today Thank you "
2029,1993-12-21," July '92 [unintelligible]   I don't know   There's certainly strong logic for moving now in the sense that I don't think we need to wait for confirmation; two years of 3 percent growth is enough We could wait for a third year but we might miss the entire expansion [Laughter] In terms of a 1/4 percentage point versus a 1/2 point, I like Governor Angell's concept It may not be possible to do; it is difficult to make a move when we're moving up, I think There is also some advantage to [holding steady] for a while--and who knows maybe for a bit more than a while-- whereas if we just do a quarter we're on the treadmill and inevitably we will get dragged up by the market I think it was to our advantage to let the market lead us down and we won't exactly be getting ahead of the market when we get started now but there is something to be said for that 50 basis point [move] Regardless of whether it's 25 or 50, I think there's plenty of economic case for doing it now The market case, though, concerns me because even if it's only a quarter-- that's a small amount and you couldn't find [the effect of] that in the economy--it is a big signal because it's a turning point So there's a capitalized value impact on the markets and the markets [are thin] around holiday time Again, in December '91 it helped us a lot to cut rates in those sorts of markets and set off a rally with no one around--with just two people bidding up prices for three weeks--but that would probably hurt us now So, I can support your ""B"" symmetric    12/21/93 "
