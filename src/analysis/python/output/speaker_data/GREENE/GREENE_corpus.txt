 [Statement--see Appendix]   I think the body of opinion does expect that The questions in the market's mind are How much and how fast?   These are the swap arrangements that we have with other central banks, which have a term of one-year and are renewable every year As a routine matter we renew them each year   That's a very difficult question to answer, partly because we don't have very good statistics and partly because the concept is hard to define When we last conducted the turnover survey, in 1989, we did ask banks to tell us what proportion of their total foreign exchange turnover was with customers I've forgotten the number, but I believe it was somewhere between 5 and 10 percent But that only goes so far, because it depends on every respondent identifying who was a customer and that would not necessarily be a corporate customer Nonbank financial institutions could be customers also The rest of the business that a bank does, although it's reported as interbank business, may be in support of the customer's business For example, if I do a trade with a customer and then I wish to manage my position, that forces me to go into the interbank market to do a certain amount of transactions I think the average    12/18/90  number of interbank transactions one might engage in to support one customer trade could be anywhere from 4 to 10   I think they are; the trend is definitely [up]   I think it's fair to say that in the exchange markets the distinction between the discount rate and the federal funds rate may not be quite as widely appreciated The symbolic influence of the discount rate probably carries a greater weight in exchange markets than it does domestically simply because the exchange market looks at lots of central banks and the discount rate for so many central banks is an important policy instrument So, it might take a little while for the exchange markets to come to the same interpretation as the domestic market of such an action   They do look at the press release and, sure, anything that could be comforting in the press release would help   Thank you, Mr Chairman I hope you can hear me; I'm suffering from the same throat ailment as some others here [Statement--see Appendix]   There were no transactions   I certainly will And I'm sure that I speak for him when I say that he has enjoyed working with you and will miss the associations he has had by being in this job for the last 10 years   [Statement--see Appendix]   Certainly, Mr Chairman As you know, this is the time of year when we start the process of discussing our swap arrangements with other central banks We have no changes in the terms and conditions to suggest at this time and would request the Committee to give us the authority to begin those negotiations The swap arrangements actually will come up for renewal at various times during the month of December and should be completed before year-end whereupon we'll come back at the first meeting in 1992 to bring you the results of those discussions   [Statement--see Appendix]   I would like now to report to you on our discussions with the Bundesbank regarding the possibility of altering the double-forward investment facility provided for the investment of the bulk of the US authorities' German mark reserves [Continuation of statement--see Appendix]   I'll try my best, Mr Chairman, not to be too confessional [Statement--see Appendix]   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Are you talking about the portfolio of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury?   [Statement--see Appendix]   Are you talking about intra-European investment positions?   Well, in reading the Greenbook last night I noted that there have been some persistent foreign purchases of US government securities in the first quarter of the year at the same time that there has been a continued very high level of US outward investment So, in effect, one could see this as financing our capital outflow The liquidation that I spoke of--the Japanese investments--will probably at least in the first instance not be US dollars Nevertheless, it had an effect on the dollar exchange rate because they liquidated, let's say, Canadian dollar securities, received Canadian dollars, and converted that to US dollars; the dollar was a means of exchange for getting back into yen We thought they were relatively easily shaken out of the Canadian dollar market; there was also some Australian dollar intervention by the Japanese The market has been talking about the Japanese more as a vulnerability than an actuality as far as US bond markets are concerned My feeling is that, with the somewhat better climate that exists now in the middle of May than existed at the beginning of April, they are more secure now But that's just a personal impression Bill may want to say something [on this issue]    5/18/93   Well, Mr McDonough has set a very high standard for me He says he'll talk loudly and clearly If I don't talk loudly and clearly, please let me know; I'll try to speak either slower or louder   I will try [Statement--Ms Greene's statement cannot be found in the Committee's files]   It is correct that we do not have that evidence What we don't know is whether they are succeeding in picking up some reserves and waiting to tell us of their operations when they are more successful But you are right; we do not have any clear evidence that they have been successful And until today the French franc had looked a little heavy So, the opportunities really were not obvious for them to acquire marks   The accounting on reserves varies [greatly] from country to country, and the sharing of the loss in a case like this-- where the French, for example, borrowed marks in an EMS arrangement-- is also unclear to us In other words, whether or not there's some kind of loss-sharing arrangement within the EMS that has been agreed to is something we are not fully confident we understand But if it were true that the country that is doing the borrowing has to cover at market rates, you are right, the consequences in terms of the profits of the central banks on their foreign exchange transactions and how that is reflected in a fiscal deficit could be a significant number   Certainly one important element is that the capital outflow, which had been a counterweight to Japan's current account surplus, has been far smaller than is typically the case Now, obviously, there's a capital [outflow] to balance the surplus in an accounting sense But the [ex ante] demand to send funds abroad by Japanese investors has pretty much dried up They did invest a fair amount and they were very active investors in the second quarter in the European markets, taking advantage of the sharp drop in interest rates, particularly in countries of the EMS other than Germany And, of course, they got burned by what has happened with the European monetary system And we believe that one of the reasons why the yen advanced so much more rapidly than the dollar in July was that these investors were hedging their exposures in French francs and other [currencies] We do not think they liquidated their investments because they thought that the breakup of the EMS would prompt a larger cut in interest rates than has taken place and they wanted to be there to get the capital gains But apart from that burst of [what might be called] an outward investment into Europe immediately after the French elections, the outflow has been small by comparison to previous years So that is probably the single biggest fact The reluctance of the Japanese investment companies and insurance companies and investment trusts to make meaningful outward investment in other countries   They are demanding fewer dollars   Yes As this has built up, of course, we have seen the Japanese companies responding differently, as I mentioned Previously they had believed that the dollar would recover and therefore they would be able to sell dollars at a higher rate, so they were willing to hold their dollar exposures As that belief has faded, people are saying "I have to cut my losses; I just have to get out of these currencies regardless of what the exchange rate is" And that's when we observed the Japanese exporters constantly reducing the dollar price at which they were willing to sell; in the past couple of weeks that has been an important additional factor   I think there is growing concern about the type of market participants; these participants are difficult for the authorities to have contact with In the past the large players have been banks which the central banks know and understand; now we have a class of market participants--call them hedge funds or investment trusts or whatever you want to call them--who exert enormous market power and for whom there is not the same kind of relationship with the monetary authorities The authorities don't know who they are; they don't know why they do these things And, of course, these funds have    8/17/93  built up huge investment positions in all countries And when they get scared, the hedging of those portfolios--just because of the way the hedging is done--is enough to have a very sudden and substantial impact on the exchange rate, which comes at the most awkward time from the point of view of the central banks So, I think there is a growing level of frustration, and I guess the question is Where does that frustration ultimately lead?
