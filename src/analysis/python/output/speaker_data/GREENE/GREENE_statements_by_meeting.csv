86,1976-06-22,"  Thank you  It is a pleasure for me to be here  Since your last meeting, the  dollar continued [unintelligible] it tried to reach in early June at the highest levels against the  major European currencies since late January  This latest advance had been triggered by the  upward advancement in short-term US interest rates; in addition, evidence of a further reduction  in unemployment, generally favorable [unintelligible] performance, and a lower trade deficit for  April underpin a generally positive [market] sentiment  Subsequently, the dollar eased  fractionally from early June levels once the rise in short-term interest rates leveled off, but then it  remained stable against many important currencies, especially the German mark, even as  tensions deepened in the market for other currencies     Meanwhile, the markets focused their attentions on sterling and the Swiss franc  Sterling  continued its deep plunge as the market, now totally demoralized, took little notice of the recent  and substantial increase in Britain’s export sales or of a growing acceptance among trade union  memberships of the need for an accepted constraint on wages  Instead, concerns deepened as  [unintelligible] fall in sterling threatened to reignite union opposition to the government’s pay  policy     At the same time, parliamentary debate over public spending [unintelligible] on the  government’s entire economic program  The Bank of England, which had earlier provided  heavy support for the pound, eased up its dollar sales as reserves came close to being depleted   And with dealers also no longer willing to take sterling into their positions, the rate dropped  without resistance to just about $170, some 158 percent below levels of just last March  This  drop was far greater than any corrections needed simply to offset Britain’s relatively high  inflation rate; moreover, it had very serious consequences, not only for the British government’s  efforts to contain inflation at home but also on competitive relationships throughout Europe     The announcement of a $53 billion dollar credit for England by the Group of Ten  countries, Switzerland, and the BIS [Bank for International Settlements] consequently had a  strongly positive and immediate impact and was followed  up with simultaneous operations in  sterling by the Bank of England in both London and through the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York  It [unintelligible] a covering of short sterling positions and a sharp rebound in the  [unintelligible] race  Since then the government pay policy has been accepted by the Trade  Union Congress by an overwhelming majority  In addition, the Bank of England took advantage  of the shortage of liquidity in the domestic money market to engineer an even greater squeeze on  speculative positions [unintelligible] in the Eurosterling market       6/22/76 - 13 -           Nevertheless, the market for sterling remains fragile  Many participants were disappointed  that the government has not adopted further anti-inflationary measures, and consequently sterling  does not yet have sufficient buoyancy to offset a continuing flow of commercial offers in the  market  The Bank of England, therefore, has continued to provide supports for the crown,  selling--since the June 7 announcement at around the $177 level--almost $550 million  The bulk  of this will be covered by a requested [unintelligible] by the Bank of England on the Group of  Ten standby of 10 percent of the total arrangement, hopefully valued tomorrow     By contrast, the Swiss franc remained strong against both the dollar and the German mark  during the period  To counter this trend, the Swiss authorities introduced harsh measures and cut  the discount rate to limit new inflows into Swiss francs  In addition, the [Swiss] National Bank  pledged to intervene massively if necessary; it also agreed that a German government borrowing  denominated in German marks be placed with a consortium of Swiss banks  This renewed  demonstration of determination to resist the Swiss franc’s persistent rise, together with Swiss  bidding for marks before the paydown of the German government loan, helped for a while to  relieve the upward pressure on the franc  But to the extent that the German mark was  simultaneously nudged higher in the European community [unintelligible], it brought those  currencies close to the band [unintelligible] such as the Dutch guilder, again under pressure     Thus, the situation on the Continent also remained fluid  During the period, the Federal  Reserve was asked by several other central banks to intervene on their behalf in the New York  market  As exchange trading has become more and more a 24-hour business, many central  banks have found it useful to follow up operations in their respective markets with operations in  our market after their close  On that basis we have sold since May 18 more than $170 million  with the Swiss banks; with the Swiss National Bank we have purchased $77 million of sterling  from the Bank of England; and we have bought over $35 million worth of guilders with the  Netherlands Bank     We did not intervene with the System account  Instead, we continued to acquire Belgian  francs, buying about $26 million worth, and repaid $20 million on our outstanding swap debt in  that currency  In addition, the System was able to add to its balances of German marks, which  now amount to $53 million equivalent, and only began to buy small amounts of Dutch guilders, a  currency which we have also used to intervene from time to time     Our total balances apart from those held against outstanding swap debts now amount to  $58 million, well below the $150 million figure that the Committee agreed last September would  be appropriate  I have two points to raise with regard to recommendations      I don’t have any information on that  I do feel--and it is just a feeling--that  they do wish to have the beneficial effects of the package demonstrated in the market, and so  they have wished to keep the rate higher than where it was at the time of the announcement      That’s right    Well, undoubtedly there has been some OPEC selling of sterling, because  there are some large sterling holders on the part of a few remaining OPEC members  But the  most surprising source of pressure there has been the many countries, not OPEC, that have  historically held large amounts of sterling and have been disinvesting their sterling holdings over  a period of several months  Probably they are equally important in terms of the amount of     6/22/76 - 15 -           sterling sold  Furthermore, probably quantitatively the most important has been adverse  movements in commercial [unintelligible]  And the kind of continuing business we see in the  sterling market on the sale side does appear to be largely commercial    Well, those countries with accounts with us look like they are diversifying  largely into dollars, but that would make sense from the point of view of the composition of their  trade  There may be other countries who are also diversifying with accounts elsewhere whose  activities we cannot so easily track    As it turned out, the Bundesbank did not need to, although there had been  some [unintelligible] into the weekend that the Bundesbank would join in the intervention on the  day of the announcement  As it turned out--    In sterling?    As I said, they did not need to  The day of the announcement was a  holiday on the Continent, and the Bundesbank was closed, and the German market was closed  that day, and by the second day there was no need for such a [unintelligible]     Certainly  Two drawings on Federal Reserve swap drawings come due  before the next meeting  The first is the $360 million Mexican drawing  So far this year,  Mexico has made progress in bringing down inflation, while its current account position has  improved in response to the economic recovery here  But inasmuch as the swap matures just  after the July 4 presidential election date, we understood at the time of the drawing and also from  more recent conversations that the Bank of Mexico might well wish to renew  In that event, we  would recommend renewal for another two months    This would be a first renewal     6/22/76 - 16 -            SPEAKER(?)  You do not know for certain whether they will renew, but you think they  will    As of a conversation yesterday, they think it very likely that they will wish  to    The next is the Italian situation  As Mr Holmes anticipated at the last  meeting, the Bank of Italy did request a renewal of its second $250 million swap when it matures  on June 27  And the Bank of Italy agreed to the same conditions we had imposed upon renewal  of the first drawing  Now that first drawing, also $250 million, will be coming due for the  second time on July 22  According to my conversation with the Bank of Italy last week, they do  intend to repay, but so far the Bank of Italy has drawn on only $500 million of the total $750  million that we made available to them in February, and so they still have $250 million to be  drawn as they need  I don’t have a specific recommendation to make in this regard, but I think it  very possible that there may be a third request in the near future    When the draw issue comes up in July, when it matures, that would be at  the end of its first renewal period  As a condition of the drawing, they agreed to repay after a  first renewal period And they intend to do so  However, they have $250 million left, and they  are obviously in an uncertain situation at the moment with the elections just completed, and so it  is very conceivable that within the next month there might be a request for a third drawing  [If  so,] that would, by the time of the next meeting, [leave] the total amount of their indebtedness  into the [unintelligible] unchanged       6/22/76 - 17 -           SPEAKER(?)  You mean they might borrow from us in order to repay us?   SPEAKER(?)  That’s what it sounds like to me    In effect    I am not asking for a renewal  I am simply anticipating [unintelligible] of  letting in a third drawing, which might be at a time other than the repayment date  But in the  future  "
1073,1979-05-22," [Statement--see Appendix]   Not completely because their instruction is  based on their close in Toyko And how that relates to rates in New  York depends very much on what has happened between the time of the  close in Toyko and our opening in New York In general I would say  their instruction has been to limit the further weakening of the yen  in New York, with the greater burden for intervention on them in Toyko  rather than in New York   Well, there is a variety of factors demand,  supply, and psychological On the supply side, of course, is the fact  that the Treasury has announced a halving of its [gold] auction  [amounts] and the IMF has announced a modest scale-back in the amount  it will auction There appears to be some lesser willingness on the  part of the Russians to sell gold, and that has been going on much of  the year So the supply picture is tighter than it had been  Industrial demand appears to be quite good, even at these higher  prices And, of course, gold reacts very [strongly] in an environment  in which there is a sense of scarcity of certain important strategic  commodities It is also reacting strongly to substantial demand for  other precious metals, particularly silver The relationship between  silver and gold is extremely important in our [unintelligible] here  So, even as the dollar has improved, the price of gold has continued  to go up   Well, the demand for gold is quite strong,  interestingly enough, in Zurich and in Paris, too   It‘s just under $200 million, about $195  mil 1 ion   We haven’t in recent weeks We have not for  some time We have not purchased any yen since the last FOMC meeting   I just wanted to say that on a day-by-day basis  we are going to need operating flexibility because these formulae are  very difficult to maintain in an ongoing operation   Yes, Henry, I'm afraid we do need that We've  come into a tremendous amount of paperwork problems, particularly when  the proportions are so tight as 10 percent and 20 percent     5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -42-  "
1147,1979-07-17," I'm afraid I have to report that the market responded to the Carter address with some disappointment--disappointment that some of the immediate questions about the economy have not been addressed and that the issues that were addressed were of a long-term nature providing nothing for the market at the moment And in that position the market has a bit in its teeth It is true that the initial reaction in the Far East to President Carter's speech was, on balance, positive But it was not sufficient to keep the dollar rate at the level at which it was trading at the time of the speech As of this moment we have lost approximately 1 percentage point from that level, going down to a low    7/17/79  this morning of 18090 to 181 In the process we provided sustained support both in the Far East and in New York Sunday night, Monday, and Monday night As of 1130 this morning the U S authorities had sold net something like $700 million of foreign currency, mostly German marks, since the Carter speech This has brought the total of our intervention since the time the market turned around in mid-June to $31 billion Of that, $13 billion had been on behalf of the System The amount of swap drawings totals about $12 billion if we include what we have done today The remaining $18 billion has been financed by the ESF; that has brought the ESF into a net minus position inasmuch as the marks that it now holds in balances are less than required to cover the Carter bonds The $31 billion of net currency sales since the middle of June compares with about $37 billion of purchases by foreign central banks The most important of these has been the Bundesbank buying about and the Swiss National Bank I'd be very happy to answer any questions you may have  I would say that the pressure has been building up since about this time yesterday It started, I would have supposed, largely with professionals There was quite a bit of European selling yesterday and in the Far East last night that pattern continued Sterling is in very strong demand this morning, the rate being up to 27 The Bank of England says they have also heard that in addition to professional buying of sterling there is considerable Middle East interest, which has the smell of diversification about it So I would have to say that on very sketchy impressions we cannot exclude the possibility that the dollar is being hurt by these shifts of investment funds I have not heard of a lot of Latin American names or a lot of corporate names such as we heard last fall; I would say that it has been more European and more traditional investors  I am not sure I heard the question "
1169,1979-07-19," Yes, I am Can you hear me?  If I may, I'd like to bring the members of the Committee up-to-date on the events since we last talked on Tuesday I should say that following the news of Tuesday afternoon the dollar came under intense pressure once again, primarily in the Far East on Tuesday night The magnitude of our intervention operations in that market Tuesday night and a quick follow-up by the Bundesbank in Frankfort the next morning impressed the market and helped to quell some of the immediate pressure Since that time the market has technically been in better balance, but the environment and sentiment continue to be extremely bearish for the dollar Market participants, commercial [firms], and investors are reporting that they are making a hard reassessment of the dollar's prospects and the implication of those prospects for their own operations Even the promise offered a couple of weeks ago that a recession might help us on the inflation front and on our trade account is a promise that is quickly fading away The one thing helping us in the past day or so has been the expectation--[which] has been affirmed over the past hours--that the heavy intervention the market has detected will soon be followed by some other kind of package Parallels are being drawn between this period and the period leading up to November 1 of last year  In terms of our operations, the Desk has sold $450 million worth of marks since we last spoke on Tuesday This brings our intervention since Sunday night to almost $12 billion, which has been equally shared between the System and the Treasury Since mid-June the net intervention by the United States has been $36 billion This compares to the $41 billion from our 3 partners in the November 1 package-- for Germany and for Switzerland And we should not overlook, however, the contribution in terms of official dollar purchases by the Bank of England of during that period Of the $36 billion of intervention we have done, $15 billion has been on behalf of the System That has been entirely financed by swap drawings on the Bundesbank The $21 billion done for the Treasury has been financed largely out of balances the Treasury had warehoused at the System This brings the Treasury's balance to more than a billion marks short of their liabilities under the Carter bonds That's all I have to report, Mr Chairman "
1851,1981-03-31," Just before the Bundesbank's move, yes  That's right  [Recommendation--see Appendix]  It was that we do not yet know whether the Riksbank will request us to renew the increase [in their swap line that was enacted last year] In the event that they do, we probably will hear about it before the next FOMC meeting and we would like to be able at that time to recommend by wire that the renewal be approved  We thought they might wish to talk about it at the time they repay That is the reason we brought it up at this time  The 23rd of April  I fully expect that they will repay the drawing The question is, if there's an increase in the arrangement, whether that should also be renewed The reason for bringing it up now, although they are two separate items, is that when we're talking to them about the repayment, we expect that they will ask for an initial reaction as to whether or not they could renew the increase in the line as well  I think that's something, if we are cooperative with them, that we could remind them about, if the situation so required "
2164,1982-05-18," Thank you Governor Martin [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, to the extent that some countries are now finding it possible to lower interest rates in their own countries as they feel it is appropriate--Germany is one case in point and Switzerland is another--their immediate concern about the impact for them is not quite so great However, they recognize that not all countries are in quite as fortunate a situation as they are And there is concern about the difficulties some countries are continuing to face in servicing their debts and the credit implications of a generally high level of interest rates So, I think there is still concern, but it's concern of a different type  Well, it may still be premature to make a judgment on that I must say that the Chairman made it quite clear that he did not feel the credit that was extended at the end of April should be viewed as a precedent for subsequent month-end assistance And the Mexicans are proceeding with their negotiations on a fairly large--I think $2 billion--jumbo credit Whether all of this will fall into place in time for the end of May is one of the questions that remains to be answered  They're negotiating with banks for this credit  They would prefer to be able to handle their problems themselves and to have a program that is sufficiently credible in the market that they can avoid going to the IMF  It was $600 million that they drew [on the swap arrangement with us]  They have sizable debt service requirements in the next couple of months They also, up until the end of April, have been experiencing regular capital outflows, which have had a negative impact on their reserves I guess one of the questions still before the court is whether they have taken sufficient action to stem those capital outflows  The borrowing requirements are very heavy; they are estimating their gross borrowing for 1982 at $20 billion  I would say that the objectives of the austerity program are welcomed, but there has been some question as to the implementation  That's right  It has worked that way before And, of course, it doesn't help matters either in terms of the [timing]  I share your view on that And I answered that question for myself in two ways First of all, there was considerable selling of dollars by the professionals on expectations of a drop in [US] interest rates, not unlike what we were talking about earlier this morning Secondly, the talk of a budget compromise was interpreted much more positively abroad than it was here Most people are unfamiliar with our form of government and think more in terms of a parliamentary system When they read that the President has reached a compromise with the Republicans in the Senate Budget Committee, [to them] that means that the job is pretty much done The implication about what that would mean for the bond market was held with far  -11-    5/18/82  greater conviction in Europe than it was here So it was a mismatch, if you like, in expectations  Well, as I said, there was some short covering I didn't make a major point of it because it happened, really, in two days It happened after publication of the retail sales figures last week and it happened yesterday; but it was sufficient to cut in half the drop in the dollar that we had recorded for the whole intermeeting period The market is extremely thin We ourselves had some correspondent business to sell about $100 million yesterday and we found it very difficult to do that The reluctance of people to take positions is quite high, so that it doesn't take a very large force to move the prices by a considerable margin  The information I have on that, which is anecdotal only, is that there was great concern Well, first of all, there are some dollar deposits in the banking system in Argentina And what was happening was that depositors were taking the dollar deposits and cashing them in for notes out of concern that the deposits might be expropriated in some way by the government and that the notes under their mattresses would be more secure "
2192,1982-06-30," I, too, will try to abridge my report [Secretary's note Ms Greene summarized the statement shown in the Appendix]  We didn't hit on it We responded to market conditions; we operated in relatively small size discreetly and it so happened that the rates around which we were operating tended to be resistance points in the markets and no further operations were necessary The market felt the resistance there, accepted it, thought it was an appropriate place for the rise to peter out, and we contributed to that sense of resistance and did not have to do more  No, I think the feeling was that the resistance point was confirmed and was noticed in the market But it was a technical reaction rather than a policy reaction at the time  They would not necessarily have identified it as our operations They would have identified the fact that somehow the dollar didn't seem to go above that [resistance] level  We took steps in smaller amounts because we were operating in amounts that are trading amounts in the markets  I think anybody participating in the market--and it would probably be true of those of us in the foreign exchange department at the New York Bank--would have a different number It's a matter of judgment Certainly the markets have been subject to abrupt movements of rates during this period but it's not clear that the problems originated in the exchange market Therefore, the question of whether intervention would be appropriate or not didn't come up  That's a fair assumption  Well, following the devaluation, the government did announce an austerity program that included wage and price guidelines That has generated a fair amount of criticism domestically by both employers and trade unions and is giving rise to a test and debate about economic policy in France I think the people outside of France feel that how this gets resolved is important in their assessment  I think also that the action has to be seen against a background in which they have been fairly aggressive in letting interest rates decline And that undercuts in another way the commitment to austerity Even though as a tool of monetary policy they have relied very much on credit guidelines, the fact that interest rates are coming down--and they are the only major country where interest rates are coming down--supports Mr Solomon's point that there is a credibility problem in the financial markets "
2663,1984-03-26, [Statement--see Appendix]  It eased somewhat from Friday  Yes 
2938,1985-07-09," [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, they can manage this hedging quite aggressively and they can select, if you will, the term of their insurance protection against an adverse exchange rate move So, they can pay the price of this insurance for relatively short periods of time We believe, or at least we have heard, that in many cases during the spring money was made on these so-called protective hedging operations when the dollar came down earlier in the year "
3146,1986-07-08," [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, the figure that you cited was a 3-1/2-month total for the Bank of Japan The purpose of the intervention on Monday and Tuesday was to demonstrate that they feel as strongly after the election as they did before that it is inappropriate [for the yen] to appreciate any more So, I would imagine that they would still be active in the exchange market Whether they would have to do the magnitudes that they have done on certain days in the past, I don't really know  For the intermeeting period, that is a fairly large amount  I think what I said was that the interest differential has narrowed to 50 basis points against Germany and 250 basis points against Japan I will defer to my colleague to the right as to whether or not he has seen any--  I think you have to distinguish between what the market is expecting and the announcement effect even when an expected action is taken I think the market is pretty much expecting a 1/2 point reduction, but the announcement of a 1 percentage point drop would have an immediate impact, particularly if what happens here comes sooner than the market might have thought "
4240,1990-12-18," [Statement--see Appendix]  I think the body of opinion does expect that The questions in the market's mind are How much and how fast?  These are the swap arrangements that we have with other central banks, which have a term of one-year and are renewable every year As a routine matter we renew them each year  That's a very difficult question to answer, partly because we don't have very good statistics and partly because the concept is hard to define When we last conducted the turnover survey, in 1989, we did ask banks to tell us what proportion of their total foreign exchange turnover was with customers I've forgotten the number, but I believe it was somewhere between 5 and 10 percent But that only goes so far, because it depends on every respondent identifying who was a customer and that would not necessarily be a corporate customer Nonbank financial institutions could be customers also The rest of the business that a bank does, although it's reported as interbank business, may be in support of the customer's business For example, if I do a trade with a customer and then I wish to manage my position, that forces me to go into the interbank market to do a certain amount of transactions I think the average    12/18/90  number of interbank transactions one might engage in to support one customer trade could be anywhere from 4 to 10  I think they are; the trend is definitely [up]  I think it's fair to say that in the exchange markets the distinction between the discount rate and the federal funds rate may not be quite as widely appreciated The symbolic influence of the discount rate probably carries a greater weight in exchange markets than it does domestically simply because the exchange market looks at lots of central banks and the discount rate for so many central banks is an important policy instrument So, it might take a little while for the exchange markets to come to the same interpretation as the domestic market of such an action  They do look at the press release and, sure, anything that could be comforting in the press release would help "
4367,1991-05-14," Thank you, Mr Chairman I hope you can hear me; I'm suffering from the same throat ailment as some others here [Statement--see Appendix]  There were no transactions "
4525,1991-11-05," I certainly will And I'm sure that I speak for him when I say that he has enjoyed working with you and will miss the associations he has had by being in this job for the last 10 years  [Statement--see Appendix]  Certainly, Mr Chairman As you know, this is the time of year when we start the process of discussing our swap arrangements with other central banks We have no changes in the terms and conditions to suggest at this time and would request the Committee to give us the authority to begin those negotiations The swap arrangements actually will come up for renewal at various times during the month of December and should be completed before year-end whereupon we'll come back at the first meeting in 1992 to bring you the results of those discussions "
4546,1991-12-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman The attitude toward the dollar and toward the outlook for the US economy is now pretty much in line with what we described at the November 5 meeting What has changed principally in the exchange markets has been a reawakening of the perception of exchange rate risks and with that a renewed strengthening of the German mark The dollar, looking across a variety of currencies, is mixed relative to where it was trading on November 5 It's unchanged on average While [higher] against the yen, it's lower against the mark by about 2 percent or so But between November 5 and now it has been even lower still We are benefitting at the moment from uncertainties about developments in the Soviet Union And, of course, we do not know how long and in what form these uncertainties will be, looking ahead The dollar has now given up more than half of the gain that it [had achieved] early in the year after the war in the Persian Gulf And we have seen a number of occasions in the intermeeting period when the dollar seemed to be moving closely in tandem with developments in our domestic capital markets So far, the movements have been relatively [unintelligible]; but this could be a troublesome dynamic in a different form, accentuating the anxiety in the financial markets if the dollar were again to fall to a substantial extent That's pretty much all I have, Mr Chairman "
4566,1991-12-17, [Statement--see Appendix]  I would like now to report to you on our discussions with the Bundesbank regarding the possibility of altering the double-forward investment facility provided for the investment of the bulk of the US authorities' German mark reserves [Continuation of statement--see Appendix] 
4794,1992-11-17," I'll try my best, Mr Chairman, not to be too confessional [Statement--see Appendix] "
4871,1993-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  Are you talking about the portfolio of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury? "
4941,1993-05-18," [Statement--see Appendix]  Are you talking about intra-European investment positions?  Well, in reading the Greenbook last night I noted that there have been some persistent foreign purchases of US government securities in the first quarter of the year at the same time that there has been a continued very high level of US outward investment So, in effect, one could see this as financing our capital outflow The liquidation that I spoke of--the Japanese investments--will probably at least in the first instance not be US dollars Nevertheless, it had an effect on the dollar exchange rate because they liquidated, let's say, Canadian dollar securities, received Canadian dollars, and converted that to US dollars; the dollar was a means of exchange for getting back into yen We thought they were relatively easily shaken out of the Canadian dollar market; there was also some Australian dollar intervention by the Japanese The market has been talking about the Japanese more as a vulnerability than an actuality as far as US bond markets are concerned My feeling is that, with the somewhat better climate that exists now in the middle of May than existed at the beginning of April, they are more secure now But that's just a personal impression Bill may want to say something [on this issue]    5/18/93 "
4993,1993-08-17," Well, Mr McDonough has set a very high standard for me He says he'll talk loudly and clearly If I don't talk loudly and clearly, please let me know; I'll try to speak either slower or louder  I will try [Statement--Ms Greene's statement cannot be found in the Committee's files]  It is correct that we do not have that evidence What we don't know is whether they are succeeding in picking up some reserves and waiting to tell us of their operations when they are more successful But you are right; we do not have any clear evidence that they have been successful And until today the French franc had looked a little heavy So, the opportunities really were not obvious for them to acquire marks  The accounting on reserves varies [greatly] from country to country, and the sharing of the loss in a case like this-- where the French, for example, borrowed marks in an EMS arrangement-- is also unclear to us In other words, whether or not there's some kind of loss-sharing arrangement within the EMS that has been agreed to is something we are not fully confident we understand But if it were true that the country that is doing the borrowing has to cover at market rates, you are right, the consequences in terms of the profits of the central banks on their foreign exchange transactions and how that is reflected in a fiscal deficit could be a significant number  Certainly one important element is that the capital outflow, which had been a counterweight to Japan's current account surplus, has been far smaller than is typically the case Now, obviously, there's a capital [outflow] to balance the surplus in an accounting sense But the [ex ante] demand to send funds abroad by Japanese investors has pretty much dried up They did invest a fair amount and they were very active investors in the second quarter in the European markets, taking advantage of the sharp drop in interest rates, particularly in countries of the EMS other than Germany And, of course, they got burned by what has happened with the European monetary system And we believe that one of the reasons why the yen advanced so much more rapidly than the dollar in July was that these investors were hedging their exposures in French francs and other [currencies] We do not think they liquidated their investments because they thought that the breakup of the EMS would prompt a larger cut in interest rates than has taken place and they wanted to be there to get the capital gains But apart from that burst of [what might be called] an outward investment into Europe immediately after the French elections, the outflow has been small by comparison to previous years So that is probably the single biggest fact The reluctance of the Japanese investment companies and insurance companies and investment trusts to make meaningful outward investment in other countries  They are demanding fewer dollars  Yes As this has built up, of course, we have seen the Japanese companies responding differently, as I mentioned Previously they had believed that the dollar would recover and therefore they would be able to sell dollars at a higher rate, so they were willing to hold their dollar exposures As that belief has faded, people are saying ""I have to cut my losses; I just have to get out of these currencies regardless of what the exchange rate is"" And that's when we observed the Japanese exporters constantly reducing the dollar price at which they were willing to sell; in the past couple of weeks that has been an important additional factor  I think there is growing concern about the type of market participants; these participants are difficult for the authorities to have contact with In the past the large players have been banks which the central banks know and understand; now we have a class of market participants--call them hedge funds or investment trusts or whatever you want to call them--who exert enormous market power and for whom there is not the same kind of relationship with the monetary authorities The authorities don't know who they are; they don't know why they do these things And, of course, these funds have    8/17/93  built up huge investment positions in all countries And when they get scared, the hedging of those portfolios--just because of the way the hedging is done--is enough to have a very sudden and substantial impact on the exchange rate, which comes at the most awkward time from the point of view of the central banks So, I think there is a growing level of frustration, and I guess the question is Where does that frustration ultimately lead? "
