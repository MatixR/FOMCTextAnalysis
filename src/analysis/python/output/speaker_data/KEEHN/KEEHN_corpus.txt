 Our forecast is certainly quite consistent with the staff forecast as it relates to this year However, I will say that our outlook for 1988 is somewhat stronger And, I would join those who have commented that, as we go along, the revisions are likely to be up rather than down  Our District has lagged the rest of the country in the recovery, but since the end of last year that has not been the case As we look at our industries and our indicators, we are tending at least to equal the national numbers This year, for example, as we  have gone through the year, employment increases in our five states have been consistently equal to the national increases The increases have tended to be on the nonmanufacturing side, but even in the manufacturing category, we are significantly above the low level of manufacturing employment prevailing at the end of 1982 Unemployment continues to be a little higher than the national average, about a percentage point higher; nonetheless, that margin seems to be coming down And, I do think that some of the manufacturing sectors that have been going through a very difficult period are showing really surprising strength In steel, for example, which is a very tough industry, the steel plants that are producing sheet steel are about at capacity Those producing structural steel are lower than that, but nonetheless stronger than you might expect And, there are a number of other categories in the machinery side that are showing improvement A large manufacturer of diesel engines in our area is now really having a hard time keeping up with the demand; construction equipment is stronger; and even the railroad equipment business, which has been absolutely moribund, is beginning to show some signs of life All of this, of course, excludes autos, though the sale numbers for autos, as Mike is suggesting, continue to look like 10 million or more [unintelligible] this year or next year The production schedules in the third quarter will be down by about 13 percent; and for the fourth quarter, though the schedules are not final, it looks like they'll be down about 5 percent And the inventories do not seem to be out of line  On the agricultural side, I have just a quick comment I am almost hard pressed to say that, certainly, we have stabilized; and there are even some signs of improvement The land values, which in the first quarter were level, at least, did show improvement in the second quarter; those land values continue to move up a bit, albeit from very, very low levels Nevertheless, transactions that are taking place show some sign of strength in land values There was, as you know, a recent revision in farm income; and the outlook for this year is for a significant increase and, therefore, those farm income numbers look pretty good Surprisingly--or at least I find it surprising--the increase in farm income is not a result of higher subsidies, but rather of a decrease in production costs, which is an encouraging sign So that part of the agricultural sector looks pretty good Admittedly, we have a long way to go before the harvest, but at this point the growing conditions look good We would anticipate good crop yields per acre and, in some areas, there will be record production The overall production will be down by 12 percent; the acreage is down even more-- say, 14 percent; but, again, we have a net improvement in yield So, I do think the conditions in the District are much improved for the rest of this year and into next year  -13-    8/18/87  But, as I pointed out, there are a couple of key areas On this trade balance issue, I've had the feeling all year that we were seeing a correction; the people I talk to suggest that that is the case The June numbers were certainly disappointing I hope there's nothing fundamental there But if the major economies in the world do not turn around and begin to pick up and take our exports, this obviously will have a big impact On the inflation side, we are seeing some of the price increases that Mike mentioned They are in a couple of categories Specifically, in steel, one manufacturer increased prices 4 to 6 percent and this time they're sticking--again, at very low levels But if these price increases begin to become pervasive, and then go through to the labor side, I think the outlook for inflation will be quite different I don't yet sense that All the people I talk to who are negotiating labor contracts are continuing to get very good results reasonably modest increases on an annual basis, and importantly, very good work rule changes, so that productivity and unit labor costs seem to be better But, I do think these are, of course, the two key areas the trade balance and inflation Net, I think the economy, both nationally and in our District, continues to look good and seems to be improving As we go along here, there is the opportunity for increasing the growth forecast   Mr Chairman, I would be in agreement with the position that Jerry Corrigan laid out For reasons that have been well stated, it certainly seems to me that the economic opportunities at this point are on the upside and not on the downside On the inflationary pressures, though admittedly far from conclusive, we may be going through something of a bubble here Nonetheless, the signs are there and I do think it is appropriate that we begin to move against that I find the aggregates' performance this year to have been erratic They may emerge on a more predictable basis, but as yet I don't see the evidence of that Therefore, I find the alternatives, in terms of aggregate growth rates, to be a little awkward Accordingly, I would prefer to deal with the borrowing level and, given the circumstances, I think a borrowing level between "A" and "B", namely, $600 million, would be appropriate In terms of the wording of the directive, I would be in favor of "would" for [greater] restraint and "might" for lesser restraint And I do think that this sentence on the next page [of the Bluebook] does, at least preliminarily, convey the reverse meaning I think we might fiddle with the language on that to get a more appropriate wording   Peter, you suggested that the increase in long- term rates is a combination of factors, with inflation being one But, in the combination of factors, how persistent is the inflation concern and is it just one of those issues?   But it is more that side as opposed to domestic pressures?   Thank you, Mr Chairman From a national perspective, our forecast is really very consistent with the staff forecast I would say that we have been a little higher throughout the year and, therefore, the last revision by the staff brings it pretty much in line with our perspective  With regard to the District, whereas we have been a laggard throughout this recovery, certainly, at this point we have turned around The conditions and the trends in the District I think are very favorable Employment, for example, is very consistent with the national numbers Our unemployment is still higher than the national average, but I do think the employment numbers are coming along quite well  I thought I would comment on just a couple of industries that are important to the District that I think are going through an interesting and positive adjustment First, the steel industry is a very dramatic example of a shift that is taking place in a very troubled industry We have had in the Midwest just a whole host of closings, bankruptcies, and near-bankruptcies, and, in addition, some shutdown of capacity; but those who have survived and those who have put some money into the plants, and have modernized them, certainly at this point are doing very well The decline in the dollar and the import restrictions have helped tremendously, but the demand for domestic steel is strong, and as a consequence, the plants are operating at a much better rate The demand for steel products seems to be quite broadly based, and now is as strong as any time since 1981 In getting to a point you raised earlier, many of these products are on allocation; the delivery times are clearly moving up from eight to nine weeks, so there is a slowdown in the delivery process The service centers, as I understand it, are trying to build inventories but are not able to do it; inventory is going out as fast as it comes in And, not surprisingly, there is something of a price increase going on in the industry and the price increases for the first time in this cycle may really seem to be sticking A tangible sign of an improvement in this industry in the last six or eight months is that we've had an announcement of two new steel plants in Indiana one a joint venture with a Japanese company, which is quite a significant installation; and the second a stand-alone facility   No, the Japanese one, I think, is fairly specialized; but they are brand new plants centrally located   No, not importing--they are taking slab out of a Chicago mill and cold-rolling it in Indiana So, I do think it's an industry that has gone through a tremendous transition The other industry that is important to the District is heavy duty trucks--Class 8 trucks Sales this year, I think, are going to be 13 or 14 percent higher than last year, and the outlook for next year is another increase of 3 to 4 percent These will go up to 125,000 to 130,000 units and this is just a lot higher than what we were experiencing three or four years ago There is still a lot of capacity in that manufacturing process but, nevertheless, this is a business that seems to have gotten better Pricing is still tough, however Nevertheless, from the District's perspective, it has been good  Let me say a quick word about agriculture by adding a little to what I've said in the past namely, conditions seem to have stabilized, albeit at low levels Land values are beginning to move; transactions are higher, and in a couple of instances, significantly higher But, the point I'd make on what I find to be a new development is that general business conditions, not just agricultural conditions, in the area of Iowa seem to be better  Turning to the price issue, I must say that I find this a very, very difficult read I keep hearing about price increases; I've commented on steel, but specialized chemicals, paper, paper products, brass, and copper all seem to be moving up in price They don't show up yet in the CPI numbers The competitive conditions for finished products are very tough and people are being squeezed on margins; but, at some point, you just have to think that this is going to poke through On the wage side, I'd add to the comments that we are hearing about shortages We were up in Michigan the other day doing a presentation and some of the people were commenting that they just can't get enough people to work in some of the operations there I would think that, at some point, we are going to see something of an increase on wage rates that's beyond what we've had over the last year or so  Turning then, Mr Chairman, to your question on long-term rates, which is a very, very key issue, like Jerry, I think it is awfully hard to analyze each part But, I think that the underlying rate of economic activity here is pretty good; it may be a little more rapid than we expected and, therefore, there may be some real pressure on rates Also--and I can't analyze what part equals what--on the inflation side, I think there is growing skepticism out there; there is concern about inflation, and something in the rate increase that we have experienced certainly has to relate to that Thank you   I agree with alternative B, and I have a preference, at least, for the asymmetrical language as it is currently Also, if there were going to be a bias, then I suppose the best nuance for the bias about borrowing would be up rather than down from the $600 million level But I do think changing the fed funds range from 5 to 9 percent perhaps would accomplish that bias   Right I would be for "B", $600 million, and a bias upward   Not really [unintelligible] instructions; it means he will just do it   Well, like Mr Prell, I think I will divide my comments into pre-event and post-event Starting with the pre-event activity certainly, the District continued to operate on a reasonably favorable basis, much along the lines that I previously have been reporting, with the exception of the auto industry The manufacturing sector has been moving along pretty well and the employment statistics have been good, very much in line with the national numbers The steel business is operating again at very, very high levels; the demand for steel products is the best we have experienced in our area since 1981 The delivery times have stretched out very considerably and many products really are being sold on allocation Construction activity remains reasonably good The conditions in agriculture are continuing to improve; land prices are up and commodity prices have improved somewhat By and large, the harvest is in and it really has been a very good harvest in our area  Moving to the post-event comments, it is too early to assess the damage but, so far at least, I don't sense from any of the people that I talk to that any of these fundamental trends that I've just noted have been badly affected Certainly at the outset, consumer spending was affected; there was a decline in retail sales as we went through the market trauma, but that seems to have leveled out I am told from people who have October retail numbers in our area that, by and large, retail sales came in this October about level with last October Looking ahead to next year, the retailers are reducing their expectations but, so far, nobody has suggested a negative trend on retail sales On the auto side, it's awfully early to tell, but one of the major producers that I talked to yesterday said that they are reducing their sales [estimates] for 1988 cars and trucks together by about 800,000 units; but they do emphasize that it's very, very early yet to assess how the consumer will react On capital expenditures, so far I have been quite impressed that there are no early signs of a sharp curtailment Most of the companies that I've talked to--those that have significant programs in place--intend to continue, unless there is a very sharp downturn in the economy They have embarked on programs that they say they will, by and large, stay with And I do find that quite encouraging So net, I think it's still too early to assess the damage I keep being favorably surprised that our early assessment isn't a little more negative than it is I think our expectations for next year will certainly be down a bit, but it is far too early to quantify We are just going to have to go through a period of some uncertainty Nonetheless, so far things seem to have come through better than I might have expected   Jerry, what's wrong with the next phrase?   Mr Chairman, I'm certainly in favor of maintaining the current policy, which I interpret to be alternative "B" And I must say I like the Corrigan wording of Variant I; I prefer Variant I to Variant II because I think it is a more honest statement of what we are doing, particularly with the language that he is proposing to amend it I'd have a slight bias in the wording toward easing, and using "would" [for easing] and "might" [for tightening] I'd be in favor of maintaining a broad range for the fed funds rate And I don't feel strongly about it, but I think in the interest of consistency and stability I'd stay with the 5 to 9 percent   In the interest of consistency and stability, I'd stay with 5 to 9 percent, but I don't feel very strongly about it   Earlier, somebody suggested that in line 5 we change that "outlook may call for" to "may continue to call for" That's appropriate   At this point I'm not sure I can handle it! I was intrigued with a line at the end of Ann-Marie Meulendyke's memorandum which says that what apparently started out as a temporary procedure has persisted, with modifications, for over five years It seems to me that there hasn't been such a significant change of circumstances at this particular time that we ought to make a change [in our procedure] I'm not persuaded by either the memo or the discussion that we really have a hard basis for making a change And if we do, I think it ought to be very well grounded Having said  -35-    3/29/88  that, I would have a reluctance to shift to any kind of fed funds rate targeting We are discussing this at a fairly benign period; the economy is moving along pretty well, inflation is higher than we like but still not out of control, and the interest rate structure is pretty good But that won't always be the case As we've said a couple of times, there are going to be some circumstances in which we'll need to tighten And I think the political pressure would come to bear if we were using the fed funds rate as our focal point--then change would be very tough I'm reminded of that line "Don't shoot the piano player, he's all we've got" It seems to me the present procedure has been serving us pretty well; I don't see a reason for making a change   I certainly agree with the direction of the staff forecast, and I think that from a national perspective the economy really is improving with the passage of time That is consistent with the conditions in the District which are also improving and I think the improvement is quite broad-based I commented before on the steel business it is continuing to operate at a very high level; indeed, those in the Midwest are operating pretty much at capacity And I am beginning to hear a phrase that I haven't heard in a great many years, namely, "double ordering" People are very much in the business of double ordering for steel; and if they get both, they are pleased to take both because they basically need the steel  But there are other parts of the manufacturing sector that are showing good improvement We have been hearing for some months now about the improvement in the machine tools business from various people in the District Earlier this week we saw some articles on the improvement that is taking place in that industry Orders for mining equipment and railroad cars are better than they were--showing improvement, albeit from low levels There are no capacity problems there, but nonetheless the trend is up, not down And, almost unbelievably, the heavy construction equipment industry has turned  -42-    3/29/88  around again, quite significantly, and they are operating at a high level In farm equipment, last year's big inventories of agricultural implements have largely been worked down, as retail inventories are at a much lower level; and production in that industry is picking up Mike Prell mentioned that the auto production schedules for the second quarter are higher--some 4 percent higher for the second quarter this year as compared to last year--given higher sales in the first quarter So I think, as I look across the District, that the fundamental conditions are showing signs of improvement  The mystery in all of this, at least from my point of view, is the inflation situation I keep hearing about these big increases in prices--in steel, aluminum, other metals such as nickel, and in paper products and raw materials going into that industry  who is in the paper industry commented on the very significant price increases that they have experienced on their raw materials So far it has been at the intermediate level; it hasn't gone through into finished products But I think there are some margin squeezes out there, and I'm hearing about some anticipated price increases for example, commented that they have price increases announced for April 1; they're not sure whether the increases are going to stick because their circumstances are pretty competitive Nonetheless, some price increases in finished products are beginning to move forward Certainly, that has not shown through in the price indices; and there would be no reason to make a change in policy now based on the indices While the economic outlook continues to be favorable, and I think we can clearly be pleased with the outlook, there are these upward pressures And I think the worry has to be on the inflationary side That is the part of this that we have to be particularly alert to   Don, back on seasonal borrowings--a question related to what I asked Peter at the outset this morning Doesn't a $200 million borrowing level, now that seasonal borrowing is going up, really represent, in a slight sense at least, an easing of policy?   Mr Chairman, I feel a little ambivalent, certainly not regarding the direction, but regarding the question of timing We have talked about that a lot Ed Boehne phrased it much the way I would I would not move on the borrowing today, because I think it would be pretty quick after the last move and might perhaps signal a little more to the markets than we would intend And we want to do this in an orderly way So, I would bring the level up by $100 million as soon as we think the markets can accommodate that; I don't know whether that's a week or two weeks, something like that Certainly, I'd be in favor of asymmetric language with an upward bias    5/17/88  in the policy directive And I think it's not only possible, but very likely, that we will move on the second $100 million before the next meeting of the Committee Whether we do that at a conference call or leave that entirely to you, I'm indifferent   Mr Chairman, economic activity in our District continues to show I think very, very considerable strength That's particularly true in the manufacturing sector, and more specifically in those activities that are either related to exports or capital goods where those operating levels continue to be very, very high The steel industry, for example, is continuing to run at quite close to capacity The third quarter is normally a period in which the steel industry shuts down a bit to deal with maintenance, but this year the maintenance is being deferred to deal with continuing demand Chemicals and paper are continuing to run at high levels Auto production schedules for the third quarter are considerably higher than in the third quarter of last year So, I do think on the capital expenditures side, Mike has certainly covered it very well I think we are going to see higher increases in capital expenditures than we may have forecast And I'm sensing from a lot of companies that they really are thinking about adding significantly to their expenditure level  I have just a couple of comments on the agricultural situation, other than crop estimates, which you've seen First, implements Interestingly, as we got started on this drought thing, it did not show up in implement sales Through June they were holding pretty well; but the July numbers are now in and, on a comparative basis, July sales of tractors and combines, for example, are considerably under last year That's not surprising, but certainly this is a negative feature Agricultural banks, a second element of agriculture comments We surveyed the agricultural banks in our District again last week, and the story I think continues to be more positive than one had expected it to be The weak producers were weeded out in the previous adjustment Those credits now on the books are farmers who are strong enough that they can deal with this drought without a renewal of significant problems among the banks  To me, the most surprising shift that I've sensed over the last month or two is this employment thing There has been, I think, quite a modification in attitudes out there There is now, I think, quite persistently a shortage of [unintelligible] The manufacturers I have talked to are running at very high levels, and their constraint really is the availability of labor to deal with it And that's also the case I think in the service sector I was talking to somebody the other day that has opened two major retail stores in Chicago They put out applications, or requests for applications, and they were flooded with people But they have high standards for their employment, and the applicants came in short on that Therefore, they have opened one of their stores very significantly undermanned As I  -14-    8/16/88  talk to people, it seems that the shortage of labor really is beginning to be felt There are a couple of key contracts for which negotiations have just started And I think people have been following that very closely My sense of all this is that the wage side and the inflation picture are going to continue to accelerate We are going to continue to see increases in wage costs   Mr Chairman, I agree with the policy pre- scription as you outlined it Going back over the past several months, I think the record's been good; we have been moving in the right way And I think it is appropriate to see if at some point this doesn't begin to have an effect But I do think it's clear from comments that we've got more to go, and the question is more of timing as opposed to the direction that we are going So, I would be in favor of the asymmetric language and a borrowing level of $600 million And I'd allow the fed funds rate to seek its own market level But also I think if there are any other indicators, I'd move again on this, and I do think the phone call procedure has worked out very well as a way of dealing with these interim changes Certainly, I would encourage continuation of that With regard to the language, I do feel that the pressure now is on the inflationary side and we ought to maintain that focus So I would leave the language in the paragraph just as it is   With regard to the national economy--with some modest adjustments for the fourth quarter of this year and the first  -12-    9/20/88  quarter of next year due mainly to agriculture--our outlook is quite consistent with the staff forecast in the Greenbook With regard to the District, there's really very little that's new to report With the obvious exception of agriculture, I think the economy continues to be really very strong But there are just a few signs of moderation-- nothing pronounced I think there are somewhat slower growth rates in a couple of parts of our economy Retail sales, for example, were much weaker in the summer months than earlier in the spring And construction activity is down a bit Another example is paperboard, which of course has been so very strong; after a string of almost two years of record monthly shipments, last month's shipments were down just a bit there  It's too early to tell if these early signs are indicative of a trend and if they're going to be sustained It's entirely possible, I think, that the trends--particularly in some of the areas that I've mentioned--are the result of the exceptionally hot weather that we've had Since the turn of the weather, I'm told by retailers that the flow of traffic in their stores is back up to more normal levels So some of these things may have been very weather related  Perhaps the lack of any significant changes could be a good thing Anecdotally, at least, I don't sense a continuation of the upward pressures on prices that were so very evident earlier this year I still think that the risks are very much on the side of greater inflation But I am beginning to hear some comments about the leveling of prices for a variety of materials--or certainly that more moderate increases are taking place as opposed to the big numbers that we had earlier this year And at least one major manufacturer that I talked to the other day is forecasting that raw material purchases next year will be level with 1988--really no increase at all  Surprisingly, consistent with what Bob Forrestal has just said, I don't sense any deterioration on the wage front Wage rates do not at this point seem to be accelerating Also, there doesn't seem to be a hardening of attitudes on the part of labor I'm told that the attitude of organized labor continues to be very constructive, given the continued progress on work-rule changes So I think the news there continues to be pretty good Companies are not losing ground on unit labor costs but, as a caveat on that, there are two major contracts out there that are currently reaching the final stages of negotiations We'll just have to wait to see how those work out Again, I think it's too early to tell whether these early signs of moderation will be sustained But certainly they are favorable, and for now it just could be the case that things are falling into line pretty well   Mr Chairman, I also agree with your recommendation I would add only one thing to it in terms of the operations of the Desk If what we're doing would suggest a federal funds rate of, say 8-1/8, I'd certainly be more comfortable with a slightly higher rate than I would with a lower rate   I think Ed and Bob make a very good point, but nonetheless I come down in favor of the change I wasn't aware of the background of the March 1st vote until I read the memorandum I always thought it was a very awkward date coming in the middle of the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony I just feel there's a little bit of confusion there for the reasons that we've said namely, that by setting the ranges we have some accountability for them I think for the rotation to be on that basis, it will be a cleaner way to do it, and I'd be in favor of the change   Sam, given the dollar-yen pressure we're experiencing and [unintelligible], are there any changes in the attitudes of the Japanese [investors] over the dollar as an overall issue?  -16-    11/1/88   Well, our outlook is broadly, in the national context, very consistent with the Board's forecast; certainly in a numerical sense that would be true, but it is perhaps a little bit different in tone From many indicators certainly, it would appear that we are experiencing some moderation in the growth rate, albeit from very high levels I think really the major question is whether or not this moderation is and will continue to flow through to prices And on this front there are just a couple of what I would view as signs, and therefore the second part of the question would be do we need to take additional steps at this point to accelerate the process We'll talk about that later  With regard to the District and consistent with the overall economy, manufacturing activity in our District as we measure it does seem to be moderating On the price front, contacts within the  -32-    11/1/88  District and certainly our directors suggest that there is a discernible leveling in price trends with regard to certain raw materials and commodities The paper industry for example where there have been very significant increases in pulp prices, weight paper, and [unintelligible] prices seem to be hitting a peak Indeed,  expects to see something of a decline in those prices over the next five or six months Aluminum prices are down; even steel is showing some signs of leveling And there are many products that have been in very short supply where the backlogs have been filling up with these distinct signs of easing  A comment about housing We would expect 1989 to be not unlike 1988 with regard to housing starts, say 14 or 145 million But in the past, production and housing starts have been attributable to interest rates who are very close to this industry, are suggesting that in fact we may be getting into an environment of some market saturation and that if new home sales don't continue at a fairly high level, we could see a buildup of inventory of unsold homes If this is true, if we're getting into some market saturation with regard to housing, I've always had a question on the auto side of how far we can continue with these very big auto years And then we could also get some market saturation in that sector  Finally, a comment on the agricultural sector I hate to mention it, but I'm going to say just one thing about aflatoxin, which is an issue that has been very badly we think blown out of proportion; it's really not as big an issue as you might expect from reading the press But the FDA's standards of aflatoxin were really very, very tight It's one of these issues where you have to eat a ton of corn flakes forever before you get into trouble Those standards have been reduced a bit, but when this first hit the exchanges corn prices took a big dive; and beans, in sympathy, also went down They've come back and I think the markets are looking through this as kind of a non- issue From a [statistically] measurable perspective, we would expect that the aflatoxin effect would have stopped, but admittedly [the price of corn] is down because the drought would only have an effect of, say, 5 to 10 percent Given this year's drought, the early anticipation is that the next year's planting will be very heavy And of course we're a million miles away from that event But the expectation is that the acreage will be up by about 35 million acres, some 12 to 14 percent And if we get some reasonable growing season [weather], production could be pretty heavy Meanwhile, land values are continuing to increase--3 percent in this most recent quarter and 4 percent over the year So, I must say net at least in our District, the agricultural sector has come through much better than one might have expected given the kind of circumstances that we were dealing with  I think from a national perspective as well as from the District's, things are in pretty good balance And I would agree that no doubt some of the moderation that we are experiencing is a reflection of the monetary policy actions that we've taken so far   Mr Chairman, I also would be in agreement with what you recommend I might have come prepared to argue for shifting language to symmetric, but I don't feel strongly about it But I do have a question about the borrowing level The $600 million--, we have been through a period where the borrowing level has been at $600 million with a significant seasonal component I meant to ask Peter about this earlier I have a feeling that at this time each year as the level of seasonal borrowing comes down, the level of adjustment borrowing builds up But there's a possibility that this shift in composition of borrowing may have caused the federal funds rate, for this and other reasons, to be a little bit higher than our anticipation And if this is the case then maybe we need to think about a precise borrowing number   But on the anticipation that $600 million is consistent with 1/8th or 1/4th, that's what I would favor   Sam, separate and apart from the central bank attitudes, what's the attitude of the participants in the markets? [Do they see] long-term trends there or is everybody kind of moving day-by-day? What are the basic attitudes?   Day-by-day?   Mr Chairman, I do find this a particularly difficult period in which to assess the outlook In his presentation I think Mike made the case, which we would agree with, that there are at least some tentative signs of moderation out there In a national context we reviewed a number of things in the Greenbook We think  -24-    3/28/89  consumer spending, particularly for durables, will be showing some sign of leveling Growth of exports is certainly short of our expectations, and that would be particularly true for industrial supplies, materials, and capital equipment The housing numbers are showing some signs of softness; interest rates have had an impact on that The railroads no longer carry the GNP but nonetheless the year- to-date numbers for rail shipments are certainly lower, particularly for February, than was the case for last year How much of this is weather-related I think is very tough to tell January was extraordinarily warm, of course, and February was at least normally cold and the seasonal adjustments may have had an impact on some of these national numbers  In a District context, we're really not seeing very much of this moderation The employment numbers throughout the District continue to be strong; we don't see any weaknesses emerging there The manufacturing outlook continues at a pretty high level The steel business, for example, is strong And the steel plants in the Midwest are exporting--admittedly from a low base--but nonetheless that's a new market for them Machine tool orders are up Railway equipment-- an industry that has been absolutely moribund over the last four or five years--is showing some signs of increased orders So, in a manufacturing context, it's our expectation that activity in the Midwest this year probably will be running ahead of the national numbers And certainly the other aspects of the Midwestern economy continue to be pretty favorable On the inflation side I have thought for quite some while that of course the risks really were, on balance, for higher levels of inflation I think that continues to be the case; but it may just be possible that we're at one of those times when the balance is shifting a little and that as we go into the upcoming period some of the moderating signs will become a bit more specific The real question--which we'll be talking about a little later--is how much more we need to do in a monetary policy sense, if in fact we need to do more   Don, maybe you answered this, but in the cool light of hindsight has the Hoey survey had a reasonable degree of accuracy?   Well, on the shorter?   Mr Chairman, I would be in favor of your recommendation, namely, alternative B But at this point I certainly would continue to favor asymmetric language Not to go further into the operational aspects of it but, if the market's perception is that the fed funds rate target is, say, 9-3/4 or 9-7/8 percent, it does seem to me that we are in a period in which there may be natural upward pressure on that rate I wouldn't resist it if the rate were moving up to 9-7/8 or 10 percent, whereas I would resist it if, in fact, the rate began to trend downward So, I'd have a clear bias toward allowing the rate to go up   Mr Chairman, I think there is increasing evidence that the economy is moderating Mike has gone over all the indicators that I would have suggested would substantiate that At the outset a couple of months ago we may have been seeing these trends because we wanted to, but at this point I do think they are becoming much more tangible The question is Will these moderating trends be sustained? My hunch is that they will and that they can be sustained without further tightening  From a District perspective, though, the moderation that we're seeing nationally is not quite as apparent Many of the industries in our District are doing pretty well--indeed, very well The auto industry is a mini exception to that but it's not a dramatic change They are reducing their forecast for the year; commonly, the sales forecast for cars is 10 million and for trucks 51 million Inventories at the dealers are very high and for the first time in years the dealers are beginning to resist the delivery of new units Therefore, production is probably going to come down The second- quarter number looks to be a reduction of about 3 percent The production risk in autos is clearly on the down side, not on the up side But as they reduce production it's going to come out of overtime; therefore, the reduction in production will not result in layoffs But the sales level of, say, that 10 million on cars and 51 million on trucks can only be maintained with the incentives that they're running As I hear it, the incentives are the richest that they have ever offered since they initiated these programs As a result of this, the steel business, at least in our District, is expected to be down--not anything significant but down certainly from last year, which was very, very heavy Other parts of the District are doing very well The demand for industrial machinery is high; chemical products demand continues to be high; construction activity, despite higher rates, also continues to be at much higher levels than the national numbers would suggest; and our employment numbers are continuing to come in quite strong  In the agricultural sector, though, we have a little different outlook than Roger's At this time of the year it's always uncertain but this year is particularly uncertain Parts of the District--specifically western Illinois, southern Iowa and southern Wisconsin--are really very dry As a consequence, the planting this year is slower and is running behind the normal schedule Also, in Michigan we've had a very cold spring and we've had some frost damage to the fruit crops There is plenty of time to recover from this before any permanent damage is done, but the next month or so is going to be pretty critical  -20-    5/16/89  On the price side, I don't see any particular changes At least as I see it there is no further deterioration Some prices-- aluminum and steel, for example--are continuing to go up but prices of other products are coming down For example, there's some weakness on some chemical products On the labor front, despite very tight labor conditions as I've reported in the past, I continue to be impressed by how well some of the contracts come out I did talk to a chief executive officer last week of a company that just concluded a very major three-year contract which calls for increases of 3-1/2 percent over the three-year period So, certainly, those numbers are coming in better than I might have expected While I see no further price deterioration, on the other hand, there's no improvement either I think the overall situation is a bit better than at the time of the last meeting It's too early to be conclusive but the outlook, at least as I see it, is more constructive   I don't have a question but an observation I find the charts to be very helpful I wouldn't advise necessarily having you send them out in advance, but I do find having these kinds of charts as you go through your presentation to be a very useful part of the presentation   Mr Chairman, I'd agree with your analysis of the situation very, very closely I would support your recommendation without change It seems to me that it would be appropriate to maintain [the current] policy under alternative B and that this is a time that we could shift toward the symmetric language   What are the disadvantages to having it show on the record?   Well, the fact that it would only be activated if those things happened, it seems to me, is consistent with what you want Also, these minutes won't come out for six weeks   Long after your--   Mr Chairman, it seems to me in a national context that the economy, as Gary has just said, is moving along just about on the track that we might have expected I think the moderating growth trends are there; there are many industries that are certainly operating at lower levels than was the case earlier Some of the interim data may be coming in a little stronger than we might have expected, or certainly than we expected the last time we met That may be particularly true on the personal consumption side But I think, basically, the situation is largely unchanged  In a District context the news is a bit mixed but on balance showing signs of moderation The steel business, for example, has been weaker but there were some seasonal issues there Last year the  -26-    8/22/89  steel industry and most of the major customers operated throughout the summer without taking the normal seasonal shutdowns This year, though, they have been operating with somewhat normal shutdowns and I think this is having an effect on the numbers Looking ahead a bit, the auto industry, as Bob [Forrestal] has suggested, [is planning] a very significant production cutback in the fourth quarter That certainly is going to have a big impact on their numbers as well as those of their suppliers The heavy truck business is much softer now and some of their main manufacturing suppliers were also scheduling layoffs The Chicago purchasing managers' report for July reflected a pattern very similar to that in the national report Alternatively though, I find that the construction business has been surprisingly strong, particularly for commercial and public works There is a lot of activity going on there Our numbers in that category are stronger than the national numbers, and I think to a lesser extent the same is true for residential construction In the agricultural sector, the news is certainly much better now than it was earlier in the summer We've had reasonably good rainfalls pretty much throughout the District Production is going to be good Farm land values are continuing to go up a little more modestly this year than they were going up last year And in the improved environment, the agricultural picture is much better Products are moving off the dealers' lots at a pretty good rate I think the price picture is also good Prices of some basic materials, which over the last couple of years had shown big increases, are now down There are some chemical products--zinc and lead--that I think are examples of that; and others are showing smaller increases The competitive factors remain pretty intense, so finished prices are remaining in pretty good check  So at this point, I think the economy is developing very much in line with our expectations, at least But I will say our forecast has been a little [unintelligible] than the Board staff's forecast has been Some of the data are coming in on the positive side but I think the underlying risks are about the same as they have been On monetary policy some things are working out just about as we'd like to have them   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation and your statement I have a mini preference for asymmetric language because, as we see it, the moderating trends are likely to continue But I don't feel particularly strongly about it   I have a question not with regard to Peter's report on the operations but on the seasonal borrowing program We basically hear about the borrowing within [unintelligible] rather high And I'm not sure that fundamental underlying conditions are that different It's easy to believe that people are perhaps using it, hopefully, advantageously I just raise the question Are we going to take a look at the use of the seasonal program before we get into next year?   At this point, Don, or--   Well, I think you're right It seems to me it complicated the operation of the Desk on the way up and it's likely to complicate it on the way down If people are using it for different reasons [other than] seasonal borrowings, I think it makes sense to take a look at it   Mr Chairman, the overall situation, particularly as it relates to the Midwest, is largely consistent with a pattern that has been developing over the past several months--namely, moderation in many sectors It is not in any way a sense of deterioration, but a tendency [for activity] to come down toward a level more consistent with our forecast This moderation is particularly true in the heavy manufacturing part of our economy For example orders for the large trucks, Class A trucks, have slowed very considerably; orders for heavy construction equipment are down substantially; and some categories of machine tools are also off Offsetting this, construction activity in the District continues to be pretty strong, stronger than the national numbers Certainly, the automotive sector is difficult to read I agree with Mike's categorization; I think the strong sales level in August that was carried over in September is largely for the 1989 [models] and is in anticipation of the substantial price increases for 1990 cars Also, there are very heavy incentives on the 1989 models As a consequence, dealers are selling out of their inventories and the order level from the dealers to the manufacturers I'm told recently has all but collapsed As a consequence, the auto production schedules have been reduced substantially in the fourth quarter and the reductions planned for the first quarter of next year are even more substantial than that So, anybody who is dealing with the auto sector is beginning to  -28-    10/3/89  take on a fairly bearish tone In the agricultural area, the news is good The harvest has started and we are anticipating good production on both corn and soybeans--not record crops, but substantially higher than last year And our expectation is that, within the District, the USDA estimates of production are probably a little on the low side On the price front, it's hard to get a good sense of where prices are going, at least from the reports I get The Chicago purchasing managers' index came out earlier this week and the price component of that was at 50 I think that's reflective of the comments that I hear some prices are up and some prices are down, but there's no decided trend one way or the other On the wage front also there is no change The settlements, in my view at least, continue to be quite constructive and not indicative of the wage pressures that you might expect On net, I think the economy is moving along on a constructive but moderating trend Not unlike the Greenbook, I think the outlook for the balance of this year and, indeed, the early part of next year is assured, but I'm beginning to get concerned as to what a continuation of our current policy may mean as we get further out into next year   I'd be in favor of alternative B and asymmetric language It seems to me that what we're basically saying is no change in policy A word change is awfully minimal; nonetheless, I'd prefer remaining with asymmetric language at this point   Don't we have a fairly long paper coming up?   Conditions in the District seem quite consistent with the national trend of moderation, but the moderation is perhaps a bit more apparent in the District because of our very significant commitment to manufacturing and also the importance of the auto companies and export-related activity And because of that, I think manufacturing may be showing something more of a downturn in our area than is true in the rest of the country Just to add a word or two to the automotive comments that we've already heard clearly, sales are down from the higher levels that were recorded this summer My contacts in Detroit suggest that November and December levels will continue to be under--and I think quite considerably under--the average for the year as a whole Even though the fourth-quarter production schedules for the domestics are down, nonetheless they anticipate that they are going to go through the end of the year with pretty high inventories at the dealer level As a consequence, at least one manufacturer has a preliminary forecast of these variables and what strikes me is the size of the decline in production for the first quarter down 18 percent compared to last year Other automotive-related businesses obviously are showing signs of weakness Heavy trucks are down significantly and diesel engine orders for one manufacturer are down 40 percent in September Given all of this, the unemployment levels in the District are showing signs of increase In Illinois, for example, unemployment went from 62 percent in September to 68 percent in October; in Michigan it went from 81 to 82 percent If you look at the District as a whole, unemployment numbers are clearly over the national average  But offsetting that trend there is, I think, some good news in the District First, the steel business--and it surprises me--has been quite good The industry has been working off some pretty high inventory positions in a variety of products They seem to be about through that So there is an expectation that for some products production is going to pick up For 1989 shipments are forecast at about 83 million tons; for 1990 the number is lower--from 80 to 81 million tons--but still hardly a [unintelligible] Farm equipment has been particularly good, given that the production of crops has been completed Farm income, of course, is good and expected to remain good Large tractor sales in the third quarter were 15 percent over last year; combine sales were 86 percent over last year's Clearly, that's a part of the industry that is doing much better Production is higher but they are going to be very careful not to build up too high an inventory position Construction activity in the District, particularly on the commercial side, remains surprisingly strong For [unintelligible], for example, we have about 13 million square feet available for lease and another 9 million under construction So, we're heading toward a vacancy rate that's going to be in the 15  -12-    11/14/89  percent area, which for us is pretty high Despite that, new building seems to be coming on  On the inflation side, by and large the current developments are consistent with some moderation built in over a long period of time Marketplace conditions for farm products seem to be very tight, with not as much latitude there as people would like In fact, some prices are coming down In the steel business, for example, the steel plate--[load] bearing or structural--prices really are coming down And in agriculture, despite this significant improvement in business, they expect price increases next year of about 3 percent--not as much as they would like and certainly very low levels On the wage front, wage rates are going up but I don't sense any particular big breakout on the up side And in the manufacturing sector, at least among those that I talk to, people have overcome the [wage] increases with productivity improvements so that costs are remaining in line So, things are working out about as we expected I think the fourth- quarter numbers, as more of them begin to emerge, are going to evidence considerably more weakness than we saw in the third quarter   Mr Chairman, I agree with your assessment It seems to me that in a broad sense we are accomplishing what we set out to do and that it's coming out about as we would have expected I do think the discussion around the table indicates that the economy is far different this time than was the case the last time Having said that, I think we've done quite a bit over the last month or two and this is an appropriate time to simply stand back and see how things work out I'd be in favor of alternative B I don't feel strongly about the language, but would have a slight preference for asymmetric   Sam, related to that Did they ask us to share, and what did we say by way of opposition?   Mr Chairman, [unintelligible] the advent of spring weather, but within a District context I sense that the level of economic activity has improved at least modestly both in tone and in fact January and February were really very weak, of course, mainly because of the auto business, and that has persisted I think there has been some improvement For example, the steel business is much better Orders are coming in from a fairly broad spectrum of industries, backlogs are up, and in some cases shipments are being deferred Those I talk to are continuing to forecast shipments this year of, say, 81 to 82 million tons, and if there are any revisions, they are more likely to be up rather than down Construction activity in the District continues to be strong, indeed above the national numbers There continue to be just an awful lot of commercial projects coming along in Chicago Vacancy rates are still in line but I hope we're not beginning to replicate the New England experience Downtown Indianapolis, the different part of the District, apparently is going through a very substantial commercial real estate growth phase Home sales are ahead of last year and permits continue to be high, which is indicative of a continuing good level of housing Machinery business is quite good, with agricultural equipment for example at very high levels The outlook is good for that industry; production schedules would suggest an 8 percent increase over last year  The big uncertainty continues to be the automobile sector Certainly, the incentives of January are lame The first 20-day sales of March were very much on the weak side Unsold inventory is up a bit but not out of line for this time of year Second-quarter production schedules look to be about 25 percent higher than the first quarter but still would be lower than the second quarter of last year And in the case of one manufacturer, it's a substantial reduction from last year The industry continues to forecast [sales of] cars and light trucks together of [14-1/2 million] That number happens to be  -23-    3/27/90  a little higher than our number but they are anticipating a pretty good second half to come up to that higher number  In the agricultural sector, there has been a very significant improvement over the last few weeks At the last meeting I reported that the moisture issue was a significant concern We've had very good rains over the last three or four weeks and at the meeting of our agricultural advisory council last week we heard that the planting conditions are the best they've seen in quite a number of years For livestock, the outlook continues to be very good Land values are continuing to move up fairly slowly, which I think is constructive  On the credit side, I've talked to a number of banks within the last few weeks and, despite the numbers to the contrary, I think there's a difference in opinion on commercial real estate I sense some shutdown on that Also, I will say that I've heard of one project in Chicago in which a Japanese bank was going to participate and within the last few days it has backed out Our small business advisory council last week reported that they do sense some tightening of credit conditions and attitudes on the part of lenders More paperwork is required, more detail, more this and that; therefore, it's making it harder for the smaller companies to get credit  On the inflation side, our outlook is perhaps a bit better than the staff forecast Competitive conditions continue to be pretty intense Price increases just aren't sticking, at least in the full sense There has been enough new capacity in some industries--and I think paper is a good example of that--that the [competitive] price pressures will continue Wage settlements seem favorable and are not in any way getting out of line Offsetting that, though, just as a couple of negative items, I keep hearing about huge percentage increases in health care costs that are going through Also, as a different item, we're starting to hear from some companies about the increase in transportation costs that they're beginning to experience  We have had a somewhat more positive view on the economy than the staff and, therefore, we think the upward revision that Mike has gone through is appropriate We continue to think that the outlook for inflation is perhaps a bit better than the staff forecast, but I'd have to admit that our worry level on the inflation side is certainly higher at this meeting than was the case at the last meeting   Mr Chairman, I think you summed the situation up very well; I happen to agree with your conclusions As I said earlier, I think the risks on the inflation side may have shifted upward a bit, but I'm really still hopeful that as we get further into the year the numbers will show some improvement without our necessarily having tightened policy Therefore, at this point I'd be in favor of maintaining our policy and would have a preference for symmetric language I would only add that I don't in any way view symmetric language as limiting action on our part during the interim period if something should develop that would call for that   Mr Chairman, overall conditions in the District are pretty much unchanged from the last meeting We seem to have stabilized at a level reasonably consistent with our outlook for the balance of the year, namely sustained growth at, say, a 2-1/4 percent rate I have a couple of specific comments First, on the auto sector, which Mike has covered At this point it looks as if some of the uncertainties in the industry early in the year have been clarified, with the very large unsold inventories having been worked down now to I think reasonable levels, particularly for this time of the year Production levels in the second quarter will be lower than last year by about 12 percent on average but significantly higher, of course, than in the first quarter And the early outlook for the third quarter is that production levels will be higher than was the case last year, but last year's third quarter was comparatively a quite weak quarter I think there's a slight change in sentiment among the auto dealers They have gone from being very, very negative to at least being cautious But my understanding is that on a national basis some 50 percent of them are still losing money And clearly, it takes very big incentives to move cars at this point The sales outlook for the year--adding cars and light trucks together--I'm told by the industry is about 14-1/2 million units They think that's very disappointing But having said that, they think their trend line is about 15 million units; so it seems to me that on a broader prospective 14-1/2 million in sales is a pretty reasonable year A major uncertainty, of course, is the labor negotiation coming up in the fall It is just far too early to tell how that's going to work out It certainly does have the potential to have a big impact on production  The steel business seems to be reasonably good; production levels are in the 85 to 86 percent area Sales of some steel products are coming in at about 100 percent of capacity and backlogs have now moved up to 82 to 83 days As a consequence, we are seeing some price  -13-    5/15/90  increases in the steel business and, given these kinds of pressures, those increases are sticking The expectation is that prices will go up about 5 percent on average next year In construction, surprisingly, both commercial and residential numbers in the District continue to move ahead of the national numbers But I think we're going to see a big change and that there will be some reduction Clearly, there is a curtailment of credit for commercial projects But everybody I talk to says it's simply a result of having had far too much money going into too many projects and it's going to take a while for the absorption rate to dig into the vacancy rates While the construction numbers probably will be a little lower than was our early expectation, offsetting that is our expectation that the opportunity for exports for the year will be a little better than we might have guessed The level of the dollar has not been impeding sales and any reduction in the dollar along the lines that Sam suggested simply will add to a more positive outlook there  In the agricultural sector, I was really pleased to hear that planting conditions have been excellent In fact, in Iowa a number of people describe conditions as the best they've seen in a good many years The corn crop is largely in; the soybean crop will go in within the next two weeks These better conditions will be reflected in a good increase in the demand for agricultural equipment Industry sales of large tractors and combines are running significantly ahead of last year  On the inflation side, the outlook is certainly less clear; it's difficult to tell how the first-quarter aberrations are going to work out as we go along here But we are still, I think, a bit more optimistic than Mike in that we see some improving trends in inflation as we get out toward the end of the year Market pricing for manufactured products continues to be very, very competitive There's a lot of pressure [to hold down] price increases, given capacity additions as well as foreign competition, [but] I think we're going to continue to see some price pressures In the services sector, though, there are some increases that are more disturbing; that would be most particularly true in regard to health care But on the wage side, basically increases seem to be continuing okay One very unusual example I talked to somebody who negotiated a six-year contract with the machinists union the other day, which provides for an annual cost increase of 2 percent and some unusual features I think that's an indication that wage pressures continue to be pretty tight  On a national basis, we think that the outlook for growth continues to be positive But certainly we're going to need to see some improvement in the inflation rate We continue to be optimistic, as I say, but pretty soon we're going to have to see that evidenced by better numbers on the inflation side   Mr Chairman, for the reasons you stated, I'd also be in favor of alternative B and would have a preference for symmetrical language The only other thing I would add is a question of timing Now, [unintelligible] I would not expect a lot to come out of the budget negotiations But it does seem to me that this could be an awkward time to be adjusting policy if in fact there is at least a possibility that something could come out of the budget discussions   The budget deficit numbers that Peter mentioned, particularly the $300 billion, are a little higher than I had heard That is a combination of lower revenues and higher expenditures, I presume On the expenditure side, is it mainly the RTC-related expenses or are there other categories that are also going up? If you take that higher number, is there any way that we can finance that without having big upward pressure on rates?   Mr Chairman, reporting first on the conditions in the District prior to the Middle East events, I must say I certainly was surprised, positively, by the resilience of the Midwest and the ability of the District economy to rise above the national trend, at least so far Certainly, the GNP revisions reduced our baseline forecast at least somewhat, but pre-Middle East events we continued to have a positive expectation for the economy We forecast continued improvement this year and into next year  I have a couple of specific comments The steel business continues to be good A company I talked with is currently operating at a level of 85 percent of capacity; their order books are full for the third quarter; the fourth-quarter orders are coming in well; and they have not experienced the normal summer slowdown that they generally do each year They continue to look for shipments this year of 83 to 84 million tons, which is about equal with last year And even prior to the Middle East events, there was something of a boomlet going on in steel used in energy-related activities Demand for sheet and bar continues to be good The only significant change in their order book is that they do see a downturn in the demand for heavy structural items that would go into commercial construction Recent price increases in the steel industry have been sticking, but on average they are still at this time some 6 percent under last year In the construction area, on a year-to-date basis both nonresidential and residential construction in the District have been comparatively strong We've had plus numbers in both categories versus negative numbers on a national basis And just one item, the backlog for cement shipments, currently is running some 40 percent higher this year than last year, at least for one shipper But having said that, I do sense in a more current perspective that there are not only postponements of some major commercial projects but some outright cancellations I think within the last couple of weeks even in the Midwest there has been a change of attitudes there One supplier to the commercial construction business tells me that their attitudes are rather worse now than they have experienced since 1981 or 1982  The auto business continues to be a sector of enormous uncertainty But I did talk to one company as late as last Friday and they continue to hold to a sales forecast for cars and light trucks together of 144 million for this year And they're looking at 143 million for next year While those numbers, at least in my eyesight, look pretty good, their baseline number is 154 million So, when they're under that baseline number by that amount, they think conditions are pretty negative Third-quarter production schedules this year are up 17 percent over last year; fourth-quarter schedules  -15-    8/21/90  are up 10 percent over last year But, clearly, the production risks at this point are on the down side And even this late into the third quarter the projected pickup of 17 percent is likely to be erroneous Meanwhile, auto dealer attitudes are very negative One would expect some pickup in orders because of the possibility of a strike; despite that, dealers just aren't ordering cars But again, for the company that I talked to, 27 percent of their dealers are operating at a loss, which accounts for the negativism The heavy truck business is bad One manufacturer we talked to is looking for shipments of class E trucks, the heavy trucks, this year of 125,000 units; that's lower than others that are at 133,000 to 135,000 Again, that's against the baseline number of about 160,000 So, clearly, they're having a very bad year  In the agricultural sector, growing conditions continue to be very good, but because of late plantings and the reasonably cool summer that we've had so far, crops are a bit slower [coming in] than normal The yield is going to be determined largely by the timing of the first frost If we have a reasonable break on that first frost, production could be excellent and, indeed, farm income will be high There's a shot at least at having a record farm income  With regard to credit and lending conditions, I continue to think that this is really a phenomenon caused by the banks themselves going through a self-correcting process I think they've raised their lending standards But even with the increases in C&I lending by the District weekly reporting banks lower this year than last, the numbers are nonetheless positive And C&I lending by small banks in the District is higher this year than was the case last year So, maybe we're seeing a bottoming in this trend--at least in genuine C&I lending, taking out merger-related activity and the like I am reassured by the bankers that for good credits--they do emphasize the word "good"--there is plenty of money available But they do all say that they have raised their credit standards  Shifting to a post-Middle-East-events comment and a look at the national economy, I think it's just too early to assess the damage that we're likely to experience Having said that, I haven't talked to anybody so far who specifically has changed their business pattern or what they are doing in the way of operations Some companies are going through their capital budgets, but there are some contradictory [comments] on that Some companies are planning to pull back on their capital spending programs, but I did talk to one company that's doing quite the opposite They are now in the process of accelerating their capital spending because they sense that the level of inflation will be higher and, therefore, they want to get their expenditures in before that occurs  Now, I continue to have a feeling, at least in an intuitive sense, that the economy is operating at a very moderate level and that the Middle East events certainly are a negative in all this But it's awfully hard to judge the outlook at this particular point And, therefore, certainly in the monetary policy sense, it's a very awkward period   Mr Chairman, I absolutely agree with the solution that you describe in what is at best a very difficult situation Therefore, I would support alternative "B" with asymmetric language toward ease I have one minor operative difference, and it relates to the question that Lee Hoskins raised Looking ahead, I do think the chances are that we will be easing policy sooner than we will be tightening it And it seems to me that these kinds of situations happen very, very quickly and that there are brief windows in which we would have an opportunity to make a change Therefore, I would not be uncomfortable--if you were to become aware of something and you felt we did not necessarily have time to bring the Committee together--if you were to go ahead and make a change without a phone call   Yes, that's how I interpreted it   That's my point  SPEAKER(?) That's the point   Thank you, Mr Chairman In a District context, there really is very little recent specific data that will give a meaningful indication as to where the economy is going Everybody is in a state of suspended animation--waiting to see how some of these major uncertainties will work out But I agree with Mike that there's a considerable dichotomy between the sentiment out there and the underlying facts On balance, though, I think the District economy is continuing to show further moderation We're still doing a bit better than other parts of the country, but I think the growth rate is coming down  Despite that, I'm quite surprised, really, that some of the basic businesses are better than I might have expected The steel business, for example, continues to be strong; and as the year has gone forward it really has shown improvement They started this year expecting shipments of about 80 to 81 million tons; that number has come up and we're close enough to the end of the year that 84 million tons looks like a very safe [bet by the] fourth quarter Order books are basically full; there are some orders being delayed but no outright cancellations that I'm aware of Meanwhile, though, those in the steel business are trying to raise prices where they can and when they can, and to some extent the increases are sticking The construction business in the Midwest has finally hit the air pocket that others have experienced The August numbers, both residential and nonresidential, showed declines--not perhaps as significant as in other parts of the country--but they were down, and that's the first time we've experienced that General attitudes of those in the construction business are, understandably, quite pessimistic  In the auto sector, sales expectations certainly are being reduced The third-quarter number for cars and light trucks together came in at 146 million The fourth-quarter number is now down to 142 million and that brings 1990 down to 143 million; there has been a steady erosion as we've gone through the year For 1991, at least at the company I talk to, they are expecting 14 million at this point; but they have brought that down from 143 million the last time I talked to them and from 149 million the time before that So, it clearly has been coming down In the September numbers that Mike referred to, fleet sales apparently had an impact both on the first, but maybe most particularly, the second 10-day period of September; those sales were moved forward a little earlier than is normally the case to deal with production schedules The fourth-quarter production schedules for the auto companies are higher than last year, but last  -21-    10/2/90  year was a comparatively low period Clearly, the production risks are on the down side which, of course, is exactly what happened in the third quarter They had a very big production increase scheduled for the third quarter and they reduced that right through that period As an aside, the heavy duty truck business has been and continues to be very, very soft The news out of that area is bad  The agricultural sector continues to be strong Another week or so of this good weather and crop production is just going to be excellent Farm income, despite low commodity prices, is going to be "pretty good," which means really very good There is some uncertainty and the budget resolution adds to that uncertainty As a consequence, the agricultural equipment business seems to have plateaued And as the major manufacturers look forward to next year, they think it's possible that equipment sales have plateaued and that 1991 will not be as good as 1990, and that's the first time in 2-1/2 years that we've had that comparison  On the price side, I must say as I talk to a lot of people around the District, that they are using opportunities to raise prices where they can Many of them felt they got burned the last time around on this energy issue and this time rather than waiting and putting through more major increases on an annual basis they are trying to add a little here and a little there whenever they have an opportunity Whether the competitive conditions are going to permit that remains to be seen  What to me is the most worrisome is this attitudinal issue While the current level of activity seems to be pretty good and there is certainly no evidence of accelerating deterioration, most businesses are worried about a recession And many of the CEOs that I talk to are running their businesses as if we are going to get into a recession They are looking at their plans for 1991 very carefully They are trying to curtail capital spending where they can The risk, of course, is that this could become a self-fulfilling prophecy and we could experience something of a downturn as a result Therefore, Mike's forecast looks entirely reasonable from our perspective Because of that and given the budget resolution and the other caveats, with respect to policy I think we need to be alert to the opportunity to respond to potential weakness   What might the timing of that be, assuming you go through with it?   Fairly near term?   Could I ask an operational question to be sure I have this clear? You're suggesting that we ease early next week, say, Tuesday Is the purpose of that easing to respond to the tightening that has taken place in the market?   That was the question Are you then suggesting we would ease 25 basis points near term before that?   That would be after the 13 individual appropriations have been done and the situation clarifies?   I would absolutely agree with your proposal as to both timing and methodology, which I would gather is alternative B as Don verbally described it, with asymmetric language now and an assumption that we may move next week with a continuation of asymmetric language   In the Bluebook there is a comment about the Japanese banks borrowing overnight and about the fact that [such borrowing] apparently doesn't have an impact on the domestic rate I'm not quite clear how that works   A premium   Because the sentence really is no longer operative, as we discussed, I would very, very strongly favor eliminating it altogether There is another option if we feel we can't do that Sort of coupling the third and fourth alternatives with the word "and" may cover all the circumstances--and indeed are the circumstances under which we would want a consultation But I prefer dropping it altogether   Mr Chairman, in the District context, I think our part of the Midwest is still operating at a better level than is true of the national indicators Nonetheless, clear signs of weakening are beginning to emerge In the steel business the plants are operating at a comparatively high level, at about 84 percent of capacity; and at this point of the year, the year being really all but done, they are rather sure that they will see shipments this year of about 84 million tons So comparatively, it's quite a good year But    11/13/90  for the first time in quite some while, they're seeing a deferment of orders Two markets that in particular have this phenomenon are autos and appliances; appliances really have been very, very weak  The price increases that have gone into effect in the steel business certainly are not sticking; competitive pressures, I'm told, have been very tough and, therefore, the price increases really are not sticking The automotive sector we talked a little about this afternoon An explanation I would offer for the strength in sales relates to this fleet sale phenomenon The company that I talked with has had a very significant increase in the fleet component of their sales Going back to 1987, for example, fleet sales were about 27 percent of their total volume; this year they are going to be about 35 percent That selling is largely behind [them] at this point of the year Therefore, they are reducing their production schedules, which we talked about, and they have reduced their sales outlook for the industry next year--cars and light trucks--to about 14 million units  In the agricultural sector, though obviously we have had a good crop year, the production and sales of agricultural equipment are down There is a lot of uncertainty out there in the market because of the impact the tax bill is going to have on subsidies That uncertainty has caused farmers to defer major purchases And in order to keep inventories in line, some of the major producers are planning significant layoffs between now and the end of January so they can keep inventories low Heavy construction equipment is declining, reflecting [weaker] conditions in real estate, mining, and forest products And real estate construction, which in our area had been holding up I think surprisingly well, is now showing signs of softness in both residential and commercial sectors Interestingly, I've had a chance to talk to a number of different architectural firms recently and their business has just absolutely stopped There are no new projects coming on line; they're finishing off some of them, but new projects have just dried up Retail sales, particularly in those areas that are affected by the auto sector, are weak and home appliances are pointed out as being something particularly soft  In the financial sector, I think there's still a question but we are seeing a tightening of credit conditions The banks have raised their credit standards and also certainly are raising their prices for credit extensions There is a growing apprehension that there's going to be a very significant tightness in the markets as we get close to the end of the year A lot of banks are beginning to play with [unintelligible] measures to be sure that they get past the year-end [unintelligible] Therefore, I think it's the time when capital ratios could be impacted by year-end transactions that [unintelligible] some measures to control that With regard to inflation, excluding energy, I sense [price trends] are showing signs of, if not improving, certainly not getting any worse And given the weakening economic circumstances the [competitive] pressures, I think, are very high Labor costs particularly are showing similar and reasonable restraint  Now, I don't think anybody is forecasting anything like a collapse; nonetheless, I do think we are seeing signs of weakening and it's perhaps very likely that we're in for a rough quarter or two Certainly our outlook in a national context for the fourth quarter of  -27-    11/13/90  this year and the first quarter of next year would be consistent at least in direction with the forecast that the staff has given   I concur with your recommendation   Peter, I think maybe you have answered the question, but let me just go back over it again On this year-end issue, I keep hearing that because of capital level constraints this year the year-end pressures are going to be particularly tough Are you saying that was the case but [unintelligible] a bit?   Thank you, Mr Chairman While in a comparative sense economic activity in the District has been stronger than the national economy, as I have commented at past meetings, I think there has been a clear downward shift both in sentiment as well as in the underlying level of activity itself Probably the greatest impact-- and Mike can certainly comment on this--has been in the auto sector We've finally reached the point where these fleet sales have moved through the system And that had kept both production and sales at a higher level than we would have expected over the last several months Given that, I think sales levels probably will be down and will be more reflective of underlying consumer demand As a result, sales forecasts have been reduced One manufacturer that I talked to has reduced its sales expectations for next year by about 1 million units --down to 13-1/2 million units And even that is dependent on a pretty good improvement in the second half of the year At this point the auto inventories are at pretty reasonable levels with days supply around the mid-80s, and that's certainly better than was the case last year Nonetheless, production schedules for the first quarter of next year are down substantially And the manufacturers say the risk is clearly on the down side--that they probably will be reduced even further as we get into the quarter All of this is backing up into the suppliers to the auto industry; they've seen very significant cutbacks in their orders So, the backup is beginning to be pretty pervasive both in Michigan and Indiana, which are heavy suppliers to the industry  Another swing factor has been the level of construction activity We also have finally been hit by this Commercial contract awards have all but stopped At this point we have quite a number of projects that are still [some distance from their] completion dates So, we're going to have a lot of floor space coming on and, therefore, vacancy rates which already are beginning to climb certainly are going to be climbing even further We're going to have some cash flow problems developing in some of the developer areas For home starts, our numbers are perhaps not off as much as the national numbers, but currently we're seeing a downturn there as well The volume of home sales this year is significantly lower than last year  In the good news category, in the agricultural sector the production levels clearly were high, although the prices weren't quite as good as farmers would have liked Farm incomes at the end of the year are really in very good shape and I think the farm sector is in pretty good balance Many of the uncertainties that were bothering them before are behind us Farm equipment sales next year are expected to be about level with this year There are going to be some layoffs in that sector to bring inventories into line, but the farm outlook seems to be pretty good  It is hard to get a fix on retail sales, particularly this early in the season My hunch is that the Christmas season will come in better than a lot [unintelligible] would suggest Clearly, the  -13-    12/18/90  pricing is bad When I say that sales will be okay, I really mean that in a volume sense I think pricing is going to be very tough and, therefore, the profit levels will be down On the inflation front, excluding energy, I think the news is just okay Competitive pressures out there are terribly heavy and, therefore, the pricing continues to be tough The steel industry is a good example They're going to ship 84 or 85 million tons this year, which comparably is a pretty good year, but the pricing is really rough As a consequence, companies are shipping a lot of metal but are not making as much money doing that And certainly on the labor front there are no current excessive upward pressures  In a national context, our forecast is very consistent with the staff forecast, at least in broad contour, We have some interim quarterly differences, but I don't think that's particularly significant In my mind, the major uncertainty here is the financial system I can't remember a time when there has been a bigger buildup of pressures throughout the financial system It's awfully difficult to measure the impact if something were to get loose on us here in a kind of [destabilizing] way And when we get into the policy discussion, that would be a very important determinant, at least to my mind, of how we should conduct policy   Mr Chairman, I would enthusiastically support your recommendation, which I think is absolutely the right thing to do given the current circumstances Specifically, in terms of our decision here today, I would reduce the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, have asymmetric language, and hope that the discount rate would be reduced concurrently or shortly   Peter, with regard to the discount rate I must say I find it a little awkward to have the discount rate and the fed funds rate at the same level, given our interest in trying to encourage at least the visibility of [the discount window] If we were to reduce the discount rate and make an argument that it was absolutely just a technical change to reestablish the [alignment with] market [rates], would the market buy it or not?   Mr Chairman, I sense something of a dichotomy in the District with the end of hostilities and the arrival of spring, which in Chicago is always a welcome event, or the combination of the two I think attitudes in the District are quite significantly better than they were at the time of the last meeting Retailers, for example, are reporting a significant increase in floor traffic and, in turn, improvement in sales of small ticket items It hasn't yet flowed through to big ticket items, but small ticket items are up  Auto dealers certainly have a significantly improved attitude As they went through December, January, and February--a very grim period--dealers were ordering cars from manufacturers at rates lower than the retail sales level That has now reversed; they are ordering cars at a higher level than their retail sales And while that's typical for this time of the year, nonetheless, I think it is a decided shift in attitudes But while the attitudes seem better, some of the specific numbers really don't line up with these improved attitudes The District labor markets, for example, are weak And while our numbers had compared favorably with the national numbers, we're seeing some deterioration there Claims for unemployment insurance are rising in the District, and my hunch is that our numbers are going to begin to take on an adverse comparison  -27-    3/26/91  with the national average We're continuing to experience what I think of as an unending series of layoffs from one plant to another-- 100 people here, 200 there, etc Specifically, in the auto industry, though the outlook may be improving, it's at pretty grim levels The manufacturers that we talk with have reduced their sales forecast for the full year again, down to 13 million units; of course, that's cars and light trucks And even that number is dependent on comparatively good third and fourth quarters The production levels in the auto industry in the second quarter will be higher than the first quarter but still some 10 to 15 percent lower than last year And as I hear it, the production risk in the auto industry is still very much on the down side at this point  This weaker auto situation is reflecting itself in the steel industry That industry is reducing its forecast for shipments for this year down to 77 million tons, which is down from 80 million tons at the time of the last meeting and down from 85 million tons for last year One manufacturer, at least when I talked to him, was producing at 70 percent of capacity The order rate is a little higher, so they won't do poorly in inventory Prices in the steel industry are at best stable but at a very low level The competitive conditions there are really very, very tough and as a consequence some have gone through some difficult profitability issues The pricing in general in the District, as far as steel and other things, is reflective of that Competitive conditions are awfully tough and for most items I don't sense much upward pressure In heavy trucks, ie Class E trucks, a category I haven't talked much about, conditions are really very weak Sales and production this year are off some 25 percent from last year; last year itself really was not a good year And one major engine manufacturer, a supplier to that heavy truck industry, is currently running at 30 percent of capacity, so they are really all but shut down and they don't expect any near-term improvement In fact, normally they sell about 180,000 units in a reasonably good year and the sales forecast for this year is between 110,000 and 130,000 units; therefore, it's a pretty depressed situation Adding to that problem for that industry, some of the major haulers are having a tough time getting credit to finance the purchase of equipment, so that just exacerbates the problem  The machine tool industry is a bit brighter than some of the other industries in the District Sales and backlogs are a little higher The auto industry will have to go through some significant model changeovers in the next couple of years, and that shows up in improved orders for machine tools Net, in the District context, I hope that we are going through something of a transitional phase and that we will see some improvement in the numbers following this improvement of attitudes that I certainly feel  In a national context, we have no basic disagreement with the staff forecast, at least in pattern We think we are moving past the low point here But our expectation is that the recovery will be a bit more modest than the staff forecast would suggest, at least for the next couple of quarters The personal consumption numbers look a little high, particularly for durables; that in turn will be dependent a great deal on the auto industry, and we'll just have to see how that works out So, as we look at it, we think we are moving through this transitional period, but at least for the moment the risk continues to be a bit on the down side  -28-    3/26/91   I would be in favor of alternative B I would have had a slight preference for asymmetric language in favor of easing but I think your comments with regard to consultation in the event of accelerating deterioration deal with that and, therefore, I support your position   Peter, the 30-year Treasury rate, which seems to be going in the wrong direction, is hard to judge What is the market's view on this? Is this a supply issue--just a very heavy volume of financing coming to market for [unintelligible]--or is this inflationary expectations?   Mr Chairman, conditions in the District remain unchanged from the last meeting You will remember that having come through the early phases somewhat better than other areas of the country, the data have now caught up with us, and the current level of activity in the Midwest, I think, is very much reflective of national conditions or already perhaps even a little weaker There may be some tentative signs of improvement, but nothing specific to suggest that we have reached a turning point  I think you can tell from Mike's comments, and it's certainly true in the District, that the critical area of focus is the auto industry Our District will not show a real-side improvement until we see a sustained pickup in the level of retail auto sales With the first and second quarters essentially complete now, the 1991 model year really has been a big disappointment The forecast of total sales for the full year was being pulled down to 12-1/2 to 13 million units and even that reduced level is quite dependent upon having a good improvement in sales in the third and fourth quarters And though car inventories at the retail level are really quite low at    5/14/91  this point, the dealers are still reducing their orders substantially At the time of the last meeting I reported that orders by retail dealers were in excess of or within the sales level That has turned around The dealers have turned quite negative and are ordering cars at about 80 percent of the current sales level, and that's, of course, very unusual for this time of the year In part, the dealer attitudes are based on the fact that many of them are losing money; at this point something like 50 percent of the dealers are in loss positions Despite this, given the seasonal factors of course, production in the second quarter is going to be up quite a bit from the very depressed levels in the first quarter Still, that higher level of production will be substantially under the production levels of the second quarter of last year But because of this shift between the first and second quarters, in a production sense the industry is going to be less of a drag on GNP than it was in the first quarter; indeed, it might have something of a positive effect As a final comment on the auto industry, I certainly would say that the enormous first-quarter losses that the Big Three experienced have cast a big pall on the Detroit area  Many of the other sectors of the District are impacted by the auto situation In the steel business, for example, one of the CEOs was telling me that his business was, in his term, "rotten" They currently are operating at about 70 percent of capacity The forecast of shipments for the year has been reduced from 85 million tons last year to 76-77 million tons this year And of that reduced level, about 20 percent is going into the export markets; of course, those sales have very little margin, so there's not very much profit there Other suppliers of the auto industry are equally hard pressed Some of the other parts of the District also are having a fairly weak time of it Construction activity, for example, continues to fade Construction contract awards are off very substantially from last year; through March the awards level is something like 26 percent under last year's level And people in the concrete business say that they are experiencing something of a free fall  More positively [for prices], though, the news in the agricultural sector is really quite good, mainly because of a reduced level of exports Corn and wheat prices are under [downward] pressure; that's going to hold down farm income Nonetheless, I think in an inflationary sense that ought to be good Due to heavy rains-- we have had a lot of rain in the Midwest--planting is about 10 days late But this is really a good problem, not a bad problem People I talk to say that the planting conditions really are excellent And while it's certainly far too early to judge the outlook for crop production, at least at this point it looks pretty good  Also positively on the inflation front, based on my talking to people, I think the price outlook is continuing to improve Competitive conditions in the marketplace are awfully tough Price increases are just very, very difficult to sustain And people who keep track of their raw material purchases say that they are experiencing very little price increases on raw material purchases The CEOs, looking ahead, still don't have any expectations that they're going to experience a very big price escalation  Net, while in a national context we may well be reaching a turning point, certainly we don't yet see it in the District From    5/14/91  our perspective within the District an improvement is going to be very dependent on the auto sector--an improved level of sales following the end of the model year production--and also an increase in exports Certainly at this point both of these objectives seem agonizingly elusive   I agree exactly with what Bob Forrestal has said I have a slight preference for asymmetric language, but I don't feel strongly about it And I do absolutely agree with both the current situation and with [policy] as you see it It's a fairly long time  -24-    5/14/91  between now and the next meeting, and a question comes up in my mind Presumably, we have now established that you have the right to move policy, and by that I mean the fed funds rate, by some amount I don't want to get into that but what would cause you to make a change as you look at the data that may be coming up in the next few weeks?   The down side   Well, I haven't looked at the calendar of the data that will be coming out over the next three or four weeks, but I'm simply saying that if there were some indication of basic weakness, I would hope there would be an opportunity to move   Thank you!   Mr Chairman, we have been forecasting a modest recovery and it seems to me that at best that's what it seems we have been getting Our forecast has been a little weaker than the staff forecast and with the passage of time I'm afraid the difference seems to have narrowed  -18-    8/20/91  With regard to the District, I think overall conditions are continuing to show improvement, but certainly this unevenness continues The auto sector remains the key uncertainty, with the change in models Recent sales trends have been encouraging at least but still far from strong, and the numbers are really confused by fleet sales It's very difficult to get at those numbers and really determine just what the underlying retail demand for cars is The '92 models have been introduced and the introduction hasn't gone quite as well as had been generally hoped Indeed, attitudes in our District are a little more negative than just a month ago In fact, one manufacturer is concerned enough about the way the '92 sales are going that they are going to put out a nationwide sales pitch of an unprecedented level in September Having said that, the retail dealer inventory is very low; no correction there is necessary But despite that, the production risks, looking at the third and fourth quarters, are still viewed as being on the down side Of course, the three main domestic manufacturers are reporting big losses And heavy truck numbers continue to be very weak; sales forecasts for '91 are estimated at about 90,000 units for the Class A trucks and that's down some 25 percent from 1990, which itself was a weak year The recreation vehicle business, which is very important--particularly to Indiana--also is pretty weak That business continues in a three-year slump now; [it's down] as much as 25 percent for some individual manufacturers The steel business, though, is doing a bit better Those manufacturers supplying the auto industry are operating at a slightly better level; 80 percent of capacity is the overall industry average And the current level of orders is responding to the slight pickup in car production; the current level of orders of those supplying the auto industry is at about 150 percent of capacity, but they do caution that those steel orders are subject to cancellation Nonetheless, they are forecasting for this year shipments of about 76 million tons and the initial forecast for '92 is 82 million tons  In the agricultural sector, the drought, as I commented the last time, is beginning to have some negative effect on the outlook for crop production So far it's not nearly as severe as the 1988 drought, and we do not expect this to move into the banking sector and cause the kind of problems that we had before Nonetheless, in terms of our District--and I think we are perhaps a bit more impacted by the drought than some other parts of the country--corn production will be down about 15 percent from last year and soybean production will be down about 4 percent But because the drought conditions are recent, prices haven't risen as much as one might expect and, therefore, farm income will be adversely affected That is beginning to show up in the weakness of sales of agricultural equipment, and the main manufacturers of ag equipment are beginning to pull back their production schedules for the remainder of this year  On the inflation front, I must say I continue to be impressed --really almost surprised--by the very, very heavy and continuing pressure on prices Competitive conditions out there are very intense and price increases at least from a [unintelligible] just aren't sticking Manufacturers are able to get a [price] reduction on their purchases of raw materials and other parts and products Some of the reductions really are quite impressive, so they've got a very good control on their costs Offsetting this, and Mike alluded to it, there has been some recent shift in labor contracts; some of the more recent contracts are not coming in quite as favorably as they were  -19-    8/20/91 -20-  earlier in the year I would point out that Deere and Caterpillar are just starting their negotiations These are very important contracts And certainly, the caps in their discussions particularly are starting off badly They can't even agree on the sites where they're going to hold the negotiations  With regard to the credit crunch--and I must say here I'm certainly speaking from a Midwestern perspective--the problem, at least in our part of the country, doesn't seem to be as bad as in other regions I think there is a slight shift taking place Though banks have raised and continue to have pretty high credit standards, for those companies and borrowers that do meet these standards there's plenty of credit available A CEO of one large regional bank told me the other day that for any good credit that goes on the table, five banks are coming after it pretty quickly In the consumer credit area--and we do have a director who follows consumer activities pretty closely--I must say the level of personal bankruptcies is getting a little worrisome The numbers are up very significantly this year over last year And this seems to be showing up in increased delinquencies in [banks'] consumer portfolios  The recovery still seems to be on track but it's certainly modest and uneven and very, very susceptible to shocks such as what we experienced over the weekend From a policy perspective, continuing ease is the best policy to facilitate the continued recovery and seems to me an appropriate course of action Thank you   Mr Chairman, given the risks as I see them--I think I heard some comments of the same nature around the table--I would prefer to do a bit more now But having said that, I find your recommendation entirely acceptable namely, alternative "B" with version II language [Nevertheless], I hope it would not take the accumulation of an awful lot of negative data before we make a move   Version II   Mr Chairman, in the Chicago District at least we seem to be in something of a steady state Really not much has changed in total context since the last meeting In a comparative sense our numbers seem a little better than the national averages On employment, for example, our numbers have shown a little less erosion than the national numbers; excluding Michigan, which of course has its own very obvious problems, some of the employment numbers are looking at least flat to up a bit Manufacturing activity is showing some sign of modest improvement The steel business, for example, is operating at a higher rate, and at least one manufacturer would anticipate that their operating rate would go up pretty close to 100 percent by the end of October  As has been the case all year, so much is very, very dependent on the auto industry And I must say at this point that I find it awfully hard to get a grasp on what the underlying retail demand for cars is The early September sales numbers are a little on the disappointing side, but it is expected that fleet sales during the last 10 days will boost sales for the month as whole The industry obviously is hoping for a better fourth quarter and the forecasts for sales of cars and light trucks seem to be coming in at about 136 million at an annual rate But they do admit that that could be a little on the optimistic side Based on that sales expectation, their production schedules for the fourth quarter have been set at levels quite a bit higher than the fourth quarter of last year and higher than the third quarter of this year But, again, the caveat or the production risk is on the down side Looking back at the third quarter, of course, they had production schedules that were forecast  -13-    10/1/91  at quite a bit higher level than actually took place If the sales fail to live up to expectations and production is cut back, that of course would work back onto the suppliers A lot of the order increases that steel manufacturers have are based on auto production, but these are orders that are cancelable We're just going to have to wait and see how all this works out in coming weeks  In the agricultural sector, despite the drought in parts of the District--it's particularly tough in central Indiana--and now the early frost, production is going to come in at a reasonable level Corn is down just a bit from last year; soybean production is probably down a little more The impact in the District in terms of farm income is nothing like what we experienced in '85 or '86 when we went through a big correction, barring even the drought of '88 And the ag banks do not anticipate a significant deterioration in the permanent aspects of agricultural loans  On the price inflation side, I must say the situation continues to look positive Competitive conditions are just too tight and too tough to provide much latitude for price increases The steel industry, for example, has announced a price increase for sheet steel They think it will stick, but major users of steel say it will not stick and that they will be able to beat it back down On the wage side, there is not much change other than, I would point out, that Caterpillar is really in a very tough negotiating stance--really a non-negotiating stance They anticipate a strike and final settlement coming out of that at a very low rate--at about the settlements of some of the other UAW contracts  In a national context, our numbers, certainly for the third and fourth quarters of this year, are quite similar to the Board staff's But I will say that our forecast for next year is a little lower than the staff forecast The main area of difference is in personal consumption for durable items and in turn for disposable income; our numbers are lower there as well So, I would argue that the staff forecast is a little on the positive side as we get into next year And, net, while the recovery seems to be developing along the lines that we've been anticipating, the main question is the one that Ed Boehne raised whether this recovery is going to be strong enough to get enough of the boats off of the bottom to sustain it for a continued period   "B" asymmetric   Mr Chairman, in the District some signs of weakness have developed since the last meeting Attitudes have certainly deteriorated Anecdotal reports are coming in very much on the negative side As always, the auto sector is the major swing element in the District and in that area the news seems to be coming in more negatively The company that I've talked to has reduced its fourth-quarter production schedule by 8 percent from the time of our last meeting, and the production risks are still on the down side In part, the fourth-quarter production rate is based on a dealer order rate of about 66,000 units a week The order rate is in fact coming in substantially under that; it has averaged 52,000 units over the last five weeks and most recently it was only 43,000 In the retail auto sector, inventories are turning out okay and maybe a little on the low side If this gap between orders and production [widens] as we get into the quarter, we're probably going to get some further production cuts In turn, that will result in cuts in orders from the suppliers While earlier we expected that the auto sector might have a positive effect on fourth-quarter GNP, perhaps by as much as 1-1/2 percentage points, it now seems much more likely that the sector will be flat at best and perhaps a bit negative The production of medium size and heavy-duty trucks in September of this year was down 22    11/5/91  percent from last year And in terms of a comparative year, sales were pretty weak last year  District employment has moved sideways since April; it's up a bit in manufacturing, offset by a decline in nonmanufacturing Retail sales came in very much on the weak side, particularly in Detroit And one Chicago retailer told me that sales of autos in Chicago since Labor Day have begun to trail off and currently are running about 7 to 10 percent under the same [period] last year, particularly [unintelligible] Sales of new and existing homes in the District have declined quite substantially and housing starts have dropped as well Plant closings in the District--and I'm not talking about just temporary shutdowns but permanent closings--are continuing at what seems to me to be disturbingly high levels, with announcements day-in and day-out  Offsetting what may seem like gloom, here and there are some bright spots The steel business, for example, is something of a mystery The industry is now running at about an 80 percent rate [of capacity utilization] and the estimated shipments for the year have been increased a little--from 77 million tons at the time of the last meeting to 79 million tons now--and the outlook for 1992 is even a bit better Though the steel companies do expect some more cancellations coming out of the auto industry, steel inventories of manufacturers and also in the steel centers really are very, very low It should mean that even if there are some cutbacks in orders from the auto companies, the steel production levels ought not to be hit too hard  On the price front, the outlook continues to improve I think the better conditions are centered perhaps in the manufacturing sector; the major manufacturers are able to hold down the cost of their purchases Indeed, in some cases they really have achieved some good reductions I have no sense that direct labor costs are increasing more than productivity gains Deere, for example, very recently settled their contract; financially it is a little more expensive than they wanted Nonetheless, they got very good work rule changes and they feel that they can overcome the financial aspects through productivity And a word of caution Caterpillar is in their negotiations and those have broken down It looks as if they might have quite a tough strike and the settlement of that could set something of a pattern for the UAW at least [unintelligible]  Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook revisions plus the staff forecast for this year are much more in line with where we have been But the staff forecast still seems to us to be a bit on the high side as we get into 1992 The main difference, first of all, is in consumption, particularly for durables While the increases in the staff forecast are in reasonable alignment with the historical record, nonetheless in a current context they still seem to be a little on the high side Net, I think we have something of a [unintelligible] on our hands, which I think we will need to address as we get into the policy deliberations   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the small reductions we have been doing really aren't producing the desired results, with M2 in this process having continued to deteriorate We haven't reduced the discount rate since September and that seems to me an awfully long time to have left such a visible rate in place, not having made a change I do think we are at a point where we need to do something a little more visible This confidence factor is important Also, it's important to do something that will bring the prime rate down I'm not [certain] that a lower prime rate is necessary to encourage more lending, at least at the outset; however, ultimately, I think it does work its way through to higher lending But it certainly does reduce the costs [of doing business] My preference would be to reduce the discount rate by 50 basis points and the fed funds rate by 25 basis points As to whether it's Wednesday or Friday, I have a slight preference for Friday, but I don't care I must say, having heard the conversation earlier, that I don't know quite how much confidence I have that a change in the discount rate [will be adopted] at this point Lacking that, then I'd be in favor of alternative A with a 50 basis point cut in the fed funds rate But I could live with 25 basis points now on the fed funds rate if there were asymmetric language If [the consensus] were for 25 basis points now and symmetric language, I'd find that a very difficult option at the moment   Mr Chairman, while I might have a preference for adjusting the wording slightly or the order of the objectives, I think    12/17/91  I hear the way things are going and I support Governor Kelley's recommendation   Mr Chairman, I'll admit to feeling a bit on the gloomy side In a District context, the moderating pattern that has  -10-    12/17/91  been in evidence for quite some while is continuing I don't think it's necessarily accelerating, but it certainly is continuing  As I have so frequently commented, the automotive business of course has a very major impact on the District's activities and it is continuing to exert something of a negative influence The order rate for dealers has been consistently underneath the manufacturing production level with the result that the production schedules are continually reduced In the fourth quarter, production is going to come in substantially under what just a month or two ago was revised to the very lowest level possible There was something of an increase in the order rate in the first week in December, but I am told that about half of that increase was the result of fleet sales, not higher retail demand The first-quarter production rates are very uncertain at this point Initially, they have been set at a level a little lower than the fourth-quarter level, but there is every expectation that as we get into the quarter they will be reduced further But because the first quarter of 1991 was so very weak, in a comparative sense at least the production levels may exert a positive influence The forecast sales levels for 1992 are about one million units higher than 1991, but much of the increase is in the second half And, frankly, it seems more of a hope than a forecast of the reality  All of this is backing up into the supplier group Steel companies are experiencing cuts resulting from the auto manufacturers The orders have been reduced by about 10 percent for January and February and, as a result, the operating rates in the steel industry have declined and are currently down to about 77 percent Therefore, the first-quarter expectations for steel will be weaker than they were before Still, they are expecting for the full year that shipments will come in at about 82 million tons That would be up from about 78-1/2 million tons this year The other suppliers to the auto sector are experiencing similar curtailments It looks to us as if in a direct and indirect sense the automotive industry may have a negative impact of as much as 1 percent on fourth-quarter GDP; and it may also have a continuing negative effect in the first quarter  The heavy truck business continues to be terribly weak The class A truck shipments this year will come in at about 100,000 units For next year the expectation is that the shipments will go up to 109,000 units, so it's quite an increase Nevertheless, we have to compare that number with what shipments could be in a good year, and shipments could come in--have come in--at as much as 175,000 units  District employment increased in October; that's the latest month that we have available But the unemployment claims rose in November, and a survey of hiring plans for the first quarter indicates a decline in the Midwest from the fourth quarter The Chicago Purchasing Managers survey indicated a pretty substantial decline in November; there was even a steeper decline in Detroit And the Chicago December report, which will be coming out later this month, shows a further decline  With regard to retail sales, it's a little hard to get a picture; but I think the outlook is a little better, particularly for those in the discounting business For those people the early Christmas sales seem to be running a little over last year But alternatively, those who are not in the discounting business are    12/17/91  having a very tough time One specialty retailer I talked to said that currently he's having the worst experience he has had in 29 years He gave me a report on sales in the various regions that they cover and I was surprised that in Chicago in the first week of December they had an 8-1/2 percent decline in sales from the first week of December last year  On the inflation side, given the competitive conditions, pricing is really very, very tough One major manufacturer said that they have gotten decreases in the prices of their outside purchases of 14 percent this year and they are forecasting a further 06 percent decrease next year Despite some attempts to raise steel prices, I am told that steel prices more broadly are still at about the 1980 levels, so there is no improvement there The wage patterns continue to be favorable, but I will say there's a growing level of anxiety about the Caterpillar strike, which at this point looks very, very difficult  In a national context, the reduced staff forecast certainly seems plausible In fact, our current look at the first quarter would be just a bit better than the staff forecast, but we have the remaining quarters of 1992 weaker than in the staff's outlook I think there's a lot of hope in this expectation that we'll get a turnaround To me the risk is that the growth rate, if we get it, won't be strong enough to sustain itself and that we could, therefore, get back into a deteriorating environment And it seems to me that our policy actions have to deal with that risk   Mr Chairman, given my concerns about the outlook and the overall situation, I'd be very much in favor of doing more and doing it now I'd be in the Syron/Boehne camp, supporting alternative A Having said that, as I hear your recommendation, the evidence of economic growth would have to be very, very compelling in order not to ease If I'm right about my interpretation of that and if the move might be in the near term, then I support the recommendation But if I'm not right, I don't know how you can be more precise about exactly what you mean in terms of the indicators that would cause you to do something If I'm not right in my interpretation, then I'd be in favor of alternative A   Norm, at the risk of interrupting, which I'm doing, could I ask the Chairman for just a bit more interpretation as to what you really mean in terms of the indicators that would cause you to do one thing or another? What would really make a difference in terms of monetary policy?   Continuation of the current trends Do you have a time perspective in mind?  -37-    12/17/91   Two to three weeks or something like that?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the national economy, our forecast is very similar to the staff forecast at least in contour We also show an improving quarterly trend but our growth rates, particularly in the first and second quarters, are a bit lower Our outlook for personal consumption, particularly durables, is just a little lower than the staff forecast Correspondingly, our outlook for inflation this year is a bit more positive We would think the CPI, for example, by the end of the year could be at 3 percent or a bit lower But these overall differences are really just differences at the margin  In the District, the modest improvement that I commented on at the time of the last meeting and also on the telephone call continues Certainly, residential housing in the Midwest has been a strong point Homebuilding has increased significantly and home sales have also been very active But I do think weather has been a decided factor We've had the warmest winter in 97 years and I have a hunch that the seasonal adjustment factors have had an effect on the numbers At the distant horizon--and I would emphasize distant--I am hearing a little better tone in the commercial real estate sector Some investors are beginning to express at least a possible interest in commercial real estate That's the first time I've heard that in quite a while Not in any way should this suggest that there's any interest in new projects; that's a long way out In fact, in Chicago we have a number of fairly sizable projects that are still being finished As a consequence the rental overhang is pretty high and the rental terms are very, very tough Nonetheless, this possible interest on the part of investors to come back may be indicative that we could be reaching toward stabilization in this very tough sector  The automobile business is a bit better, at least for the one manufacturer that I talked to Their first-quarter production, for example, was 32 percent over last year; last year, of course, was very low as a comparative period The second-quarter production will be up about 8 percent Encouraging also is the dealer order rate, which has shown a significant improvement on a week-by-week basis as we've gone through this year Sales have been a little under forecast but there is a better tone out there There is a better mix Fleet sales are down; retail sales are up Also, retail pricing for autos has been a little firmer In the truck industry, medium truck demand is flat to down a bit, reflecting very tight control on capital expenditures by businesses But the demand for big trucks, the class A rigs, is up a bit, and one manufacturer is forecasting a 10 percent increase in  -14-    3/31/92  sales this year for the class A group Still, in a comparative sense, that is a very modest number  The steel business continues to be pretty reasonable First- quarter sales will come in at an 82 million ton annual rate The industry is now operating at about 85 percent capacity but the pricing in the steel business is very, very tough On the retail side, sales continue to show an improvement It looks to us as if retail sales in the Midwest are running about 5 percent ahead of last year on a comparable store basis but the pricing continues to be [very competitive]; we see no inflation on the retail side In the agricultural sector, the outlook for the crop year looks favorable, at least at this point, despite a fairly warm and a dry winter Ground moisture is regarded as being excellent in most of our ag areas Planting is going to start in two to three weeks and the outlook is pretty positive There is some concern out there about the [weather] effect; nonetheless, we are forecasting normal crop production this year  With regard to inflation, I do think the outlook continues to improve Pricing conditions in the marketplace are awfully tough The big increases just don't stick and in some industries--paper, for example--prices are continuing to come down And energy prices just don't represent anything by way of an inflation issue On the labor side, the contracts are being settled on very favorable bases In the paper [industry], for example, one of our directors reported that a company has recently gotten a six-year contract, with annual increases of 3 percent a year plus a one-time premium shift buyout of 3 percent Two other paper companies got five-year contracts at very, very modest wage increases So, certainly, those contracts have gone well But one labor negotiation that has not gone well, and I've commented on it before, is the Caterpillar contract; the strike is now almost five months old They held the first talk in quite some while last week, but nothing came out of that In fact, the union rejected what the company said was absolutely its final offer So, the discussions broke off and both sides left The pattern issue is what is holding them up Both sides have said that absolutely under no circumstances will they give on that particular issue In the interim Caterpillar's inventories are running down to pretty low levels; and current production, of course, is very spotty I talked to somebody yesterday  That for the union would be a very tough situation The expectation is that this could get to be pretty vicious before we're all done  Net, while the anecdotal reports and certainly the data continue to be positive in a modest sense, I continue to think the risks are very much on the down side They are perhaps not as great as they were a few months ago but, still, I think that's where the risk is Therefore, in terms of policy response, I think we should be geared to deal with any signs of weakening should they appear Thank you   Mr Chairman, while we are moving through this transition pretty well and the tone and numbers are a little better this time than they were the last time, nonetheless, as I said earlier, I think the risks continue to be on the down side I also think the inflationary outlook is better than [unintelligible] To me it would be very premature to make a shift from asymmetric to symmetric language and, therefore, I'd be in favor of alternative B asymmetric toward ease   Thank you, Mr Chairman In terms of the national economy, our forecast for growth this year is very consistent with the staff forecast We get there in slightly different ways Our consumption numbers are a bit lower I think the differences in durables probably relate to the fact that our housing numbers are a little lower than those in the staff forecast but, offsetting that, our export numbers are a bit stronger There is a difference, though, in the outlook for inflation Our numbers are more constructive than the staff forecast We expect in terms of the CPI that we would be getting down to the 3 percent area by the end of this year and then perhaps see continued improvement next year  With regard to the District, there seems to be slow but steady improvement in the major segments of our economy But I must say the magnitude of the improvement between this meeting and the last  -17-    5/19/92  meeting is not quite as great as was the case at the time of the last meeting In that prior period there had been pretty good improvement In fact, in some cases there are signs of moderation appearing As an example of this, our housing activity is down a bit but from very high levels Seasonal factors had a big effect on January and February housing activity Also, that was a period in which mortgage rates had come down quite substantially and that gave housing in the Midwest a push; but we're now seeing some softness in housing Retail activity also has slowed a bit; it is still positive compared to last year but the momentum has slowed, again from a very rapid pace in both January and February  On the other hand, the manufacturing sector continues to show slow but steady improvement Second-quarter production in the auto industry is continuing to run well ahead of last year, but of course the second quarter last year was comparatively weak Third-quarter schedules have been set a little higher than the third quarter of last year, but the magnitude is not as great as the pace of the second quarter Current dealer attitudes are good, I'm told Their order rate from manufacturers is very much in line with the production schedules But I will say the dealer order rate is a bit ahead of the retail sales level Still, the inventories out there don't seem to be out of line, particularly for this time of the year I must say that in this overall category I have heard from just everybody that the demand for light trucks is very, very strong The industry sales forecasts are a little stronger than ours They are expecting a very good third quarter and an even better fourth quarter So, there is more to come on that The heavy truck business continues to be better than last year The current order rate is running about 10 percent ahead of last year, but of course that's an increase from a very low level And heavy truck manufacturers are operating at about 70 percent of capacity They are forecasting an improved sales level this year of only about 119,000 units and that's versus a good year of, say, 165,000 to 175,000 units The steel business also is doing a little better; orders, particularly for sheet, are coming in at good levels That I think is reflective of the auto production schedules and also a bit of strength on the appliance side The steel industry is operating at about 83 percent of capacity They're going to ship 40 million tons in the first half and are forecasting 42 million tons for the second half, so it ought to be a good year in terms of the [tonnage] being shipped But the pricing is just terrible I find this somewhat of a contradiction They're shipping a lot of metal but they're just not making any money  With regard to the real estate question that you asked about, the firm I talked with feels that we may be getting to the point of stability but we still aren't there yet They are seeing some increased interest on the part of funds to buy real estate There's a greater level of interest but not a significant volume [of sales] is taking place They think we're going to have a continuation of price declines this year, perhaps as much as 10 percent for the year as a whole That's lower than in previous years, which again is indicative that we're getting to a point of stability The vacancy rates in Chicago are going to go up We have two or three big projects that are still finishing up, so our already fairly high vacancy rates are going to go up This firm does not anticipate a return to normal vacancy levels until 1995 or 1996  -18-    5/19/92  In the agricultural sector, we've had a very unusual planting season It has been cold and wet in most of our area But in one week, the week of May 10th, some 50 percent of the corn acreage was planted, which was pretty phenomenal However, given the carryover stocks, which were fairly low, and the significant uncertainty with regard to weather, our expectation is that it's going to be a year in which prices are going to be very, very weather-related, but at least we're off to a pretty good start I might say that the ag equipment business is sour Contrary to earlier expectations, retail sales of major agricultural implements have slowed significantly It's down about 13 percent currently from last year As a consequence the production schedules, which had been set at a pretty conservative level, now are being reduced  With regard to inflation, I do think that the outlook is increasingly constructive Price increases are just not sticking In the manufacturing sector, I continue to be impressed by the major manufacturers who are continuing to get decreases in their prices for purchased products or, if there are increases, they are pretty modest The same also is true in the retail sector People who supply the major retail stores know that they just can't get price increases through The consumers in turn are very tough So, I must say general attitudes in the District are that rising prices are just not a major danger Labor contracts continue to be negotiated under favorable terms Three-year contracts are the norm The occasional six-year contract in the paper industry and the wage increases under these contracts are easily managed through productivity improvements After months of bitterness that I have commented on from time-to-time here, the Caterpillar strike just went "poof" When the company threatened and then began to bring in replacement workers, the union attitude just collapsed They have not, of course, settled the contract yet, but they're back at work This won't necessarily set a pattern for the UAW negotiations with the auto companies this fall, but certainly it's going to have an effect on the tone as they go into those discussions  Net, while I think the economy is continuing to show signs of slow but steady improvement, without more strength in some of the major segments the question [of sustainability] has to be a significant one Therefore, as we see it, the risks in terms of growth continue to be on the down side And with the improved outlook with regard to inflation, it seems to us that our policy response should be geared to dealing with signs of deterioration in growth should they begin to emerge Thank you   Don, in your comments about the structure of interest rates and the yield curve, I don't think I heard you say anything about the supply factor and the impact that has on rates Is that in your mind not an issue?   Mr Chairman, I was right with you absolutely all the way as you went through your analysis right up until the end I must say that although the general tone of the comments seems more positive now than it was the last time, I do think there are some unusual factors here And I continue to think that the risks on economic growth are on the down side You said, and I certainly agree, that in the near term we are more likely to ease than we are to tighten Therefore, it seems to me that the directive ought to  -43-    5/19/92  reflect those possibilities As a consequence, I'd be in favor of "B," but I'd continue with asymmetric language   Mr Chairman, in terms of economic activity in the District, really there has been very little change since the last meeting Some sectors are doing a little better but others not quite so well  Much of the District's focus continues to be on the auto sector which has declined just a bit since the last meeting The third-quarter production schedules, which earlier seemed pretty strong, have been reduced quite substantially, principally due to GM's cutback Whereas originally the third-quarter schedules were set at about 18 percent over the third-quarter 1991 levels, they now have been reduced to about 11 percent [over the year-earlier level] We would expect the effect of the auto sector, which earlier might have had an effect on third-quarter GDP of about 1 percent, to be reduced to about 1/2 percent The fourth-quarter production schedules haven't been announced for all the manufacturers, but one I talked to has reduced its sales forecast for the fourth quarter from 14 million at an annual rate to 13-1/2 million They feel in their case that the production risk is definitely on the down side  -17-    8/18/92  Retail sales in the area continue to be very tough; merchandise will move but only at discounted prices And the pricing techniques have become very, very aggressive At least one retailer that I talked to had a pretty good early part of July; at the end of the month things turned sour and the lower sales levels have continued into August Offsetting this, though, the steel business continues to be pretty good The industry is operating at a rate of about 82 percent One large Midwestern manufacturer is higher than that, at about 85 percent, and they now expect shipments for the year to come in at about 82 million tons, which in a comparative sense is not that bad a year Part of the strength is based on lower imports The industry, as you know, is involved in an effort to deal with tariffs, and that is having an effect; but also the export business has been pretty good The heavy truck business also is showing some favorable signs The order flow for Class A units has improved and customers for these units are feeling pretty good about their business The industry expects to ship about 120,000 to 125,000 Class A units this year; that's up from 100,000 last year Indeed, the current order rate is a little higher than that, and they expect the order rate to come out at the end of the year at about 140,000 units  The residential housing business is also quite strong New single-family home sales in the Midwest have been stronger than the national average Housing starts on a seasonally adjusted basis, though down in the second quarter from an unusually strong first quarter, are still above levels for 1991 And given the reduction in mortgage rates, I think the attitudes about residential housing are pretty good  In the agricultural sector, we've had a very significant change from the last meeting We had plenty of rain in July and early August and at this point the crop outlook is really excellent Crop prices reflect that; they're down quite significantly And that negative effect on farm income is showing up in the sales of agricultural equipment That industry is really having a very tough year For example, year-to-date sales of 4-wheel drive tractors are down 37 percent; sales of large tractors are down 32 percent; and sales of combines are down about 36 percent So, production schedules, which had already been reduced, are being reduced further One large manufacturer expects that their fourth-quarter production schedules will be about 20 percent lower than last year  On the inflation side, the news continues to improve Upward price pressures just aren't part of anyone's thinking Large manufacturers are putting tremendous pressure on their suppliers In many cases, they are holding [down] price increases on their purchases to very low levels and in a couple of cases they actually are getting reductions The pattern of prices on purchases over the last two or three years really has been very, very favorable  While in an economic sense, in terms of the indicators, the news in the Midwest and indeed nationally is a bit mixed, I must say that I think there has been a deterioration in mental attitudes Many of the people I talk to seem awfully grim The uncertainty and the negative outlook are beginning to creep into business thinking and, therefore, I think the risks here are a bit on the down side Using the analogy of the slow takeoff--and I think we've been experiencing this slow takeoff for an awfully long time--my worry is that we're  -18-    8/18/92  reaching the end of the runway And in a policy sense, I think we better push forward on the throttle until we're sure we are clear off the ground   Mr Chairman, I agree with Bob Forrestal I would prefer to ease now in the direction of "A" but certainly find "B" with asymmetric language acceptable   Mr Chairman, conditions in the District have not changed that much since the last meeting While the trends are somewhat mixed, I think on balance the overall rate of economic activity has moderated; and certainly attitudes have deteriorated further The auto industry and all auto-related activities are  -22-    10/6/92  weaker Third-quarter sales were lower than the industry's earlier expectations and the sales forecasts for the fourth quarter have already been reduced and, I think, still may be on the high side As a result, fourth-quarter production plans are steadily being reduced At one point, the fourth-quarter schedules were significantly higher than last year--though last year was a weak comparative period--but by now they have been scaled back and are only about 4 percent over last year's level Again, I think the production risk is on the down side  Farm equipment sales and manufacturing continue to deteriorate The sales of major [farm equipment] units for the year through August are off 18 percent from last year and off 24 percent from two years ago One major manufacturer has reduced its fourth- quarter production schedule again and is now planning fourth-quarter production that is 21 percent below last year Other parts of the manufacturing sector in the District, however, continue to expand but, again, the growth rate has moderated Orders for Class 8 trucks, the big trucks, are running some 25 percent over 1991 But in the last 30 days there has been a perceptible change in the attitude of major truck customers, and the manufacturers are now concerned that this [orders trend] might turn around quite quickly Therefore, their confidence regarding the rest of this year, but more importantly for 1993, is not very strong Medium truck sales, Class 6 and Class 7, are about level with 1991 and no improvement is expected Offsetting this, though, housing activity in the District continues to show strength New single-family home sales in the Midwest rose 15 percent in July and continued to climb in August Home starts also were strong and that strength is carrying through to the manufacturers of building materials In the retail area, sales continue to run about 6 to 8 percent ahead of last year Customers, however, as I've commented before, are very, very price conscious And retailers who import a good deal of their merchandise are continuing to have to raise prices to reflect the plunge in the dollar Finally, in the agricultural sector, I think crop production is going to bring very good news We're clearly going to have good crops--indeed, perhaps bumper crops--in both corn and soybeans Prices are way down, but we're going to have very good production  In the inflation area--price pressures--the news continues to improve Intense competitive conditions are continuing to restrain price increases and many manufacturers are holding the increased cost of their purchases to very, very minimum levels In the case of a couple of large manufacturers, they have actually been able to accomplish reductions in their purchase prices on a year-over-year basis But at this point inflation is just not an issue, certainly among the people I talk with, and they are growingly disturbed that they just can't get price increases to stick in the marketplace In turn, they have worked [to hold down] their purchase prices, as I suggested In the labor area, contracts continue to be settled on what I think are very favorable terms  In a national context, I find the overall economic outlook increasingly worrisome [The economy has remained] a long time in this very steady state--I think perhaps too long--and there is a real risk at this point that [the expansion] will lose momentum We continue to reduce our growth forecast and are now down to a point that the sustainability of even the current very moderate rate has to be open to question In this environment, despite the policy easing  -23-    10/6/92  moves that we have made, the risk of the economy taking off at such a rapid rate as to cause strong inflationary pressures seems pretty close to zero But I think the risk that the economy could fall back into negative growth is very real and is increasing with the passage of time Therefore, in a monetary policy context, I think we ought to move again as early as we have the opportunity to do so   Mr Chairman, my view on today's decision really is completely separate from either exchange market or other market expectations or political issues It does seem to me that these are matters that we can reasonably deal with, given any decision that we come to today Rather, my decision would be based on the economic situation, which I think clearly has weakened and quite considerably so At this point the risk that the economy could fall back into a negative situation is not insignificant; I think the balance here is very delicate It seems to me that we already have the data that we need to make a decision It's very much there on the record Therefore, as I indicated in my comments earlier, I could live with "B" asymmetric, but I frankly would have a far stronger preference to move now and to use this meeting as a reason for making that decision   Bob Forrestal already made the point that I was going to make I certainly agree with those who have said that any further specific detail or attribution of individual comments would be very destructive of the [deliberative] process But this is a question, frankly, that I don't think Mr Gonzalez wrote; some curious staffer way down the line wrote it And for us to respond by making a change at this point would be a very big mistake I think we ought to go back and say that we thought about it carefully and that the process we're currently using seems appropriate to us We're always open to thinking about it further, but we don't see any reason to make a change at this time I think they're just fishing and if we give them something now, that's just going to encourage them to try to get more   Mr Chairman, on balance conditions in the District have a somewhat better tone than was the case at the time of the last meeting It is a little hard to back that up with statistical data In fact, some of the data have gone the other way; for example, the Chicago purchasing managers survey for October went below 50 percent Still, the steel business continues to be pretty good The industry is currently operating at about an 80 percent rate, and that's a rate that will maintain inventories at a fairly stable level Shipments this year are probably going to come in at about 82 million tons, which is a pretty good year, though I must say that pricing continues to be very tough For 1993 the industry expects an increase in shipments to about 85 million tons There is a wild card with regard to next year and that relates to the outcome of trade suits that have been filed The early outlook on these suits is favorable and, if they prevail, that should be helpful both to volume and also to prices  Aided by strong light truck and van sales, the motor vehicle sales levels have improved Sales this year will probably come in at about 13 million units and the industry is expecting an increase to about 13-1/2 million units next year Based on these higher expectations, one manufacturer has set first-quarter production schedules 15 percent over the first quarter of last year I was talking to representatives of one major automotive manufacturer last week and was trying to convince them that at 13 million units this has been a pretty good year; they didn't buy it a bit They reminded me that the industry's base year, in their view at least, is 15-1/2 million units; and with operating results running very firmly in the red it's very difficult for them to view this as a good year The heavy truck business also is better Sales of the Class 8 units this year are about 25 percent over last year and the industry expects continued improvement next year--perhaps another 20 percent increase But I must say that even at these higher levels sales are well under the very much higher levels that existed in the mid-1980s  Retail sales in the District are showing some improvement I think consumer confidence is back a bit and the early outlook for Christmas is a little more positive than previously expected But the consumer continues to be very price conscious and it does take price discounts to produce sales In line with that comment, the price and inflation news in the District continues to be very positive Price pressures really just aren't there  Offsetting the good news, the agricultural equipment business is just terrible, with no signs of improvement One major manufacturer just finished its fiscal year and large tractor sales in that fiscal year were down by some 40 percent from the year before They are continuing to reduce production schedules and to lay off    11/17/92  employees Also disturbing is the continuing drumbeat of layoff notices in the District Just in the last few weeks we've had another 8 or 10 companies announce layoffs Some of them are small--180 to 200 employees--but others are much larger And this constant announcement of layoffs does cast something of a pall over the employment outlook  We had something of a milestone in Chicago last week There was a large reception commemorating the completion of the last major office building in downtown Chicago No one has projects underway and we now have a vacancy rate in the downtown area of about 23 percent At current absorption levels, it is going to take about 10 years to work through that inventory and there is a gloomy prediction out there that we won't see another big project until the next century  In a national context, while the outlook may be showing at least some signs of improvement, the improvement seems to be very modest I continue to think that we have a very fragile situation on our hands and that the risks continue to be on the down side If the staff forecast is right--and ours is quite close to it so I don't think it's worth spending time discussing the differences--the issue really is whether this is an outlook that will be acceptable and whether it will produce the kinds of employment gains necessary to sustain the recovery over a reasonable period of time That to me is the issue that in a monetary policy context would be the important question Thank you   Jerry, on the first question, there are frankly questions of viability about GM; that has been true not just recently but going back a few months I talked to  just felt that the troubles were much bigger than were fully understood by the market, and this goes back three or four months So, everything that has come out tends to confirm what he was saying The most recent numbers [coming out] in the last few days are really very much on the serious side So, that is certainly an open question In terms of your second question, if in fact this does evolve in a way that suggests there are questions as to GM's viability, it's only a matter of time until the market will pick that up and make the rollover of paper a very difficult issue So, this is a very significant concern in more than just a District context   I don't know if it is that large; it is huge   Mr Chairman, with regard to the long-term ranges I would prefer not to take any action at this time My impression was that our discussion basically related to your commitment to Congress to study this and report back, and it does seem to me that the paper and the discussion deal with that commitment The paper does add a lot of knowledge to this question It seems to me that there is enough uncertainty remaining that to make a change implies some degree of precision that I just don't have the confidence is really there Therefore, I wouldn't to make a change, particularly at this time when there is a signal effect that I find a bit awkward As a technical point, I assume if we were to make a change in the ranges as provisionally set, that we are not talking about making final changes to the ranges for next year   So, if we make a change now, it is a provisional range and we will leave it as a subject for next February and we would so state that?   Separately and apart from that, I'd prefer not to make a change With regard to the short-term policy, I must say that at the time of the last meeting I would have favored a change I was disappointed that it did not evolve Therefore, I came to this meeting in favor of either alternative A or alternative B with hard asymmetric language I must say I'm very surprised by the change in the tone of the reports It's the most significant shift between two meetings that I can remember While the data are a bit more positive, I have a feeling that the [anecdotal] reports are a little ahead of that It may be that good news is slow to reach our part of the Midwest Nevertheless, at this point I'd be in favor of alternative B with at least some bias or asymmetry toward ease   Mr Chairman, in terms of the District, the level of economic activity continues to increase Coming into the last meeting, conditions were starting to show signs of improvement and, if anything, the rate of improvement has accelerated a bit as we came into this meeting And I do think this improvement is fairly broad- based Auto sales have been a little better The first-quarter production schedules have been set about 15 percent over last year, so that's a good increase The auto manufacturers are anticipating an improvement in the sales level next year that is still below what they describe as the baseline but it is higher than this year The heavy truck business has been particularly strong Sales of Class 8 units are up 15 percent this year and are forecast to be up another 16 percent next year The backlog now is some 12 to 16 weeks for these units; it's pretty broad-based and is viewed as quite strong Steel production continues at a good level, operating at about 80 percent [of capacity] Steel producers also are reasonably optimistic about next year And certainly the international trade cases that are currently going on ought to be beneficial to the industry Between the subsidy constraints and the dumping constraints--and I think the latter will be announced later in January--they are expecting that imports next year will be reduced by 4 to 5 million tons That should also have the effect of improving the operating levels of the industry by some 5 percent, and they would expect that to occur by the end of the first quarter This ought to provide a better environment for pricing, which continues to be very, very rugged  Retail sales in the District continue at a good pace, but I must say some of the strength that we saw early in the Christmas season has eased a bit in the last few days This is a very tough period to judge because the selling season is longer, but I must say    12/22/92  many of the people that I've talked to who earlier were expecting, say, an 8 percent increase this Christmas season now are talking more in the area of 4 to 5 percent We have particularly strong [sales] in communications equipment Orders for communications equipment bottomed out in mid-1991 and have been increasing rapidly at annual rates of 20 to 25 percent The expectation for next year is that growth will be a little lower but still some 15 to 16 percent ahead of 1992 Even in the agricultural equipment business, there is a little better tone, or at least it's not worse One major manufacturer is expecting a 5 percent increase in unit sales next year, but that is after a 12 percent decline in '92 and a 9 percent decline in '91 So, it's an improvement from a pretty low level I will say, though, that inherent to the better outlook for '93 is the expectation that an ITC tax will be enacted, which will be beneficial to agricultural equipment  The inflation news continues to be very good To hold down their cost of purchases, large companies are exerting tremendous pressure on their suppliers with very good results More than a few, in fact, have achieved reductions in the average cost of their purchases this year and they are expecting equally good results next year Competitive conditions in the marketplace make it awfully tough to increase prices Labor contracts continue to be negotiated on favorable terms, and certainly this continuing drumbeat of layoffs and plant closings has an effect on labor expectations The fact that of GM's 28 planned plant closings 12 so far have been in Michigan certainly is unsettling to employment conditions in that state  Turning to the national economy, while I do think the outlook has improved--certainly we have no reason to question the staff's forecast--I must say that I continue to have at least lingering questions as to the underlying strength and sustainability of the recovery The employment numbers that will be coming out over the next few months I think will give us pretty good indications as to how things will work out next year   Mr Chairman, I'd be in favor of "B" symmetric It does seem to me that there has been a shift both in fundamentals and attitudes But I have a lingering question about the sustainability of that shift, so I think "B" symmetric is appropriate at this point   I think this is a constructive move I can't see any down side The up side does not seem to be considerable because I don't think it will diffuse the critics I'd prefer to do it without the executive summary I understand what Susan and Mike are saying, but I can't think of a time--again to use the private sector context-- when I've seen private sector minutes with an executive summary And I think the more we make it consistent with such minutes, the better off we are So, I'd do it without the summary   Mr Chairman, in the District the level of economic activity has shown clear signs of improvement since the last meeting At the February meeting we talked a bit about the impact of trade restraints on the steel business And in terms of pricing and production levels, I think that along with the basic increase in domestic demand is having an effect, as Mike has suggested Bookings during the last two months have been running at an annual rate of 110 million tons; that's clearly an unsustainably high level Delivery lead times are lengthening to the third quarter for at least one manufacturer, and one large steel purchaser has been put on allocation by two of its main suppliers The mills are currently operating at a stated rate of capacity of 83 to 85 percent, but there is a view in the industry that the [stated] capacity is too high, and at least in our District we think the mills are really operating at a level of about 90 percent of capacity Steel prices were raised, as you know, by $20 a ton in January; another $20 a ton increase will go in effect in April, and they have announced another $20 a ton increase to be effective in early July If all of these stick, it would raise the price about 10 percent from the low point in this most recent cycle But in a longer-term perspective the industry will only have regained  -14-    3/23/93  about one-half of the decline from the last peak in prices, which occurred in '88 and '89 And that 1988-89 level was still well under the levels that prevailed in '78 and '79 in nominal terms but, of course, further under in real terms  In other District activities, the second-quarter domestic production schedules in the auto industry have been set at about 12 percent over the second quarter of last year That production level is somewhat higher than the current dealer order rate Therefore, if the retail sales don't pick up fairly soon, there is some downward risk in the second-quarter production schedules The manufacturers I talk with have reduced their '93 sales outlook Their forecasts are down just a little to 14 million units But even that level implies very strong third and fourth quarters The truck business is also improving I've commented in the past on the heavy truck business, the class 8 units, and at this point both the order and production levels for those trucks are expected to be about 17 percent over last year But this time there's also what I think is a fairly significant change in the medium truck category, the class 6 and 7 units The current forecast suggests that these medium truck sales, which are regarded as being quite sensitive to economic changes, will be about 13 percent higher this year Agricultural equipment is doing better Sales there are improving at the retail level, and production schedules have been increased by 5 percent for one manufacturer There is a somewhat larger increase in terms of production for industrial equipment  The only sour note I heard, and it really wasn't all that sour, related to retail sales The District's sales held up quite well coming into the new year, but we hit something of an air pocket in February It's unclear whether that reflects uncertainty following the President's State of the Union message or is attributable to bad weather I must say that I think it's probably more the latter than the former  With regard to employment, we have some mixed developments Most of the people I talk with, particularly those in heavy industry, continue to say that despite the higher levels of production they are simply going to produce more with fewer people and that the staff reduction programs that they have in place will continue Yet we do think that the underlying employment data may suggest a somewhat brighter picture We've been doing considerable work on some of the statistics related to our District employment levels and we think they may be re-benchmarked and that the net effect a re-benchmarking of the state data will raise the employment level as of the end of last year by some 128,000 jobs And if that develops, it could well be that we've had a greater growth of employment in the District than we had thought If this is false, though, it may be that this higher level of employment will be consistent with the improvement that we're seeing in terms of economic activity  With regard to the national economy, when we did our forecast for the February meeting we were somewhat under the central tendency of the FOMC members Given developments since then, if we were redoing our forecast, I think we'd raise it a bit and we'd be very much in line now with the staff forecast And despite the recent PPI and CPI reports, which we don't think represent a fundamental change in the inflationary picture, our outlook for inflation has not  -15-    3/23/93  changed; we'd leave our fourth-quarter forecast at 28 percent Thank you   Mr Chairman, I would strongly support alternative B with symmetric language and the current language indicating specific growth expectations with regard to M2 and M3 We have been in an easing mode for quite some while now and a change in policy is going to be a very, very major change Somehow the asymmetric language does imply a somewhat automatic shift Well, perhaps not, but there is an implication of a somewhat automatic  -41-    3/23/93  shift If we do make a change, and it's entirely possible that we might, I would far prefer to do that from a consensus in the group, perhaps in a telephone call between now and the next meeting But for now I think maintaining our current stance is absolutely appropriate   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Chicago District have been somewhat uneven since the last meeting, but on balance I think there has been an increase in the level of activity In a modest context the outlook is reasonably positive Starting with the automotive sector Based on a pretty good April, the industry's confidence in their forecast for sales in the second quarter and the full year is somewhat stronger than it has been Despite press reports to the contrary, the inventory levels in their view are currently just about right and, therefore, second-quarter production schedules have been set about 10 percent over last year And they are pretty confident about those production schedules I must say the mood in Detroit is much more positive than it has been and that is radiating pretty much throughout the dealer organization The truck business also continues to improve Orders for the Class 8 units, the large units, were strong in the first quarter and that has continued into the second quarter For the full year the industry is forecasting an increase in sales of the big trucks of from 17 to 18 percent Also, and something of a change, there has been a recent increase in the medium truck category, the Class 5 to 7 units, and for the full year they are now forecasting an increase in sales of some 13 percent for those Medium truck sales are viewed as something of a lagging indicator and, therefore, this turn, which generally occurs about 6 months after the change in the heavy truck category, is viewed as a good sign But despite the strength in the underlying auto sales rate, I must say that truck prices really have not been increased  The steel business continues to do well and is benefiting particularly from the improved level [of activity] in the auto industry The current order rate for one major company, which they expect [to continue] for the full second quarter, is coming in at about 110 percent of capacity This is down from the first quarter but still pretty strong Some of the order rate they [feel] is due to the current labor negotiations; nonetheless, the underlying demand is pretty good And based on this they are now forecasting shipments this year of some 87 million tons, which comparatively is an awfully good year We've talked about the steel price increases at previous meetings and again earlier today There is, as you know, another increase scheduled for July They would expect that to stick But I do think it's important to remember that these increases do not apply to the major purchasers who are buying the steel on contract Those prices are still very, very tight, and it's particularly true of the auto industry But for others who are not buying on contract, when we're all done here this increase is going to amount to about 12 percent  In the agricultural equipment business, sales of tractors and combines have been higher most recently and production schedules, therefore, have been increased The large manufacturer that I talked to expects their production for the full year to be about 9 percent higher than last year Also, there has been a recent increase in construction equipment; it has been slow to get off the mark but some  -19-    5/18/93  of those orders are beginning to pick up One very major manufacturer is now selling a number of its product lines on back order  Retail sales are uneven and this, I think, is heavily driven by the terrible weather that we had in March and April As for car [sales], retailers tell me that their sales this year are up about 5 to 6 percent from last year In the ag sector, as you know, we had a very wet spring and planting, therefore, has been terribly slow But conditions looked pretty good last week and they got a lot done; that is true I will say with the exception of Iowa, which is still very wet But they're still well behind and for the major states planting is at about 40 percent of the normal level Nonetheless, there's enough time left and most people expect that there is a good opportunity to get a good crop Perhaps one of the most significant changes, at least to me, has been a decided change in the attitude about lending by banks People tell me, both borrowers and banks alike, that banks have become more aggressive They are now actively seeking loans and are pretty much out looking for business; they have begun to shave rates, but I am assured that they have not begun to ease their credit standards  In a national context, while the improved level of activity may relieve some of the concerns I've had about the sustainability of this expansion, I still think the big imponderable is on the employment side Major companies--and I must say everyone I have talked to in the manufacturing sector--say they will continue to reduce their employment and will produce more products with fewer people At some point it does seem to me that the lines between overtime and an increase in demand will cross, but so far they just are not yielding And almost surprisingly, some of the unions don't want the companies to hire more people either But despite this improved tone both in the District as well as in the national economy, it does seem to me that at best we are talking about a pretty modest recovery If you look at the staff forecast, which is largely in line with ours, the outlook continues to be positive but in a very, very modest context  On the price front, in talking to people I just don't sense the upward pressures that the recent numbers might suggest Yes, there are some exceptions, such as steel, and for the reasons that we talked about; but there are some offsets Raw aluminum prices, for example, are at the lowest real level in history Labor contracts continue to be settled on favorable terms that are, I think, very much noninflationary For example, the steel contract is a long way from settlement, but so far the thrust of the discussions has been entirely in the work rule area and productivity Companies want to improve work rules to achieve more productivity and they are willing to give a little in terms of employment security On the economic side the discussions really are focused on pensions, not on wages Therefore, the steel industry hopes that they will come out of this [negotiation] without an inflationary settlement So, although the recent numbers are a little unnerving, I do think it's far too soon to conclude that we are experiencing a basic shift in the outlook for prices Thank you   Just to add to Ed's point If we think the inflation issue is expectations as opposed to real, it seems to me that an asymmetric directive, which no one will be aware of for another six to eight weeks, isn't going to do anything for us An asymmetric directive that won't be known for eight weeks isn't going to do anything with regard to the expectations issue If in fact the inflation increases are sustained, then it seems to me we ought to move in a way that will deal with those issues, and that ought to follow a phone call Therefore, I think the asymmetry confuses the issue and doesn't deal with it My thought is to leave the directive as is but be very specific that we will have a phone call  -43-    5/18/93   May I just ask a technical question in reference to Jerry's point? I haven't had the feeling that the difference between symmetry and asymmetry necessarily constrains your ability to make a move It seems to me that as the Chairman you ought to have the ability to make a move under [changing] circumstances as you see fit Asymmetry means to me that we would go into the intermeeting period [ahead] with a very strong bias toward making a change to tighten, and I don't think the lack of asymmetry necessarily ought to  -46-    5/18/93  inhibit your ability to tighten if in fact the numbers [develop] in a way that makes that seem the appropriate thing to do   Mr Chairman, my earlier comments were really observations and questions Just to be clear as to where I come out on policy at this point It seems to me, as we went around the table and talked about the economy, that the general thrust was that the economy is okay but there was a theme that some moderation has taken place in terms of growth since the last meeting I didn't hear anybody talk about a growth rate that to me would be high enough to sustain this inflationary trend that we're worried about It does seem to me that Ed Boehne makes a very compelling point on this In light of all that, I'd be for alternative B with symmetric language But I would be prompt to take an action by telephone if something in the future would warrant that   I think I hear that any change would be preceded by a phone call   Let me start off, Mr Chairman Other than the flood, which certainly has been a serious event for those who are directly involved, I would not have to comment on any significant changes in the District economy since the last meeting Broadly, things seem very much the same The auto business continues to be strong As we get closer to the end of 1993, the industry is raising its sales forecasts for the year Third-quarter production schedules are running about 20 percent over last year and the expectation is that the fourth-quarter schedules will be higher than last year but that the margin will be much smaller I will say, though, that there is something of a growing concern in Detroit that the auto business has run ahead of the national economy And unless the employment and disposable income gains catch up, the sales levels could be at some jeopardy Order flows for heavy trucks have slowed a bit but the industry doesn't, at least so far, view this as significant They are coming off a very strong period and I think the current softness may well be a reflection of the summer doldrums  In the steel business, the outcome of the trade cases, while certainly disappointing from their perspective, is anticipated to reduce annual domestic shipments by about 2 million tons Also, this is going to have a limiting effect on price increases They had announced an increase of 2-1/2 percent for October that is clearly not going to stick And they now think that the next increase will not be earlier than next January Despite this, though, the underlying business continues to be good and they are forecasting shipments this year at about 86 to 87 million tons Contrary to the national numbers, retail sales in the District in July were comparatively good  -6-    8/17/93  Some of the larger chains that had been having a difficult time experienced some pretty strong gains  In the ag sector it is still, of course, premature to judge the full economic impact of the flood But in a broader perspective, I don't think the effect will be nearly as large as one might guess by watching the television coverage on it Growing conditions in many areas that are not directly affected have really been very good And with higher crop prices, farm income this year is expected to be pretty good But I will say that because the growing cycle is behind by several weeks this year--we got a late start you may remember and all the wetness has delayed the growing cycle--an early frost this year would be a much more significant problem than would normally be the case In the ag equipment business, the level of activity continues to be pretty high Retail sales from one manufacturer that I talked to are running some 20 percent ahead of last year and because their inventories are reasonably low their production in the current quarter is running some 25 percent over last year One manufacturer of construction equipment notes that business is up because equipment is being used in the cleanup after the flood  With regard to inflation, I continue to be impressed by how restrained the price pressures seem to be Many manufacturers say the cost of their outside purchases this year will increase by only 1 percent or even a little less One large manufacturer that I talked 'to says that in fact they are going to have a reduction in their outside purchase prices and costs this year of about 1 percent Virtually everybody we talk to--it's true for retailers and manufacturers--says that marketplace pressures are very, very tough and that there just aren't any signs of widespread price increases On a somewhat continuing somber note, I think the line on this restraint on hiring that we keep hearing about is getting harder and harder with the passage of time [Firms] just will not take on additional full-time employees, and they are continuing to rely on overtime and out-sourcing to deal with their increased production requirements While out-sourcing does increase employment, at least in an indirect sense, it's not the same kind of employment increase that we've had in past cycles And I must say this employment restraint has become something of an absolute mindset among a growing number of CEOs  Turning to the national economy, the outlook is almost surprisingly unchanged, very much in line with the forecast that we developed at the time of the last meeting of the FOMC I think that at this point the risks are about evenly balanced But I must say it does seem like a pretty unexciting outlook Thank you   It's certainly true in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan, not quite so much in Indiana Indiana is going to have a good year, much better than they've had in the past   Yes Production in Indiana looks good and they are delighted with the high prices    8/17/93   Not as good as Indiana It's between Iowa and [Laughter]--it should be obvious it's between Iowa and Indiana!   Mr Chairman, I completely agree with the position you've developed The opening line of the operational paragraph does say "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future" and it does seem to me that in the immediate future the chances that we would we change our policy at all are very remote Therefore, I think symmetric language is appropriate   Mr Chairman, turning to the District, the level of economic activity seems very much unchanged since the last meeting Still, the underlying tone of the reports seems a bit stronger, at least in terms of volumes The automotive business continues at a surprisingly good pace The fourth-quarter production schedules have been set some 11 percent over last year In a comparative sense, the fourth quarter of last year was really quite a strong one so this year's fourth quarter bodes to be a pretty good one And with retail inventories still at good levels, as long as the sales hold up the industry thinks the downside risk on production is reasonably limited The automotive industry, therefore, expects that their activity will be a plus in terms of fourth-quarter GDP The steel business continues at a strong pace given the good first half that they had; it was the best first half since 1981 As [for] the current level of operations, they're at running about 87 percent of capacity They  -13-    9/23/93  expect shipments this year to come in at 87 to 88 million tons So, in terms of production it's a good year They just aren't making any money The October price increase that was announced earlier is not going to stick; but despite that they're really pumping out a lot of metal  Despite the floods and other adversities in the agricultural sector--and as an aside I would say that the weather over the next few weeks is certainly going to be critical to that sector--the farm equipment business continues to be very strong The company I talked to has a scheduled fourth-quarter production level some 30 percent over last year, but last year was really a very, very poor comparative quarter In the truck business, the 1994 outlook for medium trucks is good They're expecting a 10 percent increase next year Heavy trucks will be down a bit, 5 to 6 percent, but this is a result of a regulatory issue; there's a change taking place at the beginning of next year and, therefore, there was some advance buying this year to get the trucks in before that change I continue to be impressed, really even surprised, by the intensive competitive conditions of the marketplace and the very restraining effect that is having on pricing Many companies are achieving outright reductions in the cost of their outside purchases And for those companies experiencing increases, the increases tend to be pretty small and in the production process they are able to overcome those through productivity improvements So, it really is a very, very intense pricing environment But I do find the employment aspects of the environment increasingly worrying Companies are continuing to contract their work forces, and CEOs are taking a very, very hard line on this and are exerting an awful lot of employment discipline on their organizations As an example, in one company in Chicago, which 15 years ago had sales of about $1 billion and 53,000 employees, their sales level currently is up to $4 billion and their employment level is down to 25,000 And despite the increased production levels, which in some cases really are quite significant, I think it's a fair statement to say that no one I have talked to plans to add permanent employees to their payroll  One change in the outlook that I find a little interesting and almost surprising is in the commercial real estate business I talk to a company from time to time that is in the upper end of the commercial business, and over the last three years they have had nothing to report other than just absolutely dismal conditions This time, though, there was a slight change in the tone They think conditions are beginning to improve As yields on alternative investments have come down, people are looking at real estate as a possible investment for a higher yield This is probably an improvement for the wrong reason; nonetheless, it appears to be beginning to result in something of a stronger tone in rental conditions, terms, and other things like that They expect, if this continues and there is an improvement, that as we get into the second half of the 1990s the underlying fundamentals can begin to show some improvement  With regard to the national economy, I think the 2-1/2 percent or so growth rate that we've been talking about continues to be very realistic, very achievable, and that at this point the risks are about evenly balanced Thank you   When you say "a stacked deck," do you mean in terms of the people who will be testifying in front of them or is there something else?   The non-Fed witnesses?   Who other than the voting members [of the FOMC] is likely to appear there?   "B" symmetric, I completely agree   In talking about a delay of, say, three to five years, somehow we seem to have gotten to a very short fuse right off the bat Is there an argument, if we're going to do this, to use a longer time period before release at least at the outset? I think three to five years gets to be very, very short right at the beginning   Why not ten as a start?   Secondly, if I could, looking ahead What's our sense of the real interest within the Banking Committee in terms of making a fundamental change here? I must say that out in the Districts this is an absolute non-issue I haven't heard--   Yes   Does that say, therefore, that if we change our operating procedures a bit in [the way] we develop the current minutes, it's entirely possible that we might not have to make a fundamental change in the way we record our proceedings?   To wit If we don't have a recording, if we don't have transcripts going forward, we need not necessarily change what we do and the way we do it  -16-    11/16/93   Mr Chairman, I'm certainly more concerned about what we do going forward than what we do about the records of previous meetings, and I certainly hope that nothing we do with regard to the existing transcripts is going to affect our [deliberative] process adversely I must say, as kind of an aside, that I have a group of people--some ten people or so--that I talk to before I come down to the FOMC meetings I sent each of them a copy of my [October 19] testimony after I got back just so they'd be aware of what was going on And in my calls this time, getting ready for this meeting, I must say that one of the conversations turned out to be very different It was with a man who runs a very large manufacturing company in our District Normally we have a 15 to 20 minute conversation; this time it was about 5 to 6 minutes And as I went through that process I just had a feeling that maybe he had talked to a lawyer and came forward with quite a different message So, I think there is a risk in this that the information we get and the way we use it is going to have an impact on the way that we develop policy  With regard to the existing transcripts, I would favor the lightly edited transcripts Clearly I would state here, and it doesn't have to be repeated, that all the confidential information should certainly be deleted from them I'd prefer to have the staff do it as opposed to going to the principals; I think it's just easier to have the staff go through them and clean them up I raised the question about timing earlier If we start off with a short time, it's not going to get longer; they're always going to chop it down I'd prefer starting at longer than five years, but if we got to five years on the existing transcripts I think that would be okay  Going forward, I would far prefer the current procedure I must say that I think the current minutes are a very detailed, excellent record of what has taken place, what has been said, and what information we are looking at They are certainly more detailed than the minutes of most other meetings that all of us are familiar with And it seems to me that if we move away from that, it's going to have an effect on the way that we develop policy So I would prefer Don's alternative number one I would cease the recording and I would cease the transcripts I would rely on greater secretarial support to produce the minutes It's probably going to mean that we're all going to have to work a little harder in cleaning them up, but that's the way it is A couple of people have mentioned that the timing of a decision to cease our recording and transcripts now would be awkward; I don't think it would be at all After all, we are having a meeting in which we are discussing the process In the years I have been here we have never had this kind of full discussion It seems to me only reasonable that as a result of it, it's very likely that we would make a change And this is the change that I think would be appropriate   I'm staying with the existing minutes, no recording, no transcript   My first choice would be lightly edited transcripts without annotation; my second choice is raw transcripts with annotation   Could I ask what you mean by annotation?   Ten, first choice; five, second choice   Current minutes first choice; enhanced minutes second choice   Yes, I would too  SPEAKER(?) It's still got four votes; there are four enhances  -51-    11/16/93   Mr Chairman, in the interest of time let me simply say that in the District there really hasn't been a great deal of change since the last meeting But I do think, to a modest [extent] at least, that the underlying level of activity has increased The steel business is going to finish the year on a pretty strong note and [our contacts in that industry] are preliminarily looking for an increase in shipments of 3 to 4 percent next year, so they're feeling pretty good The auto industry currently is having perhaps the best quarter in a sales sense that they've had since the first quarter of 1990 The production schedules for the first quarter of next year have been preliminarily set some 7 percent ahead of [those for the first quarter of] this year, and this is invariably a pretty good quarter So, they're looking currently and ahead at a continuation of good business I must say that the retail side has been a very pleasant surprise I talked to one retailer--they have nationwide activity--who said their sales in October had been simply fantastic Total sales were up 20 percent and on a [same] store basis they were up 12 percent, so he has an underlying feeling that the level of confidence of retailers and consumers is building I mentioned the last time that in terms of commercial real estate some tentative signs of stability are emerging I think that trend is continuing I'm told that there really is an awful lot of capital that is moving into that [area]--again for the wrong reason The fundamentals aren't better but the investment alternatives are such that real estate in a yield sense is looking better And it's now beginning to have an effect on rent conditions, which are slowly beginning to improve at least on the margin We're a long, long way from new construction, but we have to go through this phase before we get to new construction The only negative that I'd report certainly is in the ag sector, for reasons that are well known to the Committee Particularly in our District, we have been very hard hit by growing conditions this summer The [harvest] is about completed on soybeans and seventy-five percent complete on corn, and we really have had a significant reduction in the production of both corn and soybeans While that's bad enough this year, it really does mean that the pressure on next year is going to be very, very heavy If we had two bad years in a row, it would be certainly very tough  -71-    11/16/93  Turning to the nation, I think our [District] outlook is consistent with what we see in the national economy, namely a modestly building growth consistent with the staff forecast It may be even a touch stronger than that But I must say the marketplace pressures are continuing to restrain price increases so that our outlook for inflation is very consistent with the staff forecast   "B" symmetric   Mr Chairman, I agree with your proposal; I certainly support it The only question I would raise, really, relates to access by other people If there was no monetary policy discussion, would I gather therefore that this is something that could be discovered through the Freedom of Information Act?   Well, I'm really raising the issue Is the October 15th tape and transcript one that if somebody comes in and asks for it under the Freedom of Information Act we're going to have to deliver It is, right?   We would not have to do it   Well, then I agree I just wondered, if in fact we would end up having to disclose it, whether tactically there might be some advantage to releasing it publicly at the same time we give it to the Committee But if that's not a risk, then I would not   Mr Chairman, in our District also the underlying level of economic activity has clearly gained some momentum since the last meeting Virtually all the important sectors of our area have shown further improvement, driven largely but certainly not exclusively by the auto sector The auto production schedules, of course, have been strong this quarter; and for the first quarter of next year they have been set some 13 percent over the first quarter of this year The first quarter of this year was a pretty good comparative period And the industry estimates that their contribution to first-quarter GDP will be just a little stronger than the number that's in the Greenbook Given this, it's not surprising that the steel industry continues to operate at high levels Shipments this year will come in at about 88 million tons The forecast for next year is that they will ship over 90 million tons, a 3 to 4 percent increase One company that I talked with said that the outlook for the steel industry in the next two or three years is the best that they have seen in some fifteen years  Other parts of our economy also are doing well The farm equipment business has been strong The heavy truck business is expecting an even higher level of sales next year than this year So the improved level that we have experienced this year, as it turns out, has not just been due to the environmental standards that will become effective January 1st Machine tool orders, as an example, though down in the third quarter, for the year through October are up by almost 30 percent And retail sales--and I do think this is a fairly strong and recent development--really have increased quite substantially over the past month or so It's uneven; it's much stronger on the durable goods side than apparel Nonetheless, overall retail conditions are described as the best that have prevailed in some three to four years And I think I'd give high odds that the Christmas season is going to come in a little better than some of the forecasts that we're hearing about The employment situation also has strengthened Consistent with what Al has just said, for the first time that I can remember a heavy manufacturer has indicated that they will add employees at one of their facilities So far they have been able to meet the increased demand by increasing the line speed They now plan to add another shift, which will require additional employees They are completely out of capacity and the major constraint is a shortage of qualified drivers; there just aren't enough people available to drive the trucks And  who has been very cautious--really rather bearish for some time --describes employment conditions as the best he has seen in quite some while  With regard to the national economy, clearly the fourth quarter will come in on the strong side I think the question, as Mike has outlined, is whether or not we will experience the same kind of drop in the first quarter of next year as we did this year or whether [the quarter] will be more in line with the staff forecast And I must say at this point I think there is enough underlying momentum in place in the economy that the decline is quite likely to be very much in line with the staff forecast But there are some uncertainties out there, which are now well familiar Certainly, at this point at least, [the forecast] is not free from doubt With regard to pricing we are experiencing this interesting dichotomy very strong growth in economic activity yet pricing conditions that  -10-    12/21/93  continue to be very, very competitive Despite the higher demand for their products, manufacturers just don't have the latitude to raise prices with confidence that [the increases] will stick They are continuing to put tremendous pressure on their suppliers to maintain or even reduce their prices, and many of them are achieving some considerable success Whether this very fundamental change will last or whether we're setting the stage for somewhat higher prices on a broader basis remains to be seen I have a hunch that this will be the basis of our discussion when we get into the policy deliberations   Right   Mr Chairman, I also would be in favor of alternative B with symmetric language It does seem to me that the environment is one in which the policy stance ought to be heading to asymmetry toward tightening But I do think it's a question of timing The key here will be how the first-quarter data begin to come in rather than the fourth-quarter data I just don't think we're going to have that much available for a while that will tell us how the first quarter is really coming in And until we have that, I'd prefer to stay just where we are   I'm very much in favor of announcing it Whether it's an announcement from the Chairman or the Committee I think is immaterial If we do it today, which I think we should, we will have established a precedent and we will have to continue But I think it's a constructive change   Mr Chairman, in terms of the District, there is no question that the underlying level of economic activity has been and remains strong And despite the miserable weather that we have had in the Midwest most sectors, with the obvious exception of housing construction, have come through very, very well  There is little that I can add to what you already know about the automotive sector The second-quarter production schedules have been set preliminarily at 9 percent over last year This increase would be even greater except that some of the manufacturers are dealing with capacity constraints with some of their better selling models Still, the production increase in the second quarter will be less than in the first quarter, as Mike has pointed out Therefore, the automotive industry's contribution to the second-quarter GDP will be lower than was the case in the first quarter The capacity issue in the automotive industry, though, is an interesting shift from an industry that for years has been experiencing plant shutdowns and layoffs Now in some cases, they are struggling to keep up with consumer demand, which of course is particularly the case for light trucks To address their problem Chrysler, for example, has announced a $18 billion capital investment program And we are told that it's very likely that this program will be larger as they get further into it Given what Chrysler has been through over the last 10 or 15 years, it seems almost incredible that they are now the industry's star profit performer I must say that for the auto industry, all the way through from the manufacturers to the suppliers to the dealers, attitudes at this point are really very positive The heavy truck business has only gotten better, and Class 8 sales estimates for 1994 have been increased to 185,000 units The current order flow is the highest that they've had in 15 years and it's potentially a record year for some of the major manufacturers  -21-    3/22/94  The steel industry is running essentially flat out even though the current capacity utilization number is 93 percent That number is somewhat misleading; several companies are really producing at what they feel is their capacity limit Some of the major customers of the steel industry, and the auto companies are a specific example, have become concerned about the ability of the industry to meet their demand Ironically, steel imports this year will increase and likely significantly, but a large part of the increase will come from the domestic companies that will be purchasing foreign semi- finished products to meet domestic demand There is another increase in steel prices coming this summer Some while ago, US Steel announced a 2 percent increase that was scheduled for midyear It kind of hung out there for a while and others didn't join it; but now it looks as if the others will support that price increase  Retail sales have remained on the strong side To the amazement of one retailer I've talked to, their comparable store sales in February were 17 percent higher than last year, with good demand for higher-priced items They also worry about the ability of their suppliers to deliver, and in several instances the suppliers for this particular company are adding to their capacity  Despite this very strong level of economic activity I just don't sense that the price pressures are quite as heavy as I might have expected Major companies, particularly those that buy under contract, are continuing to push their suppliers very hard and they are continuing to get results from this Labor contracts continue to be very restrained, and wage increases are easily dealt with by productivity improvements, which continue to be very impressive Having said that, there clearly are signs that in many cases prices have at least stabilized and that some are showing slight upticks That's particularly true, of course, for steel-related products But while prices in the manufacturing sector may be firming, these increases have been offset by moderations in the service sector So I think, net, our outlook for inflation continues to be a constructive one  With regard to the national economy, our forecast is very much in line with the staff forecast And I think at this point the risks, if any, are as Ed Boehne has just suggested--namely that perhaps the numbers will come in higher than our current expectation   Well, it is a tough call I can't remember a time that the call has been tougher than it is right now I can come up with good arguments, at least in my own mind, for and against either 25 or 50 basis points But on reflecting, I do come down agreeing that at this time the 25 basis point move is the appropriate thing to do I would not be in favor of asymmetric language I would be in favor of symmetric language, not because I disagree with the direction of policy--I think we will be moving again--but because I'd rather not make it such a regular thing that the moves are going to be dependent on the timing of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee I would be opposed to establishing that kind of pattern Moreover, I'm just in general opposed to asymmetric language We had a very bad experience with asymmetric language last spring and, therefore, I'd prefer to leave the language symmetric I do think that the economy is going through a very dynamic phase and that we should keep in pretty current contact as we go through this period Therefore, I'd be in favor of 25 basis points now with symmetric language but an understanding that probably we would have a phone call before the next meeting and might make a change at that point   In terms of the District, the underlying level of activity, which of course has been strong, just continues to gain momentum The auto industry, for example, which directly and indirectly so dominates our area, continues to exceed our earlier expectations Second-quarter production schedules were set at 12 percent over last year, and since retail inventories are at relatively low levels, even if there is a fall-off in sales this ought not to affect the production schedules The third quarter at this point seems a long way off; nonetheless, the early expectations are that the production levels will be up very substantially over last year And,  -13-    5/17/94  of course, the third quarter is normally a very slow quarter While the April auto sales were down a bit from the first-quarter level, some of that reduction results from the shortage of the better selling models Production capacity constraints really are getting to be an increasing problem In this environment, the steel business continues to be excellent; the raw production side of the industry is operating essentially flat out And it's more than just autos The appliance business is also very strong, as is the demand for other housing- related steel products There is, though, a little capacity available in the finishing end of the steel business, and the majors will be increasing their purchases of semi-finished steel products from foreign sources to fill out that available capacity An activity that I haven't mentioned in years because it's been so absolutely moribund is the rail car manufacturing business There also has been a decided pickup in demand as the fleet has gotten a lot older While people in the industry do not expect that deliveries will be quite as high as some of the published reports that you've seen, nonetheless, we are told that shipments of 35,000 to 40,000 cars annually over the next few years seem reasonable Not surprisingly, prices of rail cars are being increased this year, and there is a more substantial price increase scheduled for next year  The heavy-duty truck business has been even stronger since the last meeting The Class 8 sales forecast has been raised again, this time to 195,000 units, and the sales level will be constrained by capacity limitations as will the sales of medium-size trucks GM, for example, would like to add a third shift to one of their medium truck production facilities, but they just can't get the qualified workers Offsetting this somewhat, retail sales so far in May are reported to be a little slower than earlier in the year, but I think this is a comparative issue, not one of weakness in market conditions Sales of some items, such as home appliances, continue at a very fast pace A very large retailer told me the other day that their sales of appliances, for example, in April were 25 percent over the sales level of last year  In the ag sector, so far the planting has been going well Corn and soybean acreage is expected to be up this year, and both the corn and soybean plantings, as of last week at least, were well ahead of the normal schedules It is, of course, a long, long way to harvest Nonetheless, we are off to a good start with what are regarded as generally good moisture conditions Sales of ag equipment are well ahead of last year, with sales of large tractors some 18 percent higher than last year; and last year was, in a comparative sense, quite strong  All of this strength certainly gives a very positive tone to the District, but I do think there are some worrisome signs on the pricing front In the steel business, I've mentioned at a past meeting or two that there is a $10 a ton price increase scheduled for July 1, and at this point virtually everybody expects that to stick In addition, the majors are adjusting discounts and pricing for extras, which will have the effect of raising steel prices by about another 2 percent Aluminum manufacturers are reducing their production to firm up the prices Admittedly the latter are at low levels, but the reduced production levels nonetheless have resulted in higher prices, and I am told that the Russians are cooperating with this effort One very large user of aluminum told me the other day  -14-    5/17/94  that they are forecasting about a 17 percent increase in the price they will pay for aluminum next year Many other manufacturers report an upward shift in the cost of their raw material and component purchases By no means is this a dramatic shift, but it indicates just a different attitude and a different tone out there than has been the case in the past Some, of course, are finding ways to pass these increases through in the form of higher prices for their products For example, although their heavy truck prices won't be increased this year, one very large manufacturer is planning a pretty significant price increase next year Of course, retail auto prices are being increased as we go along here Despite all this, so far there does not seem to be any upward pressure on the wage front Though everybody we talk to says there is a shortage of qualified labor, so far at least it has not resulted in higher wage rates; but I just wonder how long that can continue to hold  With regard to the national economy, our numbers are essentially in line with those of the Board staff I do think that at this point the risks, both in terms of growth and inflation, are on the up side   Well, Mr Chairman, I certainly support the proposal The only question I have is a technical one Is this a single announcement today and is it going to be announced by you or announced by the Committee or--   Okay
