  Well, perhaps  I’d point to the part of exhibits 2 and 3 where we use the   FRB/US model  Now, that is a large model with lots of persistence in it; a large number of   lagged states and lagged errors are at work there  Let’s say you ask what the optimal   parameterization of this simple policy rule would be  You ask it to pick up the very thing that I   believe Glenn is describing  What it tells you is that, unless there is a high degree forward-  January 28-29, 2003 29 of 195    looking expectations, the optimal policy doesn’t want that lag  It doesn’t want that lag to proxy   for the same kind of things that Glenn argues empirically it is proxying for  Does that mean   Glenn is wrong?  Not necessarily  It could mean that the model is wrong  But it isn’t clear that   what Glenn is referring to is not being adequately captured in what we’re describing in exhibits 2   and 3     The same thing is true, I might add, about the term structure evidence  For this term   structure evidence to explain what Glenn wants it to explain, he has to assume rational   expectations  That’s a presumption in his analysis  But as you saw in exhibit 3, if there are   rational expectations, the optimal strategy calls for a lot of persistence in the fed funds rate  So   one can interpret Glenn’s evidence as suggesting that rational expectations are not there, in   which case they shouldn’t have produced inertia in the first place  There again, it doesn’t mean   that Glenn is wrong, but it does mean that there is friction between these two views, and it can’t   be settled at this table       Yes     This is also true, if I might add just one last point, in the “policymaker   perfect foresight” simulation  Without the usual penalty on interest rate volatility—remember a   policymaker in that case is taking everything into account, including the kinds of things that   Glenn was referring to such as the tech bubble and current and future geopolitical risks—it, too,   predicts very volatile, very aggressive monetary policy as the optimal thing to do  So in short,   this outcome has nothing to do with the parsimony of a simple rule and has everything to do with   the rest of the structure     Let me answer your question in a slightly different way than Glenn did    I interpret your question as saying suppose private-sector agents don’t understand the rule or,   even more generally, the model  In that case you might ask if there is a role that the Fed can play   in the conduct of monetary policy that will assist private-sector agents in learning that rule over a   shorter period of time or getting to the right equilibrium  As you know, Jim Bullard at the   Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis works on this  There is a small and growing literature on the   subject of learnability, and that literature does say that some inertia in policy is beneficial in   helping private-sector agents learn the rule and come to the rational expectations equilibrium   I’m sympathetic to that view myself, but I don’t know how much weight to put on it because I   don’t think it has been tested in a broad enough set of models to know whether that view is   universally correct  At this point, all the experiments that have been conducted have been done   on extremely simple models that have no inherent persistence other than in the policy rule; they   are models that jump instantaneously in response to shocks at all points in time  I have a   suspicion that in a model that has intrinsic lags—so that shocks, regardless of the policy, take   some time to play out—it might not be as important to have that persistence in the rule  But I   can’t really say that I know the answer      There is a literature on robust policy design in which there are a number   of different ways to model this  The one that you seem to be pointing to is a rival model   methodology where we put different models up and see what we get if we take the optimal rule   from one model and put it into some other model  Most of the literature suggests that policy   January 28-29, 2003 39 of 195    should protect against the worst possible case in the set of models that we’re willing to consider    The usual prescription that comes out is that policy is more active than it would be under the   policy for your base case model  But it’s going to depend on what models are in your set  It’s   certainly possible to have cases in which it’s optimal to stay in a narrower range  It’s difficult to   come up with a definitive answer, but that’s where the bulk of the literature seems to be pointing   at the moment     Well, let me give you one particular example  Suppose you had two   models that differed in the degree of persistence in inflation—your Bank’s random walk model is   one of those examples  If you get a shock to the output gap in that kind of model, it produces a   cycle of inflation that lasts for an extended period of time  Suppose in the other model, if you   shock it, inflation dies out quickly  If you design optimal policy for the model where inflation   dies out quickly, that model is going to say don’t worry about inflation—just respond to output,   and everything will be fine  The other model is going to say, no, inflation is something that you   have to attack on a quarter-to-quarter basis  Every time there’s a shock to that Phillips curve   model, inflation is going to take off on you unless you react  So if you’re trying to protect   against the worst case in those two models, you’re going to respond aggressively       I think we’re creeping up that curve on the bottom left     It’s hard to say       That’s a difficult question because it depends on how people learn, a   mechanism that is not formally in the model itself  If people have completed their learning and   know your rule and you do something quite different from your rule, does that cause them to   reinterpret what you’re doing and conclude that you must not be using the rule they thought they   January 28-29, 2003 52 of 195    knew?  That’s when confusion results, and they can’t predict the funds rate ninety days ahead,   for example  There is not very much literature on this, mostly because there’s no agreed-upon   theory about how people learn  What I think is true, and this is just a feeling on my part, is that   if the events the Fed is responding to are extraordinary—outside the normal random shocks that   occur from period to period—the private sector is quite happy to give you the benefit of the   doubt     Yes  But if you’re responding idiosyncratically to normal shocks so that   it doesn’t seem as if you’re acting in a systematic way, that will undermine people’s beliefs that   you’re following a committed rule, or rule-like behavior, that anchors their expectations That is   the key here  One thing we didn’t show you in the material we presented is that, if you get to the   point Governor Ferguson referred to—where you’ve moved up the curve in exhibit 3 and are   near the top of it so that people are more rational—the performance of the economy is much   better than if they’re not rational  That’s the first point  The second is that people are also very   forgiving of mistakes  If you do behave differently than the policy rule would call for—and   people don’t bail on you and say they don’t know what you’re doing now—the policy loss from   doing something other than the optimal is very small  If people are rational, they are willing to   give you that benefit
