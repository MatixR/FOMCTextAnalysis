8072,2007-01-30,"  Thank you  [Applause]   1  Thank you  In terms of market developments, I would like to  focus on three major topics  First is the sharp adjustment in market expectations  concerning monetary policy since the last FOMC meeting  Second, I will talk about  the persistence of high risk appetites in credit markets, with a focus on what may be  the most vulnerable market in the United States—the subprime mortgage sector   Third, I want to discuss the possible factors behind some of the sharp shifts we have  seen in commodity prices since the last FOMC meeting, in particular whether these  price movements reflect a shift in risk appetite among noncommercial investors or  fundamental developments in supply and demand     First, there has been a sharp shift in market expectations with respect to interest   rates since the last meeting  At the time of the December meeting, the consensus  view among market participants was that the FOMC would begin to lower its federal  funds rate target this spring and that this easing process would continue into 2008,  with cumulative rate cuts of about 75 basis points  As you can see in chart 1, which  looks at the federal funds futures market, and chart 2, which looks at the yield spreads  between the March 2008 and the March 2007 Eurodollar futures contracts,  expectations have shifted very sharply over the past month  There is now no easing  priced in through midyear 2007 and a residual of only about 25 basis points of easing  priced in beyond that  This shift in expectations can also be seen across the Treasury  yield curve  As chart 3 shows, the Treasury yield curve is now slightly above where  it was at the time of October FOMC meeting  Since the December FOMC meeting,  there has been a rise of about 35 to 40 basis points in yields from two-year to thirty- year maturities  The shift in expectations is reflected predominately in real interest  rates  As can be seen in chart 4, breakeven inflation rates have not changed much  since the last FOMC meeting—the decline in breakeven rates that occurred early in  the intermeeting period has been reversed more recently, and so we are at or slightly  above where we were at the December meeting  This upward shift in real rates  appears to reflect a reassessment by market participants not only about the near-term  path of short-term rates but also about what level of real short-term rates is likely to  prove sustainable over the medium and longer term The buoyancy of the recent  activity data may have caused some market participants to reassess what level of the  real federal funds rate is likely to prove “neutral” over the longer term     Regarding the issue of risk appetite, there appears to be no significant change   since the last FOMC meeting  Risk appetite remains very strong  Corporate credit  spreads remain very tight—especially in the high-yield sector (as shown in chart 5)— and implied volatilities across the broad market categories—equities and interest rates  (see chart 6) and foreign exchange rates (see chart 7)—remain unusually low   Moreover, the turbulence in some emerging debt and equity markets experienced                                                     1 Material used by Mr Dudley is appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   January 30-31, 2007 6 of 255    early this month was mostly transient and has subsided as well  So things appear  calm  But what are the areas of greatest risk?     In the United States, the subprime mortgage market appears to be a particularly   vulnerable sector  The vulnerability stems from four factors  First, this market is  relatively new and untested  Chart 8 shows the overall trend of first residential  mortgage originations and the share of these mortgages by type—conforming, jumbo,  subprime, and alt-A, which is a quality category that sits above subprime but is not  quite as good as conforming  As can be seen in this chart, subprime mortgage  originations have climbed in recent years, even as overall originations have fallen  In  2006, subprime mortgages were 24 percent of total originations, up from a share of  about 10 percent in 2003  The second factor is that credit standards in this market  appear to have loosened in 2006, with the proportion of interest-only loans and low- documentation loans climbing as a share of the total  As a result, there are some signs  that strains in this market are increasing  As chart 9 shows, delinquency rates have  moved somewhat higher  In contrast, charge-offs remain low, held down by the rapid  house price appreciation that we saw in recent years  Most noteworthy, as shown in  chart 10, the most recent 2006 vintage of subprime mortgages is showing a much  more rapid rise in delinquencies than earlier vintages showed  The third factor is that  most outstanding subprime mortgage loans have adjustable rates  There is significant  reset risk given the rise in short-term rates in 2005 and the first half of 2006 and the  fact that many of these loans started with low “teaser” rates  Fourth, housing prices  are under some pressure, and this could contribute to further credit strains  I see some  risk of a vicious cycle  If credit spreads in the securitized market spike because loan  performance is poor, a sharp downturn in lending could result as the capital market  for securitized subprime mortgage products closes  This constriction of credit could  put downward pressure on prices and lead to more credit problems among borrowers  The result would be additional credit quality problems, wider credit spreads, and a  further contraction of credit  Fortunately, to date the news is still fairly favorable   The strong demand for the credit derivatives obligations created from subprime  mortgage products has restrained the rise in credit spreads  As can be seen in chart  11, spreads are still well below the peaks reached in late 2002 and early 2003  Thus,  the economics of making such loans and securitizing them into the capital markets  still work  But this situation could change very quickly, especially if the labor  markets were to become less buoyant and the performance of the underlying loans  were to deteriorate, leading to a surge in delinquencies and charge-offs     Let me now turn to the commodity markets  The issue I wish to examine here is   whether some of the sharp movements in commodity prices that we have observed  since the last FOMC meeting represent shifts in the risk appetite among  noncommercial investors who have put funds into commodities as a new asset class  versus the contrasting view that these price movements predominantly represent  changes in the underlying supply and demand fundamentals  To get a sense of this,  let’s look briefly at three commodities that have moved the most and are  representative of their classes—copper, corn, and crude oil  As chart 12 shows, the  sharp decline in copper prices appears linked to the large rise in copper inventories at   January 30-31, 2007 7 of 255    the London Metal Exchange  If anything, the price decline appears overdue  For  corn, the rise in prices also appears consistent with declining stocks both in the  United States and globally (see chart 13) as well as the growing demand anticipated  for corn in the production of ethanol  For crude oil, the decline in prices is more  difficult to tie back to inventories  Although US inventories remain high relative to  the five-year historical average (as shown in chart 14), this situation has persisted for  some time without having a big effect on prices  Instead, the shift in oil prices  appears to be driven mostly by longer-term forces  This can be seen in two ways  First, as shown in chart 15, the change in oil prices has occurred in both spot and  forward prices  The oil curve has shifted downward in mostly a parallel fashion,  which also calls into question the role of unseasonably warm weather as the primary  driver  If weather were the primary factor, then the decline in prices should have  been reflected much more strongly in the spot and very short-end of the oil price  curve  Second, as shown in chart 16, OPEC spare production capacity has been  increasing and is expected to continue increasing in 2007  This growing safety  margin reflects both slower growth in global demand and the expansion of non-OPEC  output  The improved safety margin may be an important factor behind recent  developments in the energy sector     Finally, there were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote to   ratify the operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the  December FOMC meeting        I think that is definitely part of the story  Another part of the story is   that in some countries, especially emerging market countries, the oil was heavily subsidized, and   some of those subsidies are now coming off because continuing to subsidize as the oil price   climbs entails a rather heavy budgetary burden  So you’re also seeing a sort of normalization of   oil prices in a lot of places  Think about the oil that Russia used to sell to Eastern Europe or   January 30-31, 2007 8 of 255    some of the surrounding countries at preferential prices  They are no longer getting those   preferential prices, so there is a demand response  I think it is happening on both sides  There   has been a demand response to higher oil prices, and there has been a supply response coming   out of places like Africa     As you know, this topic is undergoing a lot of further research  The   academic literature that I’ve surveyed has yet to uncover a strong causal relationship between a   climb in speculative open interest and the effect on price  One reason that is hard to imagine   January 30-31, 2007 9 of 255    happening to a powerful degree in the end is that the speculators really don’t want to take actual   delivery of the physical commodity, and so the price really should clear in the spot market on   what’s happening to underlying supply and demand  But this topic certainly remains under   investigation by a number of researchers  I don’t think we have the definitive answer to the   question at this point     It’s quite a bit smaller share of total outstanding because the average life   of the subprime mortgage loan, I’m told, is only two or three years  In other words, if your credit   quality improves, you will refinance out of your subprime mortgage into a higher quality   mortgage  So originations are 24 percent, but the actual number of subprimes that are actually   outstanding is much lower     It’s not that markets won’t work  It’s just the economics of originating   subprime loans and selling them into the market would no longer work  In other words, at some   point, if the actual capital markets are not willing to accept those subprime mortgages at the right   price, then the ability of the person to originate the mortgages and sell them into the market goes   away   Now, would this wreck the market?  Well, it depends, because some subprime originators   can carry these loans on their own books  But the industry is quite fragmented, with a lot of   these issuers not having the ability to carry these subprime loans on their books  So that part of   the subprime origination market would go away  Some of the monoline subprime originators   would be unable to exist if there weren’t a securitized demand for those assets     You could think of the situation as credit availability to that sector   diminishing, which could have feedback effects on price  That’s the risk     I would agree with that  You have somewhat firmer growth but better   inflation news, and so the Committee is about in the same place on net that it was before  I would   be very surprised to see much of a market reaction at all  "
8098,2007-03-20,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial markets have become  much more turbulent since the last meeting—especially in subprime mortgages and  associated securities, in US and global equities, and in foreign exchange markets   The good news is that markets have generally remained liquid and well functioning,  with a minor exception on the New York Stock Exchange on February 27  Moreover,  there are few signs of significant contagion from the subprime mortgage market into  the rest of the mortgage market or from subprime mortgage credit spreads to  corporate credit spreads more generally  In general, the debt markets have been  mostly unruffled by recent developments     I plan to focus my attention on four major market developments  First, the   substantial turmoil in the subprime mortgage market—I talked about the risk that this  market might unravel at the January FOMC meeting; that certainly occurred more  quickly and more forcefully than I anticipated  Second, I want to talk a little about  the decline in US equity prices and the accompanying rise in actual and implied  price volatility  Third is the sharp correction in the so-called “carry trade” in foreign  exchange markets  The low interest rate currencies such as the yen and the Swiss  franc have appreciated, with the greatest moves coming against their higher-yielding  counterparts  Finally, I’ll talk a bit about the sharp downward shift in market  expectations about the path of the federal funds rate target over the next year and a  half  Two key questions motivate my comments  First, is the market turbulence  driven mainly by fundamental developments, or does it reflect mainly a shift in the  risk appetite of investors?  Second, what is the ongoing risk of contagion from the  market area that has experienced the most stress—the subprime mortgage market—to  other markets?     Regarding the subprime mortgage market, the deterioration appears driven mostly   by fundamental developments  As you know, the delinquency rates for subprime  adjustable-rate mortgages have risen sharply  In contrast, as shown in exhibit 1 of the  handout, there has been little change in delinquency rates for fixed-rate mortgages   Most significantly, delinquency rates for the 2006 vintage of subprime adjustable-rate  mortgages have climbed unusually quickly  As shown in exhibit 2, the last vintage  that went this bad so fast was the 2001 vintage, and that had a much different  economic environment—one characterized by a mild recession and a rising  unemployment rate  The deterioration in the quality of subprime mortgage credit has  led to a sharp widening in credit spreads for the ABX indexes  The ABX indexes                                                     1 Material used by Mr Dudley is appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   March 20-21, 2007 3 of 196    represent the cost of default protection on a basket of collateralized debt obligations  that are backstopped mainly by subprime mortgages  As shown in exhibit 3, although  this widening has been most pronounced at the bottom end of the credit quality  spectrum (BBB-minus and BBB), it has rippled upward to the higher-rated tranches  that are better protected  Exhibit 4 shows how the credit deterioration initially  registered in the ABX indexes as market participants sought to buy protection  In  milder form, this deterioration also registered in the underlying collateralized debt  obligations and asset-backed securities  The widening of the credit spread in the  ABX indexes was probably exaggerated by the fact that there was an asymmetry  between the many that were seeking loss protection and the few that were willing to  write protection  This can be seen in two ways  First, as shown in exhibit 4, the  spread widening was more pronounced in the ABX index than in either underlying  collateralized debt obligations or asset-backed securities  Second, as shown in exhibit  3, the ABX spreads have come down a bit from their peaks even as the underlying  market for subprime mortgages, as reflected in the ongoing viability of many  mortgage originators, has continued to deteriorate         The deterioration in the subprime market has undermined the economics of   subprime mortgage origination and securitization  This is especially true for those  mortgage originators with poorer underwriting track records  Their loans can no  longer be sold at a sufficient premium to par value to cover their origination costs  In  addition, the costs that they must incur to replace loans that have defaulted early have  increased sharply  In several cases, these difficulties have caused banks to pull their  warehouse lines of credit  Several of the large monoline originators are bankrupt,  distressed, or up for sale—they are highlighted in red in exhibit 5  Moreover, several  of the diversified lenders, such as HSBC, have indicated that they are tightening  credit standards and pulling back from this sector  The result is that the volume of  subprime mortgage originations is likely to fall sharply this year—perhaps dropping  one-third or more from the 2006 rate of slightly more than $600 billion  This  tightening of credit availability to subprime borrowers is likely to manifest itself  through a number of channels  These channels include (1) a drop in housing demand,  as borrowers who would have been able to get credit in 2006 no longer qualify under  now toughened underwriting standards; (2) an increase in housing supply, as the rate  of housing foreclosures increases (notably, the Mortgage Bankers Association  reported last week that the rate of loans entering the foreclosure process in the fourth  quarter of 2006 reached a record level of 054 percent, the highest level in the history  of the thirty-seven-year-old survey); and (3) additional downward pressure on home  prices, which in turn threatens to increase the magnitude of credit problems,  delinquencies, and foreclosures       In considering these channels, it is important to emphasize that the credit strains   in the subprime sector are unlikely to have peaked yet  The reset risk on the  adjustable-rate portion of the subprime loans originated in 2005 and 2006 will be felt  mainly over the remainder of 2007 and 2008  Most of the adjustable-rate loans are  fixed for two years at low “teaser” rates  When yields adjust upward once the teaser  rate period is over, some borrowers may have insufficient resources to service these   March 20-21, 2007 4 of 196    debts  The good news—at least to date—is that spillover into the alt-A mortgage and  conforming mortgage areas is very mild, both in terms of credit spreads and in terms  of loan performance  Although there has been some rise in delinquency and  foreclosure rates for higher-quality residential mortgages, these rates are still low both  qualitatively and historically  Moreover, there is little evidence that the subprime  problems have hurt mortgage loan volumes  For example, the Mortgage Bankers  Association index of mortgage applications for purchase has increased in the past  three weeks      Turning next to the US equity market, it is less clear-cut whether the decline in   prices and the rise in volatility are fundamentally based  As several observers have  noted, equity valuations do not appear to be excessive  If that is the case, then why  have equities been more turbulent than corporate and emerging-market debt, for  which spreads remain unusually narrow?  Although this point is legitimate, two  fundamental developments that make US equity prices less attractive deserve  mention  First, equity analysts have been reducing their earnings forecasts for 2007   Although the top-down view of the equity strategists for the S&P 500 index has not  changed much, on a bottom-up basis, earnings expectations have dropped sharply   As shown in exhibit 6, the aggregate forecasts of the individual sector analysts now  indicate a growth rate in S&P 500 earnings for 2007 of about 6 percent, down from  about 9 percent at the beginning of the year  In contrast, S&P 500 earnings have  grown at an annual rate of more than 10 percent for four consecutive years  It should  be no surprise that falling earnings expectations could weigh on equity prices   Second, uncertainty about the growth outlook has increased  This shows up clearly,  for example, in our most recent primary dealer survey  Because greater uncertainty  about the growth outlook presumably implies greater risk, the rise in uncertainty  should—all else being equal—result in lower share prices  In contrast, it is easier to  explain the modest widening of corporate credit spreads  In theory, lower share  prices and higher volatility imply a greater risk of default, which should imply wider  credit spreads  Corporate credit spreads have behaved in a manner consistent with  this  Josh Rosenberg from the research group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York recently investigated this issue  He found that the spread widening in the high- yield corporate debt sector was consistent with past periods in which the implied  volatility for equities rose sharply  Exhibit 7 summarizes one key result  The  widening in the BB-rated corporate spreads in the week after the February 27  retrenchment was of a magnitude similar to that of other instances in which implied  equity-price volatility as measured by the VIX index rose sharply  In the most recent  episode, the VIX index rose 848 basis points, and the BB corporate spread rose  27 basis points  This rise compares with an average rise of 21 basis points in the BB  spread in the ten cases in which the VIX rose most sharply  The rise in the most  recent episode is well within the range of historical experience        In many other areas in which asset prices have moved sharply, risk-reduction   efforts appear to have played the biggest role  For example, in the foreign exchange  markets, the biggest currency moves were in the currency pairs associated with so- called carry trades, such as the yen and Swiss franc for the low-yielding currencies   March 20-21, 2007 5 of 196    and the Australian and New Zealand dollar for the high yielders  Exhibit 8 indicates  the change in the yen versus the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the euro,  the British pound, and the US dollar during three separate periods—the week before  the February 27 stock market selloff, the week of the stock market selloff, and the  past two weeks  The high-yielding currencies appreciated the most during the run-up  to the February 27 selloff, fell the most during the February 27 week, and have  recovered the most against the yen over the past two weeks  The changes in  speculative positioning in foreign exchange future markets tell a similar story   Exhibit 9 shows the change in the share of the open interest position held by  participants in the noncommercial futures market  Over the past few weeks, net short  positions as a percentage of the overall open interest in the yen have dropped, and  long positions in the British pound and Australian dollar have dropped        An examination of how Treasury yields, stock prices, exchange rates, and credit   spreads have moved also indicates that risk-reduction efforts have been important   Exhibit 10 shows the correlation of daily price and yield movements in 2007 before  February 27  As one can see, the correlations were quite low  In contrast, the  correlation matrix in exhibit 11 shows the correlation of daily price moves for the  period beginning on February 27  Most of the correlations have climbed sharply,  suggesting that risk positioning is driving price and yield movements     Finally, short-term interest rate expectations have shifted substantially since the   last FOMC meeting  As shown in exhibit 12, near-term expectations have shifted,  with market participants now expecting a modest reduction in the federal funds rate  target by late summer  However, the federal funds rate futures curve is still above the  curve at the time of the December FOMC meeting  In contrast, longer-term  expectations have shifted more sharply, with a larger move toward easing  As shown  in exhibit 13, the June 2008/June 2007 Eurodollar calendar spread is now inverted by  about 60 basis points  This calendar spread is more inverted than it was at the time of  the December 2006 FOMC meeting       Compared with the shift in market expectations, the forecasts of primary dealers   have not changed much  Exhibits 14 and 15 compare dealer expectations with market  expectations before the January FOMC meeting and before this meeting  The  horizontal bold lines represent market expectations  The blue circles represent the  different dealer forecasts  The green circles represent the average dealer forecast for  each period  The two exhibits illustrate several noteworthy points  First, the average  dealer forecast has not changed much since the January FOMC meeting—the green  circles in the two charts are in virtually the same position  Second, the amount of  dispersion among the dealers’ forecasts has not changed much—in fact, the range of  the blue circles is slightly narrower currently  Although many dealers now mention  that their uncertainty about the growth outlook has increased, that does not appear to  have been reflected in their modal forecasts  Third, there is now a substantial gap  between the dealers’ average forecast and market expectations—the gap between the  horizontal bold lines, which represent market expectations, and the green circles,  which represent the average dealer’s view, has increased  Why is there a large gap   March 20-21, 2007 6 of 196    between the dealers’ forecasts and market expectations?   I think there are three major  explanations  First, the dealers’ forecasts are modal forecasts and do not reflect the  downside risks that many dealers now believe have emerged in the growth outlook   Second, dealer forecasts often lag behind economic and market developments  Only  when “downside risks” grow big enough to pass some threshold are dealers likely to  alter their modal forecasts  Third, some of the downward shift in market expectations  may represent risk-reduction efforts  An investor with speculative risk positions that  would be vulnerable to economic weakness might hedge these risks by buying  Eurodollar futures contracts  This hedging could push the implied yields on  Eurodollar futures contracts lower than what would be consistent with an unbiased  forecast of the likely path of the federal funds rate     Nevertheless, the potential gap between market expectations and the Committee’s   interest rate expectations may pose a bit of a conundrum for the Committee  If the  Committee were to shift the bias of its statement in the direction of neutral, market  expectations with respect to easing would undoubtedly be pulled forward and might  become more pronounced  After all, most dealers expect that the Committee will not  change the inflation bias of the January FOMC statement  In contrast, keeping the  bias unchanged in order to keep market expectations from shifting further in the  easing direction might be inconsistent with the Committee’s assessment of the  relative risks regarding growth and inflation  If the Committee were to keep the bias  unchanged even when its views had changed, the communication process might be  impaired      On a housekeeping note, I wish to bring to the Committee’s attention the changes   to the “Morning Call” with the Trading Desk  They were discussed in a memo  distributed to the Committee last week  Under the new format, which we plan to  implement on Thursday, the call will be open to all members of the Committee, and  you will have the option of participating in the 910 am discussion of reserve  management issues, the 920 am portion covering recent developments in global  markets, or both portions  The March 15 memo outlines the new procedures for  joining these calls  Finally, there were no foreign operations during this period  I  request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the System Open Market Account  since the January FOMC meeting  Of course, I am very happy to take questions      Well, unfortunately, the information on the alt-A market is not very good    In fact, there is disagreement about exactly what an alt-A mortgage is  If you can’t define it, it’s   pretty hard to measure  That is problem number one  A good way of thinking about the mortgage   market is as a continuum of loan quality extending from, at the bottom, the worst underwritten   subprime mortgages that are adjustable rate up to the conforming mortgages that we always   associate with the GSEs, with alt-A somewhere in the middle  Obviously, to the extent that the   housing market deteriorates and home prices don’t go up, there will be more strain on the alt-A   market; but I don’t get a sense that we will see the kind of underwriting problems that we have seen   in the subprime mortgage area  As of this date, we don’t see a lot of evidence of a significant   problem in that area; but, again, we don’t have very good information, and we’ll have to wait and   see    Absolutely    You’re absolutely right  The market was much smaller at that time  I   would characterize the deterioration that you saw in 2001 as probably mostly driven by the   macroeconomy, and the deterioration that you saw in 2006 as driven mostly by two things  more   laxity in the underwriting process and a change in the trajectory of home prices  So I think the   causes of the deterioration in the two cases were quite different  The subprime mortgage market in   2006 is several times the size of the originations in 2001; so obviously it will have a bigger   consequence    The distinction I’d make between fundamentals and risk reduction is that   the latter occurs when people adjust their portfolios not because they change their view about the   quality of a particular asset but because they are reducing the amount of risk exposure to the market   that they want to have  So when you have a big event like February 27, obviously volatility goes   up, and so value at risk goes up, and you may decide to reduce your risk  So you’re going to sell all   sorts of things, and the prices of those things you sell will go down regardless of whether you’ve   actually changed your opinion about them in any meaningful way  Why did corn prices on   February 27 fall 2 percent?  It was probably because corn prices had been in a big bull market,   people had risk positions in corn, and so they wanted to get out of those positions   March 20-21, 2007 9 of 196     You don’t    You don’t know with certainty  You make an inference    Or assets that would do well in a bad economic environment as a hedge to   the rest of your risk    Going out on the curve to ten years, it’s possible  The Eurodollar market is   probably the most liquid market in which one could do this very, very quickly  So I guess I would   view what happened in the longer-dated Treasuries is probably more reflective of emerging   downside risk to the economy, but there’s probably some of the flight to liquidity as well  I think   it’s hard to tell    Well, another explanation is that the economists who make the dealer   forecasts are not the traders who execute the Eurodollar futures positions  So that’s a possible   alternative explanation  Generally, there’s a disequilibrium  A number of people that I’ve talked to   in the markets have said that this is what they thought was going on, and they advised me not to take   what was going on in the Eurodollar futures markets literally because they felt that some of them   were putting on these positions in case of a bad scenario that led to significant reductions in short-  term interest rates  So I’m basically taking the explanation somewhat on the advice of market   participants who told me that they were doing this    When people are in risk-reduction mode, they don’t want to take on more   risk  So there may be an imbalance temporarily between those who want to hedge versus those who   want to take more risk  To take the other side of that bet, they’re basically increasing their risk  The   ABX market is another example of that  Why did the ABX index go to a 2,000 yield spread?  Well,   it was partly because a lot more people wanted to buy protection in the subprime mortgage market   than wanted to sell it  In a perfect economic world, it should be arbitraged away, but I think there   are cases where that just doesn’t necessarily happen    It’s a possible explanation  Vince’s explanation, which I made in fact in   my prepared remarks, is probably one I would put a greater weight on    First, a simple explanation—I don’t know if this is correct—is that, if   home prices are going up and you’re getting 100 percent loan to value, you’re getting basically a   free option to see if the home prices will keep going up  If they don’t go up, you decide, okay,   thank you very much for your loan, and I’m not going to make any payments  So probably some   people are speculating  Certainly, there have been anecdotal reports of investors who were doing   this  Second, there probably has been fraud  I mean, there are examples of people who were   obtaining mortgages for other people, when they weren’t the true beneficiaries of the loan    No    That is a fair point  In fact, that’s why we like to look at sixty-day-plus   delinquencies and try to push people away from looking at thirty days—it takes time for the   payment to find the actual loan holder    It’s hard to know how connected the subprime market and the stock   market have been in the past month or two  Clearly, people are nervous about the positive   feedback loops of less mortgage origination leading to less housing demand leading to lower   home prices leading to a weaker economy—and then that feeding into corporate earnings and   disappointments on the corporate earnings side  I don’t think any of us knows exactly how   powerful those linkages are, but that’s probably at least one element that equity investors are   worried about  "
8120,2007-05-09,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the handout with  the blue on the front  The market turbulence that began in earnest on February 27 is  now a distant memory  Risk appetites have recovered, volatility in the fixed income  and equity markets has declined, and the US equity market has climbed to a new  high  Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 show the correlation matrices for the daily price and yield  movements in the fixed income, equity, and currency markets  The blue-shaded  boxes indicate correlations with an absolute value greater than 05  As shown in  exhibit 1, until February 27, the correlations across most of these asset pairs were  low  However, beginning on February 27 through mid to late March, correlations  rose sharply as risk-reduction efforts dominated financial markets  This shift can be  seen in exhibit 2, where all but one of the boxes are shaded blue  Since the March  FOMC meeting, calm has returned, with asset-price movements again becoming  mostly uncorrelated  The matrix shown in exhibit 3, which shows the correlations  since the March FOMC meeting, looks similar to exhibit 1      As I mentioned in my briefing at the March meeting, although the turmoil in the   markets was related mostly to risk-reduction efforts, in certain areas—the subprime  mortgage market is the best example—the deterioration in performance was related  mostly to fundamental developments  As can be seen in exhibits 4 and 5, which plot  delinquencies and losses for the notorious 2006 subprime vintage, the deterioration in  performance has continued apace  Exhibit 4 shows that delinquencies of more than  sixty days for the 2006 vintage are even higher than those for the 2001 vintage  This  is noteworthy because in 2001 the US economy experienced a mild recession and  payroll employment was declining  Even more noteworthy is the trend of losses for  the 2006 vintage  As shown in exhibit 5, losses for the 2006 vintage are running at  about triple the rate of the 2001 vintage  This poor loss experience appears due both  to deterioration in underwriting standards and to less-favorable underlying  conditions—for example, the softening trend of home prices in many local markets      The fundamental deterioration in the subprime mortgage sector can also be seen   in other measures of performance  For example, exhibit 6 illustrates the behavior of  BBB-rated spreads for the ABX, CDS, and cash markets  The ABX represents an  index of twenty credit default swaps on twenty BBB-rated asset-backed securities,  and the BBB cash index represents the yield spread on the BBB-rated tranches of the  asset-backed securities  Thus, the ABX index references, via the credit default swap  market, the underlying asset-backed securities market  As can be seen in this exhibit,  although all three spreads have recovered somewhat over the past few weeks, spreads                                                     1 Material used by Mr Dudley is appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   May 9, 2007 3 of 130    remain much wider than earlier in the year  Also, note that ABX spreads remain  considerably wider than the CDS and cash spreads that they reference  This situation  underscores the illiquidity of the ABX market and may partially reflect the lack of a  natural constituency of investors who might wish to take the long side of this index,  especially when the subprime market is under stress  The problems in subprime  mortgages have spilled over into the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market  As  you may recall, many CDOs have a substantial proportion of their assets in lower- rated subprime asset-backed security tranches  After widening sharply in late  February, the yield spreads on mezzanine structured-finance CDOs have shown no  recovery  In fact, as shown in exhibit 7, the spreads on these CDOs have continued to  widen     At the last FOMC meeting, I argued that the selloff in the equity market that   began in late February had at least one fundamental component—the reduction in  earnings expectations for 2007  Yet the equity market has recovered quite strongly  I  think that this can be explained by three factors  First, earnings in the first quarter  were stronger than expected  The Board staff estimates that first-quarter earnings for  the S&P 500 will have increased about 9 percent on a year-over-year basis  Second,  perhaps as a result, earnings expectations have stabilized  As shown in exhibit 8, the  median bottom-up equity analyst forecast for S&P 500 earnings growth in 2007 has  stopped falling and remains above 6 percent  Third, buyout and buyback activity  continues unabated  Exhibit 9 shows the flow of funds data on net equity issuance   As can be seen, the outstanding supply of US equities is shrinking rapidly, in  contrast to the increase in net supply that occurred over the 2000-04 period  Buyouts  and buybacks may also be a factor explaining the recent behavior of corporate credit  spreads  As shown in exhibit 10, high-yield and emerging-market debt spreads have  mostly recovered since the late February widening  However, investment-grade debt  spreads remain wider than in early 2007  Investment-grade debt performance may be  lagging because investors fear that the credit quality of this debt will be undermined  as buyouts and buybacks result in increased leverage       Turning now to the currency markets, an emerging story is the weakness of the   US dollar  As shown in exhibit 11, the dollar has fallen about 3 percent against the  euro since the start of the year and is virtually flat against the yen over this period   The weakness against the euro appears to reflect mostly changing interest rate  expectations  Exhibit 12 plots the spread between the June 2008 Eurodollar contract  and the euribor contract  As can be seen in this exhibit, the expected interest rate  differential has fallen about 40 basis points this year  As this has occurred, the euro  has strengthened  To date, the dollar’s weakness has not been of much concern to  market participants  The decline has been gradual, and investors perceive that global  imbalances are unwinding smoothly  Nevertheless, the subprime debacle points to  another source of risk for the dollar  In recent years, the net acquisition of dollar- denominated financial assets by foreign investors has shifted to private flows from  public flows and to corporate bonds, including asset-backed securities and CDO  obligations, from Treasury and agency debt  This shift is shown in exhibit 13  My  worry here is that the problems in the subprime and alt-A mortgage market could   May 9, 2007 4 of 130    ultimately affect foreign investors’ appetites for US asset-backed securities and  CDOs  For example, a particularly poor performance of lower-rated ABS and CDO  tranches, coupled with the widespread corporate rating downgrades that might be  associated with such poor performance, could cause foreign investors to lose  confidence in investing in dollar-denominated debt        In terms of US interest rate expectations, investors expect no near-term change   in policy  However, market participants continue to expect significant easing late this  year and in 2008  Interest rate expectations for the remainder of 2007 are back where  they were at the time of the January FOMC meeting  Looking at the federal funds  rate futures market in exhibit 14, we can see that only about one 25 basis point rate  cut is expected in 2007  In contrast, expectations for 2008 more closely resemble  expectations at the time of the December and March FOMC meetings, not the January  meeting  As can be seen in exhibit 15, which plots Eurodollar futures contract yields,  investors expect substantial monetary policy easing in 2008  Why this delayed  pattern of easing?  There are three potential explanations  First, as I have noted  before, futures market yields reflect the mean, not the modal, forecast  To the extent  that investors perceive a moderate risk of significant economic weakness that could  lead to pronounced monetary policy easing, then the yields in the futures market  could be well below the modal forecasts of investors  Second, some investors may  disagree with the FOMC about the outlook  In this case, they might anticipate that it  will take time for the FOMC to come around to their way of thinking—leading to rate  cuts that occur only later  Third, some investors may anticipate that inflation will  moderate  As this happens, the FOMC might gradually reduce its nominal federal  funds rate target following lower inflation—essentially keeping the real federal funds  rate constant       Finally, the survey of the primary dealers shows little change in interest rate   expectations since the last FOMC meeting  Exhibits 16 and 17 compare dealer  expectations with market expectations before the March FOMC meeting and before  this meeting  The horizontal bold lines represent market expectations  The blue  circles represent the different dealer forecasts, and the size of a circle represents how  many dealers have that forecast  The green circles represent the average dealer  forecast for each period  The average of the primary dealer forecasts is consistent  with only slightly more than 25 basis points of easing through the end of this year— not much different from what is priced into the federal funds futures market  As can  be seen, the dispersion of the dealer forecasts over the next few quarters has narrowed  a bit  However, considerable disagreement remains about whether short-term rates  will be higher or lower a year ahead  Also, the average of the dealer forecasts for  2008 remains considerably above market expectations  This presumably reflects  mainly the “downside risks” notion, which should cause the modal forecasts of  dealers to be higher than the mean expectations represented by futures prices  I’ll be  happy to take any questions         May 9, 2007 5 of 130    I will need approval for domestic operations; there were no foreign operations   Also, I circulated a memo asking you to vote to approve renewal of the swap lines to  Canada and Mexico       There is definitely some spillover into alt-A, but alt-A delinquencies and   losses are a fraction of subprime  If you compare the characteristics of alt-A loans with those of   subprime loans, you’ll see the same easing of underwriting standards in the alt-A market that   occurred in the subprime market and almost identical characteristics of the underwriting   standards except for one difference—the FICO score  The FICO score for alt-A is much higher    Apparently, the FICO score is pretty important because the losses for alt-A are a fraction of those   on subprimes  But there are data that show some spillover    I’m sure there is a disparity between the two  I do not know of any way   to break that out clearly  One factor—the weakness of the dollar versus the euro—is definitely   helping to boost corporate earnings  A disproportionate share of US foreign activity is Europe-  oriented, so it’s a bigger share than would be suggested by the European share of global GDP    That factor is definitely helping to support our earnings  I have never seen any data on that    We’ll look into it to see if there’s anything, but I’m not hopeful    Don, you could take “on balance” as acknowledging last month’s data, and   if you take “on balance” out, you’re not acknowledging last month’s data as much  "
8141,2007-06-27,"1  It is hard to follow that  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Today, I  want to focus on the significant rise in long-dated Treasury yields that has occurred  since the last FOMC meeting  As you can see in exhibit 1, Treasury yields have  moved sharply higher over the past six weeks, although they have recovered a bit in  the past few days  At two-year and longer maturities, the shift in the yield curve has  been nearly parallel, with yields roughly 50 basis points higher over this period  As  can be seen in exhibit 2, the rise in nominal ten-year Treasury yields has been  accompanied by a rise in ten-year TIPS yields  Because the rise in nominal yields has  been slightly larger than the rise in real yields, forward breakeven inflation rates have  risen a bit since the last FOMC meeting  For example, exhibit 3 shows the trajectory  of the breakeven inflation rate five to ten years in the future estimated using nominal  Treasury and TIPS yields  This measure has risen more than 20 basis points from its  trough in May  So how does one explain the rise in nominal and real Treasury yields  and the increase in breakeven inflation?  In my opinion, there is one very compelling  explanation—market participants generally believe that the downside risks to growth  have diminished, and this has led to (1) a sharp shift in monetary policy expectations  and (2) a modest change in investors’ assessment of inflation risk  But other factors                                                     1 Material used by Mr Dudley is appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   June 27-28, 2007 3 of 261    also played a role, including mortgage convexity hedging and, perhaps, the gradual  shift in the appetite of foreign central banks away from US Treasury securities  toward other assets           As shown in exhibit 4, monetary policy expectations as embodied in the   Eurodollar futures market have shifted sharply since the last FOMC meeting  In  May, a drop of more than 50 basis points in Eurodollar rates was anticipated to occur  by the end of 2008  In contrast, currently the Eurodollar futures strip is virtually  flat—indicating that market expectations are close to neutral through 2008  This shift  in expectations is also evident in responses to our survey of primary dealers  Using  exhibits 5 and 6, we can compare the dealers’ forecasts before the May 9 meeting  with their forecasts before our meeting today  The green circles represent the average  forecast of the dealers; the size of the blue circles indicates the frequency of different  forecasts; and the horizontal dark lines represent market rates  As can be seen in  these exhibits, over the intermeeting period the dealer forecasts have moved upward,  but much less than market expectations  This presumably reflects the fact that the  market rate represents the mean of potential outcomes whereas the dealer forecasts  are modal forecasts  Also, the smaller shift evident in the dealer forecasts may reflect  the fact that dealer forecasts tend to lag changes in market expectations when  expectations are changing rapidly  As can be seen in these two exhibits, much of the  dispersion evident in the forecasts toward lower rates has vanished since the May 9  FOMC meeting, and the skew to the downside has disappeared  Dealers who had  forecasted a flat or higher federal funds rate path generally did not alter their  forecasts  In contrast, dealers who had earlier anticipated easing have eliminated or  dramatically scaled back those expectations  For example, the blue circles evident in  exhibit 5 at rates of 35 percent and 40 percent are not present in exhibit 6         The dealer forecasts support the notion that expectations are changing mainly   because market participants are less worried about downside risks to growth rather  than because they think that the growth rate of real GDP will likely be stronger  With  the exception of the current quarter, in which GDP forecasts have been revised  upward sharply following a very weak first quarter, the real GDP forecasts of dealers  have generally not changed materially through 2008  This is illustrated in exhibit 7   Instead, as shown in exhibit 8, dealers are now, collectively, more certain about the  growth outlook—in other words, the downside risks to growth have diminished  The  reduction in the downside risks to growth may also be important in explaining the  modest rise in breakeven inflation measures  If the downside risks to growth have  diminished, then a corollary may be that the upside risks to inflation have increased   In that case, investors should show more interest in purchasing inflation protection   The breakeven inflation measure calculated from nominal Treasury and TIPS yields  has several components, including expected inflation and the premium paid by  investors for inflation protection  In assessing the rise in these breakeven inflation  measures due to diminished downside risks to growth, it is unclear how to apportion  the rise in the overall breakeven inflation measures between a higher premium for  inflation protection and higher expected inflation  In theory at least, reduced   June 27-28, 2007 4 of 261    downside risks to growth might reasonably be expected to push both components a  bit higher      Three other factors behind the backup in Treasury yields bear mentioning  First,   the shift in monetary policy expectations and the rise in longer-dated yields have been  a global phenomenon  When yields are rising elsewhere, that shift should put some  upward pressure on US long-term rates  Second, mortgage-related convexity  hedging may have exacerbated the speed and magnitude of the rise in yields  A rise  in yields causes expected rates of prepayment on lower-coupon fixed-rate mortgages  to fall, which lengthens the average duration of mortgage portfolios  Mortgage  servicers, the housing-related GSEs, and other mortgage holders respond by selling  long-dated Treasury securities and long-dated interest rate swaps to reduce the  average duration of their holdings  Exhibit 9 shows that most conventional fixed-rate  mortgages are below current mortgage rates  As rates rise, these mortgages get  further “out of the money”  This lowers expected prepayment rates and lengthens  duration, and people react by hedging  As long-term rates keep rising, the effect of  higher interest rates on duration gradually lessens as the rates on most outstanding  mortgages fall further below current market rates  The effect of mortgage convexity  hedging is evident in the relative underperformance of ten-year Treasuries, which is  one of the preferred hedging vehicles versus mortgages, relative to other Treasury  maturities  The week ending on June 13 had the biggest rise in longer-term Treasury  yields  As shown in exhibit 10, this was also the week in which ten-year Treasury  yields rose the most compared with five-year and thirty-year Treasury rates  To the  extent that mortgage convexity hedging pushes up nominal ten-year Treasury yields  more than other yields, then it may also temporarily distort breakeven inflation  measures  Third, diminished appetite among central banks for Treasury securities  may have also been a factor behind the rise in longer-dated yields  Central bank  buying was often a featured part of the story when bond term premiums were  unusually narrow  Foreign central banks may have played a role in the recent rise in  bond term premiums  As shown in exhibit 11, the growth rate of Treasury custody  holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has slowed sharply since April   But it is important not to push this point too strongly  Although foreign central banks  with the largest foreign exchange reserve holdings are diversifying their portfolios  away from Treasuries, they still appear to be extending the average maturity of those  Treasuries that they hold, which implies a continued bid for longer-dated Treasuries  from this source            Turning now to other market developments, the most striking aspect of this period   of rising Treasury yields has been the limited effect that this rise has had on the risk  appetite of investors in most other markets  This is in sharp contrast to the reduction  in risk appetites that occurred in a broad array of asset classes in late February and the  first half of March  For example, as shown in exhibit 12, the rise in long-term yields  has not caused the US equity market to retrench  As shown in exhibit 13, until the  past week or so, corporate debt spreads have been relatively stable  Also, in the  foreign exchange markets, the carry trade remains alive and well  One way to see this  is in exhibit 14, which illustrates the change in the value of the yen against high-  June 27-28, 2007 5 of 261    yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar as well as  against the US dollar and the euro  As can be seen, in the late February selloff, the  yen rallied, and the high-yielding currencies sold off sharply  In contrast, during the  recent rise in interest rates, the yen weakened and the high-yielding currencies  appreciated  Similarly, as illustrated in exhibit 15, although volatility in the US  Treasury market moved up sharply (shown by the rise in the MOVE index), volatility  in the equity and foreign exchange markets remained quite low       In the foreign exchange markets, movements between the major currencies   continue to be driven mainly by changes in expected interest rate differentials   Exhibit 16 shows the movement in the spreads between the September 2008  Eurodollar futures yield versus Euribor futures for Europe and Euroyen futures for  Japan  As can be seen here, interest rate expectations shifted more sharply upward in  the United States relative to Japan than relative to Europe  Not surprisingly, as shown  in exhibit 17, the dollar appreciated more sharply against the yen than against the  euro over this period  The yen’s weakness, which has been persistent but stealthy,  may begin to receive more attention  After all, as shown in exhibit 18, while the  nominal yen/dollar exchange rate has fluctuated in a relatively narrow range in recent  years, the real effective yen exchange rate has declined sharply over this period—a  rate of decline that may be intensifying  For example, in May the real effective  exchange rate of the yen—as estimated by the BIS—had fallen to its lowest point  since the early 1980s and had declined nearly to half of its early 1995 peak  Although  the June BIS data are not yet available, the rate of depreciation has likely increased  over the past month     Although calm generally pervades US financial markets, there is one important   exception worthy of note  The subprime mortgage space is still very unsettled—hurt  both by poor housing market fundamentals and by the problems of two hedge funds  sponsored by Bear Stearns  Exhibit 19 shows the behavior of the spread on the ABX  06-2 index, which is an index based on a basket of credit default swaps on underlying  cash securities  As can be seen, the spread has increased to a new high, and  underlying CDS spreads have also increased  There is a danger that forced  liquidation of illiquid subprime-based securities could exacerbate the pressure on this  market  However, it should be noted that the Bear Stearns-sponsored hedge funds  that are in trouble are not particular large; the problems of these hedge funds appear  to be mostly exceptional rather than the norm; and the counterparty exposures  generated by these hedge funds are broadly distributed and have already shrunk  sharply in size  That said, there still are risks that forced selling could drive market  prices down sharply, leading to lower marks for other portfolios of assets related to  subprime mortgages  This, in turn, could lead to margin calls, investor redemptions,  and further selling pressure in this market        In terms of lessons learned, three points come to mind  First, high credit ratings   don’t fully capture measures of risk  The ratings are based on the risk of default, not  the market risks associated with illiquidity  As a result, highly leveraged portfolios of  highly rated but illiquid assets are subject to significant market risk that the ratings   June 27-28, 2007 6 of 261    may obscure  Second, the performance of some of these complex securities is very  sensitive to the correlation of returns  As correlations move higher, the subordination  protection offered to senior tranches in complex securities such as CDOs, and CDO- squared products—CDOs of CDOs—can evaporate quickly  Because the ratings for  the tranches within such products are typically established on the basis of historical  correlations, the default risk for some of these tranches may be understated  Third,  marked-to-model asset valuation may artificially smooth returns and obscure risk— both to portfolio managers and to investors       The health of the broader CDO and CLO (collateralized loan obligation) markets   may rest on this same fragile set of assumptions—that credit ratings fairly capture  risk and that historical correlation relationships will continue to apply  This implies  the potential for problems  If investors questioned these assumptions in the subprime  area, they could also rethink their assumptions about these risks in the broader  markets  Such a development might lead to considerably less buoyant conditions in  the corporate debt and loan markets  It could be noteworthy that some of the indexes  that reference credit default swaps in the corporate debt and loan markets have shown  some deterioration in the past week        Finally, there were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote to   ratify the operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the May  FOMC meeting  Of course, I am very happy to take questions      Well, I think there is an issue  You have to wait for the market to   settle down  To the extent that you are taking a snapshot at a time that more convexity   hedging is influencing the ten-year and the five-year has not caught up, that can be a   phenomenon  Also, people in the marketplace say that people in the nominal Treasury   markets are different from the people who invest in TIPS, and so the behavior of the two can   diverge for short periods  I would be more confident if a month from now we saw the same   June 27-28, 2007 7 of 261    uptick in five to ten years of forward inflation as we do today  I am not convinced it will   necessarily persist  It may be that real yields and nominal yields will eventually equilibrate   as these two markets come back into balance  So my own view would be that it bears   watching, but I wouldn’t reach strong conclusions about it at this stage      Well, I think there’s a difference in terms of people’s assessment of   how much risk Bear Stearns is actually taking on in terms of their hedge fund  My   understanding is that they are extending credit, and they are basically taking out the credit   that was extended by the counterparties for the less highly leveraged of the two funds  They   still have equity  They are hoping that they still have equity—that the assets of the hedge   fund are essentially going to exceed the value of the loan that they are making  So they’re   feeling that, if all goes well, they are not going to be out any money  My memory of Long-  June 27-28, 2007 8 of 261    Term Capital Management, and somebody can correct me if I’m wrong, is that the people   who came into that pool were putting up equity  So it is quite different in terms of what was   actually being contributed in these two cases  Bear Stearns is just replacing the counterparty   borrowings with its own line of credit      I think there is a presumption in the Long-Term Capital   Management case that a lot of people had similar positions in place  In the Bear Stearns   case, we certainly don’t have all the information at this point, but the general thought at this   time is that there are not a lot of other people with the same positions in place    I think that people are taking this in stride  The first quarter is   old news   June 27-28, 2007 99 of 261   "
8167,2007-08-07,"1  Thank you  As you all know, there has been considerable  financial market turbulence since the last meeting  Problems in subprime mortgage  credit have persisted and intensified; credit-rating agencies have begun to downgrade  asset-backed securities and CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) that reference  subprime debt; the problems in subprime have spread into the alt-A mortgage space  and into parts of the prime mortgage market; corporate credit has been infected, with  high-yield bond and loan spreads moving out sharply; and stock prices have faltered   Although markets generally have been functioning well in terms of liquidity and the  ability to transact, there have been some important exceptions  The nonconforming  residential mortgage market and the structured-finance product markets—especially  the CDO and CLO (collateralized loan obligation) markets—have been significantly  impaired, and there are concerns about the ability of some asset-backed commercial  paper programs to continue to source funding via that market  As a consequence,  market expectations with respect to monetary policy have shifted sharply, with  market expectations consistent with considerable monetary policy easing over the  next year  Market participants are worried about the effect of tightening credit  standards on housing and about the deterioration in the market function in structured  finance, which could broaden and be self-reinforcing, ultimately damaging the  macroeconomy       I am going to be referring to this handout as we go through these comments  In   tracing the source of the turmoil that we have experienced recently, we find that the  deterioration of the subprime mortgage sector continues to play an important role in  several ways  First, the deterioration in underlying credit quality continues unabated   As shown in exhibit 1, delinquencies of more than sixty days for recent ABX index  vintages have continued to move higher, and the pace of deterioration—measured by  the steepness of the curves—has, if anything, worsened  Note that the newest  vintage—07-2, so the second half of 2007—does not show any benefit from  improved underwriting standards  That stems mainly from the fact that the pipeline  to build these securities is relatively long—with the average loan referenced by this  index more than six months old at this point  It also may reflect the fact that this  newest vintage gets—in contrast to earlier vintages—less benefit from earlier home- price appreciation  As a consequence of this poor credit performance, ABX spreads  have continued to widen sharply  This is shown in exhibit 2, which shows the  performance for ABX BBB- tranches across vintages, and exhibit 3, which shows the  performance for the various tranches of the 07-1 vintage  The deterioration in the                                                     1 Materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   August 7, 2007 6 of 136    higher-rated tranches has been much more severe than earlier in the year  In part, this  greater deterioration reflects the fact that loss estimates have been trending higher,  putting the higher-rated tranches more in harm’s way  It also reflects efforts to hedge  subprime risk by going short these indexes by people who can’t liquidate securities  easily  Translating these ABX spreads back into price, July was a very rough month  for ABX  Price declines of 20 points or more occurred in the ABX BBB- tranches of  some more-recent vintages  Second, the disturbing delinquency trajectories shown in  exhibit 1 have caused the rating agencies to downgrade a significant number of  residential asset-backed securities and CDOs that have exposure to the subprime  sector  However, most of the downgrades apply to vintages before 06-2  For more- recent vintages, the loss experience is worse but still hard to estimate  This means  that many more downgrades lie ahead  Third, some of the credit-rating agencies have  made changes to their structured-finance rating models  That, combined with huge  marked-to-market losses even in highly rated subprime tranches, has led to a  fundamental reevaluation of what a credit rating means and how much comfort an  investor should take from a high credit rating on an opaque structured-finance CDO  or CLO product     The problems in subprime have spread into other mortgage markets, including   alt-A, certain types of prime residential mortgage products, and commercial  mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)  Countrywide, for example, announced a  deterioration in its second-lien prime mortgage book  Meanwhile, American Home  Mortgage, which had operated primarily in the alt-A and nontraditional prime  mortgage space as both a large monoline mortgage issuer and a REIT investor, was  forced to shut down its operations last week and filed for bankruptcy yesterday   Market liquidity for nonconforming residential mortgage products is poor, and this  has contributed to a further tightening in underwriting standards  For example, a  number of mortgage originators indicated that they will no longer offer 2/28 and 3/27  adjustable-rate mortgage products, and some have indicated that they will not buy any  alt-A mortgages originated by brokers  At the same time that we have seen turmoil in  the subprime market, it has spread into the corporate sector as well  Credit spreads in  the corporate sector have also widened sharply  For example, in July, high-yield  corporate bond spreads widened about 150 basis points (see exhibit 4)  Similarly, the  spreads on key hedging indexes that reference credit default swaps on corporates have  also gone up sharply  For example, in July the spreads on three of these major  indexes rose nearly 200 basis points  This is illustrated in exhibit 5  The ITRAXX  crossover index references fifty European nonfinancial names with ratings below  BBB- or at BBB- and on negative watch  The high-yield CDX index references  credit default swaps on 100 high-yield US names  The LCDX index references  credit default swaps on 100 US leveraged loans       In contrast to the residential mortgage sector, corporate credit fundamentals still   look good  In particular, as shown in exhibit 6, corporate default rates for both  investment-grade and below-investment-grade borrowers have been at very low  levels  Of course, as we saw in the subprime market, readily available credit can  depress default ratios  One should expect that the tightening of credit standards in the   August 7, 2007 7 of 136    corporate sector would generate some rise in default rates independent of other  developments  Nevertheless, other measures also underscore the positive  fundamentals of the corporate sector—in contrast to the poor fundamentals in  residential mortgages  For example, global growth has been unusually strong with  little volatility, and corporate profit margins are unusually wide, both in the United  States and elsewhere  Moreover, the slowdown in profit growth expected for the  United States has been milder than anticipated  This can be seen in the rise in the  median equity analysts’ bottom-up earnings forecasts for the S&P 500 companies for  2007, which is shown in exhibit 7  It was falling through about April  Since then,  expectations for this year have actually increased, and they have been increasing  recently, even over the past month     So how does one explain the contagion to corporate credit from the subprime   market given the disparity in fundamentals between these two sectors?  Although the  answer is complex, one factor stands out  There has been a loss of confidence among  investors in their ability to assess the value of and risks associated with structured  products, which has led to a sharp drop in demand for such products  The loss of  confidence stems from many sources, including the opacity of such products; the  infrequency of trades, which makes it more difficult to judge appropriate valuation;  the difficulty in forecasting losses and the correlation of losses in the underlying  collateral; the sensitivity of returns to the loss rate and the degree of correlation; and  the problem that the credit rating focuses mainly on one risk—that of loss from  default         The CLO and CDO markets have facilitated the transformation of low-rated   paper—for which there is a limited investor appetite—into a high proportion of high- grade-rated debt  For example, in a typical CLO structure, the underlying loan  quality averages a rating of about B  Yet through the magic of structured finance and  the corporate rating agencies, the resulting CLO tranches are rated predominately  investment grade  Exhibit 8 shows the structure for a representative CLO  More than  two-thirds is AAA-rated debt, and 87 percent is investment grade  The loss of  confidence among investors in the ability to assess the value and risks associated with  this structured product has led to a sharp drop in CDO and CLO issuance  As shown  in exhibit 9, CLO and CDO issuance plummeted in July  This is very important  because the CLO and CDO markets represent the bulk of the demand for non- investment-grade debt  With this demand falling away at a time when the forward  supply of high-yield corporate loans and debt exceeds $300 billion by some  measures, a huge mismatch between demand and supply has developed  The  underlying problem is that the depth of the market for non-investment-grade rated  loans and debt—excluding CDO and CLO demand—is far shallower than the market  for investment-grade products       Where do we go from here?   Presumably buyers and sellers in the corporate   sector are in the process of finding appropriate market-clearing prices  But it may  take time for the market to settle down, especially given the August doldrums that are  upon us  Moreover, we still may have further scope for market dislocations  After   August 7, 2007 8 of 136    all, some single-strategy hedge funds that emphasize corporate credit may have been  caught out by the sharp widening in spreads that has occurred over the past few  weeks  When such results become known, investor redemptions could follow— leading to forced selling to generate the cash to fund these redemptions  In addition,  the asset-backed commercial paper market is very skittish in two areas—structured  investment vehicles and extendable commercial paper programs  Yesterday at least  two commercial paper programs were subject to extension  It is not clear whether or  to what degree these extensions will further unsettle the commercial paper market,  but that is clearly a risk       The effective shutdown of the CDO and CLO markets has, in turn, raised   questions about the sustainability of the strong bid by private equity firms to conduct  leveraged buyouts  This uncertainty has undoubtedly been a factor behind the recent  weakness of the US stock market  The importance of the buyout bid can be seen in  the relative underperformance of the Russell 2000 index compared with the S&P 500  index during the past few weeks (see exhibit 10)  The problems in corporate credit  and the virtual shutdown of the CLO and CDO distribution mechanism have caused  investors to reevaluate both the business opportunities and the risks associated with  large investment and commercial banks  Investment bank and commercial bank  shares have underperformed the broader stock market indexes  In addition, as shown  in exhibit 11, the CDS spreads for the major investment and commercial banks have  widened considerably over the past month  The CDS spreads for financial guarantors  have widened as well, even though the exposures of these firms appear to be  concentrated in the most senior portions of the subprime and structured-finance debt  structures  Perception of the strength of the financial guarantors could prove  important given the key role that they play in some markets, such as the municipal  debt sector, that lie far afield from either the subprime mortgage market or the  corporate debt markets       Only in the past few weeks have the problems in the subprime and corporate debt   markets led to broader risk-reduction activities  These risk-reduction efforts are  similar to the adjustments that we saw in late February and early March  A matrix  that shows the correlation of returns across different asset classes over the past few  weeks (see exhibit 12) looks very similar to the correlation matrix that we saw  following the late February risk-reduction period (see exhibit 13)  It looks very  different from the very calm period we had from late March through the first part of  July, which is shown in exhibit 14  But the adjustments are not uniform across  markets  In some ways, the risk reduction that we are seeing this time is a little more  US specific, a little more corporate credit specific, and a little more mortgage  specific  For example, as shown in exhibit 15, implied volatility in interest rate  swaps—the SMOVE index—and in equities—the VIX index—has climbed well  above the late February peak  In contrast, the foreign exchange markets have  experienced a less-pronounced rise in volatility         In the United States, the turmoil in financial markets has been accompanied by a   shift in monetary policy expectations  Exhibit 16 illustrates the Eurodollar futures   August 7, 2007 9 of 136    strip  As can be seen, the futures curve has shifted down about 40 basis points since  the last FOMC meeting  We are back where we were before the May FOMC  meeting  Currently, market prices imply a bit more than 50 basis points of easing by  year-end 2008  The shift in expectations appears to reflect, in part, a revival of the  “downside risks to growth” idea rather than that the Federal Reserve will absolutely  cut interest rates  This can be seen in several ways  The shift in market expectations  implicit in Eurodollar futures yields has not been accompanied by a substantial  change in dealer forecasts  As shown in exhibits 17 and 18, which show the federal  funds rate projections of the primary dealers before the June and the current FOMC  meetings, the average dealer forecast and the range of dealer forecasts have not  changed much over the past six weeks  Instead, a gap has opened up between the  average dealer forecasts, represented in the exhibits by the green circles, and the  forecasts implicit in market yields, represented by the horizontal black lines  The  most recent dealer survey does not capture the minor forecast changes that occurred  late last week  For example, two dealers with tightening forecasts pushed back the  timing of the first tightening, and one dealer with an easing forecast moved it closer  and increased the magnitude (not shown in exhibits 17 or 18)  The dealers’ forecasts  are modal forecasts  In contrast, the expectation embodied in market yields  represents the mean of the distribution of expected outcomes  Presumably, it includes  some possibility that the current market turbulence could lead to a weaker growth  outcome and a reduction in the FOMC’s federal funds rate target  Options on  Eurodollar futures contracts 300 days forward show a sharp downward skew in the  distribution of rates (see exhibit 19)  Although the mode is at 525 percent, the same  as it was before the June meeting, the probability distribution has shifted down  drastically below that 525 percent mode  So it may not be correct to say that market  participants now expect much more monetary policy easing  Instead, a more proper  characterization might be that the perceptions of downside risks have reemerged, and  this characterization is reflected in the downward skew below what is still a  525 percent modal forecast for the Eurodollar rate       There were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote to ratify the   operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the June FOMC  meeting  Of course, I am very happy to take questions        Let me take the second question first  You know, it’s certainly possible   that, when people want to hedge their risk in areas where they can’t easily sell the assets, they   would buy something that will perform well if those assets continue to deteriorate  One thing to   do would be to buy Eurodollar futures or Treasury securities  So, at least temporarily, those   yields may not fully reflect what the market expectations are  That said, the Eurodollar market is   a very deep market, and if one thought that the Fed was not going to do what the market priced   in, there certainly would be the ability of people to take the other side of the bet  So it’s sort of   hard to know exactly how big or long-lasting the effects that you are talking about could actually   be  In the short run, that kind of thing certainly goes on  If I can’t sell the bad asset that I hold,   then I will buy something that will perform well if the bad asset deteriorates  People actually do   talk about that on the trading side   As far as the issue of material nonpublic information that shows worse problems than are   in the newspapers, I’m not sure exactly how to characterize that because I guess I wouldn’t know   how to characterize how bad the newspapers think these problems are  [Laughter]  We’ve done   August 7, 2007 11 of 136    quite a bit of work trying to identify some of the funding questions surrounding Bear Stearns,   Countrywide, and some of the commercial paper programs  There is some strain, but so far it   looks as though nothing is really imminent in those areas  Now, could that change quickly?    Absolutely  For example, one question that we’re following with Bear Stearns is what their   clients do in terms of continuing to want to do business with them  Obviously, if people start to   pull back in their willingness to do business with Bear Stearns, the franchise value of the   company goes down, and that exacerbates the problem  One thing that we have heard about Bear   Stearns is that they have approached a number of major commercial banks about a secured line   of credit  We don’t know what the outcome will be, but they are clearly trying to get even better   liquidity backstops than those they have in place today  But as far as we know, they have   enough liquidity—and Countrywide as well at this moment    Where the securities are held abroad is also very important  If they are   held in a hedge fund that is highly leveraged, that is one thing  If they are held in a central bank   reserve account, that is a small loss against all their other assets, so it wouldn’t have any   consequence  So if you talk to the dealers, they’ll say, “Well, we know whom we sold the things   to initially, but we don’t know what happens after that”  I would expect, though, that most of the   stuff probably resides with the initial person because, as we have seen, these instruments are not   particularly liquid and so I don’t think that they pass on that far  If you did a survey of the   dealers, you might be able to make some headway in terms of figuring out whom they sold them   to originally  It might be a fair approximation of where they reside today    I guess I would characterize the situation as people having lost faith in   the structured-finance product, especially the high-grade AA/AAA product that they thought was   safe and therefore not subject to much market risk or liquidity risk  They found out otherwise,   and so there is a total reevaluation of that market  As a consequence, since the vehicle that was   used to turn non-investment-grade corporate debt and into investment-grade debt is sort of   broken, now they have to sell a lot of non-investment-grade debt directly and find people who   are willing to hold it  So I think about the situation as that demand has lessened at a time when   August 7, 2007 14 of 136    supply, just by bad luck and timing, is exploding  The market should clear, because the   fundamentals in the corporate sector are good as opposed to bad, but at a much higher price    They certainly could  Their problem is that they have a very large   mortgage finance subsidiary and a small thrift  If the mortgage finance subsidiary were in the thrift,   then there would be other ways of financing all their assets  So far they are able to maintain their   liquidity  But a lot of this is about perception, and that could change at any time  The good news   about Countrywide is that people view them as having a strong franchise  They also have a very   large loan-servicing portfolio, which might actually be worth a bit more because the duration of   those mortgages is extending  They are not just a mortgage originator whose business has   evaporated; they also have other parts of their business, which I think people view as potentially   quite valuable    Two areas of the asset-backed commercial paper market are being closely   scrutinized, which means that a whole bunch of the asset-backed commercial paper market is fine,   such as the asset-backed commercial paper with backstops—you know, credit card receivables    That area is fine; it is not a problem  One difficult area is the extendable commercial paper   programs that are funding some of the stuff that is very illiquid right now  The risk is that investors,   typically money market mutual funds, will look at the situation and say, “Gee, if they can’t roll over   commercial paper, my commercial paper investment will automatically be extended to a longer   maturity”  They are worried about the headline risk of that  They are also worried—and it is hard   to know how worried—that there is no guarantee that the extended commercial paper would   necessarily trade at par  If it traded below par, then they would have to worry about breaking the   buck, which is the last thing they want to do  So the risk is that the investors, who are quite risk   averse in the commercial paper market in this area, will pull back and that very pulling back will   cause extension  That is what was happening yesterday  Apparently a couple of commercial paper   programs were extended  Now, does extension mean anything really necessarily bad?  It is not   clear  It hasn’t happened before, and so we really haven’t experienced how this extension process is   going to work  These programs are backstops in various forms  At the end of the day, the   commercial paper holders should come out whole; but until that is demonstrated, you can imagine   that the extensions could cause other people to pull back  So there is a risk of a cascading of   extensions that has crossed all of these extendable commercial paper products  That is a risk  You   August 7, 2007 16 of 136    know, it is an interesting tension right now because the large investors know that, if they don’t roll,   they’ll probably be extended  So at the current time, most of them are continuing to roll so that they   don’t get stuck with extended commercial paper  But this situation is very fragile day to day   The second area is more complex—structured investment finance vehicles that basically   fund pipelines of highly rated CDO and CLO kind of stuff  I can’t say I fully appreciate exactly   how this structure works, but basically there is some risk that the collateral values of these structures   could fall below certain thresholds  In that case, the securities would have to be liquidated  Again,   commercial paper investors are saying, “Do I really want to see what this means?”  So they are   pulling back from that market as well  Of the two, the extendable commercial paper issue seems to   be the more immediate one in the market’s attention, but the SIV asset-backed commercial paper is   also an ongoing issue    I think it is a bigger shift  I think if the first is one unit, the second is   maybe two units in terms of how far you go   "
8190,2007-08-10,"  I am  Foreign central banks around the world added reserves  aggressively overnight  The Bank of Japan, for example, added ¥1 trillion, about  $84 billion  Their Euroyen rates were trading a little above the target before their  addition and below the target afterward  So the action was effective  The ECB today  did a variable-rate tender, a little different from what they did yesterday  Yesterday they  took all comers at 4 percent  In today’s variable-rate tender, they did not accept all the  bids  They accepted €61 billion in bids  That’s down from the €948 billion they  accepted yesterday  The average rate was 408 percent compared with their 4 percent  target     Coming into New York time this morning, the federal funds rate was under upward   pressure—6 percent or so for foreign names and 575 percent for domestics  We did a  $19 billion three-day RP (repurchase) this morning, a single tranche RP with a  515 percent effective rate  There were $31 billion in propositions, and we accepted  $19 billion  After that action, the funds rate has come off a bit  Foreign names are now  55 to 563  Domestics are 525 to 55  We expect the funds rate to come off through  the day  But if it doesn’t, we’re prepared to engage in additional transactions later in the  day  Yesterday we were a bit surprised that, despite a $24 billion add through a term RP  and an overnight, the effective funds rate was 541 percent—so, firmer than the target— although it did go out on the softer side at the end of the day at 475 to 5 percent     In terms of the markets, there are two broad sets of issues  One, there are concerns   about funding issues for two large US financial entities  Washington Mutual and  Countrywide have both made statements in their 10(q) filings that unnerved the market a  little, Washington Mutual saying that they’re having some trouble in terms of liquidity  and Countrywide saying that there are unprecedented disruptions in the credit market   Both of those companies have been singled out a bit this morning  In addition, there’s a  tremendous amount of focus on the commercial paper market  The European  commercial paper market is not doing well at all, and that’s really one reason that you’re  seeing the European banks scramble for funding     I talked to a dealer this morning in the US commercial paper market  I guess the   way I would characterize the situation is that the US commercial paper market is  continuing to function but at a very tough level of functionality  People are shortening  up  They are starting to take names off their lists of programs they’ll invest with  The  asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market is the area of greatest stress  The  traditional programs, such as funding credit-card receivables, are still doing okay, but  the extendable ABCP programs are under pressure  Also, apparently some investment  bank programs are seeing some stress for their own names  There’s a lot of shortening  of maturity  A lot of people are doing things that are either just overnight or out to a  week  So you’re seeing that the funding in the US commercial paper market is  shortening, and therefore every day more and more commercial paper that has to be   August 10, 2007 3 of 12    rolled over is coming due  But I would say that, at this point, the US commercial paper  market is still functioning, and that’s where we are right now      What was the second question, Jeff?    As far as what we get in terms of propositions today, we’re assuming that   it will be mostly mortgage-related RPs since we did a single tranche and did not distinguish among   different types of collateral  But I don’t have the answer to that question in terms of what the   composition of today’s $19 billion RP was; we are presuming that it will be mostly mortgage   related  As far as how late in the day, we can go fairly late  Obviously the effectiveness diminishes   considerably if we go later in the day, and I think it is more symbolic  Our feeling is that the $19   billion we added today should be more than enough, and so we would expect the fed funds rate to   come off  The reason the Desk statement said that we would come back if necessary was that we   August 10, 2007 4 of 12    wanted to reassure people that this wasn’t their only chance to get reserves if things were to   deteriorate as we go through the day  So I think we’ll take a look at where things are at   midmorning  If the fed funds rate is still trading firm to the 5¼ target, I think we would come in   fairly early—midmorning    This is Bill Dudley  I’m not aware of any news on that front  I think   Washington Mutual will be the one on which you would be most focused, given what they said   overnight in terms of their filing  Obviously, they are focused on mortgage-related products, so I   think they would probably be having the most difficulty today  I’m not aware of any other places   with problems    Our understanding, Governor Mishkin, is that they’re using them   essentially to fund some of the commercial paper in Europe that’s running off  Also, I think some   of the funds are just extra liquidity, precautionary balances for reserves  We received a comment   overnight that suggested that there was a potentially fairly significant misallocation of reserves   within Europe as people were hoarding their liquidity  So some of the funds are probably being   used to replace commercial paper, but some of them are probably just being held as precautionary   balances    I don’t know the answer to that    Well, if we are successful, we should expect that the fed funds rate could   soften significantly, but there’s no way that we can stabilize it at 5¼, if that’s your question  One   consequence of being aggressive and adding reserves is that, if we’re successful, late in the day the   funds rate could be trading at 1 or 2 percent  That’s a possibility    Well, that’s what we’re prepared to do—to do more    I think two things will happen  One, if things settle down and liquidity in   the market improves, then we would stop adding more reserves than we think the market really   needs  The excess liquidity we add today, though, will probably make it hard to push the funds rate   up  Let’s say that the funds rate falls out of bed today  We could see a sloppy funds rate for a   couple of days because the two-week reserve maintenance period goes through Wednesday  Now,   once you restart the reserve maintenance period next Thursday, the banks will have a whole new   reserve regime, and I think at that time the sloppiness would be pretty much over  So we could   definitely see a situation in which, if we’re effective, the funds rate could be on the soft side, and   that could last through Wednesday of next week  But after that, it will be a new reserve   maintenance period, and I don’t think we’ll have any difficulty there  "
8201,2007-08-16,"  Thank you  As you noted, market turbulence has continued to  spread and intensify  The strains that have emerged in the prime nonconforming home  mortgage market and in the asset-backed commercial paper market have proved to be  self-reinforcing  As investors have backed away from asset-backed commercial paper,  this has led to a forced sale of mortgage collateral, and that has put downward pressure  on the prices of private-label whole mortgages and of mortgage-backed securities  The  downward pressure on prices of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, in turn,  has resulted in increased haircuts by prime brokers and lenders  This has provoked a  rapid, forced deleveraging among many mortgage investors  This process has unfolded  rapidly and has overwhelmed the ability of depository institutions to take up the slack,  even though at current prices many of these assets appear to be at attractive valuations   The absence of strong offsetting demand by depository institutions not faced with these  same constraints appears to have been influenced by factors that threaten to put pressure  on these institutions’ balance sheets  These include leveraged loan commitments  associated with private equity deals and the assets from busted commercial paper  programs that might end up on their balance sheets     Over the past few days, we have seen a significant increase in market dysfunction    First, although the aggressive provision of reserves by the Desk last Friday successfully  pushed the federal funds rate back down after it had climbed above its 5¼ percent target,  term rates remain elevated  For example, the one-month term federal funds rate is  currently quoted at 540 percent, even though fed funds rate futures imply an average   August 16, 2007 3 of 37    rate over the next month of less than 5 percent  This is consistent with a significant rise  in risk premiums  Second, over the past two days, we have seen a sharp decline in  Treasury bill rates  Although a diminished supply may be a partial explanation, flight- to-quality concerns appear to account for most of the sharp move down in yields  Some  investors have reported that dealers are very reluctant to sell Treasury bills  Third, other  measures show that risk aversion has increased  For example, interest rate swap spreads  have widened significantly, and the spread between on-the-run and off-the-run  Treasuries has increased  Fourth, equity prices around the world have moved lower   The S&P 500 index is now down roughly 10 percent from its peak  Fifth, the so-called  carry trade in currencies is unwinding with a vengeance  The yen has appreciated  sharply against the dollar, even as the dollar has strengthened against many other  currencies, such as the euro  The yen-dollar rate has fallen below 114  Sixth, market  volatility has spiked  The VIX measure of implied volatility for the stock market has  climbed above 30, well above the peak it reached in late February and early March   Implied volatility in fixed income in currency markets has also moved up sharply     The market turbulence and the rise in risk aversion have created several areas of   vulnerability  First, there is the risk that money market mutual funds could suffer losses  on certain asset-backed commercial paper programs that have weak backstops  This  could conceivably cause some funds to “break the buck”  In the worst case, this could  even result in a run from these funds by investors  Second, worries about the exposure  of the financial guarantors to the mortgage market could cause problems to spread from  this area to areas that have up to now been more sheltered from stress, such as the  municipal securities market  The intense market turbulence has caused investors to  become more worried about the downside risk to the economy  As a result, investors  now anticipate significant monetary policy easing in the weeks and months ahead, much  more than even a week ago  For example, September federal funds futures currently  imply a 492 percent federal funds rate for the month, 33 basis points below the current  5¼ percent target, and the Eurodollar futures strip through mid-2008 is consistent with  roughly 100 basis points of easing over this period  Thank you  I’m happy to take any  questions      Yes, discount window loans will be an increase of reserves into the   banking system  We would have to be making offsetting adjustments either to our portfolio or to   our repurchase interventions  Absolutely    Oh, sure  The asset-backed commercial paper programs have a wide   variety of backstops to protect holders of commercial paper  Some have bank lines  Some have   credit co-return swaps that basically are equivalent to bank lines  So if the programs are terminated   and the collateral has to be liquidated, the banks are on the hook for the difference between the   collateral and the par value  A third kind of backstop, though, has turned out to be quite weak, and   that’s what is called the credit enhancement backstop  That’s when you might have a commercial   paper program that’s basically funding AAA-rated assets, and the backstop is just a little   overcollateralization of those AAA assets  The problem is that, in some cases, the degree of   overcollateralization is too small relative to where those AAA assets currently trade  For example,   in one asset-backed commercial paper program, the credit enhancement was 2 percent of the AAA   assets  I talked with the person who runs that entity, who said that a lot of their AAA assets, if they   had to be liquidated today, would sell in the range of 88 to 92 cents on the dollar  So if they were   liquidated, the commercial paper holders would actually have losses    Well, they look to be pretty solid  We don’t seem to have the problem that   cropped up in Canada where, my understanding is, commercial paper programs that were put in   place or backstops that were put in place before January 1 of this year had a market disruption   clause  The backstop was operative only if the circumstance was deemed a market disruption,   August 16, 2007 5 of 37    which gave the provider of the backstop the argument, well, this wasn’t a market disruption—it was   an event specific to this particular issuer  Now, the Canadians, through some moral suasion,   managed to clear that up, but we don’t have that particular issue    I haven’t heard any discussion about that    I think there has been some evidence of a modest uptick in credit cards and   auto loans, but I don’t think you can characterize it as severe  I also would say it is in the early   days  The really intense part of this market disruption has happened pretty recently  I would be   surprised if you found anything showing up in real time  From an economic perspective, if I can put   on my old economist hat for just a moment, I would say that the market disruption in terms of its   macro consequences presumably will be felt mostly through the provision of mortgage credit  in the   nonconforming mortgage loan area—large mortgage loans, subprime mortgage loans, or alt-A   mortgage loans  The sum of all those was a fairly significant portion of the mortgage market last   year  Obviously, the depository institutions can take up some of the slack, but I think it’s probably   pretty reasonable to think that mortgage credit availability and mortgage credit underwriting   standards are going to be quite different this year than they were in 2006    Well, obviously if the margin is a little higher, presumably there will be   less volatility in terms of discount window borrowings, and that’s probably helpful from my   perspective  Another thing I would say is that, if it’s 50 basis points, the thing will be more   naturally self-extinguishing  In other words, as markets improve, the 50 basis points will turn into a   penalty over time, and so the thing will naturally go away on its own, I think that’s a useful feature    Well, we don’t know for certain because we haven’t had this regime  The   reality is that we have a fair amount of uncertainty about the answer to that question  I think it   probably would raise the risk by some amount  It’s hard to know exactly how to scale that    Again, I think that’s a really hard question to answer since we haven’t run   the experiment   August 16, 2007 11 of 37     There has been upward pressure on European rates and on US dollar rates   for European banks, and there has been a bit of asymmetry in that they’ve wanted their money early   and the US banks are natural net long sellers to the European banks, which are net short dollars    Every morning the European banks need dollars  What essentially has happened is that the   European banks have become a bit more itchy and they want their money sooner  At the same time,   the US banks are more worried about what will happen in the paper market, and they want to keep   their money longer  As a consequence, moving the dollars from the US banks to the European   banks became a little more difficult  So there has been a bit of upward pressure  The pressure has   diminished a bit over the past few days  I think the aggressive reserve provisions by us and the   ECB have settled down the overnight market a bit  There’s still a spread, but I don’t think it is   August 16, 2007 15 of 37    appreciably bigger than the spread that we’ve seen for some time  This isn’t all completely new    My understanding is that this isn’t really being designed to help the European banks  I think it is   designed with a much broader mission in mind    Well, the reality is that we don’t know with any certainty  All we can say   is that, as the discount rate gets closer to the funds rate, there will presumably be more use and more   variability in the use of the discount window  The use of the discount window is not really the   problem  The problem is the variability in the use and the difficulty of forecasting that use  If we   could forecast exactly what the discount window borrowings were going to be every day, then we   could offset that by our open market operations  Forecasting what the discount window borrowings   will be in a day is a very difficult thing to do  Of course, when the use occurs at the end of the day,   it’s too late for us to offset it  So I think we could say that the risk goes up as you narrow that   margin  But Governor Mishkin’s point is a fair one  At the same time, there is a tradeoff; and if   you go further, you’re going to have a more powerful effect, and you have to make a value   judgment about where the tradeoff is  It’s a difficult judgment to make because we haven’t done   this before   August 16, 2007 31 of 37     If I could just add one more point—another issue of a narrower spread is   that, as Brian pointed out, you probably increase the number of people, and so there are also some   operational issues relating to the staff that the Federal Reserve Banks are managing  If we thought   that cutting it in half would lead to a dramatic increase in the number of banks, which is certainly   possible, given the fact that we have 8,000 banks and many more depository institutions than that,   there is an issue in terms of the operational burden and our capacity to do that, given that this is   basically very rarely used in the current environment   August 16, 2007 32 of 37   "
8221,2007-09-18,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the handout that  you have in front of you  In my mind, there are three key questions  First, how did  the problems in the subprime mortgage area—with losses that probably will  ultimately turn out to be in a range of $100 billion to $200 billion—lead to such broad  market distress?  Second, what is the cause of the dysfunction in US and European  money markets?  Third, how far along are we in terms of the adjustment process—in  other words, when might we anticipate a resumption of normal market function?     Turning to the first question, the losses in subprime mortgages had wide-ranging   effects because the poor investment performance made investors much less willing to  invest in structured-finance products more generally  Investors lost confidence  because highly rated securities that referenced subprime assets performed poorly and  because investors found it difficult to value complex structured-finance products   This loss of confidence triggered several broader developments  the inability of  mortgage originators to securitize nonconforming mortgage loans; the rapid                                                     1 Materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 18, 2007 3 of 188    contraction of the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market; the virtual  shutdown of the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) and collateralized loan  obligation (CLO) markets; the sharp shifts we saw into and out of Treasury-only  versus prime money market mutual funds, which in turn disrupted the Treasury bill  market; and the anticipated pressure on bank balance sheets and the upward pressure  on term funding rates       The pressure on bank balance sheets is coming from three major sources  First,   investor demand for securitized non-agency mortgage-backed securities has dried up   Bank originators now have to hold such loans in their bank portfolios  Second, bank  backstop liquidity facilities have been triggered as investor appetite for asset-backed  commercial paper has fallen sharply  Third, banks are expected to have difficulty  syndicating the bridge loans that they provided to finance leveraged buyouts      Of these three sources of pressure, the rollup of ABCP programs has been, in my   view, the most important  The magnitude of the potential funding requirement is the  largest, and how much will come back onto bank balance sheets is very uncertain   The constraint on mortgage loan origination can be seen most visibly in the widening  of the spread between fixed-rate prime jumbo mortgage loan rates and conforming  mortgage loan rates  As you can see in exhibit 1, the spread has widened from around  25 basis points to around 100 basis points in recent weeks  The sharp contraction in  the ABCP market began when commercial paper investors became aware that their  investments could be vulnerable to loss but were uncertain as to the extent of their  exposure in particular programs  This fear of loss had a legitimate basis for those  ABCP programs that finance mortgage-related assets without full bank credit  enhancement  An inability to roll over these programs in the current market would  force the liquidation of the assets  In the current market, that could lead to investor  losses  The problem started in extendable commercial paper market programs, where  the credit enhancement backstop by banks was typically either absent or less than  100 percent  The problem then quickly migrated to structured-investment vehicle  (SIV) programs, which suffered from similar shortcomings  From there, the problem  spread as risk-averse investors started to shun the entire asset class  Asset-backed  commercial paper rates rose for those programs that were able to roll over their  outstanding commercial paper  This is shown in exhibit 2, which compares  unsecured and secured commercial paper rates  The volume of outstanding asset- backed commercial paper shrank sharply as some issuers were unable to roll over  their maturing paper  Exhibit 3 illustrates the downtrend in the volume of outstanding  ABCP  Exhibit 4 shows the maturity structure of outstanding asset-backed  commercial paper and highlights the high proportion of paper that is now being rolled  on an overnight basis  The pressure on the asset-backed commercial paper market  was temporarily exacerbated by the behavior of money market mutual fund investors,  who shifted funds last month from prime money market funds to Treasury-only  money market funds (see exhibit 5)  Because the total assets in money market mutual  funds are nearly four times the size of outstanding Treasury bills, these flows led to a  large, albeit mostly transitory fall in Treasury bill yields  That is shown in exhibit 6        September 18, 2007 4 of 188    The good news is that the money flows into the prime money mutual funds have  stabilized  This reflects greater discernment among investors about the risks  associated with different types of asset-backed commercial paper and the widening  yield differentials between prime and Treasury-only money market funds  It is  noteworthy that those areas of the asset-backed commercial paper market with  underlying structural problems—primarily the extendable, SIV, and SIV-lite portions  of the market—represent only a small proportion of total asset-backed commercial  paper outstanding  For example, as shown in exhibit 7, SIV programs represented  only about 7 percent of the asset-backed commercial paper market before the recent  sharp contraction  Moreover, as shown in exhibit 8, much of the asset-backed  commercial paper market does not finance residential mortgage asset-backed  securities, so there is less uncertainty about the underlying value of the assets  Also,  much of the market has solid credit support, with 100 percent bank credit  enhancement  This suggests that, as time passes, investors will gradually be able to  distinguish between the different types of the ABCP programs and stability will  return to the multi-seller, bank-sponsored programs  Already, the pace of contraction  of the overall ABCP market has slowed significantly  However, the extendable and  SIV programs are likely to continue to be under pressure       The third source of balance sheet pressure stems from the sharp contraction in   CDO and CLO issuance  As can be seen in exhibit 9, CDO and CLO issuance  volumes have plummeted in recent months  The virtual closure of the CDO market  has led, in turn, to a virtual cessation of high-yield debt issuance—illustrated in  exhibit 10  These developments have created uncertainty for commercial and  investment banks about their ability to syndicate the large volume of loan and debt  commitments that they have made to finance private equity buyouts  These  institutions are faced with the prospect that they may have to carry such loans on their  books for an extended period at a discount to par value  Syndication will be more  difficult because the ability to transform a large proportion of these obligations into  marketable investment-grade products through the alchemy of structured finance is  not currently an available option     This pressure on bank balance sheets—both existing and anticipated—has led to   significant dysfunction in financial markets  In particular, primary dealers have  pulled back in their willingness to finance the security positions of investment banks,  hedge funds, and other leveraged investors  Exhibit 11 illustrates the median  repurchase-rate bid-asked spread by primary dealers for three types of collateral— GSE MBS, prime MBS, and high-yield corporate debt—at overnight, one-week, and  one-month maturities  As can be seen, there has been an upward trend in bid-asked  spreads, especially at the one-month maturity   Exhibit 12 illustrates the median  haircuts applied against such collateral  Again, there has been an increase, which has  been particularly pronounced at the one-month maturity       At the same time, this balance sheet pressure and worries about counterparty risk   have led to a significant rise in term borrowing rates  Banks that are sellers of funds  have shifted to the overnight market to preserve their liquidity, and this shift has   September 18, 2007 5 of 188    starved the term market of funds, pushing those rates higher  As shown in exhibit 13,  the spread between the one-month LIBOR and the one-month interest rate swap rate  has widened sharply, and the one-month LIBOR has generally traded considerably  above the anticipated level of the overnight federal funds rate  The same pressure on  funding rates has been also evident in euribor rates (see exhibit 14)  The rise in term  rates has pushed banks that depend on funding from the interbank market into the  overnight market  In addition, these depository institutions have turned to the Federal  Home Loan Bank system as a source of term funding  For example, FHLB advances  rose $110 billion in August  In contrast, despite the 50 basis point reduction in the  spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate target, the dollar value of  discount window borrowings remains modest, as shown in exhibit 15  This reflects  the lower cost of FHLB advances, the ability to borrow at longer terms from the  FHLB, and the lack of stigma in using such advances as a source of funding       So where do we go from here?  Clearly, the adjustment process is far from over    Asset-backed commercial paper programs are still being rolled up, and there is  considerable uncertainty about how difficult it will be to roll some of this paper over  quarter-end  Moreover, it remains unclear what proportion of leveraged loan  commitments commercial and investment banks will be able to syndicate and at what  price  Despite the big backlog and the end of the August doldrums, there has, as yet,  been little syndication activity  The good news, of course, is that as time passes, the  uncertainty about bank balance sheet pressures and funding requirements should  lessen  Moreover, investors’ ability to distinguish between “good” and “bad” ABCP  programs and structured-finance products should continue to improve  The bad news  is that the stress caused by the forcible deleveraging of the nonbank financial sector  could lead to further losses accompanied by headlines that could further damage  investor confidence  Moreover, the increased reliance by banks on overnight funding  increases rollover risk and may limit the willingness of banks to expand their balance  sheets to accommodate the deleveraging of the nonbank financial sector  In the  mortgage sector, depository institutions will undoubtedly—at the right price—take up  the slack in the prime jumbo mortgage market  But nondepository institutions are  unlikely to be able to originate and securitize nonconforming mortgages in  appreciable volume for some time      The tone in financial markets has improved a bit in recent days  Nevertheless, we   still appear to be in an environment in which the dominant theme is risk aversion  This can be seen in a matrix that measures the correlation among the price  movements in the major asset classes (see exhibit 16)  In times when markets are  calm and untroubled, the correlation coefficients are generally low  As you can see in  the exhibit, which examines these correlations since the August 7 FOMC meeting, the  correlation coefficients have been very high recently       In the foreign exchange markets, two developments are worth noting  First, the   turmoil in money markets did impair the functioning of the foreign exchange swap  market  This made it more difficult for banks in Europe that are structurally short of  dollars to obtain the dollar funding needed to fund their assets  In recent days, this   September 18, 2007 6 of 188    market function has improved  Second, the dollar has weakened  As shown in  exhibit 17, the dollar has fallen to a record low against the euro  But don’t be too  impressed by that headline  On a broad trade-weighted basis, the decline of the dollar  has been modest, with a decline of less than 1 percent from the last FOMC meeting  and a fall of slightly more than 4 percent from the start of the year  Moreover, this  softness in the dollar does not appear to signal any fundamental shift in the  willingness of foreign investors to hold dollar-denominated assets  Instead, it appears  to be driven mainly by changing interest rate expectations  As shown in exhibit 18,  the exchange rate of the dollar versus the euro has continued to track changes in  expected short-term interest rate differentials between the United States and Europe     Not surprisingly, our dealer survey reveals a large decline in short-term rate   expectations  Exhibits 19 and 20 compare the dealer surveys before the August 7  FOMC meeting and before the current FOMC meeting  The green circles represent  the average of the dealer forecasts, and the blue circles represent the range sized by  the number of dealers at each value  As can be seen, the average of the dealer modal  forecasts for mid-2008 has fallen more than 60 basis points  Market expectations—as  reflected by the solid bold lines—have declined about the same amount and remain  below the average dealer modal forecasts  With respect to the outcome of this  meeting, a slight majority of dealers expect a 25 basis point reduction in the target  federal funds rate rather than a 50 basis point cut  Only one dealer expects no change  in the federal funds rate target  Uncertainty about the short-term interest rate path has  also increased  This is evident both in the dealer survey and in the probability  distribution of rate outcomes implied by options prices on Eurodollar futures  As can  be seen in exhibit 21, the probability distribution of rate outcomes has become much  broader since the August 7 FOMC meeting     Finally, open market operations since the last FOMC meeting warrant some   discussion  As you know, in early August, following persistent upward pressure on  the federal funds rate and an extraordinarily large reserve-adding provision by the  ECB, we aggressively added reserves on August 10  That provision of reserves did  break the upward pressure on the federal funds rate, and the federal funds rate traded  notably soft over the remainder of that two-week reserve maintenance period  Since  that time, we have attempted to pull back on our provision of reserves in order to  push the federal funds rate back up toward its target  Notice that the blue bars in  exhibit 22, which measure daily excess reserves before borrowing, have been  generally in negative territory over the past month  Although we have had some  success in pushing the effective federal funds rate higher, it has generally traded over  the past month below the 5¼ percent target       Our efforts to push the federal funds rate back toward the target have been   undermined by several factors  First, expectations about the possibility of an  intermeeting cut in the federal funds rate target have caused the federal funds rate to  trade somewhat soft  Also, in recent days, the effective rate has been held down  somewhat by expectations of a rate cut at today’s meeting  Second, the narrower  margin between the discount rate and the federal funds rate target makes it more   September 18, 2007 7 of 188    difficult to push up the effective federal funds rate  The upper band of the corridor  above 5¼ percent is now half as wide as before even as the lower bound for the  federal funds rate remains at 0 percent  The lower discount rate acts as a cap on how  high the federal funds rate can climb when reserves are tight  Third, we have had bad  luck in the sense that most of our forecasting misses in terms of autonomous factors  that affect reserves—such as float, Treasury balances, currency demand, and  borrowings at the window—have caused us to inadvertently leave more reserves in  the banking system than we had intended  Our difficulty in pushing up the effective  rate can be illustrated by our experience last Wednesday, the last day of the two-week  reserve maintenance period  Despite a consistently stingy provision of reserves that  resulted in $5 billion of overnight primary credit borrowing for the day and $72  billion in total borrowing, the effective rate for that Wednesday was 518 percent  I  would note, though, that in the past two days we have actually pushed the funds rate  effectively up to its target     There were no foreign exchange operations during this period  I request a vote to   ratify the operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the  August 7 FOMC meeting  Of course, I am very happy to take questions      Turning first to your first question, why we do it the way that we do—well,   with the new authority to pay interest on reserves, we are going to take a pretty broad look at the   whole issue of how we target the federal funds rate and how we manage reserves more generally    So I think that’s a legitimate question, and it is going to be done as part of that process  Obviously,   the way we do it today is based on a sort of historical evolution that started when the Fed did not   reveal what the federal funds rate target was  So I think it’s probably fair to say that four or five   years from now, when we have that new authority, we may be doing things quite differently     In terms of the issue of going back in later in the day, the problem there is that we don’t   really know what’s happening to the autonomous factors until the next morning  So we don’t know   exactly how we’re doing in terms of tracking the reserve provisions relative to our forecast in real   time  We don’t have that    We do see the rate  We could be more aggressive and push people to the   window, but I think it is important in this environment not to be contributing to market turmoil  We   September 18, 2007 9 of 188    felt that the right thing to do was to err on the side of not pushing people forcibly to the window   when the market was under some distress  I would also say that the fed funds rate, while it has   traded soft, it hasn’t traded that soft  The effective rate so far this month has been 508, and I think   that, coming into this meeting, we have pretty much eliminated from the minds of people in the   markets that there was a stealth easing, especially in light of where the federal funds rate has been   trading over the past week  So I don’t see that as a significant issue for this meeting    Well, it’s difficult to sort out exactly how much of that term premium that   we see in the term funding markets represents counterparty risk versus balance sheet constraints  I   think in the United States that it is probably more of a balance sheet issue  In Europe it’s probably   more counterparty risk  The general sense is that the US banks are very healthy and, as you note,   well capitalized  However, the fact that you still have quite a bit of room before you hit that   boundary of “well capitalized” doesn’t mean that the banks aren’t concerned about potential balance   sheet pressures  The problem they have right now is that they can’t really size with any accuracy   how much will be coming onto their balance sheets over the next few months through asset-backed   commercial paper, through bank conduits, and through other things for which they may be on the   hook that they didn’t expect to be on the hook for  So I wouldn’t take the boundary line of “well   capitalized” versus “not well capitalized” as the constraint  I think the constraint actually starts to   bind quite a bit before you get to that point    The analysis that has been done has suggested that the banks are well   capitalized and should, with one or two exceptions, be able to handle this balance sheet expansion   reasonably well; but they can’t say that with absolute certainty    Another thing happening is that there is a potential problem on the   earnings side  You can imagine a worst case scenario in which you can’t syndicate any of the loans   and then the loans have to be marked down significantly  That has an earnings consequence  So   then the balance sheet is going to be affected not just by what’s happening in terms of the assets but   September 18, 2007 11 of 188    also by what’s happening in terms of the capital  I think the uncertainty about it will probably turn   out to be more of a problem than the actual reality, but it’s going to take time for us to find out what   the actual reality is    I would hesitate to say that I know with any great clarity that there’s   nothing else there in Europe  I think we have all been a bit surprised by the size of some of the   conduits that some European banks were sponsoring relative to their capital  I would be very   hesitant to say that we have transparency regarding that marketplace and know with certainty that   there’s nothing else there    But I would just reemphasize the fact that we did try to be stingy  Our ex   ante provision of reserves was less than what we thought that the market needed, and we thought   that would push up the federal funds rate  We do not have control over all the factors that affect the   demand for reserves, and unfortunately they consistently came in on the side of adding more   reserves into the system than we intended  That said, we have been pretty consistently trying to   push back on the market to get the effective federal funds rate back toward the target, and I think we   can say that we made it by the meeting  I think there are very few people in the market today who   believe that there’s a stealth easing in the market    For the record, I laughed    On the question about volume, there’s no question that volume went up   considerably in the overnight market—about 20 percent, as near as we can judge over this period    Since the term market was mostly shut down, especially in term fed funds, there has been very little   in term fed funds trading  You can almost infer that most volume is done overnight but probably   20 percent or so is done term  Almost all of that crowded back into the overnight market  So there   was an increase, as near as we can measure, of about 20 percent in overnight fed funds activity over   September 18, 2007 15 of 188    the past month compared with normal  Now, in terms of who is actually borrowing at term—well,   very few people were actually borrowing at term  There was probably a bit of a “lemons” problem   in the term market in the sense that—because term rates were elevated and those rates were not very   attractive economically—your wanting to borrow in the term market was a sign that you were   probably not in good shape in terms of your own liquidity position  I think that contributed to the   shutdown of the term market  Because of the economics really—why are you doing that unless   you’re in bad shape and you really need the funds?  I think that contributed to the shrinking of the   term market  Really two things were going on  One, banks that had the funds to lend didn’t want to   lend term because they weren’t sure what they would need that money for down the road,   depending on what was going to come onto their balance sheets  Two, people who wanted to   borrow term were the least attractive borrowers  That caused the market to essentially dry up over   this period  I think it is starting to come back  We’re not back to normal because obviously the   term rates are still somewhat elevated relative to the overnight rate  So it’s still not that attractive   from an economic perspective, but it is certainly more attractive than it was even a week ago    I haven’t actually seen any volume data on term  They may, in fact, exist    What we did, though, is look at the volume in the overnight federal funds market, and we saw that   go up about 20 percent  So if you start with the premise that the banks that have excess funds to   lend aren’t going to change much month to month, you can pretty much infer that most of it is   coming out of the term market   September 18, 2007 16 of 188     Yes, obviously that moves in that direction, but if I remember correctly,   the number on the volume of the fed funds market is in the $400 billion to $500 billion range    Twenty percent on that kind of level is quite a bit bigger than what you’re seeing    It’s an over-the-counter market, and in most over-the-counter markets we   do not have the kind of volume data we would like to have    I don’t know the answer to that    Yes, I agree with that    Three weeks ago, if this had happened, I think there would have been a   different market reaction  The market reaction has been very mild  They seem to be able to sort   it out as a specific problem pertaining to Northern Rock and the UK regulatory regime, not   something that applies to a broader market  So I agree with that    Just as our banks will be able to bid in both    If I could just make two points  One reason that you might want to let   them borrow in both places is that their collateral may be in both places, and they may have   different availability of collateral in the two locations  The second reason is that your goal at the   end of the day is to get the money to those who most need it  To the extent that you put   constraints on the system, you are going to make it more difficult for the money to get to the   people who value it the most    No, I think we all agree on that  [Laughter]   September 18, 2007 138 of 188     No  No, the economics are better because you have to think about the   minimum rate  The minimum rate is the swap rate plus 10 basis points, which is well below one-  month LIBOR and well below the one-month term fed funds rate  So there is that room in-  between  You could actually criticize a bank for not participating in this  They are somehow   leaving money on the table by not taking advantage of this    Not necessarily    No    But this is a temporary program    They should figure out pretty quickly what this rate means  "
8244,2007-10-30,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am going to miss Karen as my  fellow scribe at the BIS  She also was the person who identified who was actually  speaking  [Laughter]      Two crosscurrents have dominated financial markets since the September 18   FOMC meeting  (1) greater discrimination by investors with respect to credit quality  across asset classes versus (2) ongoing deterioration in credit quality within the class  of mortgage-related assets  On the one hand, underlying market function has  generally improved  In particular, investors have shown greater ability to  differentiate between the corporate and the mortgage sectors and between different  types of products such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) versus collateralized  debt obligations (CDOs)  Most of the asset-backed commercial paper market is no  longer under duress, bank funding pressures have abated somewhat, and the issuance  of CLOs and high-yield debt has increased  On the other hand, those areas more  closely linked to the US housing sector remain under pressure  This includes the  subprime mortgage market, the mortgage-backed securities market, and financial  entities—such as mortgage and financial guarantors—that have significant exposures  to these asset classes       The tension between the improved ability of investors to discriminate among   risky assets versus the deteriorating fundamentals is illustrated in the performance of  the ABX indexes  These indexes measure the cost of buying protection on different  tranches of particular vintages of mortgage-backed securities that hold subprime  mortgage loan assets  I will be referring to the handout in front of you  Exhibit 1  shows the performance for the 07-01 vintage—that is, mortgage-backed securities  originated mainly during the second half of 2006  As can be seen, the prices of the  lower-rated tranches have continued to plunge in response to rising delinquency rates  for subprime loans and the virtual shutdown of the subprime mortgage market  In  contrast, the performance of the AAA-rated tranche has held up better, especially  until very recently  This suggests that investors are more carefully distinguishing  between the implications of widespread subprime losses for those tranches, such as  AAA, that are in a senior position in the structure versus lower-rated tranches, where  the losses may well be large enough to wipe out their value altogether  Similarly,  investors appear to be doing a better job of discriminating between the different types  of asset-backed commercial paper programs  Those with high-quality, diversified                                                     1 Materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   October 30-31, 2007 5 of 162    collateral or strong bank support or both are performing well  In contrast, those  programs with less solid support—mainly SIV and extendible programs—in which  the commercial paper holders are more vulnerable to loss continue to hit liquidity and  capital triggers and are gradually being wound down  As shown in exhibit 2, the  overall asset-backed commercial paper market has been contracting recently at a  much slower pace than earlier in the summer  Moreover, secured commercial paper  rates have narrowed significantly relative to the overnight index swap rate and  relative to top-quality unsecured commercial paper (exhibit 3)       The ability of banks to securitize assets also appears to have improved  In   particular, as shown in exhibits 4 and 5, CLO and high-yield debt issuance has picked  up  However, CDO issuance remains very depressed relative to the level of issuance  earlier in the year  Investors have lost confidence in this product as market prices  have plunged and the rating agencies have begun to cut their ratings, often very  sharply, on many outstanding CDOs  Market participants are more willing to buy  corporate debt for three reasons  First, the underlying fundamentals in the corporate  sector remain good  Second, the underlying assets are much easier to value  Third,  investors are more willing to trust the credit ratings in this area  The rating agency  models have been battle-tested over a much longer period and have been shown to be  robust across a broad range of environments  In contrast, the ability of banks to  securitize nonconforming mortgage loans remains impaired  Nevertheless, spreads  between jumbo and conforming mortgage loan rates have come in a bit (see exhibit  6)  This may reflect diminished pressure on bank balance sheets from other sources       Overall, term funding pressures for banks have diminished as banks have gained   greater clarity about their future funding needs and the need for excess liquidity has  diminished  Nevertheless, term funding pressures still persist  As can be seen in  exhibit 7, although the spreads between one-month LIBOR and the one-month  overnight index swap rate and three-month LIBOR and the three-month overnight  index swap rate have narrowed, these spreads remain high relative to the level of  spreads evident at the beginning of the summer  Exhibit 8 shows the same spreads  for Europe—they have also come in but remain higher than normal  Although the  credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the large investment banks and the large  commercial banks narrowed following the last FOMC meeting, much of this  improvement has been reversed over the past two weeks as the housing outlook has  deteriorated further and as the earnings announcements for several major financial  institutions have disappointed investors  Similarly, the CDS spreads for mortgage  insurers and financial guarantors have widened  These CDS spreads are shown in  exhibit 9       The broader bond and equity markets have generally shown improvement  In the   fixed income market, credit default swap spreads have fallen somewhat for the high- yield debt market (see exhibit 10), and the US equity market has largely recovered  over the past couple of months (see exhibit 11)  Interestingly, despite the poor  earnings of the financial sector and the outlook for slower US growth, earnings  expectations of equity analysts for 2007 have declined only slightly, and the decline   October 30-31, 2007 6 of 162    in 2007 has been offset by an upward revision to 2008 earnings estimates (see exhibit  12)  Moreover, the demand for downside protection in the equity market has  diminished  Exhibit 13 examines the relative cost of buying a put versus a call  A  positive skew is consistent with a greater cost of downside protection  Although a  significant positive skew persists, it is now much lower than it was immediately  before the September 18 FOMC meeting  Exhibits 14 and 15 summarize the  incomplete transition away from risk-reduction behavior by financial market  participants  Exhibit 14 shows the correlation of daily price movements and yield  changes across the different asset classes for the time interval between the August and  the September FOMC meetings  As can be seen, the correlations were very high— indicating that risk aversion was the dominant impulse among investors—with most  of the correlations over this period exceeding an absolute value of 05  These are  shaded in blue in the exhibit  In contrast, the same correlations since the September  18 FOMC meeting, shown in exhibit 15, have come down but remain much higher  than during the first half of the year         Two other market developments deserve a brief mention before I turn to dealer   expectations concerning monetary policy and a brief look at inflation expectations   First, crude oil prices have shot higher  There is considerable disagreement among  market participants about how long the higher prices will last and the factors behind  the price surge  Although some argue that it is speculative, others point to more- fundamental drivers such as inventory drawdowns, geopolitical uncertainties, and  dollar weakness  Regardless of the cause, the effect on the macroeconomy has been  modest up to now because higher crude oil prices have not fed through meaningfully  into product prices  That is because the so-called crack spread—the margin between  the value of the refined products produced from that crude oil and the cost of crude  oil supply—has come down sharply, as shown in exhibit 16  The narrowness of the  crack spread implies that further increases in crude oil prices, if forthcoming, would  likely feed through into product prices  Second, the dollar continues on its gradual  downward course  Although the dollar has reached new lows against the euro and the  Canadian dollar, the overall pace of the decline as measured by the broad trade- weighted index has not changed much from the trend exhibited earlier in the year (see  exhibit 17)  The dollar’s trajectory still appears to be driven mainly by interest rate  differentials  This can be seen in exhibit 18, which shows the dollar versus the euro  relative to the Eurodollar–EURIBOR interest rate differential  Moreover, there is  little evidence that the dollar’s slide has made investors less willing to participate in  the long end of the US bond market  You can see that by the fact that US 10-year  Treasury note yields are still fairly low, trading around 44 percent     Market expectations about monetary policy have shown considerable variability   since the last FOMC meeting  Exhibit 19 tracks the implied probability of different  target rate outcomes at this meeting calculated from the option prices on federal funds  futures contracts  As can be seen in the exhibit, the probability of a 25 basis point cut  has fluctuated in a wide range  The most recent survey of primary dealers, conducted  ten days ago, shows a slight tilt toward a 25 basis point cut at the current meeting,  with eleven dealers expecting a 25 basis point cut, nine expecting no change, and one   October 30-31, 2007 7 of 162    expecting a 50 basis point reduction  Since that time a number of dealers have shifted  camp  Currently, a more informal survey by the Desk indicates that nineteen out of  twenty-one dealers expect a 25 basis point rate cut at this meeting  Exhibits 20 and  21 show the primary dealer forecasts for the federal funds rate before the September  and the current FOMC meetings  As can be seen, the dealers’ forecasts for the  federal funds rate path are currently a bit lower than before the September 18  meeting—partially reflecting the fact that the FOMC easing of 50 basis points at the  September meeting was of greater magnitude than the cut embodied in the average  dealer forecast  Also, the gap between the dealers’ forecasts and the expectations  embodied in market rates has narrowed over the past six weeks  As can be seen,  considerable disagreement about the rate path remains  One year out, the dispersion  of the modal dealer forecasts remains very wide       Inflation expectations increased following the 50 basis point rate cut in   September  However, the degree of widening is sensitive to how the forward  breakeven inflation rate is calculated  Exhibit 22 shows the five-year, five-year- forward implied inflation rate as estimated by the Board staff versus the five-year,  five-year-forward breakeven inflation rate as estimated by Barclays Bank, a major  participant in the TIPS market  As can be seen in the exhibit, typically these two  measures move together  More recently, however, they have diverged a bit, with the  Board staff measure showing a more persistent increase following the September  FOMC meeting  The two measures differ in the securities that they use to compare  nominal versus inflation-adjusted yields—with the Board staff using a smoothed yield  curve based on off-the-run nominal Treasuries and the Barclays measure using the  on-the-run nominal five-year and ten-year Treasury notes to compare with the five- year and ten-year TIPS notes  However, liquidity differences among Treasury  securities are hard to model  As a result, it is difficult to be confident of the accuracy  of such adjustments  This argues that one should not completely dismiss the Barclays  measure when the two measures are behaving differently  This might especially be  true when no rise in long-term inflation expectations is evident in other measures,  such as the University of the Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiment or the Desk’s  own primary dealer survey       Finally, I want to discuss briefly the Desk’s performance in implementing the   FOMC’s directive from the last meeting for a 475 percent federal funds rate target   In this respect, let me make two observations  First, in contrast to the previous  intermeeting period, in which the effective rate traded below the target for much of  the period, the average effective rate has been extremely close to the target since the  September 18 meeting  Exhibit 23 shows the cumulative effective rate relative to the  target since the last meeting  Second, as shown in exhibit 24, there has still been  more day-to-day volatility in the federal funds rate than earlier in the year  This  pattern likely reflects several factors, including the demand by European banks for  funds early in the day and the reduced spread between the discount rate and the target  federal funds rate, which has altered the banks’ demand for reserve balances        October 30-31, 2007 8 of 162    There were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote to ratify the  operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the September 18  FOMC meeting  Of course, I am very happy to take questions      I think the market takes the upside risk to inflation as more what central   bankers have to say    Right, and I think that the downside risk would be viewed as more a hint   of the way that the central bank is leaning  So I don’t think they are symmetric    November fed funds futures were up 1 basis point, December was up   2 basis points, January fed funds were up 2 basis points, and then as you go further out they are 4   to 5  So it’s fairly small    I think it has been as low as 30 and as high as—it’s nested, because   there is some probability on 50 and some probability on 25  But if you look at the Cleveland   Fed, I think it has ranged from about 30 to about 80  "
8268,2007-12-06,"1  Thank you, Brian  I will be referring to the chart packet that you   should have in front of you  The first chart is the spread between term funding rates and  overnight index swap (OIS) rates  Term funding pressures have intensified over the past few  weeks  As shown in exhibit 1, the spreads between one-month LIBOR and the one-month  OIS rate and the three-month LIBOR and the three-month OIS rate have climbed above the  peaks in early September         The sharp spike in one-month LIBOR at the end of November  seen in the exhibit represents the embedded cost of year-end funding  The pressures  in Europe and the United Kingdom have also intensified  As can be seen in exhibits 2  and 3, the upward pressure in term funding markets is also evident in the euro and  sterling markets  The term funding spreads in the euro area are a bit narrower than                                                     1 Materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   December 6, 2007 3 of 51    those in the United States and the United Kingdom  This may reflect, in part, the  term funding operations of the European Central Bank  The ECB monetary policy  framework permits the ECB to provide a large amount of term funds to many  different depository institutions that are secured by a broad range of collateral  In  addition, little stigma appears to be associated with the use of the ECB’s standing  facility, in contrast to the United Kingdom and the United States, where stigma plays  a much more important role in limiting borrowing from such facilities      The upward pressure in term funding markets and the uncertainty about forward   LIBOR rates have caused impairment of the foreign exchange swap market—a  market used by many European banks to obtain dollar funding  In this market, bid- asked spreads have widened, transaction sizes have dropped, and some dealers have  stopped making markets  As noted earlier, some of the upward pressure on term  funding markets represents balance sheet adjustments for the year-end  Currently, the  cost of the two-day year-end turn is about 11 percent  As shown in exhibit 4, the  year-end premium has moved irregularly higher over the past six weeks to more than  600 basis points  As can be seen in exhibit 5, this is much greater than what typically  has occurred in other years  However, it is much less than what was evident in 1999,  when Y2K put significant upward pressure on implied forward rates over the year- end turn       Although term funding pressures have been partly influenced by the year-end, it is   important to recognize that these pressures are expected to persist as we move into  next year  Exhibit 6 illustrates the spread implied by market expectations going  forward  As can be seen, although the spread is expected to drop about 40 basis  points in January, the expected spread remains wider than in November and much  wider than the very narrow margin that was evident before the August market  turmoil  Some have wondered whether one-month and three-month LIBOR rates  exaggerate the degree of funding pressures  After all, LIBOR rates are “offered”  rates, and they represent the cost of funds at 1100 am in London  Perhaps they do  not reflect the true marginal costs of funding for banks that are perceived to be  healthy  There is something to this argument  The spread between one-month  LIBOR relative to one-month OIS rates is high relative to the spreads on other  sources of bank funding, such as certificate of deposits, term federal funds, and AA- rated commercial paper  These other spreads are shown in exhibit 7  But these other  spreads are also considerably higher than normal and have been moving up recently   This demonstrates that term funding pressures cannot just be dismissed as being  narrowly based on the dollar needs of European banks  Moreover, upward pressure  on term rates is evident more broadly  For example, as shown in exhibit 8, thirty-day  asset-backed commercial paper rates and the spread to OIS rates have been moving  up recently and are also very elevated      So what is driving the upward pressure that is evident in term funding markets?    As I see it, there are three factors  (1) the year-end, (2) balance sheet pressures, and  (3) worries about counterparty risk  I have already discussed the year-end effect  I  think it is very difficult to differentiate between balance sheet concerns and   December 6, 2007 4 of 51    counterparty risk  Balance sheet concerns might be characterized as, Do I want to  lend at term?  Counterparty risk might be characterized as, Do I want to lend at term  to you?  I have no doubt that balance sheet pressures are important  Bank balance  sheets are under pressure from two sides  On one side, capital is being eroded by  mark-to-market losses and higher loan-loss provisions, and there is the risk that more  such losses are ahead  On the other side, bank balance sheets are growing as banks  are limited in their capacity to securitize nonconforming mortgages or to sell off  leveraged loan commitments and as assets that formerly had been off balance sheet,  such as those in financial conduits and SIVs (structured investment vehicles), have  come back on board  The balance sheet pressure is most evident in the shift in the  composition of bank assets  Exhibit 9 shows the year-over-year growth rate in the  balance sheets of US commercial banks for commercial and industrial loans and for  other securities—that is, securities other than Treasuries and agencies  On a year- over-year basis, commercial and industrial loans outstanding are now growing at an  annual rate of nearly 20 percent, and other securities holdings are rising at an annual  rate of more than 30 percent  To make room for these assets and to restrain the pace  of aggregate balance sheet growth, banks have cut their holdings of Treasuries and  agencies  As shown in exhibit 10, these securities holdings have declined at an  annual rate of nearly 10 percent over the past year  Thank you  I would be happy to  take any questions      Yes, I am happy to address that, Mr Chairman  Absolutely  If we put   $20 billion in this way, we have to take $20 billion out  But this would change the composition   of the banking system’s balance sheet, and that’s how it is going to have its potential effect  We   cannot change the amount of reserves in the system if we want to keep the federal funds rate   December 6, 2007 18 of 51    anchored at the target  But we can change the composition of our balance sheet—and of the   banking system’s balance sheet by extension—and that may have some beneficial effect    If I could just interject on the OIS—the OIS is really the expected   federal funds rate  So I think that, if we explain it in those words rather than as the overnight   index swap rate, it will seem a little less mysterious to people      Yes  I just wrote a memo about stigma for the BIS  I guess I should   take it  Our understanding is that one reason that the ECB standing facility doesn’t have a stigma   is history  It doesn’t have the history that we had when the discount rate was below the target   federal funds rate, and so the discount rate was essentially administered, and you were not   supposed to use the discount rate on a frequent basis  Their standing facility doesn’t have any   such history, and therefore they seem to have avoided stigma  I think what that tells you, in part,   is that stigma is very stable  If you start with stigma, you are probably going to have persistent   stigma  And if you don’t start with stigma, you may be able to avoid stigma altogether    Presumably it’s around 1,000  "
8292,2007-12-11,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the exhibits  that you should have in front of you  Over the past few months, the outlook for  residential housing has continued to darken  Rising inventories and tightening credit  standards have led to outright declines in home prices in many major housing  markets  The deterioration in the subprime mortgage space continues  As shown in  exhibit 1, delinquency and foreclosure rates for subprime mortgages continue to rise  very quickly; and as before, the degree and the pace of deterioration are much worse  for more recent vintages (see exhibit 2)  But most important, the problems in  residential mortgages can no longer be thought of as a subprime or even an alt-A  mortgage problem  As shown in exhibit 3, delinquency and foreclosure rates on  prime mortgages have moved up sharply in recent months        The ongoing deterioration in the housing market has had a number of important   implications  The first important development is that highly rated collateralized debt  obligation (CDO) tranches—including so-called super-senior AAA-rated tranches— are now vulnerable  That is because these tranches typically are backstopped, in part,  by lower-rated subprime ABS tranches and other mortgage-related securities product   For highly rated CDO tranches to be protected against loss, it is important that the  average loss rate on the underlying collateral stays relatively low and that the  correlation in loss performance among the different assets that underpin the CDO  stays low  Unfortunately, for many of the CDOs issued in 2006 and 2007, these  conditions no longer apply  As housing has deteriorated, not only have expected loss  rates climbed, but the correlation among the assets within CDOs has also moved  sharply higher  This has occurred because a growing proportion of BBB-rated and  A-rated ABS tranches now appear likely to suffer losses  At a 10 percent average                                                     1 Materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   December 11, 2007 5 of 138    loss rate on subprime ARMs, many BBB- and A-rated tranches are likely to survive   There is a dispersion of loss rates—say between 5 percent and 15 percent—that helps  keep correlations low  But at a 15 percent loss rate, the same degree of dispersion  protects many fewer tranches than before  Instead, most of these tranches will  become impaired  As this occurs, the correlation rate will climb sharply  The net  result is that CDO tranches that were thought to be safe become highly vulnerable to  losses       Exhibits 4 and 5 illustrate the sensitivity of CDO performance to the mortgage   loan-loss rate  These exhibits summarize a study by UBS of a large number of CDOs  brought to market in 2006 and 2007  Exhibit 4 shows how sensitive the performance  of the CDO market is to changes in underlying mortgage loss rates  The base case  scenario assumes a relatively favorable loss experience  For example, in the base  case, losses for subprime mortgages are assumed to be about 11 percent for both 2006  and 2007 vintages  In this case, total loss estimates for mezzanine CDOs are around  20 percent and less than 5 percent for high-grade CDOs  In the base case, the losses  for the super-senior tranches are trivial  But when loss estimates increase 50 percent  above the base case, loss estimates on the CDO tranches climb much more sharply   For example, the average losses for the mezzanine CDOs triple, rising six times faster  than the rise in underlying loan losses, and expected losses on the super-senior  mezzanine CDO tranches soar  In this case, they are anticipated to lose about one- half of their value  Exhibit 5 focuses on how a relatively modest change in the loss  rate on the underlying mortgages leads to a sharp shift in the distribution of losses  In  the base case, the super-senior tranches of most CDOs are expected to suffer no  losses  However, at the higher loss rate on the underlying mortgages, about half the  super-senior tranches are expected to lose more than half their value       The CDO market is now fully implicated in the housing crisis  The rating   agencies are now downgrading many CDOs, and the magnitude of the downgrades is  often quite large  As a result, the value of many CDOs has fallen sharply  This has  led to (1) large write-downs at some major financial institutions and (2) questions  about the financial health of the financial guarantors that ensure some of the super- senior CDO tranches and that have other exposure to the residential mortgage market   Exhibit 6 illustrates the large movements in two of the major financial guarantors’  share prices and credit default swaps over the last few months  Moody’s recently  indicated that MBIA—generally perceived as one of the stronger players—is  “somewhat likely” to need to raise more capital to avoid a credit-rating downgrade   MBIA announced yesterday that they are raising $1 billion in equity capital from  Warburg Pincus     The total outstanding volume of asset-backed commercial paper has begun to   contract more rapidly again (see exhibit 7)  This contraction appears relatively broad- based—it is not just an SIV story  The Master Liquidity Enhancement Conduit  (MLEC) continues to move slowly forward, with the syndication process having just  started  But the MLEC is not likely to be very large  SIV assets have already shrunk  sharply, and some banks have already taken SIV assets back on their own balance   December 11, 2007 6 of 138    sheets  The difficulties of the SIVs have affected some money market investment  funds—with the State of Florida’s Local Government Investment Pool the most  notable casualty in this regard  Fortunately, most money market funds that have SIV  exposure are backed by strong parents that have been willing to lend support, at least  up till now       The second key development—the deterioration in the performance of the broader   mortgage market—has had its own set of effects on the financial sector  First, it has  led to significant loan-loss provision charges and mark-to-market losses for the two  major housing GSEs—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  The result has been a sharp  decline in their share prices and a substantial rise in the cost of credit default swaps  for these institutions (see exhibit 8)  Second, the mortgage insurers have also been  implicated, with even more substantial share price declines and increases in the cost  of credit default protection (see exhibit 9)  In addition, the big thrift institutions  remain under pressure  Yesterday, for example, Washington Mutual announced large  loan-loss provisions and other write-downs and slashed its common stock dividend   For commercial banks, the consequence of CDO write-downs and of rising mortgage  and other loan losses has been even more pressure on capital ratios and on balance  sheets  Also, corporate debt spreads have increased markedly over the past few  months (see exhibit 10)  The rise in high-yield debt spreads is important for banks  that still have significant leveraged-loan exposure that they hope to distribute to the  capital markets  The widening in spreads suggests a risk of further mark-to-market  charges for banks for these exposures       So is there any good news in any of this?  I would emphasize four aspects that   might provide some modest reassurance  First, market participants know a lot more  now than they did before  Thus, fear is diminishing, which implies less risk of a  crisis developing from this source  Second, although there remain considerable  uncertainties on many fronts—such as the magnitude of mortgage losses, the degree  of further tightening of credit availability, and the fate of some thrifts and mortgage  and financial guarantors, I believe we may have finally defined the broad dimensions  of the crisis  Most of those who are likely to be implicated may already have been  identified, with the CDO debacle the latest installment that has widened the circle of  participants  The issue now seems to be shifting toward severity from dimension   Third, the market is resolving some aspects of the crisis on its own  For example, the  level of SIV assets has shrunk sharply since August  Fourth, several major financial  institutions, in addition to MBIA and Washington Mutual, have raised capital from  disparate sources  Citigroup and UBS are raising funds from sovereign wealth funds   E*Trade raised funds from a major hedge fund  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have  raised capital through preferred stock issues  The willingness of opportunistic  investors to make such commitments may limit the balance sheet squeeze somewhat  and put a floor—albeit a low one—under asset prices      Let me turn next to market expectations about the path of short-term interest rates   at this meeting and beyond  Exhibit 11 shows expectations for the current meeting,  calculated from options prices on federal funds rate futures  As can be seen, the   December 11, 2007 7 of 138    probability of a 25 basis point cut has climbed to about 70 percent, and the probability  of no change in the target federal funds rate has fallen virtually to zero  As shown in  exhibits 12 and 13, expectations for subsequent rate cuts have increased considerably  since the October meeting, whether one looks at the yields implied from federal funds  futures contracts or from Eurodollar futures contracts  Looking out to the end of  2008, rate expectations have fallen more than 50 basis points since the October  FOMC meeting  The Eurodollar futures rate for December 2008 implies more than  100 basis points of additional easing  Our survey of primary dealers also shows a  sharp shift downward in rate expectations since the October FOMC meeting  As  shown by comparing exhibit 14 with exhibit 15, the average of the dealer modal  forecasts for the federal funds rate target in the first quarter—the green circles in the  exhibits—fell about 30 basis points, and the average of the dealer modal forecasts  does not differ meaningfully from market expectations at that time period       However, longer term, the primary dealers’ forecasts seem to anticipate less   easing than market participants  But this may reflect more the downward skew to rate  expectations that pulls the mean below the mode rather than a more fundamental  difference in expectations  As has been the case for several months, there is a very  wide dispersion of forecasts one year ahead, with the primary dealers’ modal  forecasts now ranging from 25 percent to 475 percent  Despite an expectation of  more-aggressive easing, inflation expectations appear to be well anchored  Exhibit  16 shows two measures that I discussed at the October FOMC meeting—the market- based Barclays measure of five-year, five-year forward inflation versus the Board  staff measure  As can be seen, although the gap between these two measures has  remained much wider than earlier in the year—presumably reflecting, in part, a climb  in the liquidity premium for on-the-run nominal Treasuries—both measures have  moved down a bit since the October FOMC meeting       Finally, a very brief discussion of the Desk’s open market operations is warranted    As seen in exhibit 17, which shows the cumulative effective federal funds rate since  the last meeting, we have managed to keep the federal funds rate close to the target on  average  But it hasn’t been easy  As you can see, the rate did trade a bit soft to the  target early in the intermeeting period  Also, we continue to see upward pressure on  the federal funds rate early in the day—reflecting a strong bid by European banks— and much greater intraday and day-to-day volatility than before August       There were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote to ratify the   operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the October 30-31  FOMC meeting  I also request a vote to ratify the swap agreement with the Swiss  National Bank that Chairman Bernanke discussed earlier  Of course, I am very happy  to take questions      Yes, I think that is correct  If you look at chart 10, which shows   corporate credit spreads, you have a widening of about 50 basis points in investment-grade   corporate spreads at a time that long-term—you know, ten-year—Treasury note yields have   come down by I think a little larger magnitude  In contrast, in the high-yield debt market, you   have a widening of spreads of 200 basis points just in the last month and a half or two months,   which is much more dramatic than any decline that we have seen in Treasury rates    Well, I guess I would say two things  I think you are absolutely right   that the sovereign wealth funds are of significant size and are growing rapidly  But I think that   you really have to distinguish between the equity side and the debt side of things  The   commitments that you are seeing from the sovereign wealth funds seem to be equity investments,   and they are equity investments that have occurred only after share prices fell very sharply  If   you look at debt spreads in the United States, debt spreads in Europe, and debt spreads   throughout the world, they have widened  So it doesn’t look as though the sovereign wealth fund   money is providing much help for that sector  It would be surprising if it were big enough, given   the constraints on bank balance sheets globally, that they could come in and fill the gaps  So I   December 11, 2007 10 of 138    think, on the equity side, the sovereign wealth funds are pretty important  They are providing   some floor on equity prices, but only after the equity prices of some of these financial firms have   gone down very significantly in value    Yes  It is a good development that we are actually finally seeing banks   raise capital  I don’t think you were seeing that until last month  I would say that there was   stigma associated with raising capital, and then things got progressively worse, so banks were   just forced to raise capital despite the stigma associated with it    We try for balance    The risk to the municipal market is really through the financial   guarantors, not so much the mortgage insurers  The fact that MBIA was able to raise $1 billion   of equity capital yesterday for, I think, about one-seventh of their book value—so it is a fairly   large capital commitment relative to the size of the company—is an important development    You saw that MBIA stock yesterday rose more than 10 percent because it basically was a   December 11, 2007 11 of 138    confirmation, at least in the minds of some people in the market, that MBIA was a viable   business and that someone was willing to put $1 billion of new capital in  I think that was   reassuring to the market  Generally, the people I have talked with suggest that the barriers to   entry into those businesses are pretty high  The second thing that is happening is, obviously, as   you see this distress, their pricing power on new business is actually improving  That would   suggest that there is a reasonable chance that these firms will be recapitalized, but it depends on   how far down the path they are toward serious problems  "
8313,2008-01-09,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the chart package  that I hope you have in front of you  Market function has improved somewhat since  the December FOMC meeting  This can be seen most notably in the term funding,  foreign-exchange swap, and asset-backed commercial paper markets  In addition,  some of the risks of contagion—for example, from troubled SIVs and from financial  guarantors to money market mutual funds or the municipal securities market—appear  to have lessened slightly  However, while market function has improved and  contagion risks have diminished somewhat, the underlying strains on financial  markets remain severe and may even have intensified  This can be seen in a number  of areas, including (1) the wide spread of jumbo mortgage rates relative to  conforming mortgages, (2) the equity prices and credit default swap spreads of a  broad  range of financial institutions, (3) developments in the commercial mortgage- backed securities market, and (4) corporate credit spreads and credit default swap  spreads  Put simply, market participants believe that the macroeconomic outlook has  deteriorated significantly and financial asset price movements broadly reflect that  shift in expectations       Turning first to the better news, term funding pressures have moderated   considerably over the past few weeks  As can be seen on the first page of the handout                                                    1 The materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   January 9, 2008 4 of 60    in exhibits 1, 2, and 3, term funding spreads have fallen sharply for dollar, euro and  sterling rates  For example, the one-month LIBOR–OIS spread is now 31 basis  points, down from a peak of more than 100 basis points in December  However, the  narrowing in three-month term spreads has been much more modest, and neither  spread is back to where it was in late October or early November  Much of the recent  improvement is undoubtedly due to the passage of year-end  But coordinated central  bank term funding actions, including the term auction facility (TAF) and the dollar  term funding auctions conducted by the ECB and the SNB, appear also to have been  helpful  The first two TAF auctions went well, with bid-to-cover ratios of around 3 to  1 and stop-out rates below the 475 percent primary credit rate  Interestingly, term  funding spreads narrowed notably on the two days when these auctions settled  This  supports the notion that the TAF auctions did contribute to a lessening of term  funding pressures  Moreover, market participants have generally reacted favorably to  the news that the TAF auctions would continue and that the size of the January  auctions would increase to $30 billion per auction  As hoped and anticipated, stigma  appears to have been less of a factor for the TAF compared with the primary credit  facility  The stop-out rate rose slightly in the second auction relative to the first, and  some less healthy institutions bid more aggressively in the second auction  This  suggests that, as depository institutions gain experience with the TAF, that might lead  to an even further diminution of stigma       As term funding markets have improved, the foreign exchange swap market has   also improved in terms of function  Bid-asked spreads have narrowed, and  transaction sizes have increased  The all-in cost of funding via foreign exchange  swaps has fallen back down to approximate the cost of straight dollar LIBOR  financing  Improvement in market tone is also visible in the interest rate swap  market  As can be seen in exhibit 4, swap spreads have fallen notably from the peaks  reached in the fourth quarter  Another positive development has been the  improvement in the asset-backed commercial paper market  The volume of ABCP  outstanding has stabilized, and the spread between the thirty-day ABCP rate and the  one-month OIS rate has narrowed sharply  The spread relative to one-month LIBOR  is about back to what it was before the financial market turbulence began in August  (exhibit 5)  Bank sponsors have generally stepped forward to take problem SIV  assets back on their balance sheets, and this has reduced the risk of asset fire sales   Also, the roll-up of SIV assets onto bank balance sheets has reduced the risk of  further contagion to the money market mutual fund industry  Finally on the positive  side of the ledger, although the financial guarantors remain under significant stress  (as shown in exhibits 6 and 7, there has been no recovery in the share prices or CDS  spreads for the two major financial guarantors—MBIA and Ambac), this has had only  a modest effect on the municipal securities market  Apparently, investors have  decided that the quality of the underlying municipal securities is quite good—the  historical default experience after all has been very low—and therefore have not been  that troubled by the decline in the quality of the insurance on these instruments  That  said, any actual downgrade of the financial guarantors’ credit ratings could still  disturb the municipal market, in part, through its potential impact on insured   January 9, 2008 5 of 60    municipal bond funds, which use the AAA ratings obtained from the insurance as a  selling point to retail investors     Despite these positive developments in terms of market function, financial   conditions have tightened as balance sheet pressures on commercial and investment  banks remain intense and as the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated  This can  be seen in a number of respects  First, large writedowns and larger loan-loss  provisions are cutting into bank and thrift capital and pushing down equity prices   For commercial and investment banks, the willingness of sovereign wealth funds and  other investors to replenish capital has kept bank CDS spreads from widening back to  the peaks reached a few months earlier  In contrast, major thrift institutions face  greater difficulties in attracting new capital because their core business has soured   As a result, their CDS spreads have soared  The spread between fixed-rate jumbo  mortgages and fixed-rate conforming mortgages has climbed again (see exhibit 8)   This reflects the impairment of the mortgage securitization market and the lack of  spare balance sheet capacity for commercial banks and thrift institutions       Second, corporate credit spreads and credit default indexes have widened sharply   in the past few months, with a significant rise registered since year-end  As shown in  exhibit 9, for investment-grade debt, the widening in spreads has roughly offset the  fall in Treasury yields  As a result, investment-grade corporate bond yields have been  relatively steady  In contrast, for non-investment-grade corporate debt, the widening  in credit spreads has dwarfed the decline in Treasury yields  As a result, non- investment-grade corporate debt yields have climbed sharply  Although actual  corporate default rates have remained unusually low, forecasts of prospective default  rates have become much more pessimistic  For example, Moody’s announced  yesterday that it had raised its speculative corporate debt default estimate for 2008 to  53 percent from 47 percent earlier  Exhibit 10 illustrates that, since mid-October,  credit default swap spreads have been rising in both the United States and Europe      Third, equity markets are under pressure  For example, as illustrated in   exhibit 11, the S&P 500 index declined in the fourth quarter and, up through  yesterday, has fallen about 5 percent so far this year  Moreover, the equity market  weakness has broadened out beyond the financial sector  For example, as of  yesterday’s close, the Nasdaq index, which has little weight in financials, had fallen 8  percent this year  Global stock market indexes have also generally weakened       Interestingly, the dollar has been relatively unaffected by the deterioration in the   macroeconomic outlook  After rallying into year-end, the dollar has given back much  of these gains over the past week  But over the past few months, the dollar has  mainly been range-bound as opposed to being in the downward channel that applied  for much of 2007 (exhibit 12 illustrates what the dollar has done lately against the yen  and the euro)       As the economic outlook has deteriorated, market participants’ expectations of   monetary policy easing have increased markedly  As shown in exhibit 13, the federal   January 9, 2008 6 of 60    funds rate futures market now anticipates about 100 basis points of additional easing  by midyear  As shown in exhibit 14, the Eurodollar futures market anticipates a bit  more than 125 basis points of further easing by year-end 2008  Currently, as shown  in exhibit 15, options prices on federal funds futures imply a probability of about  50 percent of a 50 basis point move through the January 29-30 FOMC meeting   Interestingly, market expectations for an intermeeting move appear to be relatively  low  Although it is difficult to be precise about this, my best guesstimate is that the  market has priced in about a 1-in-4 chance of a 25 basis point intermeeting rate cut   Although that means that a rate cut today would be a big surprise to market  participants, it probably would be well understood in hindsight  The sharp downward  skew in rate cut expectations that has been evident in recent months persists  As  shown in exhibit 16, which looks at the expected distribution of Eurodollar futures  rates 300 days ahead, the mode is 325 percent, well above the mean of the  distribution  This likely reflects market participants’ collective judgment that there  are two distinct scenarios  The first (and more likely) scenario is one of an economic  slowdown and a modest rise in the unemployment rate  This scenario is associated  with perhaps 100 basis points of additional easing  The second scenario is a much  darker one of a full-fledged recession  In this scenario, the unemployment rate would  move up more sharply, and the magnitude of cumulative rate reductions would be  much larger       Finally, despite the rise in headline consumer price inflation, the uptick in core   consumer price inflation, and the atmospherics created by firmer gold and oil prices,  market-based measures of inflation expectations remain very well behaved  As  shown in exhibit 17, both the Barclays market-based measure of five-year, five-year- forward breakeven inflation and the Board’s measure have narrowed since early  November  Thank you  Of course, I’m happy to take any questions now or after  David’s presentation          I think the important thing is that all three of these measures are moving   in the same direction  So I wouldn’t want to put a lot of weight on the level of these three   measures, which differ because they adjust differently for liquidity and on-the-run/off-the-run   comparisons, but they have all moved down pretty meaningfully since November    Well, as I have said in past briefings, I think the Board’s measure has a   better analytical foundation  If I had to pick one measure, I would probably pick the Board’s   measure because I think it is trying to do a more precise estimation of comparing apples with   apples in terms of comparing TIPS with nominal Treasury securities  This comparison is   difficult because you have to make assumptions about what the liquidity premium is on nominal   Treasuries that are on-the-run versus off-the-run and versus TIPS  So I think that it is probably   useful also to see if movements in the Board’s measure are or are not corroborated by   movements in other measures  "
8334,2008-01-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our videoconference on   January 9, the market functioning in terms of the bank term funding markets has  generally continued to improve, with the one-month and three-month LIBOR relative  to the overnight index swap rates coming back very sharply  They are now as narrow  as they’ve been since the market turmoil began  But elsewhere in terms of market  functioning, we started to see a step backward last week—especially late in the  week—when we viewed the asset-backed commercial paper market beginning to  deteriorate again, and there was some flight to quality into the Treasury bill market  late last week      More important, the macro outlook and broader financial market conditions   have continued to deteriorate quite sharply  The S&P 500 index, for example, fell  54 percent last week; it is down almost 10 percent so far this year  Today it fell  another 60 points, or 45 percent, so that means that the cumulative decline in the  S&P 500, if it opens near where the futures markets closed today, will be nearly  15 percent since the start of the year  Global stock markets were also down very  sharply today—Monday  Depending on where you look, the range of decline was  anywhere from 3 percent to 7½ percent, pretty much across the board  Corporate  credit spreads and credit default spreads have continued to widen, and bank mark-to- market losses and loan-loss provisions keep increasing  The Merrill Lynch and  Citigroup earnings announcements last week generally suggested a widening in terms  of the scope of losses, not just in subprime but also in terms of credit card receivables  and other loans       A newish wrinkle here in terms of bank markdowns reflects the deterioration of   some of the monoline guarantors  Merrill Lynch, for example, announced a  multibillion dollar charge for its exposure to ACA, which is the most impaired of the  monoline guarantors  The other monoline guarantors are in better shape, but they’ve  either been downgraded, such as the case of Ambac by Fitch on Friday afternoon, or  are under review for being downgraded by a number of different credit-rating   January 21, 2008 3 of 32    agencies  The problem with the monoline guarantors is that raising capital has  become much more difficult  Ten days ago, for example, MBIA issued 14 percent  surplus notes, which are now trading at about 70 cents on the dollar  It’s not clear  how much additional capital is needed to keep the AAA rating  The goal posts keep  moving  S&P, for example, raised its loss estimates on subprime mortgages about a  week and a half ago, and this has implications for the monoline insurers in terms of  their capital adequacy       So the bottom line is that, unless the monoline insurers raise significant additional   capital soon, further rating downgrades seem very, very likely  This has three  potential consequences that are noteworthy  First, in the money market space, a  number of money market products are wrapped by the monoline guarantors, including  variable-rate demand notes, auction-rate securities, and tender option bonds  Some of  these securities have liquidity support, so if the securities can’t be rolled over, they’ll  go to the banks, and this will increase the pressure on bank balance sheets  For those  without liquidity support, either they will be converted to longer-dated securities,  which the investors will be surprised to find out they are holding, or the dealers will  have to take them back on their books to prevent the auctions from failing  A second  consequence from monoline guarantor downgrades would be to the municipal bond  funds  The loss of AAA insurance raises the question of what the retail bond  investors do  Do they start pulling out their money and run?  So far things are pretty  calm on that front  For example, last week the net asset values of some of the major  muni bond insurance funds actually increased a bit for the week  So there are no  signs of a run there yet, but we haven’t really explored this fully, given the fact that  only one major monoline guarantor has been downgraded and that happened late, late  last week  Third, financial institutions have to mark down the value of the  guarantors’ insurance as their financial conditions worsen  In contrast, the monolines  don’t have to mark to market  Downgrading the monolines frontloads the hit to  capital and potentially aggravates the magnitude of the hit to capital because market  valuations can overshoot  So it is not trivial to transfer this risk from the monolines  to the financial institutions given the distinction that the monolines do not have to  mark to market but financial institutions that use their insurance do     At this point, monetary policy expectations have priced in a lot of easing over the   near term  As of Friday’s close, there were about 67 basis points priced in through  the January meeting at the end of the month and about 110 basis points priced in  through the March meeting (if you look at the April federal funds futures contract)   There is likely more than that now given the decline in the equity futures market that  we saw today  So the markets are expecting quite a bit from the Fed  I’ll be happy to  take any questions, of course      The monoline insurers don’t have to mark to market the consequences   of the deterioration in, say, the structured-finance product they insured  All they have to do is   pay out, as it is incurred, the interest that the structured-finance product can’t pay out  So their   losses are going to be realized only very gradually over a long period of time  There is no sort of   foreshortening of all that into the present  In contrast, if a monoline guarantor gets downgraded   and so the financial institution no longer has the support of that monoline guarantee, they have to   write down instantaneously the value of the assets that were wrapped by that guarantee  So it’s   quite a big difference in terms of the market impact as you transfer that risk from the monoline   guarantors to the financial institutions that bought that insurance    Well, the market on Monday morning in Asia was down somewhere   around 3, 4, or 5 percent, and it was everywhere, including some of the emerging markets that up   to now had performed pretty well  India took one of its biggest one-day hits, for example, in a   very long time  Then, we got to Europe, and the declines in Europe were actually a little bigger   than the declines that we saw in Asia  For example, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 Index, which is   an index of 50 large European companies, was down 7¼ percent on Monday  The market went   down sharply at the open, it rallied back up a bit during the day, and then it came sharply down   again at the close  So for both indexes you are basically at or very close to the low for the day    Bond markets reacted as you might expect  Bond markets rallied as people became more   pessimistic about the stock market  In the currency market, we saw the sort of normal risk-  January 21, 2008 5 of 32    aversion behavior  The euro underperformed, the dollar was in the middle, and the yen   appreciated as people were reducing their risk appetites     I talked to some people about what was going on in Europe  I didn’t really feel as though   my contacts there were focused exclusively on the financial guarantors  That was part of the   story, but there were other parts of the story, including the idea that maybe decoupling isn’t   going to happen to the degree that we hoped  Also, part of the story was that the risks of   recession in the United States were increasing  So financial guarantors got part of the blame for   the stock market decline in Asia and Europe, but that by no means was the whole story  "
8353,2008-01-29,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the handout that  you should have in front of you  Over the past month, term funding pressures for  banks have generally subsided  But the bigger story remains the continued pressure  on bank balance sheets, the tightening of credit availability, and the impact of this  tightening on the outlook for economic activity  The travails of the monoline  financial guarantors—some of which have already been downgraded by one or more  of the rating agencies—have exacerbated the worries about the potential for further  bank writedowns and have created risks that some financial instruments that rely on  monoline guarantees might no longer be viable  At this juncture, whether the major  monoline guarantors will receive the new capital needed to keep or restore their AAA  ratings remains uncertain       I’ll start today by noting that US and global equity and fixed-income markets   have behaved in a way consistent with a darker economic outlook  As shown in  exhibit 1, the major US indexes have fallen sharply since the December 11 FOMC  meeting  These declines in the stock markets have been mostly matched abroad, as  shown in exhibit 2  At the same time, corporate credit spreads have risen in tandem  with the equity markets’ decline  As shown in exhibit 3, high-yield corporate bond  spreads are up more than 100 basis points since the December FOMC meeting,  pulling the interest rates on high-yield debt significantly higher  Investment-grade  spreads have also widened  But for investment-grade debt, the decline in Treasury  yields has been larger than the rise in spreads, lowering somewhat the absolute level  of yields  Global credit default swap spreads have also increased sharply, as shown in                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   January 29–30, 2008 6 of 249    exhibit 4  Market price risk has increased  This is most visible in the rise of most  market measures of implied volatility  For example, the VIX, which measures  implied volatility on the S&P 500 index, recently climbed back to the peak level  reached in August (exhibit 5) and the MOVE index, which measures volatility in the  Treasury coupon market, has climbed to its highest level since 1998       The problems of the financial guarantors have been an important part of the story    In recent years, the major financial guarantors have diversified into insuring  structured-finance products, including collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)   Currently, their exposure to all structured-finance products is about $780 billion   Exhibit 6 shows the distribution of exposure across three buckets  US public  finance, US ABS and structured finance, and the total non-US exposure for the six  major monoline guarantors  Because the structured-finance guarantees have typically  been issued against the highest rated tranches at the very top of the capital structure,  until recently the rating agencies did not think that these guarantees would result in  meaningful losses  However, as the housing outlook has continued to deteriorate and  the rating agencies have increased their loss estimates on subprime and other types of  residential mortgage loan products, the risk of significant losses has increased  sharply  This is particularly the case with respect to these firms’ collateralized debt  obligation exposures—a portion of their total structured-finance exposure  As I  discussed in an earlier briefing, given the highly nonlinear payoffs built into these  products, modest changes in the loss assumptions on the underlying collateral can  lead to a sharp rise in expected losses on super senior AAA-rated collateralized debt  obligations  Unfortunately, the CDO exposures of several of these financial  guarantors are quite large relative to their claims-paying resources  As shown in  exhibit 7, statutory capital for even the biggest firm is less than $7 billion; the total  capital for the entire group is slightly more than $20 billion; and total claims-paying  resources for this group from all sources is about $50 billion  Exhibit 8 compares  these claims-paying resources with the subset of CDO exposures that contain some  subprime mortgage-related collateral  For four of the six major guarantors, these  CDO exposures represent more than 200 percent of their total claims-paying  resources  These exposures and the uncertainty about how these exposures will  actually translate into losses are the proximate cause for the collapse in the financial  guarantor share prices and the widening in their credit default swap spreads  This is  why new sources of capital have been either prohibitively expensive or dilutive or  both to existing shareholders        As I noted in last week’s briefing, credit rating downgrades of the financial   guarantors would likely lead to significant mark-to-market losses for those financial  institutions that had purchased protection  For example, in its fourth-quarter earnings  release, Merrill Lynch wrote down by $31 billion its valuation related to its hedges  with the financial guarantors; $26 billion of this reflected writedowns related to super  senior ABS CDO exposures  Unfortunately, there is not much transparency as to the  counterparty exposures of the guarantors on a firm-by-firm, asset-class-by-asset-class,  or security-by-security basis  However, major broker-dealers have considerable non- ABS CDO exposures to the financial guarantors  For example, they are thought to   January 29–30, 2008 7 of 249    have hedged an even larger amount of the super senior tranches of synthetic corporate  CDOs with the financial guarantors  This suggests the potential for significant  additional mark-to-market losses for commercial and investment bank counterparties  should the financial guarantor credit ratings get further downgraded  In addition,  such downgrades would increase market anxiety about counterparty risk because  there would be considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and incidence of the  prospective losses such downgrades might trigger  Financial institutions are also  exposed to the monoline guarantors via the wraps these guarantors have issued on  certain money market securities, including auction rate securities, tender option  bonds, and variable rate demand notes The amount of these securities outstanding is  significant  The total market size for these three types of securities is estimated to be  about $900 billion  The major risk here is that the loss of the AAA-rated guarantee  from the financial guarantor could undercut the demand for these securities  In the  case of tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, this could trigger the  liquidity backstops provided by major commercial banks and dealers, leading to  further demands on their balance sheets       In the case of the auction rate securities market, the dealers would be faced with a   difficult Hobson’s choice  They could either allow the auction to fail or take the  securities onto their books to prevent a failed auction  In the case of a failed auction,  the investor receives a higher interest rate but has to wait until the next auction to try  to redeem the securities  If failed auctions were to persist, as would be likely, then  the securities would essentially become long-term rather than short-term obligations   Failed auctions would undoubtedly distress clients that had purchased the securities  on the assumption that they would be liquid and could be redeemed easily  Failed  auctions would also likely lead to broader distress in the associated municipal and  student loan securities markets  We have already experienced a number of failed  auctions for auction rate securities  Moreover, the recent downgrades of Ambac and  FSA have led to significant market differentiation among tender option bonds and  some upward pressure on municipal bonds wrapped by weaker monoline financial  guarantors  If the monoline guarantors are unable to find additional equity or other  forms of support, these pressures are likely to intensify in coming weeks     The travails of the financial guarantors have added to the pressure on major   commercial and investment banks  As shown in exhibits 9 and 10, commercial and  investment bank equity prices and credit default swap spreads have generally  continued to widen  The cumulative writedowns reported for a selected group of  large banks has now reached $100 billion over the past two quarters (exhibit 11)   Coupled with balance sheet growth and other factors, such as acquisitions, these  writedowns have put significant downward pressure on bank capital ratios  For  example, although all of the top five US commercial banks can still be characterized  as “well capitalized,” there has been significant erosion of their capital ratios over the  past two quarters (exhibit 12)  This balance sheet pressure helps to explain why  commercial bank counterparties continue to complain about their access to credit, the  tightening in lending standards, and the wider spreads for assets such as jumbo   January 29–30, 2008 8 of 249    residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, and leveraged loans that can no longer  be readily securitized and distributed into the capital markets     Shifting now to what market participants expect from us from this meeting    Monetary policy expectations continue to shift in the direction of more cuts that are  delivered more quickly  As shown in exhibit 13, the federal funds rate futures market  currently implies that market participants now expect additional rate cuts totaling  about 100 basis points by midyear  Further out, as shown in exhibit 14, the  Eurodollar futures curves indicate that about another 25 basis points is anticipated  during the second half of the year  But these expectations are volatile and have been  shifting considerably day to day  The primary dealer survey tells a similar story  The  modal forecast of the primary dealers shows a federal funds rate trough slightly below  25 percent (exhibit 15)  Compared with the previous dealers’ survey conducted for  the December FOMC meeting (exhibit 16), the trough has moved down about 75  basis points  As of last Friday, seventeen of the twenty primary dealers expected a 50  basis point rate cut at this meeting  This sentiment appears to be generally shared by  market participants  As shown in exhibit 17, as of last Friday, options on federal  funds rate futures implied a rate cut at today’s meeting, with the highest probability  on a 50 basis point rate cut to 3 percent  However, it is important to recognize that  the probabilities shown in exhibit 17 put a zero weight on the notion of another  intermeeting cut in February—so they should not be taken literally as to the outcome  at today’s meeting  The distribution of yields on Eurodollar futures 300 days ahead  suggests that there has been a regime shift since the December FOMC meeting  As  shown in exhibit 18, not only have expectations shifted down sharply, but the skew  has reversed direction  The mode of the distribution is at 175 percent, and the skew  of the distribution around that mode is toward less extreme rate outcomes  This could  be viewed as market participants now pricing in considerable risk of a severe  recession but maintaining some hope that a milder downturn might occur or that a  recession could possibly be averted altogether       As shown in exhibit 19, the intermeeting rate cut was accompanied by a rise in   inflation compensation at the five-year to ten-year time horizon  However, it is  unclear that this represents a genuine deterioration in inflation expectations for  several reasons  First, the rise occurred, in part, because breakeven inflation at the  five-year horizon has fallen as nominal five-year Treasury yields have dropped  sharply  It is this decline that has lifted the five-year, five-year-forward measure  I  would agree with the memo by Board staff that was distributed to the FOMC  yesterday on this issue  The rise in five-year, five-year-forward inflation  compensation likely reflects a greater liquidity premium for nominal Treasuries  The  rise in interest rate volatility is also a factor  According to TIPS traders, the rise in  five-year, five-year-forward inflation reflects technical factors such as a temporary  increase in the demand for shorter-dated Treasuries, month-end index extension  flows, and a greater liquidity premium for nominal, on-the-run Treasuries  The  general rise in interest rate volatility is probably also a factor  Second, the rise in  five-year, five-year-forward expectations has not been accompanied by a broad set of  other signals consistent with deteriorating long-term inflation expectations  For   January 29–30, 2008 9 of 249    example, the four- to five-year-forward breakeven inflation measure shows a much  smaller rise, the dollar has been relatively stable, and estimates of bond term risk  premiums remain low  On the other side, gold prices have increased sharply in the  past week  Third, in our primary dealers’ survey, there was very little change in long- term inflation expectations  Finally, it is worth noting that following the 50 basis  point rate cut in September, which was more aggressive than expected, the five-year,  five-year-forward rate also rose, but the rise proved temporary       I would also like to briefly discuss the state of play in bank term funding   markets—some good news  As shown in exhibit 20, the spreads between the one- month LIBOR and the one-month OIS rate and the three-month LIBOR and the three- month OIS rate have fallen sharply since year-end  However, over the past week,  there has been considerable volatility in these spreads  This could be due to a variety  of factors—including a temporary increase in the demand by Societé Générale for  term funds and the sharp shift in expectations about the near-term federal funds rate  path  Currently, these spreads are close to the narrowest we have seen since the  market turmoil began last August  Although the passage of year-end was the  predominant factor behind the decline in term funding spreads, the term auction  facility (TAF) also appears to have been helpful  Exhibit 21 shows the results for the  first three US auctions  Completing the exhibit, the results for the fourth auction,  which was conducted yesterday, were minimum bid rate, 310 percent; stop-out rate,  312 percent; propositions, $375 billion; bid-to-cover ratio, 125; and number of  bidders, 52  In general, the pattern is one of declining bid-to-cover ratios and a  declining spread between the stop-out rate and the overnight index swap rate  The  results for the ECB and Swiss National Bank auctions show a similar pattern  At the  latest auction, the ECB had $124 billion of bids, a bid-to-cover ratio of 124, and  their number of bidders fell to 19 from 22 at the previous auction  The Board of  Governors has said that on February 1 it will announce plans for the TAF in February   The staff has recommended to the Chairman that the auctions continue on a biweekly  basis, that the size be maintained at $30 billion per auction, and that the minimum bid  size be cut to $5 million from $10 million to make it easier for smaller institutions to  participate       Finally, there was no foreign currency intervention activity during this period  I   request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the System Open Market Account  since the December 11 FOMC meeting  Of course, as always, I am happy to take any  questions      We have been very cautious about talking about the role of the foreign   banks, but they’re definitely a significant factor  The best way to look at it is just to look at the New   York District, which is taking an overwhelming share of not all but most of these auctions, and most   of that is foreign  Regarding the participation in terms of number of bidders, the split is more even   between domestic and foreign; in terms of the actual takedown of dollars, it does skew a bit to the   foreign side, but it has been variable  It is not the same in each auction    I don’t think we’re particularly sensitive, but I think other central banks   would be very sensitive    Those are a lot of questions  [Laughter]  Okay, I’ll take the easy one first    The TAF is completely sterilized  For every dollar that goes into the TAF we drain reserves, and   we’ve been doing that mainly by redeeming maturing Treasury bills  Regarding whether these are   additional funds to those entities, it is hard to know what they would have done if the TAF facilities   hadn’t been available  This may have funded some assets on their balance sheets that they   otherwise would have decided not to fund  I think it is very difficult to know what that   counterfactual is  It is hard to believe that in the system as a whole it led to a lot of additional   funding  I would be surprised by that, especially given that we did sterilize reserves and didn’t   allow expansion of the balance sheet  In terms of the issue of crowding out, the way I think about   the TAF is changing the composition of our balance sheet and changing the composition of the   banking system’s balance sheet  It’s not crowding out  We are basically supplying Treasury   securities by redeeming bills, and then the Treasury issues more bills that the markets want, and we   January 29–30, 2008 13 of 249    are essentially absorbing collateral from the marketplace that’s hard for them to finance elsewhere    So it is a change in the composition of the balance sheet  That’s how I would think of the way it   works   In terms of how we should evaluate the success, we don’t know how much was the year-  end  We don’t know how much was monetary policy easing  But market participants view the   TAF as very positive  I think that, if we were to discontinue it abruptly, they would be unhappy    There’s no evidence to suggest that the TAF has caused any great harm  It looks as though the   benefits, to my mind, are likely to significantly exceed the costs even though we can’t measure   those benefits very accurately  Regarding the foreign institutions issue—the choice between dollar   balances from us versus dollar balances from foreign central banks—I think it was a little more   complicated than that because, if I remember how we got to the foreign exchange swaps, they were   essentially more or less conditional on our doing the TAF  They were willing to do the swaps if   they could get the auctions in tandem with our term auction facilities  So my judgment would be   that we probably didn’t really have a choice of getting the dollars to those foreign banks through the   ECB if we hadn’t done the term auction facility    Did I miss any?    I wouldn’t say it’s about their willingness to lend to their institutions  It’s   their sense of what their responsibility is in terms of providing dollar liquidity to their institutions    January 29–30, 2008 14 of 249    To the extent that they could just passively take the dollars and funnel them through this auction   process in which their auction was very passive—their auction was essentially a noncompetitive   auction that was based off ours—they were willing to do that  They were less willing to do   something in which they were taking responsibility for the problem and saying that they were going   to get the dollars and supply them to those banks    Well, it’s difficult to say  If you look at credit default swaps, that would   say not  But as President Rosengren and I were talking before the meeting, those credit default   swaps may also contain different appetites to recapitalize banks when they get in trouble in the   United States versus abroad  So the one thing that we can probably say with confidence for the   period is that there’s more anxiety that things are hidden in certain foreign banks that are probably   not as likely to be hidden in US banks  There’s better disclosure in the United States on a faster   and more real-time basis  The market sense is that there isn’t really the same kind of quarterly   disclosure process abroad that happens for US institutions    Well, first of all, continuing that $30 billion is not supplying any additional   dollars, so we’re just going to be rolling over maturing auctions    Right  But, second, I would caution you that this last auction was right   before an FOMC meeting and that may have diminished the appetite  We don’t know with   certainty, but our supposition is that the demand would have been higher if the auction had been a   week later, if that’s how the schedule had fallen  Third, February might be fine, but March is a   quarter-end  Lastly, the fact is that, while the term funding pressures seem to be better, a lot of other   things seem to be worse, and clearly the pressure on bank balance sheets has not diminished at all    If anything, it has grown more intense  So to remove this prematurely would be a risk, especially   when market participants view this as helpful and it gives them a sense of confidence that the Fed is   there    I don’t remember any strong sense of that    What has happened, as the auction has proceeded, is that people have bid   more tightly around where they think it’s going to come, except for a few institutions who just say,   January 29–30, 2008 16 of 249    “I want the money,” and they bid at very high rates because it’s a single price auction  You usually   see some behavior like that    I haven’t had much contact with them  I don’t know if Tim has    Another thing that is not very well known is what their assets consist of    We have rating buckets, but we don’t know what those ratings actually apply to  We don’t know   who they have reinsurance with  Some people think that they’re reinsuring each other to an extent   or they have reinsurance with subsidiaries that they own so that the insurance is not at arm’s length    So there’s quite a bit of cloudiness about what their true condition is    Well, I think the presumption is very much that it went in the right   direction in terms of the Treasury market because basically the Treasury has auctioned off larger   weekly one-month, three-month, and six-month bills to replace those that we were redeeming  So   the floating public supply of bills went up  "
8385,2008-03-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial conditions have worsened   considerably in recent days  Credit spreads have widened, equity prices have  declined, and market functioning has deteriorated sharply  Although there are many  factors that can be cited to explain what we are seeing—including the acute weakness  in the US housing sector, a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, and the loss of  faith in credit ratings and structured-finance products—we may have entered a new,  dangerous phase of the crisis  Major financial intermediaries are pulling back more  sharply and along more margins than previously—shrinking their collateral lending  books and raising the haircuts they assess against repo collateral  For a time, this  adjustment was occurring in a relatively orderly way, but we appear to have passed  that point about ten days ago  The failure of Peloton—a major hedge fund—and the  well-publicized problems of Thornburg Mortgage and Carlyle Capital Corporation in  meeting margin calls have triggered a dangerous dynamic       That dynamic goes something like this  Asset price declines—say, triggered by   deterioration in the outlook—lead to margin calls  Some highly leveraged firms are  unable to meet these calls  Dealers respond by liquidating collateral  This puts  downward pressure on asset prices and increases price volatility  Dealers raise  haircuts further to compensate for the heightened volatility and the reduced liquidity  in the market  This, in turn, puts more pressure on other leveraged investors  A  vicious circle ensues of higher haircuts, fire sales, lower prices, higher volatility, and   March 10, 2008 4 of 39    still lower prices, and financial intermediaries start to break as a liquidity crisis  potentially leads to insolvency when assets are sold at fire sale prices     This dynamic poses significant risks  First, it impairs the monetary policy   transmission mechanism  We have seen that in recent weeks in the sharp widening  between mortgage rates on an option-adjusted basis and Treasury bond rates  Second,  as hinted at above, there is a systemic issue  If the vicious circle were to continue  unabated, the liquidity issues could become solvency issues, and major financial  intermediaries could conceivably fail  I don’t want to be alarmist, but even today we  saw double-digit stock price declines for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  There were  rumors today that Bear Stearns was having funding difficulties  At one point today,  its stock was down 14 percent before recovering a bit  Third, the problems in one  financial market disturb others  We have seen the problems move from subprime to  alt-A mortgages to jumbo prime mortgages and now even agency mortgage-backed  securities  Commercial-mortgage-backed security spreads and corporate credit  spreads have also widened, and we have seen considerable distortions in the  municipal market     The deterioration in market function can be seen in a number of ways  First, term   funding spreads have widened back out  For example, the one-month LIBOR–OIS  spread today is 56 basis points, up from its low point in 2008 of 16 basis points,  which was reached in January  Second, haircuts for residential MBS have increased  sharply, and if anything, the rate of deterioration in terms of haircuts has accelerated  markedly in the last week  Third, bid-asked spreads for transactions on many types of  financial instruments have widened, indicating a growing liquidity problem in the  market     To address these issues, the Federal Reserve has responded by increasing the size   of the TAF program and by implementing a large, term, single-tranche RP program   Together, these two programs will likely cumulate to total outstandings of about  $200 billion  In addition, as the Chairman mentioned, the ECB and the SNB today  have submitted requests to increase their foreign exchange swap draws and restart  their term funding auctions  But there are limits to what these programs can do  The  TAF provides liquidity only to depository institutions—this liquidity is not  necessarily passed on readily to primary dealers and to other financial institutions   Although term RPs do provide some assistance to primary dealers, these operations  are limited to the highest quality collateral—Treasuries, agencies, and agency  mortgage-backed securities  Moreover, as both programs are scaled up, there is a  large impact on reserves that must be offset by Treasury redemptions, sales, or  reverse repurchase operations  Frankly, there are limits to our ability to adjust our  portfolio quickly without our actions becoming a source of disruption to financial  markets       For this reason, the staff has proposed a new facility, the term securities lending   facility, or TSLF  A memo from the New York Fed staff and a term sheet were  circulated to the FOMC earlier today, and these documents discuss in some detail this   March 10, 2008 5 of 39    proposal  Let me give a summary of what I see as the most important points  In  brief, this facility would expand the Federal Reserve’s securities lending program for  primary dealers by lending securities secured for a term of 28 days, rather than  overnight, by a pledge of other securities—Treasuries, agencies, agency mortgage- backed securities, or AAA-rated private-label mortgage-backed securities  The last  category is not currently eligible for open market operations (OMO)  Currently, our  securities lending program is overnight and exchanges only Treasuries for Treasuries   The purpose of this facility is to help alleviate the rapidly escalating pressures evident  in term collateral funding markets      So how would this facility help to accomplish this?  By providing the ability to   swap illiquid mortgage-backed collateral for Treasury securities, the program would  reduce the uncertainty among dealers about their ability to finance such collateral   The expanded supply of Treasuries obtained in the collateral swaps would improve  the ability of primary dealers to finance the positions on their balance sheets  This  should, in turn, increase the willingness of dealers to make markets across a range of  securities  Better market-making, in turn, should lead to greater liquidity for these  securities  This, then, should reduce price volatility and obviate the need for dealers  to assess higher haircuts against such securities  The liquidity option provided by the  TSLF should reduce liquidity risk more generally  The program should help slow, or  even reverse, the dynamic process of reduced liquidity, greater price volatility, higher  haircuts, margin calls, and forced liquidation       Why does the staff recommend that the scope of collateral be broader than OMO-  eligible collateral?  The staff believes that a program based only on OMO collateral  could help improve liquidity in those markets  An improvement in liquidity in these  core markets could help other related markets  Despite this, the staff recommends  that the TSLF go one step further and also accept AAA-rated private-label residential- mortgage-backed securities in this program  The staff believes that it is important to  take this additional step because the level of dysfunction in the non-agency mortgage- backed securities market is pronounced, this market is large, and steps to improve  market function in this asset class are likely to have positive consequences for the  availability and the cost of mortgage finance  In other words, improvement in this  area would make monetary policy more effective and would likely generate  significant macroeconomic benefits     To limit the credit risk exposure of the Federal Reserve, the facility for non-  OMO-eligible collateral would be limited to AAA-rated residential-mortgage-backed  securities assets not on review for downgrade  In addition, the securities would be  repriced daily, and appropriate haircuts would be applied against such securities   Why not go further?  Although the SOMA lending facility could be extended to  include other asset classes such as commercial-mortgage-backed securities,  corporates, and municipals, the staff recommends against such a broader extension  for two reasons  First, these markets are not under the same degree of duress as the  residential-mortgage-backed securities market  Second, adding additional asset   March 10, 2008 6 of 39    classes would increase the operational complexity and risk of the program—for  example, by requiring additional auction cycles     What are the risks of such a program?  We think there are several risks that are   particularly noteworthy  First, we cannot be sure that the program will have its  intended impact  Experience with the TAF suggests that it will, but there is no  guarantee of this  Second, the TSLF could increase moral hazard  If the program is  successful in preventing losses that would have arisen from an inability to obtain  funding, the TSLF would be a form of insurance that could conceivably induce  broker–dealers to run smaller liquidity cushions during normal times  Third, Federal  Reserve credit risk would increase as the SOMA portfolio accepted lower-quality  collateral from primary dealers       On the first point—Will it work?—the TSLF would be quite large, perhaps   cumulating to $200 billion, the same size as the TAF and the term RP program  combined  We can make it even bigger if we desire  So we think we have the muscle  here to have an impact on term funding markets  On the second point—the moral  hazard issue—the staff believes that the TSLF will increase moral hazard somewhat   Ideally, this type of program would also be accompanied by prudential regulation to  ensure that primary dealers hold adequate liquidity buffers across the typical business  cycle  On the third point—the issue of credit risk to the Federal Reserve—we  conclude that there will inevitably be some increase in credit risk  But this risk  should be controllable  We know our counterparties, we are not accepting securities  that are on watch for downgrades, and the non-agency MBS securities will be AAA- rated  Moreover, we plan to limit the exposure to the more robust AAA-rated MBS  by not accepting private-label MBS with CDO-type structures and characteristics   And if securities are put on watch, we can demand substitution       Fully cognizant of these risks and others—which are outlined in more detail in the   memorandum circulated to the FOMC earlier today—we conclude that the benefits  are likely to significantly exceed the costs of the program  The staff believes it is  important to take those steps necessary to restore the monetary policy transmission  mechanism to working order and to short-circuit the vicious dynamic now evident in  financial markets  Debby Perelmuter will now describe the TSLF program in more  detail, focusing on how it will operate in practice, now that I’ve outlined the theory   Debby        You asked a question about broadening it potentially to other asset   classes  I don’t think there is any presumption  That is certainly not our intention, but obviously   we have to be responsive to the way things evolve  We are certainly not intending to do that, but   I can’t say categorically that we would want to rule it out    Well, the first thing I would say, President Fisher, is that we are doing   this collateral swap for a fee and for one that is higher than the normal fee in normal markets  So   in no way is it free  In terms of the prudential regulation, I think there will be a lot of lessons   learned from this crisis that will be addressed in the fullness of time, and this is one lesson that   we are going to have to remember when we look at what we have learned from this experience    That is the working assumption for the time being  We are going to   have conversations with our primary dealers, and that is where we are going to really fine-tune   March 10, 2008 11 of 39    what the appropriate haircut is  But I think the general operating principle here is to have   haircuts that are considerably higher than the market during normal times but lower than the   market during times of crisis, which we would argue that we are in or are close to being in right   now    For AAA collateral, I think it is actually lower than that  I think it is   3 percent, so we would expect that the haircut should be higher because we are dealing with   primary dealers rather than depository institutions as our counterparties  So we certainly accept   the fact that there should be higher haircuts    We have the right to limit our exposure to primary dealers that we have   less confidence in  In fact, that is what we would actually do in the implementation of this kind   of program    My understanding is that we are going to take only securities for which   market prices exist      I think you answered the question very well    I think the answer to that question is that we are going to make a   determination but we don’t have the same level of knowledge about the institution because we   are not the primary consolidated supervisor    We are proposing the rough size of the facility today  As we gain   experience with the facility and examine market conditions, we will be keeping the FOMC   apprised of the programs and certainly seeking the input of the Committee on how to take this   going forward  I hope that we will get a lot of feedback as we go through this auction process    If the bidding is very strong and if the markets are under tremendous distress, then we would   probably want to increase the size of the program  Conversely, if the bidding is weak and if the   markets settle down, then we would want to wrap up this program pretty quickly    Well, the first thing is that almost all of these primary dealers have the   SEC as their primary consolidated supervisor  So it is important to understand that it is not as   though there isn’t an entity looking at the financial strength and stability of these institutions    We have the right not to accept collateral from any of the primary dealers, should we decide to   do that  It is not going to be public  We are not going to be making a statement  This is just   going to be a bilateral arrangement between us and the given primary dealer    However, if we did improve market function, we would be helping that   dealer   March 10, 2008 19 of 39   "
8403,2008-03-18,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  To start, I just want to update people  on what happened overnight in markets  Equities rebounded a bit in both Asia and  Europe, and bond yields reversed some of the decline that they saw on Monday  The  dollar was slightly weaker against the yen and the euro but still in the range that it  established  It did not go back below the lows that it reached early on Monday  I would  say that generally the markets’ function was okay  The big issue was bank funding  pressures in Europe were evident for dollar funding  The funds rate bid as high as  3¾ percent, which is quite surprising on the eve of a meeting in which we are likely to  reduce the federal funds rate target  Term funding pressures, if you look at the one- month or three-month LIBOR–OIS spread, are basically unchanged from Monday,  when they were up quite sharply from last Friday       Before talking about what markets have been doing over the six weeks since the last   FOMC meeting, I’m going to talk a bit about the Bear Stearns situation  In my view, an  old-fashioned bank run is what really led to Bear Stearns’s demise  But in this case it  wasn’t depositors lining up to make withdrawals; it was customers moving their  business elsewhere and investors’ unwillingness to roll over their collateralized loans  to Bear  The rapidity of the Bear Stearns collapse has had significant contagion  effects to the other major US broker–dealers for two reasons  First, these firms also  are dependent on the repo market to finance a significant portion of their balance                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   March 18, 2008 3 of 127    sheets  Second, the $2 per share purchase price for Bear Stearns was a shock given  the firm’s $70 per share price a week earlier and its stated book value of $84 per  share at the end of the last fiscal year  The disparity between book value and the  purchase price caused investors to question the accuracy of investment banks’  financial statements more generally       The contrast in the behavior of investment bank equity prices versus credit default   swap (CDS) spreads is revealing  Share prices fell sharply, but the CDS spreads  narrowed a bit, indicating a lower risk of default  For example, Lehman’s stock price  fell 19 percent, but its CDS narrowed by 20 basis points, to 450 basis points,  yesterday  This underscores the difference between the $2 per share buyout price for  Bear Stearns—less value than people thought—and the introduction of the Primary  Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)—a reduction in the risk that a liquidity problem could  drive a firm into insolvency      I have a few words about the PDCF, before moving to a discussion of market   developments since the January FOMC meeting  The PDCF should help to restore  confidence among repo investors  It essentially creates a tri-party repo customer of  last resort—us  When investors have concerns about the ability of a dealer to fund  itself, they are reluctant to roll over their own repo transactions  The reason is the  fear that the clearing bank may not send their cash back the next morning when the  overnight repos mature  This fear may not be misplaced  If the clearing bank is  worried about whether investors will stay put, the clearing bank may decide to keep  the cash  In that case, the investors would be stuck with the securities that  collateralize the repo transactions  The PDCF should break that chain of worry by  reassuring the clearing bank that the Fed will be there as a lender to fund the repo  transactions  The repo investors are reassured that the clearing bank will send back  their cash the next day and thus are willing to roll over their repo transactions  At  least that’s the theory  As noted, the PDCF should provide some comfort to the  counterparties of these firms that these firms will, in fact, be able to fund their  obligations  Yesterday, the major money market mutual fund complexes did roll their  outstanding repos with the major investment banks  However, the jury is still out on  whether the PDCF will be sufficient to stabilize confidence       High use of the PDCF would result in a large increase in the amount of reserves   added to the banking system  I think it is important to go on record on that because, if  that were to occur, over the short run the New York Desk might not be able to drain  reserves sufficiently quickly to keep the federal funds rate from trading extremely soft  to the target  We will make all efforts to make the “short run” as short as possible   But realistically, there is a good chance that the federal funds rate could trade soft  relative to the target, especially through the end of the current reserve maintenance  period  In fact, yesterday we saw that, although it started the day quite firm, the funds  rate crashed at the end of the day, and the effective fed funds rate for the day was 269  percent  It depends, in large part, on the volume of use of the PDCF      March 18, 2008 4 of 127    Stepping back from developments of the past few days, recent weeks have been  marked by rapid and, at times, disorderly deleveraging of financial holdings within  the global financial system  As I discussed last week, the most pernicious part of this  unwinding has been the dynamic of higher haircuts, missed margin calls, forced  selling, lower prices, higher volatility, and still higher haircuts, with this dynamic  particularly evident in the mortgage-backed securities market       I’ll be referring to the handout from here  Over the past six weeks, we have   surveyed a number of hedge funds and one REIT about the haircuts they face for  financing different types of collateral  As shown in exhibit 1, the rise in haircuts has  been most pronounced in non-agency mortgage-backed securities  But even agency  MBS have seen a significant widening of haircuts in recent weeks  The collateral  funding pressures have been particularly evident for residential-mortgage-backed  securities collateral  This is due to several factors including very unfavorable  fundamentals for housing, a high level of uncertainty about the ultimate level of  losses, and an overhang of product for sale, both currently and prospectively  In our  discussions with market participants, unleveraged players have been unwilling to step  in to buy “cheap” assets for several reasons  First, there are few signs that housing is  close to a bottom  Second, a significant amount of product sits in weak hands and,  thus, could be dumped on the market  Third, this particular asset class has  characteristics that exacerbate price volatility and, therefore, risk  For example, when  spreads widen and yields climb, prepayment speeds slow  This extends duration   When the yield curve is upward sloping for longer maturities, the rise in duration  generates an increase in yields  The rise in yields also reduces housing affordability,  which puts further downward pressure on home prices, increasing prospective losses  on the mortgage loans that underpin the securities     Signs of distress in this market include the following  First, a sharp widening in   option-adjusted mortgage spreads—as shown in exhibit 2, option-adjusted spreads for  conforming fixed-rate mortgages have widened considerably since the January 30-31  FOMC meeting, though they have come in quite a bit over the past couple of days   That’s good news  Second, jumbo mortgage spreads relative to conforming  mortgages rates remain very wide  As shown in exhibit 3, this spread has averaged  more than 100 basis points this year  The current yield on prime jumbo loans is  around 7 percent, a margin of about 3½ percentage points over ten-year Treasury note  yields  Third, mortgage securities prices continue to fall  For example, as shown in  exhibit 4, the prices for AAA-rated tranches of the ABX 07-01 vintage continue to  decline  Fourth, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported large fourth-quarter losses,  and their stock prices and CDS spreads have performed accordingly (exhibit 5)  The  sharp decline in the equity prices has made the companies reluctant to raise new  capital, despite the prospects of higher-margin new business, because additional share  issuance at the current share prices would lead to massive dilution for existing  shareholders  Fifth, the yield levels on many mortgage-backed securities have  climbed significantly above the yield on the underlying mortgages that underpin the  securities  This is the opposite of how securitization is supposed to work  This   March 18, 2008 5 of 127    phenomenon reflects the glut of supply of such securities on the market and the added  risk premium attached to assets that are typically held on a mark-to-market basis     Although the residential mortgage market is the epicenter of the crisis, distress   has been evident much more broadly—with the municipal market fully implicated in  the period since the January meeting  The deleveraging process evident among  financial intermediaries operating outside the commercial banking system has led to a  widespread repricing of financial assets  When available leverage drops, risk- adjusted spreads have to rise for leveraged investors to earn the same targeted rate of  return as before  This helps explain why the problems in the residential mortgage  market have infected financial markets more generally, leading to wider credit  spreads (exhibits 6 and 7) and lower equity prices (exhibit 8) both in the United States  and abroad  As leverage is reduced and spreads widen, financial arbitrage implies  that all assets should reprice  The risk-adjusted returns from holding different asset  types should converge—recognizing that the degree of leverage that is available in  markets may differ across asset classes in accordance with divergences in price  volatility, liquidity, transparency, and other characteristics       Of course, the notion of convergence to equivalent risk-adjusted returns is an   equilibrium concept, and we are not in equilibrium  The events of the past week  underscore that point  But there are plenty of other examples of disequilibrium at  work  For example, for mortgage-backed securities, the losses implied by the prices  of the AAA-rated ABX index tranches appear to be high even relative to the darkest  macroeconomic scenarios  The municipal bond market is also a good example of  how market valuations can become unusually depressed when supply increases  rapidly  Then the value inherent in the securities becomes broadly known, this  mobilizes new money, and risk-adjusted returns come back down relatively quickly   Term funding spreads also indicate greater stress within the financial system  As  shown in exhibits 9 and 10, the spreads between one-month and three-month LIBOR–  OIS spreads have widened sharply in recent weeks, even before Bear Stearns’s  demise  We are sitting today at 56 basis points for the one-month LIBOR–OIS  spread and 77 basis points for the three-month LIBOR–OIS spread, about the same as  yesterday morning       As you are all aware, we have been active in responding to the growing market   illiquidity  Exhibit 11 illustrates the results of the TAF auctions  Note how  propositions and the number of bidders have increased recently and the spread  between the stop-out rate and the OIS rate has risen over the past few weeks  Even  before the Primary Dealer Credit Facility was implemented this weekend, we were in  the middle of a historic transformation in the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheet   We are increasing the supply of Treasuries held by the public (either outright or  borrowed) and reducing the supply of more-illiquid collateral held by the private  sector  Even excluding the uncertain impact of PDCF borrowing, this shift will speed  up noticeably over the next month or two  Our current plans are to increase the size  of the TAF to $100 billion, scale up the single-tranche RP book to $100 billion,  renew and increase the size of the foreign currency swaps with the ECB and the SNB   March 18, 2008 6 of 127    to $36 billion outstanding (if fully subscribed), and implement a $200 billion TSLF  program  Exhibit 12 shows how these programs are likely to change the composition  of the Federal Reserve’s SOMA portfolio  As can be seen, when all the current  programs are fully phased in by May, Treasury holdings will have shrunk to about  45 percent of the total portfolio, down from about 97 percent last July       At the same time that financial markets have been under severe stress and the   macroeconomic growth outlook has deteriorated, the inflation news has also been  disturbing  Several market-based indicators are adding to investors’ concerns about  the inflation outlook  First, commodity prices have increased sharply  As shown in  exhibit 13, the increases have been concentrated in both energy and agricultural  prices  Of course, subsidies to stimulate the production of ethanol from corn have  been an important factor  By diverting corn production to this purpose, the linkage  between energy and grain prices has been significantly strengthened  Second, the  dollar, after a period of stability that lasted from mid-December into February, has  begun to weaken anew (exhibit 14)  This has gotten considerable attention in the  press and abroad as the dollar has hit new lows against the euro and has fallen below  100 against the yen  Up to now, the decline has generally been orderly, and the  downward slope of the broad real trade-weighted dollar trajectory shown in exhibit 14  has not changed much       The foreign exchange markets are clearly very skittish  In particular, there has   been considerable focus on China and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries  and their willingness to maintain their pegs against the dollar  For China, investors  expect its crawling peg to move faster  As shown in exhibit 15, the Chinese yuan is  now expected to appreciate about 11 percent against the dollar over the next year, up  from an 8 percent pace at the beginning of the year  For the GCC countries, there is  speculation that some of these countries might decouple from the dollar  However,  on a one-year-forward basis, market participants are currently building in only a  couple of percentage points of expected appreciation     Breakeven rates of inflation have continued to widen  As shown in exhibit 16,   both the Board staff’s and the Barclays measures have broken out above the ranges  evident in recent years  It is difficult to differentiate how much this widening reflects  a higher risk premium due to greater uncertainty about the inflation outlook versus  higher expected inflation  But either way, it is probably fair to say that inflation  expectations have become less well anchored over the intermeeting period  I will say,  however, that yesterday breakeven rates of inflation came down very sharply—the  move was 15 to 20 basis points  Today, we are back in the range we were in, but that  is only today  Short-term rate expectations continue to move lower  As shown in  exhibit 17, federal funds rate futures now anticipate a trough in yields a bit below  15 percent  The yields implied by Eurodollar futures prices have also shifted sharply  lower, as shown in exhibit 18  The trough in yields is expected to be reached in late  summer or early fall        March 18, 2008 7 of 127    Our formal survey of primary dealers, which we normally show you, was  conducted more than a week ago, and it is clearly out of date (these exhibits are  included in the appendix to the handout)  So let me focus on what the dealers’  expectations were as of yesterday  They changed quite a bit over the past week   Most dealers expect either a cut of 75 or 100 basis points  There are eight for 100  basis points, ten for 75 basis points, and two for 50 basis points  This compares with  the slightly more than 100 basis points built into the April federal funds rate contract  (yesterday the April fed funds contract implied a 195 percent effective fed funds rate  for the month)     There were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote to ratify the   operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the January 30-31  FOMC meeting  Of course, I am very happy to take questions      She is doing well, thanks    I don’t have a number    We have given it some thought, but the press of other business, frankly,   has overwhelmed us in the very short run  But I think it is a good point  I would say two things   about the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and our ability to keep the funds rate at the target  One, if   this works the way we hope it works, there are not going to be many people showing up at the   Primary Dealer Credit Facility  We hope, over time, none—because if we reassure the repo   investors that they can roll their repo, we think that will dominate coming to the Primary Dealer   Credit Facility  So if this works out the way we imagine it could work, the Primary Dealer Credit   Facility use will be very nominal, so we won’t have this issue  The second thing I would say is that,   if people do come to the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and that leads to softness in the federal   funds rate, by definition it will make the Primary Dealer Credit Facility less attractive because,   March 18, 2008 9 of 127    remember, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility cost is tied to the target federal funds rate not to where   the federal funds rate actually trades in the market  So that also will obviate some of that issue  But   look, we haven’t done this before  We have now had one day of experience  We’re going to have   to work on the issues that you raised, and we’re going to have to see how it goes, frankly    I don’t think there has really been a shift  There’s no meaningful shift    It’s high  It will be interesting now with the reintroduction of the swap    You know, the ECB will essentially have a noncompetitive auction with us on this coming Monday    It will be interesting to see how that affects the TAF auction results    I think there was a day that that might have happened, but I don’t really   know the answer to that  I’m not sure what that really means    If that were to happen, I’m not sure what I would make of it  That would   probably reflect more what’s going on between different countries in Europe than to have anything   really to do with us versus Germany  That’s how I would interpret it    Yes, we have certainly gotten questions about how this will be   disclosed  Now, there will be a disclosure  There will be a line item in the H41 release, but it   will just show the total dollar amounts extended through this facility  It is all bid through the   New York District, so the total primary dealer borrowing will be shown in that release  The   stigma issue is a legitimate issue, and that is why we have to be very careful about how we talk   about this and take tremendous care not to disclose who or even what type of institution uses it    But at the end of the day, if you can’t fund your repo and your only choice is to come to the   PDCF, that is probably what you are going to do   Now, to come back to Vice Chairman Geithner’s point, I think that is exactly right,   though  The fact that to the extent that there is stigma, they are not going to want to come, and   that is going to reinforce the deleveraging process that is clearly under way, as is the fact that   they just saw Bear Stearns go from a troubled but viable firm to a nonviable firm in three days    The lesson from that for a lot of firms is going to be, oh, I need more liquidity, I need to be less   leveraged, and that lesson, from what happened to Bear Stearns, isn’t going to go away    I just want to update the dealer survey  We got two more responses  Two   people moved from 75 to 100  So right now as we speak, it is ten in the 100 camp, eight in the   75 camp, and two in the 50 camp    I think that the April fed funds futures contract earlier this morning was   priced at 199, and it was up by 4 basis points  I don’t know if it moved subsequently    Stocks are up about 2 percent  Both Lehman’s and Goldman’s earnings   showed declines, but they were less significant than expected  So share prices for both of them have   March 18, 2008 83 of 127    rallied a lot  Lehman’s stock was up 19 percent when I last looked—I don’t know where it is today    So a lot of reversals occurred yesterday in terms of the investment banks    Adding just the word “slightly”—“risen slightly”—gets to your point  "
8427,2008-04-29,"1  Certainly  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The financial market  environment has improved markedly since mid-March  However, concern about the  circumstances that led to the demise of Bear Stearns may have provided added  impetus to the ongoing deleveraging process  The result has been improvement in the  broader equity and fixed-income markets but heightened term funding pressure within  the financial system       Turning first to the broader markets, improvement is evident across most broad   asset classes both in the United States and abroad  As shown in exhibit 1 of the  handout in front of you, the broad US equity indexes have recovered much of their  earlier losses  Although the financial sector still lags behind, financial share prices  have, in the aggregate, recovered more than 10 percent off their mid-March trough   Credit markets have also improved  As shown in exhibit 2, corporate credit spreads  in both the investment-grade and the high-yield sectors have narrowed somewhat   Moreover, global credit default swap spreads—as shown in exhibit 3—have fallen  significantly  As shown in exhibit 4, measures of implied volatility in the Treasury,  equity, and foreign exchange markets have declined       Signs of a recovery in risk appetite can be seen very clearly in the subprime   mortgage-backed securities market and the municipal securities market, both which                                                    1 The materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   April 29–30, 2008 4 of 266    had earlier experienced significant distress  Exhibit 5 shows the price performance of  the AAA-rated tranches of the last four ABX subprime vintages  As can be seen, the  AAA-rated tranches have recovered even though housing activity and home prices  have continued to decline at least as fast as anticipated  In the municipal market,  crossover buyers have entered, attracted by municipal bond yields that exceed those  available on Treasuries of comparable maturities  As seen in exhibit 6, although the  ratios of tax-exempt to Treasury yields of comparable maturities remain elevated,  there has been considerable improvement during the past two months  This  improvement has occurred even though the outlook for the monoline financial  guarantors remains poor  Ambac’s announcement last week of a $17 billion loss in  the first quarter made—thus far—barely a ripple in the broader market         The introduction of the primary dealer credit facility (PDCF) seems to have   helped to stabilize the repo markets  That improvement, in turn, has caused the  equity prices of the four remaining large investment banks to recover somewhat and  their credit default swap spreads to fall sharply (exhibits 7 and 8)  The PDCF  backstop facility also appears to have helped break the negative dynamic of higher  haircuts, forced asset sales, lower prices, higher volatility, and still higher haircuts  that was in place in the weeks leading up to the Bear Stearns liquidity crisis   Although the collateral haircuts set by the major dealers for their hedge fund clients in  our April 9 survey—shown in exhibit 9—are considerably higher than in the previous  month, our contacts indicate that this rise occurred mostly around the time of Bear  Stearns’s demise  Over the past few weeks, haircuts have stabilized       Despite the improvement in the broad market indexes and in the equity prices and   credit default swap spreads of most major financial firms, term funding pressures  have intensified rather than subsided  As shown in exhibits 10 and 11, the pressures  have been evident at both the one-month and the three-month tenures in the United  States, the euro area, and the United Kingdom  The additional deleveraging by the  investment banks following the demise of Bear Stearns may have intensified the  pressure on commercial bank balance sheets or the urge for banks to delever      The LIBOR indexes took a jump upward following a Wall Street Journal article   that alleged that some of the 16 LIBOR panelists were understating the rates at which  they could obtain funding  The British Bankers Association reacted by threatening to  throw out any panelist that was not wholly honest in its daily posting of its costs of  obtaining funds at different maturity horizons  The BBA announcement appears to  have provoked an outbreak of veracity among at least some of the panelists  As  shown in exhibit 12, the LIBOR fixing rose nearly 20 basis points in the few days  immediately after the article  The dispersion in offered rates between the highest and  lowest posting banks also increased  There is considerable evidence that the official  LIBOR fixing understates the rates paid by many banks for funding  For example, as  shown in exhibit 13, the all-in cost of FX swap financing into dollars out of euros has  recently climbed to more than 30 basis points above the cost of LIBOR funding        April 29–30, 2008 5 of 266    The term funding pressures appear to be mainly the consequence of the  deleveraging process that is still firmly under way  Balance sheet capacity has  become strained in three ways  First, pressures to carry more assets on the balance  sheet have increased in a number of ways  For example, some types of assets can no  longer be securitized, and balance sheet assets are created when lines of credit are  drawn upon  Second, loan-loss provisions and mark-to-market losses have cut into  capital, at least until recently, faster than banks have been able to raise new capital   Third, desired capital ratios have undoubtedly risen as financial markets have become  more volatile and the macroeconomic outlook has worsened  These pressures have  sharply pushed up the shadow price of balance sheet capacity, and term funding  spreads undoubtedly reflect that pressure  As evidence, note how the spread between  jumbo and conforming fixed-rate mortgage yields in exhibit 14 has mostly tracked the  trajectory of term funding spreads shown in exhibit 13  Because banks can securitize  conforming mortgages but not jumbo mortgages, this widening spread likely reflects  the rise in the shadow price of balance sheet capacity  The term funding pressures  have also been evident in the strong demand exhibited in our biweekly TAF auctions   As shown in exhibit 15, the spread between the stop-out rate and the minimum bid  rate has risen sharply since late January, despite the large rise in the size of the TAF  auctions over this period        In contrast, the demand by primary dealers to borrow Treasury securities in our   term securities lending facility (TSLF) has been less intense  It is unclear whether  this reflects the large and immediate scale of these auctions ($175 billion offered over  four weeks) or less need by primary dealers, who rely heavily on secured repo  borrowing for their short-term funding needs  As shown in exhibit 16, two of the five  auctions have not been fully covered  Besides providing liquidity to the primary  dealers, the TSLF auctions have helped to generate a dramatic improvement in  Treasury market function  As shown in exhibit 17, before the first TSLF auction,  overnight Treasury repo rates were unusually low, and the Treasury market was  distorted by a growing number of security failures (that is, dealers were unable to  deliver promised securities) and a large number of securities trading special (that is,  with a repo rate below the rate on general Treasury collateral)       So have the TAF and TSLF auctions been helpful in improving market function?    Although it is impossible to know what the counterfactual would have been without  the auctions, most evidence suggests that these auctions have improved market  function  Although a recent study by John Taylor and John Williams found no  statistical evidence that the TAF auctions have had an effect on term funding, the  choices in terms of econometric design made it very difficult for this study to have  found an effect  Interestingly, minor changes in the specification used by Taylor and  Williams produce statistically significant results with the expected sign—in other  words, the TAF auctions reduced the spread       They say that a picture is worth a thousand words  Exhibit 18 documents the   Federal Reserve’s major initiatives over the past eight months relative to the LIBOR– OIS spread  Note that virtually all the Federal Reserve initiatives aimed at improving   April 29–30, 2008 6 of 266    market function have been associated with a decline in the LIBOR–OIS spread   Perhaps this just represents an announcement or placebo effect  More study is  obviously needed  However, it is interesting that those market participants who are  the patients have been clamoring for more medicine in the form of both an increase in  the size of the TAF auctions and auctions with longer maturities       As the equity and credit markets have improved, market participants have reduced   their expectations of the magnitude of further monetary policy easing  As shown in  exhibit 19, the federal funds rate futures curve has shifted upward and is virtually flat  around 2 percent from May though September—implying that market participants  expect that tomorrow will likely be the last easing in this cycle  The Eurodollar  futures curve, which is shown in exhibit 20, has shifted up even more sharply since  the last FOMC meeting  In part, this reflects the rise in term funding spreads and,  most important, the view that these spreads are likely to remain elevated relative to  the target federal funds rate for the foreseeable future     Our Survey of Primary Dealers undertaken about ten days before each FOMC   meeting shows more stability in dealer expectations (exhibits 21 and 22)  Note that  the dealer forecasts now anticipate somewhat greater easing than implied by the  federal funds rate futures market and the Eurodollar futures market  This is quite  different from the pattern in previous months  The average of the dealer modal  forecasts has a trough in yields of about 150 percent, about ½ percentage point below  the market forecast  In terms of this week’s meeting, there is little disagreement  between the dealer survey and market participants  All 18 of the primary dealers that  responded to our survey anticipate a rate cut at this meeting, with nearly all in the 25  basis point rate cut camp  As shown in exhibit 23, this is slightly more aggressive  than the expectations embodied in federal funds rate options, which are pricing in a  probability of a 25 basis point easing of almost 80 percent  The shift in interest rate  expectations cannot be explained easily by developments on the inflation front   Although the continued surge in crude oil prices has pushed aggregate commodity  indexes, such as the GSCI, higher, agricultural and industrial metal prices have been  much more stable in recent weeks (exhibit 24)  Despite the rise in energy prices,  market-based measures of long-term inflation compensation have fallen in recent  weeks  For example, as shown in exhibit 25, both the Board’s and Barclays’ five- year, five-year-forward measures have declined about 40 basis points from the peak  reached in early March       Turning to the Desk’s operations, we get mixed grades over the intermeeting   period  On the one hand, we have done a pretty good job of hitting the target on  average (through yesterday, the daily effective rate since the last FOMC meeting was  a miraculous 225 percent)  On the other hand, this average conceals considerable  intraday and day-to-day volatility  This can be seen in exhibit 26, which charts the  daily federal funds rate range and the daily average effective rate  Notice how wide  the daily range of trading has been  This reflects three factors  (1) the demand by  European banks for federal funds, which has often caused the federal funds rate to be  elevated early in the day before Europe closes; (2) stigma associated with primary   April 29–30, 2008 7 of 266    credit facility (PCF) borrowing—the PCF rate is not a firm cap on federal funds rate  trading; and (3) large unanticipated shifts in the autonomous factors that affect the  level of reserves in the banking system—especially shifts in the level of PCF and  PDCF borrowing  Note the big rise in PCF and PDCF borrowing since mid-March  and the large daily shifts in the level of this borrowing shown in exhibit 27  We have  little ability to forecast these daily shifts in borrowing  Thus, these shifts are mostly  unexpected and do increase the volatility of the federal funds rate      Finally, let me briefly outline a number of policy recommendations for which we   seek your approval  First, I will need approval for domestic operations  There were  no foreign operations  Second, as noted in the memo that was circulated to you last  week, we are recommending that the outstanding swap lines with Canada and Mexico  be renewed for another year  Third, the staff is recommending approval of an  increase in the size of the foreign exchange swap facilities with the European Central  Bank and the Swiss National Bank  This recommendation is discussed in more detail  in a memo that was distributed to the FOMC last Friday  For the ECB, the  recommendation is to increase the size of the swap line to $50 billion from  $30 billion, and for the SNB, to $12 billion from $6 billion, with maximum draws on  these facilities of $25 billion and $6 billion, respectively  We also recommend  extending the term of these swap facilities to January 30, 2009, from September 30,  2008  As before, these swap lines will be used in conjunction with our TAF auctions  to increase the amount of 28-day term dollar funding available to banks with  operations in the euro area and in Switzerland  At the same time, we understand that  Chairman Bernanke intends to use his delegated authority from the Board to increase  the size of the TAF to $150 billion from $100 billion       Fourth, we recommend that eligible collateral for the TSLF be broadened to   include AAA-rated asset-backed securities (ABS)  Currently, as you know, this  facility accepts only AAA-rated residential-mortgage-backed securities and  commercial-mortgage-backed securities  We believe that broadening the eligibility to  AAA-rated ABS will help support the availability of consumer credit, including credit  card, auto, and student loan credit  Spreads in AAA-rated ABS backed by auto loans  and credit card receivables have risen sharply over the past six months even though  the deterioration in the underlying performance of the assets in terms of delinquency  and loss has been well within the bounds of past cycles  We do not recommend  increasing the collateral eligibility by greater breadth than this  As we noted in last  Friday’s memo, including additional classes of securities could increase operational  costs to an extent that is not likely to be warranted by the marginal benefits  It could  also expose the System to the risks associated with a range of complex structured  finance products and, in the case of AAA-rated corporate securities, would not  provide much benefit because the amounts of such securities outstanding are  relatively small  Under this proposal, the maximum size of the TSLF would remain  unchanged—at $200 billion—as would the other terms of the facility      I also want to inform the Committee of a small technical change that the staff   plans to make in the TSLF program  We plan to eliminate the requirement that   April 29–30, 2008 8 of 266    eligible AAA-rated securities not be on watch for downgrade  We plan to make this  change because we have found that enforcing this rule has been very difficult  operationally because the two clearing banks that manage the triparty repo system  have a limited ability to perform this monitoring function on our behalf  In addition, I  would point out that the added risks from this change are very small  If securities  were downgraded, the primary dealer would have to substitute new eligible collateral   Also, it should be pointed out that the PDCF accepts most investment-grade  securities—thus, we already have a broader collateral regime in place for our other  primary dealer facility        I am not so much saying that they are not warranted  I am saying that   the spreads have widened a lot relative to the actual experience, given that we are in a period of   weaker economic growth  The stress seems to be more on the spreads that the market is   demanding for these assets as opposed to a deterioration in the underlying credit card loans or   auto loans that back those assets      Yes  They are priced every day; and if they are downgraded, there will   be an automatic substitution  So you are protected both on price and on the ability to substitute    Well, I think the honest answer is that we don’t really know exactly   where it is on the continuum of very modest to substantive  One thing we can say is that this   should increase the demand at the TSLF auction, so it should increase the likelihood that more of   the Treasuries are actually put into the market in exchange for such collateral because we are   broadening the eligible collateral  But I don’t think the notion that this is a panacea is true     If I may come back to the issue of the AAA securities and the spreads,   those are AAA-rated securities for which the spread has widened hundreds of basis points  If the   loss experienced is not unusual relative to the cycle, then it’s hard to understand why AAA-rated   securities would be selling at several hundred basis points over Treasuries  It is impossible to   square that circle    I think you could get your result if people took the action as that the   Federal Reserve’s view was that the economy wasn’t as great a risk  So risk premiums would   come down, the dollar would rally, and the stock market would do better  I mean, it’s possible    It is also being significantly driven by the subsequent data    Yes, it’s hard to know what to read into that  It could be that the   forecasts have more inertia to them     But forecasts don’t change that fast, so it is hard to know; but that could   be one factor    Yes, a soft pause rather than a hard pause is the way I would think about   what the market is looking for    Building on the earlier presentations, I am going to focus briefly   on four areas  First, I’d like to put the interest on reserves project in the broader  context of monetary policy implementation  Second, I will discuss briefly the  implications of our experience during the recent market turmoil in terms of how it  might influence our choices in this project  Third, I’ll suggest some next steps and a  potential timeline  Fourth, I’ll focus on the criteria for evaluating the different  options and those areas where your guidance will likely be particularly important      Turning to page 42 of the handout, the issue of paying interest on reserves should   be placed in a broader context  In particular, this project should be considered as part  of the process of improving the overall monetary policy framework  Put bluntly,  although the current system works very well during normal times, we have found it  recently to be less robust during times of stress  As a result, we should use this  opportunity to strengthen the robustness of the framework       So what are the weaknesses of the current monetary policy framework?  As   shown on page 43 of the handout, four come immediately to mind  (1) In times of   April 29–30, 2008 155 of 266    stress, the federal funds rate can be very volatile—both day-to-day and intraday   (2) On the upside, the primary credit facility rate is not a binding ceiling on rates   (3) When there is a large reserve adding miss, the Desk can temporarily lose control  of the federal funds rate target to the downside  (4) Stability in the federal funds rate  may not limit upward pressure in term funding rates  Today I’ll focus on the  volatility issue and the failure of the PCF rate to be a binding cap  Two issues are  worth noting regarding volatility  First, the federal funds rate has become more  volatile on a day-to-day basis since last August  This can be seen on page 44   Second, the federal funds rate has become very volatile intraday  The exhibit on page  45 shows how wide the range of federal funds rate trading has been recently  The  vertical dashed lines indicate the daily range  Note that the primary credit facility rate  has not acted as a firm cap on the upper end of the daily range       As shown on page 46, these shortcomings suggest that paying interest on reserves   should be considered in tandem with other changes to the overall monetary policy  framework  We should be willing to make significant adjustments to our monetary  policy framework so that it is more robust during times of stress  In this context,  although option 1 (paying interest on required and excess reserves) and option 2  (eliminating reserve requirements) are attractive because both would eliminate the  reserve tax distortion, they do not do much in terms of making the monetary policy  framework more robust  That said, option 2 has a number of favorable features  It is  voluntary and would lessen the regulatory burden  We have considerable experience  with this type of framework, so the risks of unintended consequences might be lower  than for some of the other options  The Bank of England has been using this  framework successfully, and it has proven to be reasonably robust through this period  of market turmoil  Nevertheless, we may wish to be more ambitious       Turning to page 47, option 5 (voluntary daily target with clearing band) is   potentially more robust than option 3 or option 4  In part, this is because it is very  flexible  This proposal has a number of parameters that can be adjusted—for  example, the width of the corridor and the size of the voluntary reserve band  Thus,  this option has the advantage that it could be modified relatively easily in light of  experience or in response to changing market conditions  The biggest shortcoming of  option 5 is that no other central bank has adopted such a model  Thus, experience and  empirical evidence are lacking compared with the other proposals      So what is our recommendation in terms of pushing this forward (see page 48)?    As Jim noted in his presentation, the five options can be broken down into two  classes  Options 1 and 2 operate in a framework of a multiple-day reserve  maintenance period  Options 3, 4, and 5 are single-day systems  Reserve  maintenance periods have both advantages and disadvantages  Reserve maintenance  periods reduce volatility by averaging—which can be a good thing  But there is a  cost  The shocks can persist  In contrast, in single-day systems, each day is a new  start, so one avoids the problem of a large shock contaminating an entire reserve  maintenance period  This suggests that a reasonable next step might be to develop  the best proposal within each of these two broad classes  We recommend focusing on   April 29–30, 2008 156 of 266    option 2 as the best proposal within a reserve maintenance framework and option 5 as  the best proposal in a single-day system       What would be the next steps (see page 49)?  First, we would need to identify   workable systems of voluntary targets for reserves needed for either option 2 or  option 5  This would include setting clear objectives for the aggregate size and the  distribution across depository institutions and how such a system would be applied to  a heterogeneous banking system  Second, we would need to critically assess the  relative merits of maintenance periods versus daily clearing bands  In this context,  we would need to determine the optimal length of a reserve maintenance period and  the width of a clearing band  Third, we would have to define the optimal width of a  rate corridor under both options  Here we would have to understand the implications  for rate dynamics and the functioning of the market during normal conditions and  during times of stress  Finally, we would need to assess whether the options were  compatible or could be made compatible with other changes that we might  implement, such as changes in our counterparties or in the types of collateral we  accept as part of our central bank operations     So what would be a possible timeline between now and implementation in   October 2011?  The timeline that I will discuss should be viewed as tentative and  subject to revision in light of your comments and further discussion within the  Federal Reserve System  Turning to page 50, we would propose that most of the  remainder of 2008 be used for an extensive study of the options  In May 2008, the  staff would publish a white paper on possible approaches for public comment  In  December, the staff would propose a specific approach to the Board and to the  FOMC  Continuing on page 51, the first half of 2009 would be spent filling in the  details, with the final proposal published for public comment in August 2009  The  rules implementing the proposal would be published by the Board in October 2009   The final two years would be spent preparing for October 2011 implementation       On the last page, we outline areas in which we particularly seek your guidance    These include the following questions  Do you agree with our metrics for evaluation  of the policy options?  In particular, what are the appropriate weights to place on the  reduction in burden and distortions versus the other criteria?  Which options should  be studied further?  Are you comfortable with our proposed timeline?  Finally, how  do you view the interaction of the interest on reserves project with other issues—for  example, collateralized daylight overdrafts?  We would now like to open the floor for  questions and comments         The big risk would be if the voluntary balances were really low    You’d have to change the incentives somehow    But you could  You could raise the cost of daylight overdrafts    As long as you have enough parameters that you can adjust to change the   incentives, you’re probably going to be okay in that environment  But if you have a system in   which there aren’t any parameters that you can actually move, then you have a real problem    We think we could implement it pretty quickly  Another benefit would be   not just addressing the crashes of the funds rate late in the day but also enabling us to actually   expand our balance sheet if needed    It’s pretty small if you just confine it to excess    Pretty dramatically, in fact    What we don’t know is whether that volatility somehow has consequences   for term funding  How do you know the linkage between the two because they’re happening sort of   simultaneously?  But I agree with Spence that we don’t think there’s any significant macro effect    There may be some marginal effect of volatility creating a greater risk premium in the market, but   it’s hard to say    The high morning rate could conceivably affect other rates in a way   that’s—    Well, we’re not seeing much arbitrage    The TAF auction results underscored the idea of stigma at the primary   credit facility  It’s possible that we have actually a bit more stigma now than we did before because   you can just see very clearly that there would have to be stigma for people to be bidding that much   in the TAF auction  "
8454,2008-06-24,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to be referring to the  handout that you should have in front of you  Financial markets have become more  resilient to bad news in recent weeks  Although the news associated with several  important groups of financial intermediaries—including investment banks,  commercial banks, and the monoline insurers—has not been favorable, contagion has  been limited compared with some of our earlier experiences during the past year   Moreover, the types of vicious feedback loops that were evident, for example, in early  March have been largely absent more recently       Despite this, much of the news has not been good  Looking first at the US   equity and credit markets, a good portion of the improvement that occurred in the  run-up to the April FOMC meeting has been unwound recently  The broad US  equity indexes are only marginally above their low points reached in mid-March and  the price of the Standard & Poor’s 500 financial sub-index has fallen to a new trough  (exhibit 1)  In contrast, corporate credit spreads have held on to much of the gains  achieved after mid-March  As shown in exhibit 2, the spreads on both investment- grade and high-yield corporate debt have been quite stable recently  However, as  shown in exhibit 3, corporate credit default swap spreads have widened over the past  few weeks       Most of the major investment banks have continued to struggle  As shown in   exhibit 4, the share prices of the four remaining independent US investment banks  remain depressed  Further write-offs, capital-raising (which is increasing the number  of common share equivalents outstanding), and investors’ concerns about the  consequences of deleveraging on long-term profitability have all been important  factors weighing on share prices  In contrast to this poor equity-price performance,  credit default swap (CDS) spreads remain much narrower than at the time of Bear  Stearns’s demise in mid-March (exhibit 5)  The establishment of the Primary Dealer  Credit Facility and the Federal Reserve’s role in the acquisition of Bear Stearns by  JPMorgan Chase are undoubtedly both important factors behind the divergence of  equity prices and credit default swap spreads  Lehman Brothers, which reported a  second-quarter loss that was considerably larger than expected, has been under the  most stress  However, in contrast to Bear Stearns’s experience in mid-March,  Lehman’s short-term financing counterparties have generally proved to be patient   The financing backstop provided by the Primary Dealer Credit Facility has been cited  by many counterparties as a critical element that has encouraged them to keep their                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   June 24–25, 2008 4 of 253    financing lines to Lehman in place  The investment banks have begun to rapidly  deleverage their balance sheets  As shown in exhibit 6, the gross leverage ratios for  Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley all fell sharply in the second  quarter  This stands in marked contrast to the rise in leverage ratios that persisted  through the first quarter of this year      Regional banks have also come under considerable strain recently  Deterioration   in their construction lending, commercial real estate, and residential mortgage books  has caused many banks to raise their loan-loss provisions sharply  Potential acquirers  of troubled regional banks have been discouraged by the accounting requirement that  these banks must mark down the assets of the bank that they’re acquiring to the  current market value at the time of the acquisition       The financial guarantors have also been under stress  Both Standard & Poor’s and   Moody’s recently downgraded Ambac and MBIA  The Moody’s downgrade of  MBIA was particularly sharp—five notches to A2 from AAA  These downgrades of  the monoline guarantors have a number of important implications  First, the firms  that have purchased protection from Ambac and MBIA will have to take significant  write-downs  Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and UBS appear to have the largest  exposures to these two firms  Second, the ability of Ambac and MBIA to establish  new AAA-rated subsidiaries that would enable them to write new municipal bond  insurance is increasingly in doubt  Most likely, these firms will be forced to go into  runoff mode in which they can no longer write new business  Third, the financial  resources of these firms will be strained by the downgrades  For example, MBIA said  that, as a result of the downgrades, it may have to pay out $29 billion to satisfy  certain contracts and post up to $45 billion of additional collateral  Fourth, the risk  of a default or a restructuring event by a major monoline guarantor could potentially  unsettle the CDS market  As shown in exhibits 7 and 8, the share prices of the  monolines have continued to slide, and their credit default swap spreads have risen  further  As has been the case for some time, there remains—even after the credit  rating downgrades—a big disconnect between the CDS spreads of these firms and  their credit ratings       Despite these rating downgrades, the effect on the municipal securities market has   been muted compared with the turmoil evident in the first quarter  Put simply, much  of the adjustment in the short-term municipal market—for example, the demise of the  muni auction rate securities market and the restructuring of many variable rate  demand notes (VRDN) and tender option bond (TOB) securities, has already taken  place  Although the yields on the VRDNs wrapped by Ambac and MBIA have  increased sharply, up to now much of this paper has been remarketed rather than put  back to the liquidity providers  The effect on the municipal bond market has been  even more subdued  As shown in exhibit 9, the ratios of 10-year and 30-year  municipal yields to comparable Treasury yields have risen only slightly recently and  remain well below the peaks reached in mid-March  Investors have already been  looking through the credit ratings of the monoline insurers to the quality of the  underlying tax-exempt issuer     June 24–25, 2008 5 of 253      The performance of term funding markets also suggests a greater resilience to bad   news  Subsequent to the May expansion of the TAF auction sizes and the increase in  the foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss  National Bank, one-month and three-month LIBOR–OIS spreads have narrowed  significantly (exhibits 10 and 11)  The decline in term funding spreads is particularly  noteworthy because it stands in contrast to the widening that occurred in the last  month of the three preceding quarters—September, December, and March  The  increase in the size of the TAF auctions has also been associated with a decline in  bid-to-cover ratios Also, as shown in exhibit 12, the spread between the stop-out rate  and the minimum bid rate has been relatively low  In contrast to the US auctions,  the bid-to-cover ratios in the ECB and SNB auctions have risen sharply over the last  three auctions (exhibit 13)  This likely reflects several factors including (1) a  reduction in the willingness of US banks to lend at term to European banks—due  mostly to balance sheet constraints and (2) strategic bidding behavior  As you recall,  the ECB auction is a noncompetitive auction with the stop-out rate determined by the  TAF auction  As a consequence, increasing the bid size in the ECB auction will not  raise the price that the banks will have to pay, and that encourages more bidding in  the ECB auctions  This strategic bidding explanation, however, is undercut by the  fact that European banks have also been strong bidders in both the TAF and the SNB  auctions  The introduction by ICAP of a competing measure of bank funding costs— the New York Funding Rate (NYFR)—has mostly bolstered the credibility of  LIBOR  The NYFR rates have consistently been within 1 or 2 basis points of  LIBOR  However, it is unclear how much this conformity reflects the accuracy of  LIBOR  It is possible that the NYFR respondents use LIBOR as a benchmark for  their own responses, since LIBOR comes out earlier in the day than when they have  to respond       Demand for the term securities lending facility (TSLF) auctions has also generally   been subdued  Only one of the last nine auctions has been fully subscribed  This  mainly reflects the convergence in Treasury and non-Treasury repo financing rates   Following the first TSLF auction, Treasury repo rates rose sharply  Given the  minimum bid rates for the schedule 1 and schedule 2 auctions of 10 and 25 basis  points respectively, the convergence in repo rates has eroded the economic appeal of  the TSLF auctions as a funding vehicle  The $80 billion of the single-tranche repo  program has been more attractive as a source of funding  Moreover, the PDCF  backstop has made investors more willing to finance the non-Treasury collateral held  by the investment banks and other primary dealers, and this has also reduced the  demand for TSLF borrowing       The continued rise in commodity prices has been another important market   development  As shown in exhibit 14, both energy and agricultural prices have been  rising sharply  Although the weakness of the dollar has often been cited by analysts  as a causal factor behind the surge in commodity prices, the recent rise in energy and  food prices has been accompanied by a slightly stronger, rather than weaker, dollar  (exhibit 15)  Nevertheless, short-term movements in the dollar and oil prices do   June 24–25, 2008 6 of 253    appear to have become more closely linked over the past few years  Exhibit 16 plots  the six-month rolling correlation between the weekly change in the spot price of West  Texas intermediate crude oil and the weekly change in the value of the trade- weighted dollar  As can be seen, these price changes have become increasingly  negatively correlated in recent years  Of course, correlation does not imply causality   Even if there is causality, it is unclear in what direction the causality runs—from  commodities to the dollar or from the dollar to commodities  Although many factors  are undoubtedly at play, a couple of possible explanations that have made the rounds  may be worth considering  First, higher oil prices swell the dollar reserves held by  the oil-producing countries  Because these countries may respond to this dollar influx  by selling dollars to diversify their foreign exchange reserve holdings, traders may  sell dollars in anticipation  Second, trade data suggest that the composition of import  demand from the oil-exporting nations is skewed away from the United States, and  this may also weigh on the dollar       The rise in commodity prices has fanned anxieties about inflation  As shown in   exhibit 17, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey measures of one- year and five-to-ten-year inflation expectations have increased recently  In contrast,  both Barclays’ and the Board’s five-year, five-year-forward measures of breakeven  inflation have moderated a bit since the last meeting  These measures remain well  inside the ranges evident over the past year (exhibit 18)  The anxiety about higher  commodity prices and inflation has been an important factor behind the sharp shift in  monetary policy expectations  As shown in exhibits 19 and 20, the federal funds rate  and Eurodollar futures curves have continued to shift upward since the April FOMC  meeting  As shown in exhibits 21 and 22, our survey of primary dealer expectations  also shows an upward shift in the expected path of the federal funds rate target   However, compared with the expectations embodied in futures prices, the rise has  been more modest  As a result, the gap between the average of the dealers’ forecasts  and the market’s forecast has continued to increase and is now unusually wide  The  divergence between the dealers’ forecasts and market expectations and the wide range  of the dealers’ forecasts one year ahead indicate that there is considerable uncertainty  about the future path of short-term rates  This uncertainty is also evident in the fact  that the implied volatility of short-term interest rates is unusually high currently       The tightening expected over the next year is not anticipated to begin soon  As   shown in exhibits 23 and 24, options on federal funds rate futures contracts currently  imply that market participants expect that the FOMC will stand pat at both this and  the August FOMC meetings  Although considerable tightening is priced in over the  next year, this is not unusual at this stage of the monetary policy cycle  Assuming  that we are at the trough of the current rate cycle, the magnitude of tightening  expected over the next year is not significantly greater than what has been priced in  following other troughs in the federal funds rate target  Tomorrow we will be eight  weeks beyond what may turn out to be the onset of the trough in the target rate  As  shown in exhibit 25, the roughly 125 basis points of tightening that is currently priced  in over the next year is comparable to what was anticipated at the same point after the  federal funds rate trough in 1992     June 24–25, 2008 7 of 253      Finally, a few words about the Primary Dealer Credit Facility  (Art Angulo will   talk about this in more detail tomorrow)  We have been actively managing our  counterparty risk in this facility and have made it clear to market participants that this  should be viewed as a backstop facility rather than as a core source of funding  By  the end of next week, borrowing from this facility is likely to drop sharply because of  two events  The first is this week’s closing of the Bear Stearns–JPMorgan Chase  transaction, which will result in the elimination of Bear Stearns’s PDCF borrowing   The second is the anticipated closing next week of the Bank of America acquisition of  Countrywide, which is expected to eliminate Countrywide’s PDCF borrowing  In the  absence of new financial shocks that could provoke renewed funding difficulties, we  would anticipate little persistent PDCF borrowing after these mergers are completed       Last week I sent you a memo informing you of our plans to initiate a euro time   deposit with the Netherlands Central Bank, subject to Regulation N approval by the  Board  There were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote to ratify  the operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the April FOMC  meeting  As always, I am very happy to take any questions        It is a bit higher, yes    About 225 basis points are priced in for our dollar turn—maybe 150   basis points or 175 basis points elsewhere—but those are pretty small differences measured over   just a couple of days  So I wouldn’t read too much into it  The reality is that the European banks   are structurally short of dollar funding, and so that may be why there is a little more upward   pressure on dollar rates over the quarter-end    The latter, of course  [Laughter]      It actually has increased a bit  But I have consistently shown just the   Barclays and Board measures over the past few months, so this is not “pick and choose”     There have been more borrowers than just them  Some have done it   because they wanted to test the facility  Some have done it because they viewed it as a fairly   advantageous cost of funding  You know, there have been quite a few different borrowers, but   those two borrowers mentioned are the ones that I would view as more persistent than desired    I think there is some stigma attached to the Primary Dealer Credit   Facility  It is hard to know exactly how much  One thing I thought was interesting  The first   week the facility was outstanding, a number of institutions went to the Primary Dealer Credit   June 24–25, 2008 9 of 253    Facility and then announced that they were doing it as a test  Now, presumably you wouldn’t   announce that you were doing it as a test if there were no stigma associated with the facility  But   I would judge that it is clearly less stigmatized than the Primary Credit Facility, probably   because it doesn’t have the history that the Primary Credit Facility has  The fact is that it is an   advantageous rate or was an advantageous rate several weeks ago, and there were some   institutions that were borrowing from the facility just on the basis of rate—so that suggests less   stigma than the discount window    This is just assets divided by equity, so I think it is pretty good  When   the investment banks start proposing their adjusted leverage ratios, then I think you have a   problem—you know, apples and oranges—because the different investment banks calculate   those kinds of adjusted leverage ratios a bit differently  Usually you see two leverage ratios—  one that is gross and another one that excludes the matched book—and the leverage ratio falls   pretty significantly when you exclude the matched book    May I just interject one thing on this?  Vice Chairman Geithner makes the   important point that one issue is counterparty risk for Cantor and Countrywide, which was sort of   separate  The other issue is, since this is permissible only under section 13(3), that it can’t be a   chronic source of funding and it can’t be part of their core funding plan  We want to make it clear   to them that this is going to go away, and we want to be confident that they’re not dependent on the   PDCF as a source of funding  So I would distinguish between Barclays coming in occasionally   with Barclays coming in every day, and that’s really the point we were trying to make to them    If I could add just one more thing, I also think that the stigma doesn’t   really undercut the benefit of the PDCF as a backstop to these firms’ financing  If the stigma really   undercut the benefit, then the stigma would be quite important  But I think that the PDCF is still a   very viable backstop even with some stigma associated with it in the current environment    I don’t think they’re back to normal, and I also think very strongly that the   amount of use of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility is not a guide to how important it is as a   backstop for financial firms    There were a number of people to whom we talked who said that the   reason they stayed with Lehman during this period of stress was that they knew that the Primary   June 24–25, 2008 155 of 253    Dealer Credit Facility was there as a backstop  So I have a high degree of confidence that Lehman   would have been in great difficulty without it    It was a little over $100 billion    It was starting to run off    The real issue may be that the PDCF borrowing may be de minimis  In   that environment, it’s not really clear what raising the price really means  It might even be   confusing to people if you raise the price at the time the borrowing was de minimis  So I think   that is just one consideration   June 24–25, 2008 195 of 253   "
8480,2008-07-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As outlined in the memo circulated  earlier to the Committee from Brian and myself, the staff is proposing two  innovations to our suite of liquidity facilities  First, we are proposing to add a  $50 billion options program to the TSLF  There is a precedent for this  We auctioned  options in advance of Y2K  This proposal calls for selling options to primary dealers  in a series of auctions beginning several weeks before each quarter-end  The options  would be for the right to borrow Treasuries from the SOMA portfolio in exchange for  schedule 2 collateral for a short period of time (a week or so) over the quarter-end  period  If the option is exercised, the dealer would pay a fixed rate for the borrowing  (we have currently penciled in this rate at 25 basis points, annualized—the same as   July 24, 2008 4 of 50    the minimum bid rate on 28-day TSLF borrowing)  The fine points of the program,  such as the rate and the precise timing and tenor of the borrowing that the options  would reference, would be determined after consultation with the primary dealer  community  As you recall, in the rollout of the original TSLF program, we consulted  with the dealer community after the program was announced  The dealer comments  did result in changes in the program that we believe made it more effective, and the  dealers certainly did appreciate the opportunity to have their views heard before the  program was implemented  We anticipate that an options facility would be helpful in  providing a means for dealers to purchase insurance that could be used to secure  funding over stress periods such as quarter-end and year-end  Because the options  would be auctioned well in advance of quarter-end, dealers should be able to better  plan their funding needs over that period  The options program should help reassure  dealers that they will be able to finance their less liquid collateral over these high- stress balance sheet periods  Greater comfort on the part of the dealers is likely to  reduce the risk of a margin spiral in which forced liquidation of illiquid collateral  leads to lower prices, higher volatility, and higher haircuts, which, in turn, provoke  further liquidation  Debby Perelmuter will discuss the TSLF options proposal in  greater detail in a few minutes      Second, we are proposing to extend the maturity of Term Auction Facility loans   to 84 days from 28 days  The size of the total program would remain unchanged at  $150 billion  The auction cycle would remain biweekly, with the size of each auction  cut proportionately to the rise in maturity—to $25 billion per auction in six biweekly  cycles covering 12 weeks from the current program of $75 billion in two biweekly  cycles covering four weeks  We also are proposing to change our  overcollateralization rules  In the current program, we require that TAF bids must not  exceed 50 percent of pledged collateral  But the overcollateralization can be  withdrawn after the loans are made  Under the new rules, we would change this  standard so that the sum of all outstanding term TAF and term PCF loans could not  exceed 75 percent of available collateral, both initially and throughout the term of the  loans  As the Chairman noted, the ECB and the SNB have indicated that they will  modify their programs accordingly  The ECB is seeking to raise its swap line  authority to $60 billion from $50 billion  They are seeking to do this because the  current swap line of $50 billion is not easily divisible into a six biweekly auction  cycle  We anticipate that they will decide to raise their biweekly auction size to either  $9 billion or $10 billion—so the total swap draw is likely to rise to either $54 billion  or $60 billion  The motivation for the maturity extension is provide greater support to  term funding markets  For some time, banks have asked for longer-term maturity  TAF loans  This is attractive to them for two reasons  (1) almost all of these loans  will extend over quarter-ends—periods in which balance sheet stress is likely to be  greatest—and (2) the longer maturity would also help banks extend the average  maturity of their borrowings  This change will also put the maturity of TAF loans  more on par with the ninety-day limit of the primary credit facility  Sandy Krieger  will discuss our TAF maturity extension proposal in more detail shortly        July 24, 2008 5 of 50    So what will these two programs do?  My own view is that these new proposals  are evolutionary rather than revolutionary  They are unlikely to result in a dramatic  improvement in term funding conditions  However, they are likely to be helpful at  the margin  In particular, I think they will help reduce the risk of the type of margin  spiral that could potentially turn a period of balance sheet stress into something  systemic  In my view, this is a worthwhile goal  Better to take steps now to reduce  the risks of bad outcomes than wait to respond only after the bad outcomes occur   Introduction of these program innovations also will demonstrate that the Federal  Reserve is actively on the case, refining its liquidity suite in order to make its tools  more effective       Will introduction of these changes be alarming to the market?  I don’t think so    Because they would be announced simultaneously with the extension of the PDCF  and the TSLF programs, the changes are likely to be perceived as an ongoing  refinement of the existing programs rolled out as a package with the PDCF and TSLF  extension rather than as a program that signals great concern about problems known  to the Federal Reserve but not to market participants       Should we worry that the $50 billion TSLF options program further commits the   Fed’s balance sheet, making it more difficult to respond to large, unanticipated PCF  or PDCF borrowing?  Although this is a legitimate issue, it should be emphasized that  the Federal Reserve has other means of easing its balance sheet constraints, which the  staff has been actively pursuing  Also, the regular TSLF program has been  undersubscribed—currently only $1135 billion of TSLF loans are outstanding  This  will climb to $1231 billion tomorrow, when today’s auction settles  This means that  there is a bit more headroom than suggested by the $175 billion size of the TSLF  auction program and the $200 billion that was authorized  Moreover, in the worst- case scenario of massive PCF or PDCF borrowing, I wonder whether the $50 billion  claim on the Fed’s balance sheet represented by the options would indeed be  significant at the margin  Debby Perelmuter will now explain how we anticipate that  such a TSLF options program would work          No    Correct  Although if a number of institutions did that, they would not   know what the price would be for that loan    If you won an option, you would lock in with certainty the ability to   borrow at the TSLF for a fixed price—so you would be locking in your place in the queue, and   you would also be locking in your price     You are reducing your uncertainty    I think they would have trouble characterizing it that way, to be frank   about it  We have certainly heard that there is a lot of uncertainty about what is going to happen   going forward in terms of balance sheet stress  We certainly have heard that that stress tends to   July 24, 2008 10 of 50    be greatest around quarter-ends and year-ends  I don’t think that we have heard the dealers   characterize it in terms of tail risk  I don’t think that is how they would frame the question     Well, I think one advantage of it is that you are buying an option today   for an auction that is going to take place several weeks in the future  That allows you to plan a   little better what you need to do to actually be able to finance yourself over year-end  If you win   the option, you know you have locked in that financing  Then you may behave differently in   terms of how you manage your portfolio and how you manage your willingness to extend credit   to other counterparties  I would say that is the major difference    I think we have seen a couple of quarter-ends over the last year that   have been problematic and more difficult  Certainly, the September quarter-end was difficult,   and the year-end was difficult  March somewhat less so, but that was a little colored by the fact   that the Bear Stearns resolution happened just before the March quarter-end  June was actually   pretty manageable  But we have definitely seen more stress over those periods    Well, I think the stress during those periods means that there is more   risk that a small shock could actually build into something bigger because people are all in   balance sheet reduction mode at the same time  That is why you care about those periods  You   already know that they are likely to be more stressful, but the fact that they are more stressful   means that a shock of a given magnitude could have more-damaging consequences  So you are   really trying to lean against that    Right  But that is not tenable in the large  If a whole group of   institutions had that same strategy, we could have a very interesting auction result  It would be   profitable for us    Well, I don’t think that is the result we are going for    Okay  To answer your first question—Does this commit us for   longer?—I don’t really think so  I think the options could be granted only for periods over which   the Federal Reserve determines that unusual and exigent conditions exist  So today if we extend   that time table to January 30, 2009, then we are opening up the possibility of having options over   the September quarter-end and year-end but no longer  In terms of the maturity, the banks have   been pushing for this for a long time  If you ask people, “What is your single most popular   recommendation that you would like the Fed to do in terms of its suite of liquidity tools?” this is   the one that is always at the top of the list     Now, to your question, “Have things deteriorated?” I would say “yes and no”  They   haven’t deteriorated in terms of term funding pressures by looking at the LIBOR–OIS spread   being worse  But what has deteriorated is that the markets think these strains are going to last a   lot longer—if you look at the one-year-to-two-year-forward LIBOR–OIS spread on a forward   basis—and that deterioration has occurred over the last couple of months    Sandy, do you want to take this?   You could get a bit of an adverse selection problem    I think we would concede that point, that one could have a break point   at 28 days or 30 days, where beyond 30 days you had this overcollateralization requirement, and   less than 30 days—it could be zero—that is really for you to decide  But to us it is not really   compelling one way over the other    I think we would be comfortable with that as an alternative  I mean, it   does have the advantage of not taking something away that we have already given    We are picking 28 days because that is the length of the current TAF   loan  If you are going to make a cut, that would seem to be a logical place to make that change   July 24, 2008 17 of 50     Of course it is an option  I think the reason that we preferred moving   completely to an 84-day was that we thought it was much clearer  In other words, the users   would know what they were doing and wouldn’t be faced with a multitude of choices in terms of   keeping straight what week this is and what auction they are bidding for today  So we felt at the   end of the day, because we had repeatedly been asked for a longer maturity, that we would be   diluting it if we split it 50-50 between 28 days and 84 days  We also thought it would be more   confusing in terms of if 84 days is good, why are you moving only halfway?    I also want to point out that for the banks that don’t have enough   collateral today, that doesn’t mean that they don’t have collateral available  It is just that the   collateral hasn’t been pledged at the window  So the bottom line is that we don’t think that the   overcollateralization requirement is very constraining—to use economics terms, the shadow   price of collateral is pretty close to zero as far as we can tell     Well, the big problem would be how we would make the transition,   because I think we cannot do two auctions simultaneously on 84 days and 28 days and it’s not clear   how one would actually transition then to steady state  We would have to spend some time working   on that to see if it is possible to make this happen without having a lot of reserve-management issues   July 24, 2008 48 of 50    because we really don’t want the outstanding amounts to go up or down violently as we’re   transitioning  So we’re just going to have to see if that’s feasible or not  "
8501,2008-08-05,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am going to be referring to the  handout in front of you  It seems to be getting thicker at every meeting  Since the  June FOMC meeting, financial markets have been characterized by two distinct  phases  Until the middle of July, share prices weakened substantially, and credit  spreads widened  The financial sector’s difficulties were at the forefront as housing- price declines continued to pressure this sector  The IndyMac failure led to uninsured  depositors taking losses, and this roiled the regional banking sector  The equity  prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plummeted, and their ongoing viability was  called into question  The passage of housing legislation that provided support to the  GSEs then led to an improvement in investor sentiment and a modest recovery in  share prices  As shown in exhibit 1, financial sector shares led the recovery   However, the overall improvement in the broad market indexes was very modest,  both in the United States and abroad (exhibit 2)  Moreover, no meaningful  improvement was evident in the corporate debt or CDS markets  CDS spreads have  not changed much, and spreads of asset-backed securities have begun to widen again  (exhibits 3 and 4)      Despite intermeeting news that I would characterize on balance as more bad than   good, this news did not trigger the type of risk-reduction spasms by investors that  have sporadically plagued financial markets over the past year  Exhibits 5 and 6  compare the correlation of daily asset price changes across a broad array of asset  classes in July to the corresponding period in March  The blue boxes denote  correlations with absolute values of more than 05  As can be seen, asset price  movements have become much less correlated       Although the mood is slightly improved today compared with a few weeks ago,   the underlying news, especially from the financial sector, remains quite bleak in most  respects  In particular, there is little conviction that financial shares have reached a  bottom  This can be seen in the unusually high volatility of financial share prices  (exhibit 7) and the positive skew in options prices for financial firms, in which the  price of a put has been much higher than an equivalent out-of-the money call (exhibit  8)  Financial market participants are paying more to protect the downside than to  participate on the upside       Merrill Lynch’s recent experience is reflective of the challenging environment   faced by financial firms  Merrill Lynch raised new equity capital and announced that  it had sharply reduced its net ABS CDO exposure  Investors were initially pleased  that the company had bitten the bullet, and the share price rallied in response  But  further consideration tempered the initial enthusiasm—and there are more articles on  this in the Wall Street Journal today  A closer look revealed some troubling aspects  of the transactions  First, Merrill Lynch took an additional $44 billion of CDO write- downs from the June quarter-end valuation date  Merrill Lynch sold CDO exposures  with a par value of $306 billion to Lone Star for $67 billion  At quarter-end, these  positions had been carried on the books for $111 billion  Second, this transaction  resulted in a drop in net CDO exposure of only $17 billion because Merrill Lynch                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   August 5, 2008 4 of 145    provided 75 percent nonrecourse financing to Lone Star  Merrill Lynch gave away all  the upside on these assets in exchange for a payment equal to 6 percent of their par  value  Third, Merrill Lynch’s equity issuance reportedly resulted in 38 percent  dilution to existing shareholders  The dilution was exacerbated by the terms of an  earlier share issuance agreement with Temasek, a Singapore sovereign wealth fund   This agreement granted Temasek a “make whole” provision if, within 12 months,  common stock was issued at a price below Temasek’s $48 per share investment  This  resulted in Merrill Lynch’s paying $25 billion to Temasek, which Temasek then  rolled into a new $34 billion share investment        Over the past month, the troubles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken   center stage  Rising loan delinquencies for prime single-family mortgages caused  share prices to plunge  This eroded confidence that the firms would be able to raise  new equity capital and raised concerns about the viability of these firms  This, in  turn, intensified the downward pressure on share prices  As a result, investors began  to lose their enthusiasm for the firms’ debt  Investors in short-term discount notes  were uninterested in taking on any potential credit risk  As a result, issuance volumes  fell, and discount note rates climbed (exhibits 9 and 10)  Some investors in the firms’  longer-term debt obligations—including some major foreign central banks—became  unwilling to add to their long-term agency debt and agency MBS positions, and one  or two of the central banks actually cut their positions somewhat  However, longer- term debt spreads did not change much because the loss of central bank demand was  offset by buying from US fixed-income asset managers, who believed that the  implicit Treasury support of GSE debt was likely to be hardened (exhibit 11)  Fannie  and Freddie responded by issuing less debt  To husband their liquidity, the two firms  have backed away from purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities for their own  portfolios  The removal of this bid was one factor that caused the mortgage basis— the spreads between the option-adjusted yield on agency MBS and other benchmark  yields, such as Treasuries and interest rate swaps—to widen significantly (exhibit 12)       The Congress responded by enacting housing legislation that included provisions   that hardened the implicit government guarantee and, thus, reduced debt rollover risk   The Treasury now has authority to lend the GSEs an unlimited amount of funds, the  magnitude being constrained only by the debt-limit ceiling  In response, discount  note issuance costs have fallen in the most recent auctions  However, enactment of  the legislation has not generated any comparable narrowing in the mortgage basis or  resolved the longer-term outlook for the GSEs  The mortgage basis remains wide in  part because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have few incentives to expand their  balance sheets  Although their regulatory capital is still well above minimum levels,  these capital standards are under review  Moreover, because further losses are likely  in coming quarters, it is unclear how long this excess capital will be available to  support portfolio growth  Of course, the two firms could respond by issuing new  equity  However, the low level of these companies’ share prices makes this option  unattractive  To raise sufficient funds to ensure long-term viability would cause  massive dilution for existing shareholders  To put this in perspective, the current  market capitalization of Freddie Mac is only about $5 billion  This compares with a   August 5, 2008 5 of 145    book of business in terms of its portfolio and guaranteed book of $22 trillion   Because the GSEs will likely remain reluctant to expand their balance sheets in the  near term, the mortgage basis will probably remain elevated, keeping mortgage rates  high  This will intensify the downward pressure on housing activity and prices,  which in turn will lead to greater loan delinquencies and losses  The consequence  will likely put further pressure on Fannie’s and Freddie’s capital positions  So what’s  the bottom line?  In my view, the legislation has helped to avert—at least for now—a  meltdown in the agency debt and agency MBS markets  But the passage is no  panacea for ensuring the viability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or in enabling the  two firms to provide significant support to the US housing market       One consequence of the GSE-related turbulence was a temporary pickup in   demand in the most recent schedule 1 TSLF auction, on July 25 (exhibit 13)  As term  mortgage agency repo spreads widened relative to term Treasury repo rates, the cost  of borrowing via the TSLF became more attractive  This illustrates how the TSLF  program can act as a shock absorber and reduce volatility in term repo rates  With the  exception of the July 25 auction, the TSLF auctions continue to be undersubscribed  with relatively stable bid-to-cover ratios     In contrast to the turbulence evident in the financial sector, the bank term funding   markets have been relatively stable since the June FOMC meeting  As shown in  exhibits 14 and 15, the spreads of one-month LIBOR and three-month LIBOR to OIS  remain elevated in the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom  However,  this masks the fact that forward funding rates appear to have risen significantly  As  shown in exhibit 16, the forward three-month LIBOR–OIS spread has risen about  20 basis points over the past three months  This spread is now anticipated to remain  elevated at around 50 basis points on a one-to-two-year time horizon, indicating that  market participants expect term funding pressures to persist for the foreseeable future   Before the crisis, the spread was about 10 basis points     The US TAF auctions also show a stable trend  As shown in exhibit 17, the bid-  to-cover ratio remains around 12 to 1, and the stop-out rate has been quite steady  over the past five auctions  In contrast, as shown in exhibit 18, the bid-to-cover ratio  for the ECB dollar auction continues to climb  As I noted in an earlier briefing, part  of this rise reflects the fact that the ECB auction is noncompetitive  The bids are  prorated, and the banks pay the US stop-out rate  Larger bids by European banks in  the ECB auction do not affect the interest rate they pay for such funding, and that  encourages more-aggressive bidding  Conversations with the ECB staff indicate that  they are concerned that the outcome could be a bidding spiral  Individual banks  could keep raising the size of their bid submissions to ensure a stable amount of  dollar funding  It is possible that these pressures could eventually encourage the ECB  to switch to a Swiss National Bank type of multiple-price auction  This would  eliminate the incentives to bid more and more aggressively on the part of the  European banks  However, such a change probably would result in a higher stop-out  rate in the ECB auctions compared with the United States or Switzerland  ECB  officials might not be fully comfortable with such an outcome      August 5, 2008 6 of 145      Early reactions by primary dealers and depository institutions to the two   refinements to our liquidity facilities—the $50 billion program of options on the  TSLF and the introduction of the longer, 84-day, maturity TAF auctions—have been  favorable  We recently—last Friday and this Monday—completed an extensive set of  interviews with the primary dealer community about the TSLF options program and  will be proposing final terms, within the set of parameters approved by the FOMC on  July 24, by the end of this week  Of course, we will keep you fully apprised as we go  forward on this       As you know, our liquidity facilities have placed significant demands on the   Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, as the Chairman mentioned  As the liquidity  facilities have been expanded, we have reduced the size of our Treasury portfolio   We do this to drain the reserves added by our liquidity programs  The use of our  balance sheet to sterilize these reserve additions has raised questions about whether  sufficient capacity is still available to meet prospective demand—especially a large  unanticipated rise in PDCF or PCF borrowing  Exhibit 19 illustrates the  transformation of the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheet over the past year, out  of Treasuries into non-Treasury lending  As shown in exhibit 20, the non-Treasury  portion consists mainly of $150 billion of TAF loans, the $62 billion (in steady state)  of foreign exchange swaps executed with the ECB and the SNB, and our $80 billion  28-day maturity, single-tranche repo program  Although the amount of Treasuries  held in the SOMA portfolio still totals $479 billion, a majority of these securities are  encumbered in one way or another  As shown in exhibit 21, from that $479 billion  we need to allocate $45 billion of Treasuries to collateralize the foreign central bank  repo pool, retain $35 billion of on-the-run Treasury securities to keep available for  our traditional Treasury securities lending program, and set aside $175 billion for the  TSLF program and now an additional $50 billion for the TSLF options program  (TOP)  When the options program is included, we have about $174 billion of  unencumbered Treasuries available to offset additional PCF and PDCF borrowing or  to fund further expansion of our liquidity programs  Obviously, further expansion of  our TAF or TSLF auctions or single-tranche repo operations would be at our  discretion and, thus, does not pose a meaningful problem in terms of reserve  management  We wouldn’t expand these programs if we didn’t have the ability to  conduct offsetting reserve draining operations  However, what would we do if faced  with a huge rise in PCF or PDCF borrowing?  An inability to drain the reserves added  by such lending would cause the federal funds rate to collapse below the target     Fortunately, we have a number of alternatives that would enable us to offset very   large demands for PCF or PDCF borrowing  First, we could sell our remaining  unencumbered Treasury holdings or use them to engage in reverse repo operations  with the primary dealer community  This could be augmented by the $35 billion of  on-the-run Treasury securities currently set aside for securities lending  Together,  these two sources could be used to drain more than $200 billion of reserves  Second,  we have made arrangements with the Treasury so that, if the need arises, the Treasury  would issue special Treasury bills into the market on our behalf and take the proceeds   August 5, 2008 7 of 145    and deposit them at the Federal Reserve  Putting the proceeds of such T-bill sales on  the Fed’s balance sheet would drain reserves from the banking system  The potential  scope here is large  The housing legislation raised the debt limit substantially  There  is now about $12 trillion of headroom under the debt limit compared with only about  $400 billion previously  Third, we continue to press for legislation that would  accelerate the timing of the Federal Reserve’s authority to pay interest on reserves   Being able to pay interest on reserves would put a floor under the federal funds rate   In this case, an inability to drain additional reserves from the banking system would  not result in the federal funds rate collapsing toward zero  Finally, we continue to  explore the legal and operational feasibility of expanding our balance sheet in other  ways  For example, could we engage in reverse repurchase transactions using the  collateral obtained from our single-tranche repo and from our TSLF operations?      I wouldn’t say I am confident that we can handle any eventuality—after all, the   triparty repo system provides trillions of dollars of funding to the primary dealers  In  the unlikely event that it all came to us, we wouldn’t have the capacity to fully offset  it at present  But we could accommodate hundreds of billions of dollars of demand if  that proved to be necessary  That said, I want to go on record that any very large  unanticipated demand for funding from the Federal Reserve by dealers or depository  institutions might take a few days or more to offset by reserve-draining operations   Thus, in such a circumstance, the federal funds rate could temporarily trade below its  target       Turning now to interest rate expectations, monetary policy expectations have   reverted back to the very slow path toward tightening that was evident before the  April FOMC meeting  As shown in exhibits 22 and 23, the federal funds rate and  Eurodollar futures curves have shifted down sharply since the June FOMC meeting   Our current survey of the primary dealers shows an even slower anticipated pace of  tightening  As shown in exhibit 24, the average of the dealer forecasts in our most  recent survey anticipates no tightening until the second quarter of 2009  But the  change in the dealers’ forecasts since the June FOMC meeting is more modest than  the shift in market expectations (compare exhibits 24 and 25)  Looking at the  probabilities of different rate outcomes implied by options on federal funds rate  futures in exhibits 26 and 27, one sees that there has been a steady trend upward in  the probability that the FOMC will keep its policy target rate unchanged at both the  August and the September FOMC meetings  Note also that the probability assigned  by market participants to further easing is lower than the probability assigned to  tightening       The past month has been marked by a significant decline in commodity prices    As shown in exhibit 28, although the energy complex has led the way down,  agriculture and industrial metals prices have also declined significantly  These  declines have spurred a large decline in breakeven rates of inflation measured by the  spread of nominal Treasury and TIPS yields (exhibit 29)  As shown in exhibit 30,  longer-term market-based indicators of inflation expectations have increased a bit   Both the Barclays’ and the Board staff’s measures of five-year, five-year-forward   August 5, 2008 8 of 145    inflation implied by nominal Treasury versus TIPS yields have drifted upward since  the June FOMC meeting  However, both measures remain well below the peaks  reached in early March     There were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote to ratify the   operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the June FOMC  meeting  As always, I am very happy to take any questions      Okay  That is a big question  [Laughter]    I think the first thing we can say is that market participants expect this   to last a long time  The fact that the forward LIBOR–OIS spreads are elevated, looking out a   August 5, 2008 9 of 145    year or two years, suggests that the market views the balance sheet adjustment process as taking   quite a long time  Second, I would say that how long is really going to depend in part on how   the macroeconomy evolves  If the macroeconomy evolves in a favorable way, then the losses   that will be borne by the financial sector will be discretely smaller, and so you can get through   this process sooner  In contrast, if the economy has a bad macroeconomic outcome, then   obviously this is going to be a lot worse  We don’t really know the answer to that yet  Part of   that is also going to be very sensitive to what happens in terms of individual institutions over the   next 6 to 12 months because we are putting a tremendous amount of strain on the financial   sector  If there is little breakage, then the chance of our getting through relatively quickly, say in   12 months, is pretty high  But if that stress creates failures and systemic contagion because of   those failures, then this could last quite a long time  So the answer is that we don’t really know   yet  I think there is a long way to go  We are about one year in, by my measure  I date this back   to August 9, when the ECB did their massive reserve intervention  So I wouldn’t want to make a   bet on what inning this is, but it is definitely not the ninth inning    I think it is a fair point that we shouldn’t assume that “normal” is   returning to the LIBOR–OIS spreads that applied before August 2007, so we have to look at a   broader set of indicators  For example, I think that it would be worthwhile looking at the spread   between jumbo mortgage rates and conforming mortgage rates as evidence of the degree of the   shadow price of balance sheet capacity  I think that, once financial institutions either raise   sufficient capital or stop taking loan-loss provisions or writing down assets so that they have   enough capacity to expand their balance sheets, we will be getting to the end of this process   Another thing I would say to add to the answer I gave earlier to President Evans is that   the trajectory of housing in all of this is going to be hugely important  One thing that may signal   the next phase, maybe the beginning of the end, is when people really do get a sign that the   housing sector is starting to bottom, probably first in activity and then in price  Once that   happens, the huge risk premium embedded in some of these mortgage-related assets will then   collapse  That means that the mark-to-market losses in a lot of institutions will start to fall  So I   think that is going to be a very, very important metric once housing starts to really bottom and   August 5, 2008 11 of 145    people get some visibility about how much home prices will go down  You know, when the   argument is about whether home prices are going to go down 15 percent or 20 percent, that will   be a very different argument from the argument now, which is whether home prices are going to   go down 15 percent or 30 percent    I think that the market function has varied, frankly  In the middle of the   GSE turmoil, the agency market was basically shut down  With the passage of the legislation, it   has improved  Haircuts are still quite elevated  Liquidity is certainly not as good as it was back   before this crisis  The cost of funding through the FX swap market is still very elevated relative   to LIBOR  I think things are improving, though, in the sense that shocks are not as broadly   contagious as they were before  The reason is that people now are pretty cognizant of what the   problems are; and so when there are new, bad pieces of information, people aren’t quite as   shocked, and they don’t revise their outlook to the same degree about a whole variety of asset   classes  But I think that is why the correlation slide that I showed you in the exhibits showed   less of a correlation between different asset classes  We are still getting tremendous amounts of   movement in asset prices, but it doesn’t seem as though, if something happens in one sector, it   necessarily ripples through to other sectors    I guess we don’t have a lot of observations to know what normal is in   that environment  I think that the markets are generally doing somewhat better, as I said, relative   to the flow of new information  I don’t think the information flow has improved, but I think the   markets are responding a little better to the bad information  That is how I would characterize it    I think the market is reacting pretty appropriately to the information it is   seeing, although I would say that the risk premiums are still high in a pretty broad array of assets   relative to what one would think would be normal  Haircuts are high, and market liquidity is still   August 5, 2008 13 of 145    impaired  We are definitely not back to normal market function in a pretty broad array of asset   classes    Yes  It is hard to benchmark how markets are supposed to behave in a   period with hundreds of billions of dollars of losses—because how many times have we actually   gone through this experience?    The effects of our actions have been to mitigate the rise in term funding   pressures and to somewhat mitigate the forced liquidation of collateral because of the inability to   obtain funding  Because of that, our actions have helped prevent the kind of pernicious margin   spiral that we saw in March, when volatility was going up and haircuts were going up, which   was then causing mark-to-market losses, which were causing forced selling  So I think our   actions have mitigated those to some degree  Now, obviously, we don’t know what the   counterfactual would have been in the absence of our actions, but I believe—and most market   participants believe—that our actions have been helpful in those respects    We have never argued that the role of our facilities is to prevent the   adjustment  We have always argued that the role of the facilities is to allow the adjustment to be   orderly rather than disorderly  That is what we have been going for    I think what makes it complicated, though, is that there’s a nonlinearity  If   the housing-price declines do turn out to be on the higher side, it then puts more stress on the   financial system and on credit availability, which then leads to a weaker economy, which then puts   more stress on the housing sector  So small differences in the path get amplified    I wasn’t really addressing the point estimate of where housing was going   as opposed to the uncertainty around that estimate  I would argue that the uncertainty around that   August 5, 2008 30 of 145    estimate is still quite wide  At some point it will be resolved  When it is resolved, that will be a   favorable development, but I don’t think we’re there yet    They’ve had to pay a lot for not very much insurance in the case of Merrill   Lynch  "
8527,2008-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am not going to go through this in  great detail  You can look at these charts at your leisure1  I am going to focus on                                                     1 The materials to which Mr Dudley refers are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 16, 2008 3 of 108    what is going on right now, how we have responded to it, and what I think the issues  are  Just to give you a snapshot of what has happened since Sunday evening, stocks  are down worldwide—4 percent plus everywhere  Yesterday, the US stock market  was down about 4½ percent, and S&P futures indicate a lower opening today  As you  might expect, there has been a big flight to quality, especially into the Treasury bill  market  Ten-year Treasury note yields fell about 30 basis points yesterday, and there  has been a big rally throughout the Treasury curve  The big thing, where there has  probably been the most severe stress in the market, is in dollar liquidity for foreign  banks  As you remember, foreign banks, especially in Europe, have a structural  dollar funding shortfall, and they look to execute foreign exchange swaps or borrow  in the dollar LIBOR market to fund that  There was significant upward pressure in  that market—overnight LIBOR rates today were 644 percent—and that pressure in  Europe is leaking over into our market  Yesterday the federal funds rate opened at     3 to 3½ percent  Despite our doing a $20 billion repo at our normal 930 am time,  the upward pressure on the funds rate yesterday continued  It rose to as high as          6 percent in the late morning, and that is why we came in with a second operation of  $50 billion around noon yesterday     To try to have more effect on this issue, this morning we came in much earlier   than we normally do—around 800 am  We did a $50 billion overnight repo  The  funds rate at the time was trading at 3¼ percent  I think this means that we are  obviously adding way too many reserves for the current maintenance period; but the  good news is that, when this maintenance period is over a week from tomorrow, we  get a fresh start  So at the current time I think we will see essentially a lot of firmness  in the funds rate in the morning and then the funds rate trading down to zero late in  the day  Where the funds rate averages relative to the target is going to be somewhat  difficult to say  Yesterday, despite the collapse in the funds rate to essentially zero at  the end of the day, the funds rate was quite firm relative to the target  I don’t  remember the numbers, but it was in the 2½ percent range  We are going to try to hit  the target on average, but it is going to be very difficult  In the current circumstances,  it probably is more sensible—at least my advice would be—to err on the side of  providing enough liquidity to the market rather than trying to be cute and worrying  just about the target federal funds rate     Now, the Lehman filing has also intensified the pressure on Morgan Stanley and   Goldman Sachs in a number of respects  The Lehman failure means that investors  now view the debt of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as having much more risk  than it did on Sunday  This means that these firms need bigger liquidity buffers than  they had before, and it does have implications for long-term profitability  As a  consequence, their share prices fell very sharply yesterday  Morgan Stanley was  down about $5 a share, to $32, and Goldman Sachs’s stock was off 18 points, to  $135  Morgan Stanley experienced a modest, but not insignificant, pulling back of  their counterparties and ate into their liquidity buffer by a measurable degree  The  Lehman problems also were evident in some other areas  This is very incomplete, but  the ones that came to my attention were money market funds—especially, the  Reserve Fund that had large withdrawals, and they encountered a significant liquidity   September 16, 2008 4 of 108    problem  I am actually not sure how that was resolved, but I think that State Street  was in the situation of having to cover a very large shortfall of the Reserve Fund last  night  The risk here, of course, is that, if AIG were to fail, money funds have even a  broader exposure to them than to Lehman, and so breaking the buck on the money  market funds is a real risk  The capital resources of the entities that are associated  with the money market funds often are quite modest, so their ability to top up the  money funds and keep them whole is quite limited  Thus the money market funds are  definitely one important issue in how this contagion could be broader     The second issue is the people who are dealing with Lehman and who have   positions with Lehman as their counterparty and how they wind up those positions   As you know, the parent filed for bankruptcy, but the US broker-dealer is still in  operation  But being in operation doesn’t mean that they are necessarily conducting  business in a normal way  One issue that has received a lot of attention is from some  of the asset managers on their mortgage TBA positions with Lehman  Apparently,  the sell side can net these up pretty easily through the FICC (Fixed Income Clearing  Corporation), but the asset managers have positions with Lehman to either take on  mortgage-backed securities or to sell mortgage-backed securities on a forward basis,  and they are not really sure what those positions are going to be when we get to that  date  Lehman was not executing those trades yesterday, and so these asset managers  are in the very unfortunate position of not knowing what to do  Do they offset their  Lehman position with a trade elsewhere or not?  So that has been another very open- ended issue for the market  In terms of market function yesterday, it was manageable  in the sense that markets did trade  But I think it is much too soon to think that we  are going to make it through just based on yesterday’s move because that move, even  though it wasn’t particularly severe in terms of, for example, the share price  movement, did cause quite a bit of damage, and people are still pulling away       Of course, we also have the issue of AIG  The AIG problem is at least starting as   a liquidity crisis  The problem with AIG is that the parent company doesn’t have a  lot of liquidity resources and doesn’t have easy ability to funnel liquidity up from  their subsidiaries because most of the subsidiaries are regulated entities  So AIG is  running into two problems  One, they are unable to roll their commercial paper and,  two, as their ratings are downgraded—they were downgraded by Moody’s yesterday,  I think from AA minus to A minus, but don’t quote me on that—they have to post a  lot more collateral against their derivatives exposures and also with respect to their  GIC (guaranteed investment contract) business  So AIG is in a situation in which the  parent is basically going to run out of money—today, tomorrow, Thursday, or very,  very soon  Now we say it’s a liquidity thing, but a lot of times when people look  closer at the books they find out that the liquidity crisis may also be a solvency issue   I think it is still a little unclear whether AIG’s problems are confined just to liquidity   It also may be an issue of how much this company is really worth     Finally, let me talk a bit about the facilities that we introduced over the weekend    Basically, we did two things  We broadened the Primary Dealer Credit Facility  (PDCF) significantly in terms of collateral eligibility  Whereas, before, the PDCF   September 16, 2008 5 of 108    took investment-grade securities only, we broadened it to include basically everything  that is in the tri-party repo system  We felt that, by backstopping the tri-party repo  system completely, we would reassure tri-party investors that they didn’t face rollover  risk, and so we would keep tri-party investors investing with the banks  That seems  to be mostly what happened, at least yesterday  We did get quite a bit of PDCF  borrowing yesterday evening, but it was predominantly Lehman  It was about $28  billion of Lehman borrowing  I think the total borrowing was something on the order  of $42 billion  That is telling you that most of the borrowing we had was associated  with Lehman’s not being able to roll over their tri-party repo positions with their  investors  We don’t really know the reasons for the other borrowing, but it probably  was mostly to test the facility as opposed to actual need  So broadening the PDCF  collateral eligibility does seem to be working, so far at least, in keeping tri-party  investors in the game and continuing to provide funds to the other primary dealers     The second thing we did was to the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF)  In   terms of the collateral requirements, that had been AAA-rated RMBS, CMBS, and  asset-backed securities  We broadened that collateral, so the terms are now the same  as the old Primary Dealer Credit Facility  We think that there is quite a bit of  collateral that the primary dealers have in those AA, A, and BBB classes of asset- backed securities, CMBS, and RMBS  So we think that is going to provide more  support to the primary dealers in terms of funding their liquid collateral in this  environment  We also increased the size  The original authorization was for $200  billion  Our auction schedule had been $175 billion, and we put that $25 billion  increase into schedule 2  Remember, there are schedules 1 and 2  Schedule 1 is  Treasuries and agencies  Schedule 2 is Treasuries, agencies, and this other stuff  So  the schedule 2 auctions are going to go up in size, and we frontloaded that increase  because the TSLF has not been fully subscribed  We are actually going to be able to  do two TSLF schedule 2 auctions this week of $35 billion, so we are going to get  quite a bit of TSLF liquidity into the market this week, which we think will also be  helpful     So that is where things stand  Otherwise, I think things in the market are doing   what you would expect  There is a flight to quality  The Japanese yen and the Swiss  franc are outperforming  The dollar is sort of in the middle, and the high-yielding  currencies continue to be under pressure  But that is just what we have seen for the  last year underlying these risk trades  I have a lot more material, so if you ask  questions I can get into that  But I think I will just leave it there      That was not actually even known until late yesterday evening  It takes   a while for us to get the reports from the clearing bank to be able to go through and tell you what   the collateral is  In terms of the Lehman collateral, they are not allowed to broaden the PDCF—  they are basically bringing us the stuff they had on Friday  It is also important to recognize that   for Lehman we are demanding a lot higher collateral requirements on the non-Treasury and non-  agency securities  Their collateral haircut for those is 20 percent  So the Fed is taking some   credit exposure there, but we put in place on Friday—and we are continuing that—a 20 percent   collateral haircut on the non-Treasury and non-agency stuff that is in the PDCF for that exposure   to Lehman  We think that’s about roughly three times the market level that investors had been   charging previously, so I think that gives us a fair degree of protection    At this time, I believe that is right    Well, I guess the first thing I would say is that you are absolutely right    If investors pull away, they have to take their money somewhere  It doesn’t disappear  I think   that the Primary Dealer Credit Facility has been shown to be pretty significant in providing   support to this market  If you look at what happened to Lehman, for example, even though   Lehman was under extreme pressure on Friday, the tri-party repo investors stayed with Lehman   on Friday night, which actually surprised me  I think the reason that they stayed is that they   knew they didn’t really have a lot of rollover risk  As long as the broker-dealer didn’t file for   bankruptcy over the weekend—and that was the risk they really were taking—the Federal   Reserve and the PDCF would be there as the tri-party repo investor of last resort  Lehman’s   experience suggests to me that, if we can contain the broad parameters of this crisis so that it   September 16, 2008 8 of 108    doesn’t spread much further, then we can keep the tri-party repo investors from bolting because   they don’t really have a huge amount of risk as long as we are there behind them to take them out   when their overnight obligation comes due the next day    Well, I’m not sure about that  I thought that there was an issue about   broker-dealer filing  I know that the clearing banks are certainly quite nervous about that   eventuality, but I’m not a lawyer      We give them Treasuries, and they give us other stuff  You know, this   will also probably be helpful this week in providing more Treasuries to the market  There was a   tremendous amount of Treasury fails yesterday  So this mechanism does two things  It takes   illiquid collateral from the dealers, and it also supplies a lot of Treasuries to the market, which   should help improve the market function in Treasuries    I have just sketchy details based on a phone call, so this may not be   quite right  But my understanding is that this morning Norway put in place a facility by which   September 16, 2008 9 of 108    they are going to offer their banks dollars, up to $5 billion, on a one-week term—sort of an open   facility  The fact that Norway is doing this suggests that the situation has broadened quite a bit   further because this is the first time that we have heard about Norway in this story, except for   maybe some exposures to the Icelandic banks   I have had some conversations with my counterparts at the ECB this morning—this is at   a staff level, so I can’t really say what would happen if you were to take this up the chain of   command  But certainly, at least on a preliminary basis, there is quite a bit of interest in having a   similar facility for the ECB, which would not be a TAF loan type of facility but more of an open   facility where European banks could come and get dollars  This would reassure people that   dollar liquidity was available in Europe throughout the European day  My advice to you is that   this is probably a good idea in this environment because we are seeing that the lack of dollar   liquidity in Europe is really having a feedback effect on people’s willingness to do business with   one other in the broader markets  I think we should be open to doing this with the ECB and   perhaps with the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan as well—at least have the ability to do   it should it prove necessary    The Bank of Japan has requested at the staff level to set up a facility that   would be on the shelf for year-end because the Japanese are quite worried that their banks are   going to face a dollar funding problem at year-end  Now, this preceded the recent crisis, so even   before this last week they were concerned that the Japanese banks could potentially have   problems, and they were interested in exploring with us having a facility in place  We were   actually going to pursue this, and I hope we will have more at the October FOMC meeting if not   sooner    Certainly you want to make it pretty broad  You want to make it to the   Bank of England, Switzerland, the ECB, the Bank of Japan, potentially Canada  I would leave it   to their discretion if they would like to participate  I would make the offer to them; and if they   want to participate, then we should be willing to do that  In terms of size, I think it is really   important that you don’t create notions of capacity limits because the market then can always try   to test those  Either the numbers have to be very, very large, or it should be open ended  I would   suggest that open ended is better because then you really do provide a backstop for the entire   market  As we’ve seen with the PDCF, if you provide a suitably broad backstop, oftentimes you   don’t even actually need to use it to any great degree  So I think that should be the strategy here    European banks?    I don’t know    Do you mean in terms of their dollar foreign exchange reserves?    I don’t have the numbers    No    In principle, we could talk to the ECB and other central banks about   having the rate on these swap lines be at a slight penalty relative to normal times to try to   mitigate the potential reserve impact  I mean, it doesn’t have to be at 2 percent or 2¼ percent for   overnight funds—it could be somewhat north of that  But if we have a credible backstop, then it   should calm the markets, and then the backstop should not be used  If we have a backstop and it   actually is used, that is presumably because market conditions are horrific  So in that   environment, you could argue that the reserve-management things are very second order   concerns in some sense    Well, I think we are going to have discussions with our foreign   counterparts to decide what the right strategy is  I think right now it is better to have it open   ended     No, I think they have to take it up the chain of command, just as we do   here  So it’s going to take probably a day    I think it would be after we’ve had a chance—I mean, I think we have a   lot of work to do with our foreign counterparties  This was basically raised to me this morning     Yes  We have authorities extending right now to January 30 for a lot of   these facilities, so that would certainly be a reasonable time frame, I think    I presume so    Yes, this is about the major financial centers and the ability of large   banks that operate globally to obtain dollar funding    I think a lot of the programs that we have are actually open ended  The   discount window is open ended in the sense that it’s limited only by the amount of collateral that the   banks post there  The Primary Dealer Credit Facility is open ended in that it is limited only by the   size of the tri-party repo system  My point here is that, if foreign banks worry about capacity limits,   even having a large program could in principle not be sufficient in extremis  But if the program is   open ended, the rollover risk problem goes away  If I lend you more dollars today, I don’t have to   worry about getting those dollars back because I always know that the facility is there  So it’s really   the elimination of the ability to flatten out your position if you need to in terms of your dollar   exposures    I think that remains to be discussed with our counterparties  I think we   need to have discussions about what would be most effective  Would a big size that’s fixed in   quantity be most effective?  Would an open limit be most effective?  I think we have to have those   discussions  I think the important thing here—and what we’re going for—is credibility  In a crisis   you need enough force—more force than the market thinks is necessary to solve the problem—and   we’re going to have to have discussions to determine how much is enough force   September 16, 2008 17 of 108     If I could add a few thoughts on market expectations about this meeting—I   think it looks as though easing is priced in for two reasons  One, dealers do expect the federal funds   rate to trade soft as we add excess reserves, so I would not take the softness in the September federal   funds futures contract as indicative of necessarily expecting an easing  Two, I think it is important   to recognize that the rates embodied in those fed fund futures contracts are means not modes  So I   September 16, 2008 26 of 108    would characterize the market expectation as either that things get very, very bad and the FOMC   cuts rates significantly or that the FOMC does nothing   I think that actually a 25 basis point cut is probably the least likely outcome that the market   anticipates  As evidence of this, a couple of dealers yesterday did change their forecast to a 50 basis   point rate cut  I’m not aware of anybody who has changed to 25  Probably people like that are out   there  I know that my colleagues at Goldman Sachs, where I used to work, are saying that they   think the FOMC is going to keep rates unchanged today but, if they were to move, it would be 50    That gives you a sense that it’s really a bimodal kind of view and that putting different probabilities   on 50 and zero gives you some easing priced into the federal funds rate futures market  So I think   the consensus view still in the marketplace is that the Fed probably will not cut rates today  That   would be a disappointment to a degree because there’s some probability placed on the idea that the   Fed might do 50, but that’s how I would interpret what’s priced into the markets today    Well, I think the market participants would gain some comfort to the   extent that the Federal Reserve as an institution indicates concern about what’s going on in the   financial markets  But in some ways the Desk has already signaled that concern by its intervention,   so I’m not sure that additional indications are needed  But in the language you might want to   indicate to market participants that, if things were to materially worsen in the financial markets, the   Committee might revisit the issue of where the federal funds rate should be   September 16, 2008 27 of 108     That is true  I think on Friday the mood was basically that the funds rate   was going to be flat for a long time  Probabilities placed on either easing or tightening were quite   low, and since then the probability of easing has gone up fairly significantly  But I think it’s hard to   interpret because it’s really not about 25 versus zero  It’s really about zero versus 50 or maybe even   100 as you look out longer term  Either the financial system is going to implode in a major way,   which will lead to a significant further easing, or it is not    I would say that the markets will take it as a statement that is   conditional on what happens in markets  If markets get sufficiently bad, if there is some   threshold of deterioration, that can potentially provoke an intermeeting move is the way I think   they would take it  Brian, would you agree with that?   September 16, 2008 79 of 108     I think the expectation going in is, for most people, that you are not   prepared to ease today, but if things got really dark from here you would  So the question is,   How do you convey that with the right word?  You need something in between “closely” and—    “The Committee will carefully evaluate economic and financial market   developments”  That means you are on the case  "
8549,2008-09-29,"  Okay  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with the foreign  exchange swap lines, and then I’ll talk a bit about the TAF increases and about the  balance sheet  I think Brian later is going to talk about interest on reserves in more  detail        September 29, 2008 3 of 16    All of the foreign central banks that have obtained dollar swap lines in response to  dollar funding pressures in their home markets have decided, with some encouragement  on our part, to seek an increase in the size of these swap line authorizations  We just  have to hear from the Bank of Japan—I think that’s the only one that’s outstanding—but  we expect to hear that shortly  The actual draws on these lines may turn out to be  considerably less, and the amounts that are actually drawn are likely to depend on  market conditions  The large increase in authorization should be considered as  insurance in case market conditions continue to deteriorate and as reassurance to market  participants that the world’s major central banks are determined to respond in force to  mitigate dollar funding pressures  By foreign central banks, the current lines are being  doubled for the larger participants and tripled for the smaller participants  The increases  are as follows, very quickly  the Bank of Canada, $30 billion from $10 billion; the Bank  of England, $80 billion from $40 billion; the Bank of Japan, $120 billion from  $60 billion; the National Bank of Denmark, $15 billion from $5 billion; the ECB,  $240 billion from $120 billion; the Bank of Norway, $15 billion from $5 billion; the  Reserve Bank of Australia, $30 billion from $10 billion; the Swedish Riksbank,  $30 billion from $10 billion; and the Swiss National Bank, $60 billion from $30 billion   Adding up all of this would result in an increase in our swap line authorization to  $620 billion from $290 billion previously  I think that these decisions have been made  in response to the increasing turmoil evident in interbank markets, especially for dollar  funding; and by increasing the size of the authorization significantly, the intention is to  reassure market participants that sufficient dollar funding will be available well into  2009     The staff believes that these large increases are appropriate to reassure market   participants that the world’s central banks are prepared to take extraordinary steps as  needed to address ongoing strains in financial markets  These strains are evident in a  number of ways  First, we’ve seen a sharp rise in overnight dollar funding rates and in  term LIBOR–OIS spreads  For example, on Friday, the three-month LIBOR–OIS  spread was over 200 basis points, and in fact, LIBOR may actually understate the degree  of funding pressure  The NYFR index, which is the US-based alternative to LIBOR,  has actually been much higher than LIBOR over the past week or two  So LIBOR  actually may be understated  Second, there have been many anecdotal reports of a  withdrawal of counterparties’ willingness to engage in term funding activity  So the  tenor of almost all activity in the market now is overnight  Third, there are growing  liquidity strains at major financial institutions  Obviously, Wachovia is part of that  story  Fourth, we’ve seen a significant rise in the demand for our TSLF and TAF credit   For example, the stop-out rate for the most recent TAF auction, which was a 28-day  maturity auction, was 375 percent, significantly above the one-month LIBOR rate at the  time  Fifth, we’ve seen a sharp rise in PCF and PDCF borrowings  For example, on the  week ending last Wednesday, PCF credit was $394 billion, an increase of about  $18 billion from the previous week, and PDCF borrowing was $88 billion in the latest  week, up $68 billion from the previous week  Last, European banking strains have been  increasingly evident in recent days, especially this weekend following the announcement  of the Fortis rescue and the nationalization of B&B in the United Kingdom  The  European banking news has led to a sharp drop in the European equity markets—this   September 29, 2008 4 of 16    morning they’re down 2 to 3 percent—and the euro and sterling exchange rates have  dropped quite sharply against the dollar, down about 2 percent     Now, along with this increase in authorized swap lines, Chairman Bernanke has   approved the staff recommendation for a large increase in our term auction facility  (TAF) program  We are proposing two changes in the TAF program  First, we’re  proposing to increase the 84-day TAF auction sizes to $75 billion per auction, from $25  billion  That will start with the next 84-day auction that was scheduled for October 6   The second change is that the Chairman has approved two forward TAF auctions  totaling $150 billion  These auctions would take place in November, and they would  auction short-dated TAF funds for one-week or two-week terms over year-end   Together, these two changes to the TAF program would increase the supply of TAF  credit to $450 billion, from $150 billion currently  The notion is that a larger  commitment to TAF funding should help ameliorate market concerns about the  availability of term funding and about the availability of such funding over year-end   The effective dates for the swap lines and all the programs will be extended, I think, to  April 30, 2009  This would enable the foreign central banks to extend 84-day TAF  credit through year-end under their swap agreements     Obviously, these commitments are likely to put considerable further strain on the   Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  In recent days we have been offsetting the large  reserve additions with the Treasury SFP (supplementary financing program) cash- management bill issuance  After this week’s scheduled bill issuance, the total amount of  outstanding SFP obligations will reach $400 billion  However, we cannot rely on this  program indefinitely because the Treasury’s room under the debt limit ceiling is about  $900 billion as of early last week and is shrinking rapidly because of the SFP and other  ongoing funding commitments     PARTICIPANT  It’s impossible to hear      I’ll make sure everything is off  Probably I’m the culprit  Poetic  justice  Let me just repeat the last stuff on the SFP  After this week’s scheduled bill  issuance, the total amount of SFP obligations will be $400 billion  We can’t keep  relying on that program indefinitely, though, because the Treasury’s room under the  debt limit ceiling, which was $900 billion as of early last week, is shrinking rapidly  because of that program and other ongoing funding commitments  So that’s where the  interest on reserves legislation comes in  Assuming that the Congress enacts that  legislation this week, we will be able to pay interest on reserves  I’ll leave that to Brian  to talk about in more detail  Thank you  I’m happy to take any questions      September 29, 2008 5 of 16     At 10 am    Yes    Just the swap lines  The TAF program doesn’t need an authorization   because it is just within the discount window program    I think that’s correct  Our strategy all along has been not to prevent the   deleveraging or the unwinding that developed earlier but to stretch it out a little so fewer things   break  The swap lines are just one more tool to help that process unfold without severe systemic   consequences occurring  Obviously, things are breaking, even with all the tools that we’ve rolled   out  So I think that just suggests that more force needs to be applied  Clearly, confidence in the   markets is extraordinarily poor and fragile, and that’s another reason that an escalation in the   authorizations is important—to reassure people that the central banks are prepared to be there, if   necessary    We’re looking at a lot of different things to potentially make the   management of reserves more effective and to provide more support for the market  But we don’t   have anything that is close to being put forward at this time  We’re always looking at   contingencies, what other tools are available, and what other options might be available, but there’s   nothing that I would say is imminent  "
8560,2008-10-07,"  Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Despite our massive escalation  on the liquidity provision front and passage of legislation granting the Treasury authority   October 7, 2008 3 of 30    to set up a $700 billion troubled asset relief program, or TARP, market conditions  continue to deteriorate  This is occurring in three broad respects     First, market participants continue to pull back in their willingness to engage with   one another  This pullback is evident in elevated interbank lending rates and elevated  foreign exchange swap bases and market liquidity more generally  The one-month and  three-month LIBOR–OIS spreads have widened to 271 and 296 basis points,  respectively  That is up more than 175 basis points in the past three weeks since the  September 16 FOMC meeting  The all-in cost of dollar funding via the foreign  exchange swap market, although bouncing around day to day, has actually been even  higher than LIBOR, often by 100 basis points or more  In addition to the interbank  market, the commercial paper market has come under stress  The breaking of the buck  by the Reserve Fund led to a wholesale flight out of prime institutional money market  funds  This forced the liquidation of assets, which has led to impairment of the  commercial paper market  Term commercial paper rates are elevated, and the average  tenor of commercial paper has shortened considerably     Second, financial conditions continue to tighten, and in recent weeks, the tightening   has been substantial  Equity prices have plunged both in the United States and abroad   Corporate bond yields, especially for non-investment-grade debt, have increased  substantially  Short- and long-term tax-exempt rates have climbed, and credit  availability has been even further impaired  On the equity market side, for example, the  S&P 500 index has fallen about 18 percent since the September 16 FOMC meeting   Although there is considerable uncertainty about the appropriate metrics and weights to  use in examining the evolution of financial conditions over time, most data are  consistent with the judgment that conditions have tightened significantly since the onset  of the crisis, despite the 325 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate target   Compared with the previous two monetary policy easing cycles, there have been four  important divergences  First, corporate bond yields have climbed  In previous cycles,  the widening credit spreads were more than offset by the decline in Treasury note and  bond yields, causing corporate bond yields to fall  Second, credit availability has  declined greatly in this cycle  In the two previous cycles, the proportion of banks  tightening credit standards actually fell through the easing cycle  That stands in sharp  contrast to what has been happening in this cycle  Third, housing price declines have  been far larger than in previous cycles, in real and in nominal terms  Fourth, the dollar  has weakened actually much less than in the previous two easing cycles     The third aspect of the market that I think warrants noting is that the US financial   sector in particular remains under pressure, especially with respect to share prices and  banks’ ability to obtain funding, especially term funding  Today was a particularly bad  day for financial shares, with double-digit declines common for many banks  The only  good news was that credit default swaps actually narrowed a bit, maybe helped by the  introduction of our commercial paper backstop facility or the fact that we’ve escalated  so massively in terms of the term auction facility and the foreign exchange swaps with  our foreign central bank counterparts        October 7, 2008 4 of 30    On the inflation side of the ledger, pressures continue to abate  Since the last FOMC  meeting, both industrial and agricultural commodity price indexes have fallen about  15 percent  At the same time, the dollar has strengthened  The fall in the commodity  prices and the strength in the dollar are two factors that have contributed to a fall in  breakeven measures of inflation on both the spot and the five-year, five-year-forward  basis  For example, the Barclays measure of five-year, five-year-forward breakeven  inflation has declined more than 60 basis points since the September FOMC meeting   Today it was around 15 percent     The interbank, money market, and capital market dysfunction, the tightening of   financial conditions, and the apparent easing in inflation risks have caused investors to  conclude that the FOMC is likely to lower its federal funds rate target in the near future   Late today, the November federal funds futures contract implied an effective rate for the  coming month of about 14 percent  That’s more than 50 basis points below the current  target  Interestingly, the failure of the FOMC to ease today actually led to a rise in  October and November federal funds futures contracts  Market participants presumably  interpreted the introduction of the commercial paper funding facility as potentially a  substitute for further monetary policy accommodation at this time  Obviously, this is an  extremely fragile and dangerous environment  I am struck by the feeble market  response to the substantial escalations implemented over the past ten days  These  include expanding standing foreign exchange swap facilities’ capacity to $620 billion  from $290 billion; expanding the TAF auction cycles to $900 billion from $150 billion;  and proposing a major backstop for the commercial paper market  With respect to the  commercial paper market backstop facility, the market reaction today was generally  positive, but market participants clearly want to know more in terms of the specifics,  especially when the program will be up and operational  Of course, I’m happy to take  any questions      Yes  The markets didn’t take as much solace as I would have hoped, given   the degree of escalation of those provisions    Well, for example, I would expect that LIBOR–OIS spreads might narrow   rather than widen  I might expect that equity prices would have taken some comfort from our   efforts  So generally I think the reaction was somewhat disappointing, frankly    Well, a fair point is that the Federal Reserve cannot by its actions solve the   balance sheet constraints of the US banking system  The Federal Reserve by its actions cannot   create capital for banks, and that’s obviously one of the problems at the core of what is going on in   the financial system    The LIBOR panel may understate the pressure on funding costs for some   banks  But if you remember, the way the LIBOR is calculated, it actually is a truncated sample size    They throw out the highs, and they throw out the lows  They get the median of people in that   market  Also, other measures, such as the New York NYFR, have actually tended to be elevated   relative to LIBOR, and the FX swap rate—the all-in basis for dollar funding in the FX swap   market—has actually been elevated relative to LIBOR  So I think that what we’re seeing in the   LIBOR market is a pretty fair indication of the strains in term funding markets    I think the reality right now is that LIBOR does not mean very much   because there’s very little term funding going on at all  So I think that there are rates that are posted   in LIBOR, and they pull them off  But you could argue that in some ways it’s even worse than the   rate that is posted because, according to the reports that we’ve gotten, there’s just very little activity   at term not just in the interbank market but in the broad array of markets    Well, I wouldn’t go quite that far  Where it is today tells you that there’s   significant strain  I wouldn’t say that, if it goes up 10 basis points tomorrow or down 10 basis   points tomorrow, I would conclude that the strains had lessened    Well, the escalation in the size of the TAF auction was obviously quite   significant, and I think that it tells you two things  Maybe there are limits to the demand for term   funding, and maybe it represents a constraint in terms of collateral pledged at the discount window,   especially given the fact that we announced the auction on Monday morning and the auction   happened Monday afternoon  So it is very possible that there was a bit of a lag in terms of the   ability to mobilize collateral or take advantage of that auction capacity  I thought it was actually   pretty well subscribed  I think it was $130-something billion in bids for $150 billion of available   credit  So in retrospect, I think that it was sized about right    Sure  I think those figures are the right order of magnitude  I looked at   some figures today that, based on reasonable assumptions, you might expect the balance sheet to   grow to a high of $25 trillion to $3 trillion by the end of the year  Obviously, it depends on what   assumptions you make about the amount of TAF credit that is actually drawn down and the amount   of swaps that are actually drawn down  But it could be that order of magnitude, and that would be   exceptional  That’s why getting interest-on-reserves authority was very, very important  As Brian   has said in earlier briefings, interest on reserves is going to start on Thursday, and that’s going to   place a floor on the federal funds rate  So we think we’re in a situation where we have a very   important tool that will allow us to expand the balance sheet but maintain control of the federal   funds rate  So we’re not going to be compromising monetary policy  "
8584,2008-10-28,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Today my attention will be  narrower than usual, given the briefings by Bill Bassett and Linda Kole that will  follow covering the broader developments in the equity, fixed income, and foreign  exchange markets in the United States and abroad, which have been considerable  over the past six weeks  I will focus on three topics  (1) the impact of our new  facilities and other government initiatives on market function, (2) the consequences of  the expansion of these facilities on our balance sheet and our ability to hit the federal  funds rate target over time, and (3) the travails of the hedge fund community and how                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   October 28–29, 2008 3 of 206    this could potentially add to market dysfunction  I will be referring to the chart  package that should be in front of you     As you all know, the Lehman bankruptcy led to sharp outflows from prime money   market mutual funds into Treasury-only funds (exhibit 1)  The result was a collapse  in Treasury bill yields (exhibit 2)  At the same time, the cost of financing Treasury  securities via repo fell sharply—this is illustrated in exhibit 3 by the drop in the  overnight general collateral (GC) repo rate  This increased the incentive for Treasury  traders to short Treasury securities that were already hard to obtain because the  effective cost of borrowing such securities is determined by the level of the GC repo  rate  As a result, Treasury fails, which represent Treasury securities that are not  delivered as promised to their buyers, soared  Treasury fails were also exacerbated  by the withdrawal from the securities lending market of some large holders of  Treasuries, including some major foreign central banks  Although Treasury yields  fell sharply and Treasury bills were in great demand, the rise in fails resulted in a  sharp diminution of trading and liquidity in the Treasury securities market  The fact  that there are severe market-functioning problems in the asset class that is in greatest  demand—Treasuries—underscores the scope and severity of the markets’ broader  dysfunction       At the same time, the outflows from prime money market funds led to a sharp   drop in the demand for commercial paper, a significant rise in commercial paper  rates, and a shortening of commercial paper maturities (exhibits 4 and 5)  Term bank  funding spreads rose sharply, with the one-month and three-month LIBOR–OIS  spreads increasing to levels that make the earlier peaks look like modest speed bumps  (exhibits 6 and 7)  The Lehman bankruptcy caused counterparty risk concerns to  intensify  Moreover, the Lehman bankruptcy disrupted a number of markets because  participants in these markets were uncertain how to adjust their long- and short- position exposures that offset their open positions with Lehman  The result was a  sharp drop in the willingness of counterparties to engage with one another, especially  at term  Essentially, the result was a massive coordination problem that has led to a  very unattractive equilibrium  I would put it this way  “I won’t lend to you even  though I think you’re okay because I am not sure others will lend to you either  I  need some assurance that others will lend to you in order to have some assurance I  can get my money back if I need it”  Even though it has been in the interest of all  parties to engage, no party has been willing to go first       In response, the Federal Reserve dramatically expanded its programs of liquidity   support  The size of each TAF auction has been raised to $150 billion—the same size  as the entire TAF program just six weeks ago  Fixed-rate tender dollar auctions were  implemented by the BoE, the BoJ, the ECB, and the SNB  The asset-backed  commercial paper money market mutual fund liquidity facility (AMLF) and the  commercial paper funding facility (CPFF) were implemented, and plans for a money  market investor funding facility (MMIFF) were announced  The Federal Reserve and  other central banks stepped forward to engage in transactions with a broad range of  bank and, in the case of the Fed, nonbank counterparties  The hope, of course, is that   October 28–29, 2008 4 of 206    this willingness to engage will reduce rollover risk and therefore encourage others to  re-engage with their counterparties       At least for now, the escalation in the size of the TAF auctions appears to have   been sufficient to satisfy the demand for dollar funds in the United States  As shown  in exhibit 8, the first two auctions of $150 billion have been slightly undersubscribed   Currently, about $300 billion of TAF credit is outstanding  Demand for dollar  funding in Europe has increased sharply even though the cost is much higher than in  our TAF auctions  Whereas the two most recent TAF auctions were stopped out at  the OIS rate, which is the minimum bid rate, the foreign fixed-rate tender operations  have been conducted at a rate of OIS plus 100 basis points  As shown in exhibits 9  and 10, swap outstandings have grown to nearly $500 billion currently  The ECB  swap size is currently about $280 billion, more than half the total amount of swaps  outstanding  The amount of outstanding swaps is likely to climb sharply when the  first 84-day fixed-rate tender operations are conducted in Europe next week       The CPFF facility is another important element in the Fed’s program of liquidity   escalation  As you know, this facility provides a backstop for domestic issuers of  A1/P1-rated commercial paper  Issuers can sell commercial paper to the facility at  three-month term for an effective cost of OIS plus 200 basis points for nonfinancial  and financial issuers and OIS plus 300 basis points for asset-backed commercial  paper (ABCP)  This facility complements the AMLF, which lends funds to banks at  the primary credit facility rate against the ABCP purchased from money market  mutual funds  Yesterday was the first day that the CPFF was open for business, and a  number of borrowers issued commercial paper to the facility totaling more than  $50 billion  At the close of business last week, 79 issuers had registered to use the  facility, paying 10 basis points, or $580 million, to cover the potential issuance of  commercial paper  The 10 basis point fee provides a little equity to get the program  off and running      Finally, the most recent facility, the money market investor funding facility, was   announced last week  This facility will provide liquidity to five conduits that will  purchase commercial paper and certificates of deposit of designated issuers from 2a-7  money market mutual funds  It will likely be several more weeks before this facility  is operational       The escalation in the provision of liquidity and some of the other initiatives I will   discuss shortly have led to a grudging improvement in the interbank funding markets  and in the commercial paper market  Reviewing the earlier exhibits, most term  funding spreads have narrowed, but the improvement is modest relative to the earlier  deterioration  It is unclear at this stage whether the modest extent of improvement  reflects the limited ability of additional capacity and breadth in terms of liquidity  provision to restore confidence, especially at a time that the macroeconomic outlook  has deteriorated globally, or whether it will just take time for these liquidity facilities  to restore confidence and some semblance of normality to the money markets        October 28–29, 2008 5 of 206    The expansion of the Fed’s liquidity provisions has been accompanied by  escalations on two other fronts  First, the FDIC announced a bank funding guarantee  program  Although the terms and conditions of this program have not yet been  finalized, the program is likely to guarantee most of the new senior debt obligations  of participating depository institutions and their associated holding companies up to a  cap of 125 percent of the maturing obligations through June 30, 2009  Importantly,  new interbank funding will be covered  How this affects the federal funds market  remains to be seen  Second, the Treasury has committed $250 billion of funds from  the TARP program to inject as preferred stock into the banking system  Nine large  banks announced two weeks ago that they will accept $125 billion of preferred stock  investment from the Treasury  Over the past few days, the Treasury announced that  an additional $35 billion of capital has been committed  The FDIC guarantee  announcement and the TARP capital infusion have been effective in shoring up  confidence in the major US banks  As shown in exhibits 11 and 12, credit default  swap spreads for most major US financial institutions have narrowed sharply       But the guarantee of the senior debt of depository institutions and their associated   holding companies has generated some unintended consequences for those firms not  covered by these guarantees  In particular, the credit default swap spreads for major  nonbank financials have narrowed less than those for the banks (exhibit 13)   Moreover, the funding costs for the GSEs have climbed, especially for short-term  discount note issuance  The funding costs for Fannie and Freddie for both long-term  and short-term debt are shown in exhibits 14, 15, and 16  However, the fear that  funds would flow out of prime money market funds back into bank assets guaranteed  by the FDIC has not been realized—at least not yet       The expansion of the Fed’s facilities and the open-ended nature of the fixed-rate   tender dollar operations by the foreign central banks that we are funding by swaps  have led to rapid expansion of our balance sheet  Exhibit 17 provides a snapshot of  the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at different times before and during the crisis   During the first 13 months, the size of our balance sheet was little changed  We  accommodated our liquidity programs mainly by selling Treasury securities  During  the next stage, which began around the time of the Lehman bankruptcy filing, we  expanded our balance sheet but drained the reserve additions primarily by having the  Treasury issue supplemental financing program bills and placing the proceeds on our  balance sheet  However, the capacity to continue to drain reserves via SFP bills was  unlikely to be a long-term solution because the Treasury would ultimately be  constrained by the debt limit ceiling       The passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 granted the   Federal Reserve the authority to pay interest on reserves immediately  This was very  important because it meant that we could expand our balance sheet size by  unsterilized reserve additions but at the same time keep the federal funds rate from  crashing to zero by paying a positive interest rate on holdings of excess reserves   Further rapid balance sheet expansion appears inevitable as the takedown from the  TAF auctions and the fixed-rate tenders expands further and as our new facilities,   October 28–29, 2008 6 of 206    such as the CPFF and MMIFF, begin operation  Although the estimates shown for  year-end in exhibit 17 are indicative—the actual size will be driven by the use of our  various liquidity facilities—it does seem likely that the Federal Reserve System’s  balance sheet will grow very rapidly through year-end  We are now nearly three  weeks into the new interest-on-reserves regime, which was implemented on  October 9  As you know, the Board of Governors initially set the spread between the  target federal funds rate and the rate paid on excess reserves at 75 basis points   Policymakers erred on the size of a wide margin given unsettled market conditions  and the lack of experience with the new regime, recognizing that the spread could be  reduced if the federal funds rate traded soft relative to the target       As shown in exhibit 18, despite the payment of interest on reserves, the federal   funds rate has continued to trade soft relative to the target  As a result, the Board  narrowed the spread to 35 basis points with the start last Thursday of the second  reserve maintenance period under the interest-on-reserves regime  It is too soon to  assess the effect of the narrower spread on our ability to push the federal funds rate  back up to the target because the interest rate paid on reserves is based upon the  lowest target federal funds rate during the reserve maintenance period  So currently it  is hard to separate the impact of the narrower spread on the effective federal funds  rate from the expectations for further cuts in the target federal funds rate that might  occur at this meeting  There are two complications in fixing the interest-on-reserves  spread at a level consistent with the target  First, some of the GSEs, which hold  balances at the Fed, are not allowed to earn interest on their balances  Thus they have  to sell federal funds to banks that, in turn, hold the funds and are paid the interest-on- reserves rate  Second, some banks have also been selling federal funds below the  interest-on-reserves rate  We expect this to diminish over time as they gain more  experience with the new regime  However, other factors, such as concern with their  overall leverage ratios, could cause this phenomenon to persist  As a result, there has  been a significant amount of federal funds rate trading below the interest-on-reserves  rate  This is illustrated in exhibit 19, in which the circles are sized to reflect the  amount of trading at a particular rate level       This trading of fed funds below the interest-on-reserves rate has two   consequences  First, it blurs the meaning of the effective federal funds rate with  respect to its relationship to the stance of monetary policy  Conceptually, the interest- on-reserves rate, rather than the effective federal funds rate, could be viewed as  representing the default risk-free investment rate for banks  Second, it implies that  we may have to narrow considerably further the spread between the target federal  funds rate and the interest rate paid on excess reserves in order to push the effective  federal funds rate up to the target  In principle, if fed funds sales were to continue in  large volume below the interest-on-reserves rate, the interest-on-reserves rate might  need to be set right at the federal funds rate target in order to support the federal funds  rate close to that level       Before turning to a discussion of monetary policy and inflation expectations, I   want to make a few comments about the hedge fund industry  Before this crisis   October 28–29, 2008 7 of 206    began, most of the fears about a market meltdown were focused on hedge funds   Until now, these fears have been mostly misplaced  However, the risks that hedge  fund problems will now exacerbate the crisis have increased substantially recently   The underlying problem is that the recent performance of the hedge fund industry has  been very poor and hedge fund viability is not very robust when net asset values slip  considerably below their high-water marks in individual funds  September was the  poorest month in the past 10 years, and so far October returns are on pace to be even  worse  Net asset value for the entire hedge fund industry is down more than  10 percent year-to-date  The average performance, shown in exhibit 20, masks  substantial dispersion in returns and particularly poor performance for certain  strategies  In particular, convertible arbitrage, emerging market arbitrage, and fixed- income arbitrage strategies suffered double-digit losses in the month of September,  and further losses are likely in October       Poor hedge fund performance has been exacerbated by several factors  First,   policy shifts such as the short sales ban have caused big problems for convertible  arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, and long/short equity strategies  This has been an  important factor behind Citadel’s travails  Second, prime brokers continue to pull  back in their willingness to provide financing by raising their haircuts assessed  against hedge fund assets as market volatility rises (exhibit 21)  Third, investors are  pulling funds out of hedge funds because of their poor performance and a generalized  increase in risk aversion  As a result, hedge funds are raising cash to meet actual and  potential redemptions, and many hedge funds are either hitting or approaching their  net asset value trigger points       Let me say a few words about net asset value triggers  Hedge funds often   negotiate agreements with each of their prime brokers that set the terms for their  access to financing  These contracts give the prime brokers the option to seize and  liquidate collateral if the hedge fund net asset value falls by more than a certain  magnitude—say, a 30 percent decline in assets under management over a three-month  period; that’s a very common trigger  Obviously, if only a few hedge funds are close  to these triggers, there is little problem as there is no potential flood of asset sales into  the market  But when so many hedge funds are under pressure at the same time, the  risk of broader asset liquidation increases  The prime broker may have a lessened  incentive to waive its right to liquidate collateral when a greater proportion of the  industry is troubled because the first-mover advantage of selling collateral likely  becomes more important under such circumstances       I anticipate that the pressure from the liquidation of hedge fund assets will   continue to weigh on financial markets over the next few months  Some major fund  of fund managers anticipate redemptions between now and early 2009 of at least  25 percent of the total industry, or about $500 billion based upon the estimated  $2 trillion size of the global hedge fund business       Market participants continue to price in additional cuts in the federal funds rate   target  Of course, it is a little harder than usual to tell what they are expecting based   October 28–29, 2008 8 of 206    on futures prices because the federal funds rate has traded soft relative to the target  and those expectations are also embedded in the near-term rates for fed funds futures  contracts  Regardless of the cause, if you look at exhibits 22 and 23, there has been a  fairly sharp downward shift in the federal funds rate curve and the Eurodollar futures  curve—they have shifted downward about 100 basis points  Moreover, the curves are  considerably flatter than they were a few months ago, indicating that market  participants expect that the FOMC will be slow to raise the federal funds target in  2009  Our primary dealer survey indicates that most survey respondents expect the  Committee to lower the target federal funds rate over the next two meetings to around  1 percent and keep it there through most of 2009  This also represents a downward  shift of about 100 basis points from the survey conducted before the September 16  meeting (exhibits 24 and 25)  When the survey was conducted more than a week ago,  the majority of respondents anticipated a 25 basis point cut  Since then, the  consensus has flipped, with most now anticipating a 50 basis point rate cut at this  meeting      On the inflation expectations front, normal relationships between TIPS and   nominal Treasuries have been distorted by the illiquidity of TIPS relative to nominal  Treasuries and the high level of chronic fails in the five-year sector of the nominal  Treasury market  As a result, TIPS yields have climbed sharply relatively to nominal  Treasuries, leading to a sharp fall in breakeven inflation measures (exhibit 26)  The  fact that breakeven inflation rates have fallen more sharply in the five-year sector  than in the ten-year sector has generated a rise in five-year, five-year-forward  measures of inflation (exhibit 27)  The distortions in the US Treasury market  suggest considerable caution in interpreting the rise in these measures  Interestingly,  our Desk survey of primary dealers shows a slight drop in long-term inflation  expectations since the September survey (exhibit 28)       Before concluding, let me note that the staff recommends approval of a   $15 billion foreign exchange swap line with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to  help satisfy the dollar funding needs of banks that operate in New Zealand  As noted  in the memo to the Committee from Nathan Sheets and myself that was distributed on  Friday, this would complement the swap agreements that we have already enacted  with other advanced economies and would have the same technical features as those  with the smaller advanced countries (that is, Australia, Denmark, Norway, and  Sweden) with fixed swap line limits  Nathan will be discussing the potential for  additional swap line authorizations for four emerging market countries recommended  by the staff that were discussed in a second memo to the Committee on Friday       There were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote to ratify the   operations of the System Open Market Account that have been undertaken since the  September 16 FOMC meeting  Nathan will continue our presentation      Under the term auction facility, there is a minimum bid rate, the OIS   rate  So when we have a $150 billion auction and let’s say there are propositions of $120 billion,   the winning bid rate is the OIS rate for everybody     Yes, right now it is a very low rate because the market is building in   future rate cuts  So I think the OIS rate is now below 1 percent on a three-month basis    I think that is something worth considering  The emphasis right now   has been getting term funding out in as much size as possible and not worrying so much about   whether the cost of the funds is or is not at a penalty  So I think the emphasis of the program did   shift a bit over the past six weeks  Obviously, if things settle down and the demand at the TAF   auctions subsides, then you can have the option of cutting the size of the auctions or increasing   the minimum bid rate or some combination of the two    The awkward thing right now is that we are trying to add liquidity as   powerfully as we can  So to raise the minimum bid rate or do anything that somehow suggests a   pulling back would be a bit inconsistent with the LIBOR–OIS spread widening that we have seen   and the fact that it still remains very, very elevated  You might want to do exactly what you   suggested, President Rosengren, at some future date, but I think that doing it now would send a   very mixed message to the market  I think people would be confused about what we are doing     The collateral isn’t always in the right place  You are absolutely right if   the collateral could be easily moved; but the collateral oftentimes isn’t in the right place    Okay  Let me take them in reverse order  I don’t like to give up, but if I   could just exclude that portion of it, it’s possible that you might want to consider the interest rate on   reserves or some reasonable facsimile thereof as your target because that is essentially the risk-free   rate that banks face  That may be the purer measure of what you’re really trying to accomplish in   terms of its link to monetary policy than the federal funds rate  It’s possible  There are obviously   important governance issues that surround that choice, though, in terms of what’s the Board’s   October 28–29, 2008 44 of 206    prerogative and what’s the FOMC’s prerogative  But that’s a completely reasonable thing to think   about, just as long as we don’t characterize that as giving up   Have we added enough reserves to drive the federal funds rate down to the interest on   reserves?  Well, I think not  I wouldn’t look at it quite that way because the gap in principle, if other   things are not going on, should be the difference between us as a counterparty and a bank as a   counterparty  One is an unsecured loan between one bank and another bank, and the other is us as   the counterparty  So normally there should be a spread between the interest on reserves and the   federal funds rate  Now, obviously what complicates that in the current environment is the Federal   Deposit Insurance Corporation’s guarantee on interbank funds going forward  So federal funds may   be covered—in fact, they look as though they could be covered by that guarantee  In that   circumstance, one might argue that the federal funds rate and interest on reserves should probably   be the same rate because there’s no difference in credit risk    Right, but I still think that generally a bank faced with a choice of having   risk with the Fed or selling fed funds to another bank would want to be compensated for that risk of   selling, so they are going to get some positive spread    It would not surprise me at all if, when we are finished with this process—I   hope over the next six weeks as we go through a couple more reserve maintenance period rounds—  that that margin might be zero and we might see the federal funds rate trading right on top of the   interest rate on reserves  But we are going to have to see  I think our presumption at the current   time would be to recommend to the Board next round to narrow that spread further—it is 35 basis   points today  Another thing that we don’t know is how much learning is going to go on by banks    So the selling of fed funds below the interest rate on reserves is not just the GSEs; it is also banks,   and so it’s a little hard to understand exactly why they’re doing that unless the leverage ratio is   what’s driving that behavior  Maybe they are just not very well informed or they haven’t gotten   their first check for the interest rate compensation, so I think it’s a little too soon to be certain about   how they’re going to behave going forward  You had one other question about the policy reason for   excluding the GSEs    It is not at all clear that their behavior is going to persist necessarily,   because they may decide to manage their short-term liquidity in a different way than selling at a   very low federal funds rate to banks  "
8613,2008-12-15,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Unfortunately this package is a little  thicker than usual, but that’s the way it goes, I guess  The stimulus provided by  monetary policy to the real economy depends not only on the level of the federal  funds rate but also on the health of the financial system  The ability of market  participants to intermediate and act effectively as the transmission channel between  the change in the federal funds rate target and financial asset prices is critical  When  bank and dealer balance sheets are constrained as they are now, this transmission  mechanism is impaired, and traditional monetary policy instruments become limited  in their ability to support economic activity                                                           1 The materials used by Mr Dudley are attached to this transcript (appendix 1)   December 15–16, 2008 4 of 284    The recent sharp deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and the forced  deleveraging of the nonbank portion of the financial sector have led to sharp declines  in asset values during the past few months  The consequence will be further big  mark-to-market losses for investment and commercial bank trading books and a  significant increase in loan-loss provisions on commercial bank loan books  These  losses are likely to intensify the vise on financial firm balance sheets, and that is  likely to further impede the Federal Reserve’s efforts to ease financial conditions  As  a consequence, a broadening of our suite of liquidity facilities that bypass banks and  dealers may prove to be necessary       Equities, corporate debt, and securitized assets—especially commercial-  mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)—have all been hard hit, and the commodity  sector, the preferred asset class of choice earlier in the year, has been clobbered  As  shown in exhibit 1 of the handout, US equity prices fell sharply beginning in  September  Although the aggregate indexes have bounced off their low points, the  S&P 500 index had still fallen 30 percent between the end of August and the end of  November  This is the relevant quarter for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,  which report this week  In the current calendar quarter, despite the rebound, the  S&P 500 index has declined about 25 percent  The carnage has also been evident  abroad, especially in emerging markets  The corporate debt market has scarcely been  more hospitable  The high-yield corporate bond yield for some broad indexes has  climbed above 20 percent (exhibit 2)  Assuming a 20 percent recovery rate on  defaults, yield levels in this sector appear to fully discount a default experience  consistent with the peak reached in the Great Depression  The securitization markets  have performed little better  Not only are most securitized markets shut to new  issuance, but also the yields on even the highest-rated outstanding tranches have  climbed sharply  Exhibit 3 illustrates the current spreads for different types of  AAA-rated consumer securitizations—credit cards, auto loans, and student loans   Exhibit 4 illustrates the sharp deterioration in valuations in the CMBS market  The  left panel shows spreads on a basket of post-2003 vintages  The right panel shows the  price performance of particular AAA-rated CMBS tranches  Most have fallen about  20 points in the past quarter        Commodity prices also continue to plummet  As shown in exhibit 5, the declines   have been particularly pronounced in the energy and industrial metals sectors  In  contrast, gold prices have held up quite well (exhibit 6), especially since the October  FOMC meeting  Gold prices presumably have been supported by the drop in global  short-term interest rates, which reduces the carrying cost of owning gold  It is also  possible that gold is viewed as a hedge against the risk that central bank policy  actions could ultimately prove inflationary  Presumably, the fear may be that the exit  from these policies could be delayed or prove more difficult to engineer than  generally anticipated       This poor performance of financial and real assets has a number of important   implications  In particular, the earnings of most major financial intermediaries will  be very poor this quarter  For example, the two investment banks that report this   December 15–16, 2008 5 of 284    week are almost certainly likely to record large mark-to-market losses The Wall  Street Journal reported earlier that Goldman Sachs will report a loss of around  $2 billion when it reports tomorrow morning  This may actually understate the  carnage because compensation booked for previous quarters can be reversed and the  reversal of income taxes paid will reduce the size of the loss  Commercial banks will  also not be spared when they report next month  Not only will they have significant  losses on their trading books, but also loan-loss provisions are likely to climb sharply   JPMorgan indicated last week that the current quarter has been terrible, and they have  been one of the best-performing commercial banks     The sharp decline in asset prices is also likely to reinforce the deleveraging   process that is occurring throughout the financial sector  Although hedge fund  performance in November was better than in the previous months, preliminary figures  show that the aggregate index continues to slide (exhibit 7)  We’re down about 17 or  18 percent so far this year, and that’s the worst performance in hedge fund history in  the aggregate by a significant margin  Although the redemption deadlines for year- end have generally passed, this pressure will persist into the first quarter and beyond  for two reasons  First, many fund-of-funds managers will get another round of  redemption requests before year-end, which will cause them to ask for monies from  the hedge funds that are part of their fund-of-funds families in the first quarter   Second, some hedge funds restrict or “gate” the rate of withdrawals  For example,  Citadel suspended all redemptions for their two biggest funds through March 31   This means that there will be a backlog in unfulfilled requests that will take time to  satisfy  The Bernard Madoff scandal may also lead to additional redemption requests     The losses suffered by dealers and banks mean that their balance sheet constraints   will continue to stymie the Federal Reserve’s efforts to supply liquidity to prospective  borrowers  As shown in exhibit 8, recent TAF auctions have been undersubscribed,  and as shown in exhibit 9, the amount of dollar liquidity supplied via our swap lines  has stabilized even though term LIBOR remains elevated well above the minimum  bid rate that we charge on those auctions and the fact that swaps are open-ended in  size  The problem is no longer one of supplying sufficient liquidity to the banks and  dealers  The problem is getting these intermediaries to pass the liquidity onward to  their clients       Balance sheet constraints reveal themselves in many guises  Although LIBOR-  OIS spreads have narrowed somewhat, they remain very elevated relative to historical  levels (exhibits 10 and 11); jumbo mortgage rate spreads remain wide relative to  conforming mortgage rates (exhibit 12); and cash instruments that take balance sheet  room trade at significantly higher spreads than the corresponding derivatives that  don’t  Exhibit 13 illustrates the spread between high-yield cash bonds and the  corresponding CDX high-yield derivatives index  This widening in that basis is one  reason that some banks have taken large losses in the fourth quarter  Evidence that  balance sheet constraints are impeding the availability and cost of credit continues to  proliferate  This is obviously important because, if credit is not available on  reasonable terms, this is likely to exacerbate the downward pressure on the economy    December 15–16, 2008 6 of 284    A darker economic outlook, in turn, threatens to lead to more losses and balance sheet  pressures, reinforcing the downward dynamic       In terms of credit availability, the commercial mortgage area appears to be   particularly vulnerable  According to industry sources, about $400 billion of  mortgage debt—most put on five to seven years ago—needs to be refinanced when it  comes due in 2009  In recent years, commercial banks and the CMBS market  provided the major source of funds for the commercial mortgage market  The owners  of this commercial real estate are worried that, without new Federal Reserve and  Treasury initiatives, funding will not be available to refinance this mortgage debt in  2009 on virtually any terms  Investment-grade and high-yield corporate debt will  also have to be refinanced  Exhibit 14 illustrates that more than $600 billion of term  investment-grade corporate debt will need to be refinanced in 2009  So far, this  market still looks open for business, but it may become less so if the macroeconomic  environment continues to deteriorate     Enough gloomy news  In the credit markets, are there any areas that have shown   improvement?  The answer, of course, is “yes”  In those areas in which the federal  government, including the Federal Reserve, has applied the most force, the situation  has generally stabilized or improved  Let me briefly give a few examples  First, the  FDIC funding guarantee, the Citigroup intervention, and the $250 billion of TARP  money allocated for bank capital seem to have stabilized the banking sector  As  shown in exhibits 15 and 16, CDS spreads have been pretty stable recently despite the  deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook  Second, the commercial paper funding  facility (CPFF) has led to significant improvement in the commercial paper market   As shown in exhibit 17, the yields on highly rated commercial paper have declined   As this has occurred, the CPFF has become less attractive, and the number of issuers  and the amount of commercial paper purchased each day by the CPFF have  moderated sharply (exhibit 18)  Just as important, after an initial surge in which the  CPFF represented virtually all of the long-dated maturity issuance, the CPFF share of  long-dated issuance has fallen significantly (exhibit 19)  So far, the CPFF has  worked pretty much as designed  Third, our announcement and purchases of agency  debt have brought in agency debt spreads relative to Treasuries  For example, in the  five-year sector, debt spreads for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have narrowed more  than 50 basis points since the last FOMC meeting  Fourth, our announcement that the  Federal Reserve would purchase up to $500 billion in GSE mortgage-backed  securities has caused the spread between conforming mortgages and Treasuries to  narrow sharply  Coupled with the fall in Treasury yields—encouraged somewhat by  the Chairman’s suggestion in a speech that the Federal Reserve might buy long-dated  Treasuries for the SOMA—this has caused conforming mortgage rates to drop  sharply (exhibits 20, 21, and 22)  As a result, mortgage refinancing activity has  climbed sharply  Exhibit 23 illustrates the spike upward in the Mortgage Bankers  Association mortgage applications to refinance index that has occurred in the past two  weeks       December 15–16, 2008 7 of 284    Exhibits 24 and 25 contrast the performance in markets with federal government  intervention to those markets without  Spreads have generally narrowed where there  has been intervention and widened elsewhere  The contrast in the behavior of spreads  suggests that one might wish to expand our existing facilities further  The TALF is  an obvious potential candidate given that it could conceivably be extended in multiple  dimensions—including the scope of asset classes, vintage, and credit quality  In my  opinion, the liquidity facilities should be viewed as part of our suite of monetary  policy tools  The impulse of monetary policy to the real economy depends not just on  the level of the federal funds rate but, more important, also on the impact on financial  conditions  In normal times, movements in the federal funds rate result in moves in  financial conditions in the same direction  Markets do the work, and financial  conditions ease as the federal funds rate is cut  But in extraordinary times such as the  present, in which banks and dealers are unwilling to on-lend liquidity because of  balance sheet constraints, federal funds rate reductions alone may be ineffective in  easing financial conditions  In such an environment, special liquidity facilities that  bypass the banks and dealers may prove necessary to ease financial conditions   However, expansion of our liquidity tools does blow up our balance sheet  Exhibit 26  shows the growth of the balance sheet and the changes in its composition over time   Since late September, the balance sheet has grown sharply mainly because of the  expansion of our foreign-exchange swap program (shown in light blue), the CPFF  (shown in brown), and the TAF program (shown in purple)  As shown in exhibit 27,  which is a snapshot of our balance sheet late last week, this has caused excess  reserves to rise sharply  The growth in excess reserves has been exacerbated by the  rolling off of the Treasury SFP (supplementary finance program) bills  We peaked at  about $500 billion earlier, and now we have $364 billion of SFP bills on our balance  sheet  The Treasury was unwilling to continue this program at its earlier level  because of worries about reaching the debt limit ceiling in the first quarter and  because they would have had to notify the Congress 60 days before that       Turning now to the Desk’s efforts to implement monetary policy and the FOMC’s   directive, the effective federal funds rate has continued to trade soft relative to the  target rate (exhibit 28)  The interest rate paid on excess reserves (IOER rate) has not  been a perfect substitute for the Treasury SFP program  Because the IOER rate for  the two-week reserve maintenance period is set at the lowest level that occurred  anytime during that period, the sharp drop last Thursday evident in the exhibit  occurred because banks anticipate a substantial cut in the federal funds rate target and  the IOER rate at this FOMC meeting  The drop in the effective rate has occurred  even though we have increased the rate paid on excess reserves to equal the federal  funds rate target  Although some of this softness in the effective rate relative to the  target reflects the sales of federal funds by GSEs that are not eligible to be paid  interest on excess reserves, this is by no means the whole story  The unwillingness of  major banks to bid more aggressively for these funds is an important factor  This  unwillingness to fully arbitrage the gap between the IOER rate and the effective  federal funds rate is another consequence of the lack of balance sheet capacity in the  banking sector  Although we are exploring ways to remove most of the GSE effect  from the picture, even if we were to be successful in doing this, we expect that the   December 15–16, 2008 8 of 284    balance sheet constraints would still be powerful enough to cause the effective federal  funds rate to trade soft relative to the target  Also, if the GSE federal funds volumes  were removed, it is not clear what the effective target would represent because trading  volumes could then turn out to be very, very low       The drop in the effective federal funds rate has been accompanied by a   corresponding drop in other short-term interest rates  In particular, general collateral  repo rates have collapsed almost all the way to zero (exhibit 29)  This is likely to lead  to a rise in Treasury fails because, when general collateral repo rates are very low, the  cost of shorting Treasury securities becomes negligible  As fails climb, in turn, this  erodes market function in the Treasury market and reduces the usefulness of the  Treasury market as a hedging vehicle for other fixed-income assets  The effect of  fails on Treasury market function can be seen in exhibit 30, which shows how errors  in our Treasury yield curve model have increased as short-term interest rates have  fallen close to zero        In terms of monetary policy expectations, the federal funds rate futures curves   (exhibit 31) and the Eurodollar futures curves (exhibit 32) continue to shift lower   However, with the effective federal funds rate persistently trading below the target  rate, it is unclear how much of this shift represents a change in expectations about  what the Committee will do with respect to the target  The primary dealer credit  survey sheds considerably more light here  As shown in exhibits 33 and 34, rate  expectations have shifted lower since the last FOMC meeting  All 16 respondents to  our most recent survey expect the FOMC to reduce the target, with most (13 out of  16) calling for a 50 basis point reduction in the target rate  No dealer expects a 25  basis point cut at this meeting  Two are at a 75 basis point cut, and one anticipates a  100 basis point reduction in the target rate  A slim majority—9 out of 16—expect a  50 basis point target to be the trough for the target rate  Most expect that the FOMC  will not cut the target at future meetings, and no rate hikes are expected by anyone  until the second half of 2009 at the earliest  Comparing exhibits 33 and 34, the most  recent survey shows considerably less dispersion in the four-quarters-ahead federal  funds rate forecasts      Finally, for completeness, I include our standard chart on inflation expectations as   measured by the Board’s and Barclays’ measures of the five-year, five-year-forward  breakeven inflation rate (exhibit 35)  I don’t think these breakeven rates provide  much information right now because the TIPS market has been heavily influenced by  the sharp fall in CPI inflation that will accrue to TIPS over the next few months and  by the growing illiquidity of TIPS versus nominal Treasuries  Interestingly, the most  recent primary dealer survey shows no change in five-year, five-year-forward  expectations for CPI inflation, with the average of the group remaining at 24 percent   There is, however, somewhat greater dispersion on both sides indicating uncertainty  about how successful the Federal Reserve will be in keeping core PCE inflation in the  “comfort zone” of 1½ to 2 percent on a longer-term basis (exhibit 36)     December 15–16, 2008 9 of 284    There were no foreign operations during this period  I request a vote as always to  ratify the operations conducted by the System Open Market Account since the  October FOMC meeting  Of course, I am very happy to take questions      Yes  There are two potential explanations, and it’s really hard to sort out   what’s driving it  One is just that trading volumes have come down, and as trading volumes have   come down, fails have come down  So that’s part of it  It’s just tied to trading volume  The second   explanation is that the Treasury Market Practices Group published a best practices report basically   arguing that a penalty rate should be put on fails, and it is going to design a road map to show how   that might be implemented in practice  It may be that, given that publication, people who before   might have been more cavalier about shorting Treasury securities at very low interest rates are now   somewhat less inclined to do so just because of the moral suasion of that report that it is not a good   thing to do  So it is some combination of those two, I think    I think you have to distinguish between conforming mortgage markets and   everything else  The conforming mortgage market is doing fine  Some spreads are a little wider   than they have been historically, but our actions seem to have been pretty successful in bringing   those spreads in a bit  So the conforming mortgage market rate is fine  The problem is in   December 15–16, 2008 10 of 284    commercial-mortgage-backed securities and nonconforming mortgages  The appetite to provide   financing there is very, very much impaired, especially in the commercial mortgage market    I don’t think it has created much confusion  The biggest confusion is who   is guaranteed and who is not and which instruments are guaranteed and which instruments are not  I   think people will have trouble sorting that out  Most of the issuance has been long term—three   years  People say, “Well, if I’m paying 75 basis points, let me get the most value for that”  So there   hasn’t really been much channel conflict with the very short end, and I think that the fact that one   month and in is not covered also has reduced that potential channel conflict    I think so    This is total  In fact, when you look at the issuance of investment-grade   corporate debt recently, there’s quite a bit of it, but most of it is the guaranteed stuff    So excluding the guaranteed stuff, the issuance volumes do not look as   robust as the aggregate number suggests because so much of that is the guaranteed stuff    I don’t have the number off the top of my head    No    No  I mean that in the fourth quarter they will reflect the decline that   occurred from August 30 to November 30 for the investment banks  September 30 to December 30   just hasn’t been yet recorded on their balance sheet  They haven’t announced it yet    That has been widely reported  Morgan Stanley is also going to report this   week, and it is highly likely they will have similar losses    Well, if you basically take that 21 percent and compare it with the default   rates in the Great Depression and write down some numbers for recoveries, if you had a default rate   equal to the Great Depression default rate and you had a 20 percent recovery, you’d actually do   pretty well owning high-yield debt at these levels right now  So the level of yields fully discounts   horrific default rates    Well, yes  It is possible that we could have default rates greater than those   of the Great Depression  I’m just saying that these levels discount that kind of outcome  Obviously,   the high-yield debt market today is different from general default rates  Yeah, I think that’s a fair   point    Well, there were certain leveraged utility companies that you could argue   were pretty junky    Well, you could solve for the risk premium that was left over, and we did a   back-of-the-envelope calculation in New York on that  It was an excess return of about 600 basis   points      Look  This is back of the envelope  Obviously, you’d have to dig down   pretty deeply to try to separate what’s the default rate and what’s the risk premium  But the point   here is that the market is discounting very adverse outcomes    No, I think it’s some combination  I don’t think you can really separate   how much of it is default rate versus how much of it is risk premium  The point is that there’s   probably a considerable amount of both  Clearly the risk premiums are high because we see risk   premiums on safe assets being very, very high  The classic example is the student loan, which is   97 percent guaranteed by the federal government, trading at LIBOR plus 350 or LIBOR plus 400    That’s probably a pretty good measure of risk premium—that’s your underlying risk premium on all   assets, maybe a few hundred basis points     I think what you’re describing is the perspective from the issuer of the   obligation  The issuer of the obligation has a problem because on one side they get commercial   paper and on the other side they get LIBOR, and so they have a mismatch  They have essentially a   basis risk  But about where securities are trading in the market or what end-investors can invest in   the securities—I think you’re referring more to the issuers of the securities, and the chart I showed   is what investors in the AAA tranches get  So I think it’s a slightly different thing   December 15–16, 2008 14 of 284     I don’t see it that way    We think they’re pretty safe—not perfectly safe, but pretty safe    It might work eventually, but right now I would guess the spread between   the effective funds rate and the target would be bigger than that  We’re sort of running that   experiment right now  The market consensus is that the Fed is going to reduce the target 50 basis   points at this meeting  That’s incorporated in the current federal funds rate trading because it’s the   lowest interest on excess reserves during the two-week maintenance period  We’re trading in a   range of about 10 to 15 basis points  We don’t have that much information, but right now that   spread is probably 35 to 40 basis points  So I think we probably couldn’t do what you said  If we   worked on it—you know, took the GSEs and made it so that they couldn’t sell fed funds and did a   few other things—maybe we could get that spread down to 25 basis points over time  Brian, do you   have anything?    For term, it is a huge spread, probably 300 basis points or so, but   overnight it is much smaller    Yes   MR FISHER  Which leads to more-conservative financial management and business   management  You do everything you can not to become an A2/P2 borrower, to slip off the   A1/P1 ladder   December 15–16, 2008 116 of 284     Historically BBB was the sweet spot of the corporate capital structure,   and that was associated with A2/P2 commercial paper borrowing, which people thought was   safe  It turned out not to be quite as attractive as they had thought   MR COVITZ  I think over history this isn’t the only time when A2/P2s have come under   stress  Whenever there were disruptions in the market—for example, after the California utilities   defaulted in the early part of the decade—A2/P2 outstandings plummeted, and A2/P2 spreads   rose, though not nearly to this magnitude  This is truly extraordinary  But that is a portion of the   market that is under stress because this market in general tends to be very, very skittish  At the   first sign of trouble, there is quantity rationing  I didn’t show the outstandings of the A2/P2s, but   they have gone down—as I think I mentioned—40 percent in the last couple of months  So   quantity rationing is already taking place, and they are having trouble getting over year-end    You know, it also may have helped the money market fund industry to   keep its money knowing that there was a facility outstanding that could provide liquidity for that   sector because we did see inflows back into the money market mutual funds   December 15–16, 2008 121 of 284     They provided more stability to the system as a whole    You can look at credit ratings, for example, or what’s happening to their   profitability  It is highly likely that the strains in the CP market are more dramatic than any change   in the underlying financial condition of the A2/P2 borrowers    I think the market will be slightly confused, but I think they will figure   it out quite quickly  They will scan the document and figure out, well, what does this really   mean?  They will be surprised by the magnitude of the interest rate reduction  As I said   yesterday, most of the dealers are clustered around a 50 basis point reduction in the target    We are saying here that we are at exceptionally low levels of the funds   rate for some time  I think they will understand that this is it and that the funds rate is going to   be very, very low  Obviously, the next day you will probably observe a federal funds rate that is   no more than a couple of basis points, would be my guess    I think the markets would look at this as saying it is a substantial rate   cut  The funds rate has been trading soft to the interest rate on excess reserves by a considerable   margin  The interest rate on excess reserves was cut considerably, so they will figure out that,   December 15–16, 2008 168 of 284    therefore, the funds rate is going to trade at an exceptionally low level  But you are right—it will   not be quite as straightforward as putting it out there right up front    I think we wouldn’t do things differently to any meaningful degree    I think the real issue is what happens to the CPFF, what happens to the   swap programs, and the take-up of the TAF  Those are the three big elements, and they   conceivably could run down in the first quarter      Or “likely to”    No  But I think the issue is that, because we have open facilities, we   just can’t guarantee what their take-up is going to be relative to what they are today  The swap   lines are roughly $600 billion; those could come down    We can do it, but we’re under a strain  As long as we don’t start until   sometime in January, I think we could manage, as long as you don’t ask us to do it every day    How about once every couple of weeks?    Well, I guess we would stop doing reverse repos to signal our protesting of   the fact that the fed funds rate is trading soft to its targets  That’s the first thing we’d do  I have to   December 15–16, 2008 211 of 284    say that I think the probability of this happening is extremely remote because banks are balance   sheet constrained and therefore aren’t going to do that perfect arbitrage  Maybe in a normal world it   would be possible to get fed funds to trade above the interest on excess reserves, but in this world   it’s just extraordinarily unlikely  But if it were to happen, we would signal our unhappiness with   that, and the first thing we would do is we’d stop doing the reverses that we’ve been doing every   day to protest the softness in the funds rate    I don’t know how quickly we could pull it back down  Look  I don’t think   that this is going to happen under almost any conceivable circumstance, but if it were to happen, we   would basically add reserves to protest what we’re seeing  Time would pass  We’d have another   FOMC meeting, and we would make an adjustment to the framework  But I think this is an   extremely remote possibility    For what it’s worth, Mr Chairman, I agree with you  I think the market   will be more confused about alternative A than alternative B  If that’s important, then that should   be part of the decision    I said substantively we’re not going to conduct policy any differently, but   the market will be more confused about A than about B in terms of having to process what this   means  Now, it will get to the right answer eventually, but it will be more confused in terms of   processing information, in my opinion    It is better than the time I found out I had to discuss a Stiglitz  paper in grad school about 12 hours ahead of time  That was harder  I read the  Stiglitz paper three times, and then I started to understand it  [Laughter]  What I  thought I would do, if I could, is invert the order and start with the balance sheet  issues and then go into the TALF because I think that there is a broader question of  our exit from all our liquidity programs  That is a very legitimate issue  You can  imagine a circumstance that sometime in the future we still have an inflated balance  sheet, and we actually want to raise the federal funds rate target  The question is,  Would we be able to do so?     The good news, of course, is that a lot of our facilities are going to go away pretty   naturally—the swaps, the CPFF, and the TAF  We may have to give it a bit of a  nudge, but those programs should downsize pretty automatically  Even after that, we  are still going to have on our books a lot more agency debt and a lot more agency  mortgage-backed securities  We’re going to have loans outstanding that are  associated with Bear Stearns and AIG  We are going to have longer-term Treasuries   We have potentially a very large funding obligation to Citigroup, if its losses go  through the FDIC and TARP money  Then, of course, the TALF could also still be  on our balance sheet, depending on what the terms of those TALF loans are  I am  going to come back to that a little later     Generally, I am not worried about our ability to raise the level of interest rates,   even if our balance sheet is still inflated at the time, for a number of reasons  First, I  think the interest rate on excess reserves does work, just not quite as well as we had   December 15–16, 2008 218 of 284    hoped  The gap between the interest on excess reserves and the effective funds rate  has been running in the 40 to 50 basis point range  That means that, if we were to  raise the interest rate on excess reserves, we would raise the whole complex of  interest rates, including the effective fed funds rate  The gap is as large as it is  because, when balance sheet capacity is scarce, people have to be paid to use their  balance sheet to arbitrage that difference  But I think that gap today is pretty stable,  and we can expect that, as the balance sheets return to a more normal condition, over  time that gap might actually narrow as people say, “Well, gee, I have more balance  sheet capacity to do this arbitrage”  So that would be point number 1     Point number 2 is that we can probably take active steps that reduce the cost of   that arbitrage to banks today  We can limit the GSEs in terms of their fed funds sales,  and we can also reduce the balance sheet consequence of the arbitrage by potentially  removing those purchases from the leverage ratio, giving them a little regulatory  relief, which actually makes some sense because there is really no risk to a bank that  is buying fed funds from another bank and putting them on deposit with the Fed   There is no interest rate risk overnight  So that is something that we might want to  consider     Another thing that I think is important to recognize is that there may be other   means of addressing our excess reserves problems  The first point is that interest on  excess reserves is probably good enough to do a reasonable, if somewhat sloppy, job  in pushing up interest rates  In addition to that, we have other ways of addressing  excess reserves in the system  We have the ability to change our monetary policy  framework  We had a meeting earlier this year in which we discussed some of the  potential places we might want to go  To drain excess reserves, if we decided that  was necessary to get better control of the federal funds rate, we could do reverse  repos with a broader set of counterparties, like money market mutual funds  We  could do that using the agency debt on our balance sheet and using the Treasury debt  on our balance sheet, and we could probably do that in size, since the money market  funds would be very happy to be our counterparts       Second, we could also change the monetary framework in a more radical way    One can imagine a system by which we set voluntary reserve targets for banks at  pretty high levels, where the rate they got if they were above the target dropped off  considerably and the rate they got below the target dropped off considerably  So we  could basically give the banks incentives to hold the amount of their excess reserves  that actually are in the banking system     Third, the Treasury could help us, as it was helping us for a while  The SFP bills   actually did work  The problem was that, as the Treasury’s borrowing needs  skyrocketed, it started to worry about running into the debt limit  What actually  happened—it was a political issue—it didn’t want to notify the Congress 60 days  ahead of time that it might hit the debt limit, and that is really why it started backing  away from the SFPs  Now, we could resolve this in a couple of different ways  One,  if the debt limit were raised enough, you would have plenty of room  Or you could   December 15–16, 2008 219 of 284    potentially exempt the SFPs from the debt limit, and you could argue that doing so  makes sense because there is debt here and there is cash on the Federal Reserve  balance sheet, so no real net debt is created       Last, you could gain legislative authority to issue Fed bills, which I think is   actually a little more radical step  But the attractiveness of that, of course, is then we  have complete control over our destiny, and you don’t have the mushing together of  church and state, where we are at least somewhat dependent on the Treasury for  managing our monetary policy  So the bottom line for me is that I don’t think we  should be concerned about the large size of our balance sheet constraining our ability  to manage our interest rate policy going forward  That should not be a driver of what  we decide about our liquidity facilities     So why is this important?  Well, the TALF, just to recap, is a program in which   we would basically lend funds against AAA-rated consumer asset-backed securities  on a nonrecourse basis to basically anyone—not quite anyone, not foreigners, but  pretty much anyone who wants to do it—and we would conduct these transactions  through the dealer community  In the TALF program we would be offering three  things to investors  First, they would be offered more leverage than they can get  today because the haircuts that we would put on the securities would not be the 50  percent type of haircuts that the market is putting in place today  They might be 10  percent, 20 percent, or 30 percent  We are still negotiating, determining that  So  investors could get a lot more leverage than they can get today  The second thing that  would be offered is protection against tail risk, and that is something that investors  very definitely can’t get today  Because the loan would be nonrecourse, the investor  could lose only the amount of the haircut, and that is really important in a world  where prices are very volatile  So that would significantly reduce the mark-to-market  risk of investing in the securities from the perspective of investors  Finally, probably  the most important thing, we would be providing term funding  People could buy  these securities, which are of relatively long duration  It depends on what security  you are looking at, but the securities probably range in duration from two years to  seven or eight years, if you are looking at student loans  So this facility would not  work if the term were very, very short     We have been in the process of going out and talking quite extensively to issuers   and investors over the past couple of weeks  The Board staff has been involved  The  New York Fed staff has been involved  Basically what we found out is that they like  the program  The leverage is not quite as important as we thought  They said they  could live with less leverage rather than more leverage  They like the protection  against the tail risk  The nonrecourse nature of the loans, of course, is very attractive   But the main thing on which they focused and that they said was most important for  the success of the program was the length of the term of the loans  When we went  forward with the initial term sheet, we were talking about a one-year term, and the  investors have come back quite forcefully and said that a one-year term is not  sufficient  The program will not work with a one-year term  Now, maybe they are  exaggerating the degree to which it wouldn’t work, but it does seem fairly credible   December 15–16, 2008 220 of 284    that there is no reassurance that one year from now we are going to be completely out  of the situation that we are in today  So, certainly, it is completely legitimate to be  worried as an investor about the rollover risk one year from now, given that these are  assets of longer durations     Where I come out on all of this is that I think we really do need to be attentive to   that concern, and we should try to make the term of the TALF loans as long as  possible, subject to protecting the Fed, obviously, from credit losses  If we were to  make it short term, I think there is a high probability that the program would fail  I  think that would be a huge blow to our credibility  Up to now we have done pretty  well in wheeling out programs that have done what we said they were going to do  I  think this is a particularly important program because of its ability to be expanded in  multiple directions  The Treasury is very, very interested in this program as a way of  using TARP capital efficiently  So to wheel this out on terms that are too short and  that make the program unattractive would be very, very damaging to our credibility   My view is that we should be willing to offer these loans at term  I would favor three  years  I think if we do that, this program will be successful  Obviously, if we do that,  we are going to have more balances on our books  This program was originally  conceived of as about a $200 billion program  That is probably as big as it would get  for consumer ABS, but obviously, if we expand it to CMBS and other things, it could  be considerably larger than that  So that is sort of where we are  Pat, do you have  anything you want to add?      Three years gets you far enough along that reasonable people will   believe that three years from now you might actually be able to get private-sector financing for   this stuff    Yes    Yes    The purpose of this facility is not to give investors profits  The purpose   of this facility is to address the fact that lending spreads on AAA-rated securities are extremely   wide right now and the securitization market is closed  The idea is that, if you offer more-  attractive terms than those available in the market, the demand for these securities will increase,   issuers will be able to sell these securities at better prices and lower spreads, and the   consequences of that will be lower lending rates and improved credit availability to households    The goal at the end of the day is not to do anything for investors  The goal is to harness   investors’ profit motivation to drive down spreads in the AAA market    Our view is that spreads are high mainly because people can’t get   leverage—that is number 1  Number 2, the traditional buyers of these AAA-rated assets either   have disappeared completely, like SIVs and bank conduits, or have balance sheet constraints  So   the risk capital hasn’t really been willing to come in because they can’t get the financing to make   it worth their while  You know, LIBOR plus 300 is not an attractive proposition for someone   who is using capital on an unleveraged basis   December 15–16, 2008 222 of 284     The demand is low for these securities today  It is low because of lack   of leverage      No, I don’t think that is quite right  We are in basically a market   disequilibrium, where the traditional buyers of these securities have vanished  In a normal   market environment, it would be completely reasonable to lend against these securities on a   leveraged basis  But the people who would do that lending—banks and dealers—are balance   sheet constrained, and that is why they are not willing to make those loans  If we had a normal   banking and dealer situation today in which they were willing to extend loans to their   counterparties, they would be providing the leverage  But that is just not happening    Well, I think the counterfactual is what the investors tell us  They tell   us that that is not the case    If you look at AAA-rated assets, the historical credit risk on these assets   is very, very low     Yesterday we talked about AAA tranches of student loans, which are   97 percent backed by the Department of Education  They are selling at LIBOR plus 300 or   LIBOR plus 400  It is hard to say that those securities are priced there because of credit risk    I would be very surprised if you saw anything similar to what we are   seeing today    Jeff, this is all a judgment call  We have been making lots of judgment   calls    Well, it really depends on what rate we are charging for the loan    Presumably we are going to charge for the loan at a rate that is attractive in times of extremis and   somewhat expensive in normal times  So the question really is, Will the market financing   improve quickly enough to make the market a cheaper source of funds?  I don’t think we can   count on all of these loans going away before the end of the term  I think we have to presume   that the term could actually be three years because we just don’t know whether the financing will   be available from the private sector sooner    Well, I think the idea would be that the window for this program would not   be three years  It would be a shorter period of time  So the program would come to an end by the   end of 2009 perhaps, but the loans that we had made during that period could be outstanding for   some time beyond that    The other thing that we should talk a bit about is credit risk to the Fed in all   of this  I think the important thing to recognize here is that the credit risk to the Fed is quite low   because the Federal Reserve is protected by two things  One, it is protected by the haircuts  The   Fed’s risk is a credit risk not a mark-to-market risk  Two, the Fed is also protected by the TARP   money  The way this will work is that, to the extent that people put securities to us, we take those   securities and we place them in a disposition SPV (special purpose vehicle) that’s capitalized by   TARP money  We’ve been doing a lot of work recently about how risky these assets are and what   the risk of loss is to the Fed  It turns out that it’s very hard to generate scenarios in which the Fed   has any meaningful risk of loss    Cash bonds versus derivatives, for example    Okay  On the AAA—it is really for specific classes  I think we’ve heard   that somehow the AAA would not be sufficient mostly from the auto loan area  It’s hard to judge   how credible that is, given that the AAA is the big bulk of the capital structure  So if you’re getting   good financing for most of the capital structure, it’s hard to believe that you can’t pay people at the   bottom of the capital structure a high enough rate to induce them to do that  So I think I’m a little   skeptical that this is true  I think that this program will be successful even if we confine it to just   AAA    You can figure out the economics better once you know how much you   have to pay for that 75 percent of the capital structure    I don’t think this program addresses the nonleveraged, but I think there’s   not much nonleveraged interest in this sector at this point    May I add just one thing to that?  It’s also not clear to me that the private   sector won’t be clever enough to take these things and package them into securities that have the   equity and the leverage embedded in them and sell them to people who want to get high rates of   return  It might be a pretty interesting proposition    Yes, we’re still working on—    The issuers have to basically conform with the TARP executive comp   restrictions    Well, there is in this program, in that we’re trying to figure out the right   way of restricting it to US investors    I don’t think so—not that I’m aware of    I think we’re in disequilibrium  We’re in a disequilibrium in which the   dealers and banks that used to do this lending are in the process of dramatically shrinking their   balance sheets  Goldman announced their fourth quarter today  They shrank their balance sheet by   18 percent from the end of their third quarter to the end of their fourth quarter  That’s certainly not   any notion of equilibrium in the marketplace, and I think that is what’s causing the stresses in the   securities markets    The way I look at it, President Lacker, is that the deleveraging process is   happening at a very rapid rate, and that speed can cause quite a bit of damage to financial conditions   and, therefore, to the real economy  To the extent that we intervene and slow down the pace of that   deleveraging, we can probably mitigate the degree of damage to financial conditions and to the real   economy  That’s how I think about it    We’re bridging—exactly   December 15–16, 2008 231 of 284     Also how you go through the cycle and what the loss experiences on these   securities are going to be are hugely important  If this is the worst recession in 30 years, that’s   going to be a very interesting data point in terms of what the credit losses on the securities are  If it   turns out that the credit losses are low and the securities are robust, I think that will create more   demand for these securities over time  You have to weigh that, of course, in terms of what leverage   we are going to require financial institutions to carry and how leveraged they can be, and where we   set those two standards will determine what goes through the capital markets versus what goes   through depository institutions    The Treasury has basically committed $20 billion of TARP, and we think   that’s going to fund a program of roughly $200 billion of credit cards and auto loans and so on    Well, I’m sympathetic with your view that broader is better than narrower   because of all the boundary issues that one creates  I think we all are sympathetic with that    I think we would consider it  The real issue is the Treasury’s willingness   to use TARP money  We can’t do any of this without the Treasury’s commitment, so we’re   somewhat constrained in our ability to broaden it in the dimensions that we might want to broaden   it    I’ll give you an example—the VIX has never been this elevated this long   since the Great Depression  "
8655,2009-01-27," Thank you   Thank you    Yes, just a very brief one to reinforce Nathan’s point   We began discussions with the foreign central banks literally last week on this issue, and it was   really begun because of the vulnerability that we felt on Martin Luther King’s Birthday with our   being closed and what would happen in that environment—how we could get liquidity to a US   bank that might have difficulties abroad  In terms of President Evans’s questions about risk, this   is really no different from our lending domestically to a domestic institution against collateral   that we hold, except that we are basically using that collateral to fund the foreign exchange swap    So you can just think of it as equivalent to our lending to a domestic institution against the   collateral they hold here in the United States   Details have not been addressed   It is risk in that the currency is going to be worth less in   dollars, but it is not risk in that you are getting back anything different than what you actually   extended   I would say that the markets are already distorted  We   are starting from a point of the market not in equilibrium in the sense of normal long-time        January 27–28, 2009 46 of 267  functioning We are starting with markets that are very out of joint relative to where they have   been historically So to say that you are distorting markets by the intervention, in fact we are   actually trying to push markets back to something closer toward normality   About your point whether there is a market failure in the securitization market, I think   there is absolutely a market failure in the securitization market, and you basically cited what it   was The very fact that securitization rates are well above the rates that the banks would demand   to hold it on their own balance sheet tells you that the market is fundamentally broken down  It   is certainly true that those particular banks that you cited may not be balance sheet constrained,   but the banking system as a whole is clearly balance sheet constrained  What the TALF does is   basically provide balance sheet capacity to the private sector that the banking system today   cannot provide   Also, even if the ABS market is functional for those two banks that you note, there are a   whole bunch of other problem areas in the securitization market that the TALF could be used to   address in the future  For example, the commercial real estate market is an area about which lots   of people have been coming to us and saying, “We are going to have a real problem refinancing   the commercial mortgage loans that come due in 2009 because there is no balance sheet capacity   in the commercial banking sector” So although it may be true for the two particular banks that   you described, I don’t think it is true for the banking system as a whole  I think that the TALF   can address a real market failure because it provides a number of things that the market can’t get   right now, which are balance sheet capacity, protection against downside risk, and term funding    Those three things are not available in the market right now    I am still trying to figure that out myself     I guess this deserves an answer [Laughter] Well, first   of all, I think we have a fundamental disagreement about how we are looking at the current set of   events I think we are in the middle of a disequilibrium, not an equilibrium  You are looking for   models that describe equilibrium outcomes, and I think we are in the middle of a disequilibrium   caused by the massive deleveraging of the nonbank balance sheet  As that process unfolds, we   are not where your model wants to describe   Number two, what we are observing is well outside the realm of historical experience    So I think that to be able to produce a model that describes what we are seeing is very, very   difficult because we have never been here before  We are just generating the empirical data now   to develop the model that we can actually test  In terms of this issue—is the securitization   market evidence of market failure?—I think my example is just a very simple one  The fact that   the bank, as you describe it, would rather hold these assets on its balance sheet than securitize   them and AAA yields are higher than the net return to the bank of holding them on its balance   sheet is telling you that there is a lack of arbitrage between the bank market and the nonbank   market              January 27–28, 2009 57 of 267  I think fundamentally we have a disagreement about what the process is that we are   describing You say, “Show me a model”  I certainly want to see your model that describes   what has happened over the past 18 months because I think it is very, very difficult to show that   model as well   Yes, that is a fundamental basis of the disagreement   We are in that world  We definitely are   You are exactly right that historically the securitization   market has had elements of regulatory arbitrage I think that is true But I think, in this   particular case, it is not really the reason that AAA ABS assets are still selling at such high yields   right now The reason that they are selling at high yields right now is that the borrowers who   would love to invest in these assets on a leveraged basis can’t get leverage  Their inability to get   leverage is being driven by the balance sheet constraints of the dealer and bank community,   which is a disequilibrium event caused by their historically large mark-to-market losses and   loan-loss provisions, which are depleting their capital and constraining their ability to lend  So   this is a disequilibrium  Five years from now, we won’t be here, and banks will have the ability   to lend, they will be able to lend on AAA assets on a leveraged based, and AAA yields will be   much lower    Yes   The issuer, in principle, could buy it back from the   money market fund and then potentially issue into the CPFF, but that is not an obligation that the   issuer would necessarily have   There is a presumption in President Plosser’s remarks   and President Lacker’s remarks earlier that, if we intervene in one market, we are going to make   these other markets that are adjacent to those markets somehow worse  In fact, we have seen in   several cases that it actually does not work that way  It works in just the opposite way One   good example is the commercial paper market in which the A2/P2 market has actually improved   probably in part because of the commercial paper funding facility’s taking some of the strain off   the commercial paper market  So it might work that way sometimes, and improving one market   may make another market worse  But it also may be that improving the function of one market   by providing balance sheet eases the aggregate balance sheet constraint, which then leads to   improvement in other, adjacent markets  So it is not necessarily true that doing something in one   market makes other markets in which we are not intervening worse     January 27–28, 2009 67 of 267  But did they deteriorate because of our intervention?   Did they deteriorate because of our intervention, or did   they deteriorate because the macroeconomy was deteriorating at a very rapid rate?  I would argue   that they deteriorated because the macroeconomy was deteriorating at a very rapid rate, not   because of our intervention   I would say that the market is not doing well, but it is   doing better than it was a month ago  So it is improving, but I am not aware of the Treasury   having this on the front burner     January 27–28, 2009 71 of 267  In principle, you could set up an SPV that the   municipality issued out of That would be the corporate entity that we would lend to  You could   do that, but it is not clear whether this problem isn’t going to gradually resolve itself   I did that on purpose   He is multiplying by two   You mean, for example, where you want to anchor long­  term inflation expectations?           January 27–28, 2009 113 of 267  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As noted around the table,   the economy continues to contract at a rapid rate, and there are few signs that the pace of decline   has slowed That said, clearly there are some positive elements in aspects of financial   conditions, such as interbank funding rates Corporate bond and mortgage rates have eased   somewhat since our last meeting  Oil prices have fallen a lot over the last few months, and that   has bolstered household real income  Moreover, the political uncertainty about what is next   should lessen now that the Obama Administration has assumed power  Over the next few weeks,   the Administration is likely to pass its fiscal program and announce how it plans to utilize the   second tranche of TARP monies That should lessen some of the uncertainty in financial   markets about the public policy response   But these developments should not comfort us much, if at all  In my view, the risks to   the New York Fed forecast and the Greenbook forecast, which don’t differ very much, remain   very much to the downside, and we should emphasize that when we motivate our response to the   crisis In particular, in addition to the labor market woes already cited, the banking system is   probably in worse shape today than it was last fall, despite the injection of hundreds of billions of   dollars of government capital  Moreover, the ability of the federal government to adequately   recapitalize the banks as loan-loss provisions mount is in question, impaired by the question of   whether the size of the second TARP tranche will be big enough to do the job  A good portion              January 27–28, 2009 146 of 267  of this is going to be used for other areas, such as mortgage foreclosure mitigation, and there are   exceedingly poor politics associated with giving more resources to aid the banks, making it   problematic whether a third TARP installment, which might be needed, can actually be secured   politically Inadequate bank capital is at the core of our problems, and I am not sure we are   going to be able to solve this problem quickly or definitively  It would be much better to do too   much in terms of capital injection, taking back that excess later, than being a day late and many   billions of dollars short as we have often seemed to be throughout this financial crisis  Adequate   capital in the form of tangible common equity is essential to restore confidence, improve credit   availability, and restore good market function   The second issue I would like to talk about is household net worth  It is contracting at a   rate exceeded only in the Great Depression  We should not understate the size of the blow to   US households, for households’ wealth has been evaporating at an alarming rate at a time when   the personal saving rate has been unusually low and the safety net had been whittled back  That   is not a good combination  This is the first big economic downturn in which defined-  contribution plans, which are immediately affected by changes in financial asset value, are the   dominant source of retirement income for many households beyond Social Security  In the past,   defined-benefit plans with a fixed monthly payment insulated retirees and their families from   changes in financial asset values  Moreover, the decline in wealth may not be over  Although I   will not predict the equity market, the Greenbook forecast of a 12 percent annualized return over   the next two years could turn out to be optimistic  After all, if bank balance sheet constraints are   causing risk premiums to be unusually high, couldn’t this also translate into the risk premium for   the US equity market remaining high with lower equity prices at least over the near term?                     January 27–28, 2009 147 of 267  Finally, even if equity prices do better, it certainly looks as though housing prices will continue   to fall for another year or so, until housing inventories are brought down to more-normal levels   Third, the US recession is occurring in the context of global weakness  This means that   the trade sector is not likely to provide any significant degree of support here or anywhere else  I   think this is very important, especially in the context of the staff’s analysis of the Reinhart–   Rogoff consequences of past crises  The staff forecast showed a lesser decline relative to past   crises and what has happened historically Yet in those past crises, individual countries had the   out of depreciating their currencies and having trade improvement  We do not have that out this   time, and I think that just makes me a bit more nervous about whether our experience will be   more in line with those historical experiences   I know the Greenbook and our own modal forecast assume that the recovery will begin in   the second half of the year I hope that is true  But it strikes me that, until our banking system is   repaired, the risks lie clearly to the downside of such a traditional-recovery, V-shaped forecast    At a minimum, the degree of uncertainty about the outlook is unusually wide, as described in the   Greenbook and illustrated by the width of our fan charts  We are well outside the range of   normal experience  In such circumstances, model-based forecasts probably should be viewed   with somewhat greater skepticism, and the Greenbook acknowledges that  Under these   circumstances, the Federal Reserve needs to continue to be aggressive in providing liquidity and   balance sheet capacity to the private sector  The goal should be to ease financial conditions as   much as possible in the current environment, subject to the constraints imposed by our legal   authority, subject to protecting ourselves against credit risk and the issues posed by further rapid   balance sheet expansion on our exit from our current suite of special liquidity facilities   The tension here is that this is probably factually correct,   and so the question is whether or not you want to say what is factually correct because you are   afraid that it will influence expectations   No, not really  The term funding lasts for three years,   but the actual program ends at the end of this year   Thank you, Mr Chairman  We have been discussing   whether we should embark on a long-term Treasury purchase program or whether we should            January 27–28, 2009 199 of 267  engage in a greater magnitude or duration of agency MBS purchases  I am not sure these really   are the next and best escalation options  Not surprisingly, I agree with the staff memo on long­  term Treasuries, since I helped write it  [Laughter]  I think the TALF expansion really is   probably our next and best escalation option, but we are not prepared to do that quite at this time   because we have to do that hand in hand with the Treasury  So I want to agree with Governor   Warsh that this is probably a time for temporizing   It seems clear to me that we do want to continue to expand our liquidity facilities, but to   do so we have to satisfy a number of criteria  I would argue that there are five criteria that any   liquidity expansion should satisfy  First, the market in question needs to be dysfunctional, and   we might measure that by lack of liquidity, higher spreads, and lower volumes  Two, the   dysfunction has to be tightening financial conditions  There needs to be a fairly direct link   between the market in which we are intervening and economic activity  Also, if there is a clear   alternative source of funds, then intervention may not be warranted  Third, we need to be   confident that our facilities are likely to be helpful in improving market function and easing   financial conditions The goal should not be to displace markets but instead to provide support   that primes markets to function better  I think the CPFF is a good example in that respect    Fourth, we need to be comfortable that we will indeed be secure to our satisfaction  Fifth, we   have to be comfortable that exit from these programs can be managed to avoid any conflict with   our dual mandate   The TALF program, especially if the Treasury provides us with some support on the   balance sheet exit issue, appears to fit best with these criteria If the TALF works as anticipated   in restarting the consumer ABS market and bringing down AAA-rated ABS spreads, then we   may wish, with the Treasury as partner adding additional TARP capital, to broaden it to other        January 27–28, 2009 200 of 267  asset classes that are also in distress  In particular, the CMBS market and the nonconforming   RMBS market appear to be very good candidates  It is not just the financing related to new   activity that matters but also the ability for maturing debt to be refinanced  This is a particularly   important issue in both commercial real estate and nonconforming residential mortgage markets    I believe the TALF program is very important because it provides three elements that are not   broadly available to private investors right now—(1) term funding, (2) leverage and balance   sheet capacity, and (3) protection against tail risk  The TALF would bypass banks and dealers   and provide balance sheet capacity directly to risk capital—capacity that today is unavailable   because of the deleveraging that is taking place among banks and dealers and making them much   less willing to extend such credit It also provides protection against tail risk  Because the   financing is done on a nonrecourse basis, the most an investor can lose is the size of the haircut    In this sense, although the TALF program is a lending program, one can also consider it to be a   contingent purchase program  In very bad states of the world in which AAA-rated consumer   ABS tranches decline sharply in value, these securities will be put to the Federal Reserve and   placed in an SPV capitalized by TALF money   The second issue I want to talk about is the exit issue  Although I agree that this is a very   important topic, I wonder how helpful it is to worry about this publicly, for two reasons  First,   anxiety expressed by us about the exit issue may fan fears that we will not be able to exit   smoothly and avoid an inflation problem  If market participants were broadly to share this   opinion, the result could be higher risk premiums and tighter financial market conditions    Second, the more we express concern with exit and our balance sheet, the more we may alter   expectations about how much we are willing to do to support the economy  I think we should err   on the side of reinforcing the message that the FOMC will do all it can to ease financial        January 27–28, 2009 201 of 267  conditions and stimulate the economy  Worrying publicly about the balance sheet seems to   undercut that goal to some degree  At the same time, we should work aggressively to make sure   that our balance sheet will not interfere with the appropriate conduct of monetary policy later,   and we should clearly explain to the public our ability to do so   In terms of the statement, I prefer alternative B language generally, but I would suggest   two alterations In paragraph 2, the language that “the outlook for the economy remains weak”   seems too mild to me and could be taken by market participants as sounding complacent  I   prefer the language from alternative A, which states that “the economy has weakened somewhat   more than anticipated,” which I believe is factually correct and provides greater information   about how the data are coming in relative to our forecast  I also think it signals greater concern   by the Committee about the outlook, which is where the Committee actually is in terms of   thinking about policy going forward The second alteration I would suggest in alternative B is   where we are talking about the implementation of the TALF  We say “next month” in   alternative B  Given that our ability to enact this program is subject to some degree to the   Treasury’s coming along with us in a timely fashion, I think it would be better to change “next   month” to “later this winter,” which will give us until March 21, giving us a few more weeks    Thank you, Mr Chairman   I think “later this winter” does provide an endpoint  I   am not sure how long “soon” is   Yes, I think that is correct, although the Treasury right   now is scrambling to get their new staff up and running  So there is some risk that what had   been agreed to by the old Treasury now needs to be sort of relitigated with the new Treasury    That could delay our putting out a term sheet to market participants, which they really need to   have several weeks ahead of time for this program to get up and operational  I think there is a   good chance that we are still going to be able to make February or certainly early March, but we   probably want a bit of wiggle room there because we don’t have complete control of the process   Yes I would prefer “winter,” but I can live with that    “Soon” is factually correct If we take a broad view of what “soon” means—yes   To not specify it   Yes I guess I am somewhat less than fully enthusiastic   about publishing long-term projections at this time  I could support it, but I just want to make a   couple of points First, I think it is a somewhat awkward time to introduce long-term   projections Our forecasts are almost certainly going to be very wrong, given the level of   uncertainty Moreover, long-term projections may be viewed by market participants as off point    The economy is sinking rapidly, yet the FOMC is spending its time constructing forecasts for   2011 and beyond   Second, if the goal is to introduce long-term projections to communicate the Committee’s   views about parameters such as the NAIRU, the potential growth rate, and the desired level of        January 27–28, 2009 215 of 267  inflation, wouldn’t it be better to simply proceed and publish those measures rather than long­  term projections, which are just an approximation of those parameters?   Third, I think the individual long-term projections are difficult to link back to the   projections for 2011  If one of the primary objectives of the long-term projections is to provide   some background for how the projections past 2011 will converge to the Committee’s goals, you   might want to consider different ways of constructing the central tendency forecast   Fourth, I worry a little about what happens when the composition of the FOMC changes    The long-term projections that result might change because of changes in the composition, not   because of an underlying change in view by individual members  I think it would be hard for   market participants to know how to judge those changes over time, quarter to quarter, as the   projections evolve   So I can support it, but I am not enthusiastic  "
8681,2009-02-07," There will be Treasury capital The question is just, how   much   Well, the haircuts on the existing program are slightly   below 10 percent on average for the consumer asset-backed securities  So the leverage there is   roughly 11 to 1 Obviously, as the Chairman said, we’re going to have to go through the same   analysis that we did for consumer asset-backeds; we have to do it for other asset classes to   determine what is an appropriate haircut given the expected loss experience of commercial real   estate, of private-label RMBS, and so on, under these scenarios  So I think we can’t say for sure   exactly what the leverage ratio is going to be  As the Chairman said, we have choices on   haircuts, we have choices on rates, we have choices on how much capital the Treasury supplies   to backstop the facility—all those parameters can be adjusted  But I think, as a rule of thumb,   we started down the TALF path for consumer asset-backed securities thinking that they were   going to be roughly 10 percent That’s where we ended up  So it’s probably going to be              February 7, 2009 17 of 65  something on the same order of magnitude  But the analysis is going to have to drive that   process I would hesitate to commit to a number before the staff has a chance to do that analysis    Just one thing that I think is different for the smaller   banks relative to the larger banks is that a much greater proportion of their capital structure is in   tangible common equity, and, if you remember, the stress test is going to be applied probably   against this tangible common equity standard For most small banks, they’re probably going to   have quite a bit of room on that metric  And as the Chairman said, it’s just not practical in a two-             February 7, 2009 21 of 65  month window to scrub 8,000 banks So you’re really relying on the fact that most of these   small banks are better capitalized on the metric that you really care about    They are borrowing at a higher rate, though—LIBOR   plus 100 basis points   It will be converted if they absolutely need it   They won’t like that event of the conversion, but that   event would be precipitated by the fact that they had very bad performance and they needed the   common equity So it’s sort of a good news–bad news kind of paradigm   On your TALF asset question, I think that we’re going to try to have the Treasury not be   definitive about what assets are included or not included in the expanded TALF  To give a “for   example”  We’re pretty comfortable, I think, with our analysis that CMBS and private-label   RMBS should be included But whether it goes beyond that, I think, is really in the “to be   determined” category, and I think we are going to try to make sure that the Treasury   announcement doesn’t commit us to things beyond CMBS and private-label RMBS  That’s   certainly our intention    Yes, and I think that Governor Duke raises some very   important points, which is why I was here until late in the night last night, to try to improve the   messaging   I think there’s another issue, too, which is that there are firms that can be resolved pretty   easily within the existing bank resolution framework, and there’s one particular firm that can’t;   we are working on how to handle the one particular firm that can’t, but it’s very, very difficult,   given the existing tools   I think the key question about this aggregator bank is     Given these private sector investors who are going to have to be compensated for the risks that   they’re taking, will the bank pay prices high enough to incentivize banks to actually sell assets to   the aggregator bank?  I think at this stage we don’t really know the answer to that  I don’t think   at this point we can really say how well or how badly it will work in practice   I think the expectation, too, is that this number is not   going to be stated In order to minimize the idea that there is this new requirement, there’s not   going to be a number out there that they actually have to go to  What we have here is a   fundamental tension between individual institutions who want to hold only enough capital for the   good states of the world, and us, who want them to hold enough capital for the bad states of the           February 7, 2009 41 of 65  world, to make the bad states less likely  And that fundamental tension has existed throughout   the last year and a half  The buffer is designed to cut through that dilemma a little bit by forcing   them to hold enough capital that they can withstand a bad state of the world, which will then   make the bad state of the world less likely  I think that’s the intent  But they’re not going to like   it I think that’s fair    Separate silos for each Bank?   It’s not the most straightforward thing to work your way   through, and I think we can share a lot of material on that  But if I could address the risk of the   TALF for just a second, I’d mention four points  One, it’s a triple-A-rated security, so it’s   already at the upper part of the capital structure  Two, there’s a haircut that the investor takes   above and beyond that triple-A-rated security Three, there’s a spread in terms of the interest   margin that’s earned  And then, four, there’s the Treasury capital between us and loss   So a lot of things have to happen to get to the Fed actually losing money here  And under   most scenarios, the Treasury doesn’t lose money  The Treasury makes money on an expected   value basis under reasonably stressful scenarios  We can share that stuff with you  But I think   it’s important to recognize that these are new securitizations, so they’re newly underwritten, and   a lot of things have to happen before they get to us   I don’t have the number off the top of my head  The   number is going up, clearly  It’s a couple of trillion dollars, I think           February 7, 2009 55 of 65  I think your summary of the program was very precise,   exactly as I understand the program myself as of late last evening  I think that we have to   recognize, though, that Mr Geithner still has 48 hours, and the program could change in the   meantime  So if the program turns out to be somewhat different than the Chairman describes,   that’s not the Chairman’s doing, that’s the Treasury Secretary’s doing  It could be a little bit   different at the end of the day than what we have right now, so don’t criticize the Chairman if the   program morphs a little bit in the final 48 hours  I don’t think it’s going to change, though, to a   great degree I think that the one area of the program that really needs to be nailed down is the        February 7, 2009 56 of 65  FDIC guarantee program—exactly how they’re going to extend that, whether they’re going to   modify the cap, and whether the covered bonds are being included  I think that most of the   work, though, on the program now is really on the message  And I think that our general view of   what we saw yesterday was it was a bit scary, it wasn’t particularly confidence-building, and it   wasn’t very clear     We have a number of people at the New York Fed that are helping with the process, and   we’re trying to do three things Make it less scary; make it clear that this capital-raising exercise   is designed to instill confidence in the banking system by ensuring that the banks have enough   capital to withstand the stress scenario, above and beyond what we expect to happen; and, as a   consequence of that, make investors look at the program as confidence-building rather than   confidence-draining I think the disappointment for a lot of people that have been working on   this exercise is that the program is not as clear and definitive as we would like  But we’re going   to try to make the message as clear and as definitive as we can within the confines of the   program   As far as the TALF is concerned, I think that people are going to be a little bit confused   about how the TALF fits into this program, because they’re waiting for an announcement on   Monday about the banking system, and the TALF isn’t really about the banking system per se    It’s really about expanding the capacity of the private sector balance sheet to take the pressure   off the banking system, basically to help market functioning improve and ease financial   conditions So there may be a little bit of confusion with people wondering, well, is this TALF   going to take bad assets off bank balance sheets?  I don’t think the TALF is really being built   with that in mind  It’s possible some assets could come off the bank balance sheets as a   consequence, but we’re going to need to be clear that the TALF is really not a bank rescue              February 7, 2009 57 of 65  vehicle It’s really more about improving financial conditions in the general economy  Thank   you   At this point in time   Yes  On the first question, I think the stress testing is far   beyond any other stress test any financial institution has ever had  I think it’s one out of 100   years, and then stressed versus that   It is a very high stress scenario  And if you want to give   some numbers, it might be useful   Not ours Isn’t that the whole loss?   Including for the Treasury   The Treasury could legitimately argue that they’re   putting up too much TARP capital relative to their risk              February 7, 2009 61 of 65  I think the zombie issue        February 7, 2009 64 of 65 "
8700,2009-03-17," In terms of the order, I think the SPV was initially a   device so that real money investors could get involved in the TALF  But then, as all the political   considerations became more severe over the last couple of weeks, people thought, “well, hey, we   could also use it for this second purpose—to provide some distance from the government and the   TARP restrictions” But the original impetus was for real money accounts    Or we could take the Treasury capital and apply it   against all of the assets   On asset purchases, [laughter] I think there are lots of   good reasons to escalate  The economy is weaker; financial conditions are tighter; in addition,   the TALF is off to a slow start because of all of the stuff that’s swirling around on AIG and   TARP The broader TALF, I think, is going to come much later  While there might be an   announcement on legacy TALF relatively soon, the actual operationalization of that, I think, is   going to take many months—just given that the TALF 10, which we’re enacting today, took   four months  And the PPIF—it’s not even clear whether banks are going to be willing to sell   assets to the PPIF Are they going to get a high enough price to engage in those transactions?    So it seems to me that right now it’s on us  And it’s more on us than it was even a few weeks   ago, because I think the political climate has deteriorated significantly, so the ability of the   Administration to go back to the Congress and get more TARP money is significantly less than it   was even a few weeks ago           March 17–18, 2009 73 of 266  Then the question is What should we escalate to?  The lines in David’s graph suggest   that $2 trillion would put us roughly on top of the unconstrained line  And, conveniently, the   numbers I was going to advocate total $2 trillion, by coincidence rather than by design  We did   not talk beforehand, as David can attest  [Laughter] I think that I’d want to escalate the agency   MBS program to more than $1 trillion, because escalating to $1 trillion through year-end is   basically keeping the run rate exactly the same as the program is doing right now, which is   essentially $500 billion every six months  So I think we should escalate the program, and I   would suggest $1½ trillion The market will not give us much credit for just extending the   program another six months at the same purchase rate  I think the market generally expects us to   extend the program, so I don’t think that’s really going to have a lot of benefit   I would increase the agency debt from $100 billion to $200 billion, so I’m at $22 trillion,   to be honest But I’m not counting that  I don’t think the agency debt is really very important or   that effective, but I think leaving it out raises more questions than it’s worth raising at this   juncture And I would engage in a Treasury purchase program  The last time I was here, I   argued mostly against it  But I think the stakes are pretty high right now  We don’t know   exactly how much a Treasury purchase program would do, but, if we start one, we’ll be able to   answer that question There’s a lot of information that we really just don’t have right now  So I   would suggest engaging in a Treasury purchase program, starting immediately, up to   $500 billion, concentrating in 2-year to 10-year maturities and buying both nominals and TIPS    We can also purchase things outside of those maturities to avoid distortions to the shape of the   yield curve But that’s what I would do   One other thing before I give up the floor—I just want to stress what the point of the   reverse swaps is  The point is to prevent some bad piece of news that creates a liquidity run in              March 17–18, 2009 74 of 266  some foreign market from putting us in a very difficult position in which a foreign central bank   is unwilling to lend to a US-owned company because it doesn’t have enough collateral, and we   don’t have the ability to get them the money quickly enough to prevent a default  I think that we   want to do this I’m not sure whether we want to delegate it to the Subcommittee or actually   enact it in the FOMC; but it would be really unfortunate if we didn’t do this, and then something   happened that caused the exact problem that this reverse swap will address, and then we’d say,   “Why didn’t we do what we could have done to avert it?”  So it’s a belt-and-suspenders   approach, but I think we’re in an environment where we need both a belt and suspenders   But then, what happens after that is the problem   I just had a question about the liquidity of the Treasury   market  People have said a couple of times that the Treasury market is really liquid  I don’t   really think it’s all that liquid  Trish, did you have a comment?   Think about it as  Volatility comes down, therefore the   risk premiums will come down as a function of lower volatility  And that’s what brings rates   down    You’d want it conditional on the financial conditions  In   other words, if things got worse, you’d want to accelerate the rate, and similarly, if things got   better   He’s worried about missing going to bed today    [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman  In general, I think the   Greenbook baseline forecast is pretty sensible The New York Fed view is not much different,   but, echoing President Stern’s comments, I can also tell a credible story of why the rate of   economic contraction first slows, then the economy reverses direction as we move into the   second half of 2009 The inventory cycle turns from negative to positive, the decline in housing   activity ends, mainly because there’s no room to fall further, and fiscal stimulus provides support   to consumer spending and cushions the downward adjustment in state and local government   outlays Unfortunately that doesn’t tell us much about 2010 and beyond  In my view, the   longer-term outlook rests on the answers to two key questions  First, what is the desired   household saving rate?  Where is it headed, and how rapidly will we get there?  Or to put it   somewhat differently, echoing President Yellen, where is the household sector in its   deleveraging process?  And, second, will the financial system stabilize and credit availability   steadily improve over the next couple of quarters?  Of course, these two interact If we don’t get        March 17–18, 2009 146 of 266  an improvement in credit availability, asset prices will go down further, and that will feed back   into the household saving rate   The fourth-quarter flow of funds data were, I think, as expected  They’re going to show   this 9 percent drop in household net worth, which brings the ratio of household net worth to   income back to levels not seen since the mid-1990s  That would seem to imply that the   household saving rate, which is currently around 5 percent, will likely need to rise even further    And the question is To what level?  There has to be quite a bit of uncertainty about that both in   terms of where we are going and how fast we are going to get there  One possible benchmark   would be the household saving rate of the early 1990s, which was slightly below 8 percent  If   that’s where we’re headed, I’d say that’s probably doable while still having an economic   recovery, although it is considerably higher than the Greenbook forecast of 5¼ percent this year   and next An 8 percent rate does not seem too high a bar, given that we have a lot of fiscal   stimulus coming  The fact that most of the stimulus will be saved does not mean that the   stimulus has been ineffective, since the counterfactual in this case might be that the households   would have had to reduce their spending in order to achieve their new desired level of savings   However, one could argue that there’s a risk that an 8 percent household saving rate may   be too low Demographics may imply the need for a higher saving rate now, given that the   working-age population is much older now than it was in the 1990s; in other words, if we adjust   for the age mix of the population today, an 8 percent figure back then might map into a 9 percent   or 10 percent figure today If that’s the case, obviously the task is a bit more daunting  But the   bottom line is, we simply do not know how older households are going to react to the wealth   losses that they’ve experienced in terms of how much they’re going to raise their saving rate,   whether they’re going to delay their retirement, whether they’ll have the opportunity to delay        March 17–18, 2009 147 of 266  their retirement and keep their jobs, and whether they’ll accept lower standards of living in   retirement  It’s just a huge open question   Some commentators have set the bar much higher  They argue that the ratio of household   debt to income needs to fall back to levels of the mid-1980s  That’s a very high bar, implying   the ratio would have to decline by more than half  It would suggest that the deleveraging process   of households has only just begun and that we have many, many years of deleveraging ahead of   us I think that’s a bit too pessimistic a view for several reasons  Over time, the cost of financial   intermediation has fallen; that implies to me a higher debt-to-income ratio and a higher asset-to­  income ratio, as well  Second, some of the changes in tax policy do encourage you to hold more   assets and more liabilities; for example, earlier, you might have paid off your mortgage, and now   you refinance your mortgage and instead fund your 401(k) plan  In that case your assets and   liabilities are both higher now relative to your income, but you are not worse off  I expect we’ll   see some further decline in the household debt-to-income ratio, but because I think the longer-  term secular trend has been upward, I don’t think we’re going to need to see decades-long   household deleveraging At least I hope not   Of course, the difficulty in deleveraging will depend on the inflation outlook  I think   that’s important  If we do fall into a debt–deflation dynamic, then, as income drops, real debt   burdens will increase, and it will become even more difficult for households to deleverage even   if they want to So that just underscores why we need to do everything we can to minimize the   risk of a deflation outcome  The second key issue is, of course, the stability of the financial   system  Without this, I don’t think we can have a sustainable recovery  Yes, the economy could   improve a little bit during the second half of 2009, but if we don’t fix the financial system and its   ability to intermediate between savers and borrowers, I suspect 2010 will be very disappointing               March 17–18, 2009 148 of 266  This is why the downside risks to the forecast still are predominant in our views at the New York   Fed The FOMC and the Board should concentrate on taking whatever steps are needed to   improve market functioning and the viability of the large banks, which lie at the core of the   financial system  This implies expansion of our liquidity programs, such as the TALF, and, at   minimum, increased purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities  It also implies support for   the Treasury’s CAP, which is designed to get additional capital into the banking system, as well   as a willingness to extend our suite of 13(3) activities and our foreign exchange swap programs    Thank you   A quick question The directives have “up to,” and the   statements do not have “up to”  Is that important?  Is that intentional?    You don’t necessarily want to save the $500 billion for   the second half of the year is what you’re saying?   “Over the next several months”   You have this one question of the settlement of   mortgage securities, though, which might not actually occur by then    I’m sorry, if I could just add a point  With the CPFF,   you had this big refinancing wave that happened late January  You’re not going to have another   one until late April, and there’s going to be less coming due at that time So that’s probably not   going to change dramatically  The big question is on the foreign exchange swap side  But that   has already come down a lot   450   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Obviously, there’s a need for   more stimulus, and it looks like less support is going to be coming from other quarters, so a   substantial escalation is appropriate  Obviously, given what I said yesterday, I favor doing both    I would favor scaling up the Treasuries’ size to $500 billion from $300 billion, per Governor   Warsh’s comment that, if you’re going to do this, you might as well do it in size  I don’t think   the balance sheet constraint here is really meaningful, because we can sell or repo the Treasuries   at a future date So I just don’t think that’s a reason to make the distinction between $300 billion   and $500 billion, and I think we’ll have a more definitive test of how the market perceives this if   we do $500 billion rather than $300 billion At $300 billion, if we don’t get much response,   we’re not going to know if it was because the market thought the scale was small  I think $500   billion is a more appropriate metric  I favor A over A′ just because I think it’s simpler and it’s   more consistent with what we’ve been doing And I agree that we should not be quite so scary in   reminding people of how badly the economy is doing            March 17–18, 2009 215 of 266  I think it’s fine for the Desk just to accelerate its   purchases, and the market is going to see it   I think that’s more accurate     Are we putting “up to’s” in front of all of these   numbers?   I think they are always “up to”   I think the one issue, though, is to make sure it’s not   quite so definitive that you are committing to purchase exactly that number     We have to put the Treasury sentence in the directive  "
8729,2009-04-28," Thank you  I just want to thank Trish Mosser as acting   SOMA manager for dispensing her duties with such élan and skill  As you know, Brian Sack   will be joining us as the head of the Markets Group and, subject to the Committee’s vote, will   become the SOMA manager going forward  But thank you, Trish   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the economy is going   to do somewhat better over the next few months and, I hope, quarters  A big swing in the rate of   inventory liquidation is certainly going to help, and we have seen in the past that it can be very,   very powerful quarter to quarter A good example is the fourth quarter of 2001 to the first   quarter of 2002—which was probably the worst forecast I ever made in my life—but I’m not   going to be very impressed by that for several reasons   First, we still do not have the banking system on a sound footing, and that’s pretty   damning, frankly, 20 months into this crisis  If we can do a good job with the supervisory capital   assessment program and get more capital into the banking system, then we have a fighting   chance In this regard, I think it is important for us all to be on message about this  Next week is   going to be really, really important  The announcement will generate lots of criticism  The   stress test is not severe enough, the estimated losses are too low, and so on  I believe that we     April 28–29, 2009 80 of 201  should emphasize three points  First, what is the purpose of the exercise?  To get more capital   into the banking system and thereby to make the adverse outcome less likely  It is important not   to get lost in the fine print  Second, the adverse scenario that was assumed is still considerably   worse than the base forecast; and in the adverse scenario, banks would still be well capitalized    We need to emphasize that  Third, in assessing the loss figures, we need to make it clear that the   losses that matter for commercial banks are credit losses, not liquidation losses  Because banks   have deposits, they can hold their assets to maturity  This means that the liquidation value is   mostly irrelevant This is particularly important in the current environment, of course, because   the illiquidity discount is unusually high  This makes the value of the assets to those, such as   banks, that are leveraged and have deposits that can fund and hold those assets much greater than   the value of the assets to those, such as hedge funds, that have difficulties in this environment   obtaining leverage   The second thing that I would stress about the economic outlook is that a lot of pain is   still ahead, and I’ll echo some of President Hoenig’s comments  Commercial mortgages and   highly leveraged loans appear particularly vulnerable  Commercial mortgages are suffering from   a double whammy—a higher capitalization rate on mortgages and lower income  This is pushing   down commercial real estate values sharply  The John Hancock Tower sold for half the price at   which it was purchased in 2005, and that’s considered a prime property rather than a not very   attractive property I don’t see this ending very quickly  On the corporate side, highly leveraged   businesses are going to have trouble refinancing for the same reason  The rise in the risk-  adjusted return demanded by investors will significantly drive down the value of the underlying   enterprises  For many private equity deals, covenant-lite loans and PIK toggles will delay the        April 28–29, 2009 81 of 201  day of reckoning, but that just means that the resulting hole that must be filled will be bigger as a   consequence   The third thing I’d say on the economy is that the big news is the large adjustment that   households are going to have to make in terms of deleveraging and the offsetting shift that we’re   going to have to see in foreign economies toward stimulating domestic demand and away from   exports That’s going to take quite a bit of time, and to my mind that process is just starting    This is one more reason that I think the risks to the economic outlook, even expecting that GDP   growth may resume by the second half of this year, are still very much to the downside   It would do less, though, to bring down mortgage rates    So it really depends a little on why you are purchasing the Treasuries Are you purchasing the   Treasuries to bring down mortgage rates, or are you purchasing Treasuries to steepen the yield   curve?   No, I don’t think that’s right  I think doing it means that   you like what you’ve done You want to do more, and it opens the door for doing even more at   subsequent meetings        April 28–29, 2009 125 of 201  I think part of the confusion here is that we do a program   and the market is also evaluating whether the program is effective, and then how are we going to   react to the perception of the effectiveness of the program?  So if we do a program and the   market responds in the way that we want the market to respond, the market participants are going   to assume that, gee, it worked pretty well for the Federal Reserve, so of course the Federal   Reserve is likely to want to do more of it  Their view is conditioned not just on the   macroeconomic outlook but also on how the markets respond to the program  In this particular   case of the Treasury securities, I think that the market expects that the program is going to be   expanded because (1) we did expand the MBS purchase program and so they’ve already seen   that, when the market seems to get the desired response, the Fed has responded by increasing the   size of the program and (2) they’ve seen that the Treasury program seems to have worked in the   desired way that we intended So all of those things point to an expectation that they expect the   program to be expanded   Oh, sure But it’s not just the economic outlook; it’s   also how the program seems to work in practice because we don’t have any track record on this   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have some sympathy with   President Yellen’s case for expanded purchases, but I think that we have to recognize that these   purchase programs have costs as well as benefits  Speaking for myself, I would really feel more   comfortable if we had a more formal evaluation of what those costs and benefits were regarding   what we have done up to now One cost that I don’t think we have ruminated on very much is   the interest rate risk that we are actually taking on the Fed’s portfolio  One thing I have   wondered about is, if the balance sheet were to get $6 trillion and most of that was Treasuries   and MBS, what would happen if short-term rates rose above the yield on our portfolio?  What   would happen if we were asking the Treasury to pay us money because we had negative interest?    In a way, we are turning ourselves into a kind of S&L in terms of our balance sheet structure,   and we really need to think about what the implications of that are for the medium and longer   term  So I would encourage the staff to do analysis on those kinds of issues for the June   meeting   The second reason that I don’t think it is appropriate to do it right now is that it would   send an odd signal to the market  We are saying that things are better, yet we feel the need to        April 28–29, 2009 149 of 201  expand our purchase programs in a way in which the market was not anticipating us to do  So I   think it would be a little confusing to the market  I think the market is expecting us to do   something in June about Treasuries because of the cliff question  In other words, what   happened?  It is a six-month program  The market is going to start looking ahead to what   happens at the end We need to do more to get clear on how we think about these cliff effects  It   is not quite the same as the federal funds rate because you could argue that ending the purchase   program is de facto tightening  You are taking away something that is pushing down rates, so I   don’t think it is quite the same as specifying the federal funds rate path  It is a lot different, too,   because there is so little experience with it  We have had many, many economic cycles in which   to get a sense of the federal funds rate—you know, market prices, futures expectations, et   cetera—but I think we need to do some more work on this whole cliff effect  I think the market   implicitly assumes that we are going to taper off and smooth the rough edges  I notice that, in   the balance sheet simulations that were put forward yesterday, it went to the end and just ended   abruptly I don’t think that is really what the market expectation is  I think they expect us to   round those off But we haven’t really discussed that formally as a group, and we need to come   to some conclusions on that   As far as the choices for the statement, I favor the B alternatives—you know, B′, B′′, and   B′′′ I am not sure what is gained by the added details  The market participants can already   calculate the monthly purchase rates by just taking what we have announced about duration and   magnitude  I also think that writing down specific monthly purchase rates implies that the   growth rate of the balance sheet is the prime metric driving our thought process  I don’t really   think that is right We are really thinking more about the effect on financial conditions  And I   don’t think a dollar of Treasury purchases is necessarily the same as a dollar of agency purchases           April 28–29, 2009 150 of 201  or agency MBS or some other things that we are doing with our balance sheet  So I don’t want   to suggest that a dollar of the balance sheet is created equal across all our different facilities    Finally, if we added some more detail, it would be a little confusing to people because they   would say, “Well, why are they telling us this now?  Why didn’t they tell us this a meeting ago,   two meetings ago, or three meetings ago?”  So I think it would be more confusing than   illuminating to the markets  Thank you   I agree with Governor Warsh that the market thinks that   the prospect of taking down the size of the facilities is extremely low  "
8752,2009-06-03," I talked to the senior people from S&P this morning   about this issue What is happening is that they are changing their methodology, so the actual   credit quality of the CMBS tranches that we are talking about isn’t changing; it is really that they   are changing how they characterize them  And we are going to have to make a decision, frankly    If their characterization is way outside what we think is appropriate, we may want to modify our   criteria For example, let’s imagine a situation in which there are five rating agencies, and four   rank a given tranche triple-A, and S&P is the outlier  If we really judge that the outlier is   inappropriate—in other words, that there isn’t a lot of credit risk associated with that tranche—   we might want to change our criteria to allow one exception among the credit-rating agencies    So that is something that we are going to have to evaluate  We are going to have to see what   they do and then (1) evaluate what that means for the size of the eligible market and (2) consider   what it means, if we modified the criteria, in terms of what sort of credit risk we would be   actually taking So we are going to have to wait and see what they actually do in terms of what   the impact is and then feed that into what is appropriate for the program  But it is not a change in   their perception of the actual underlying credit quality; it is how they are characterizing that   credit quality because they are changing their methodology   My point is that I think we just want to make sure that   we control our own destiny It may be completely appropriate for S&P to do these downgrades,   and we may feel completely comfortable with that  We may want to rule out all of those     June 3, 2009 11 of 20  tranches I am just saying that it is possible that we may view them as such outliers in terms of   their assessment of credit quality that we may not want to give full weight to it  So you are   absolutely correct  We haven’t changed our policy, and we haven’t committed to changing our   policy But we might want to reevaluate that     Another whole issue about the question of credit rating   is that, when you are talking about a new securitization selling at par, the ratings are comparable   across different assets, but when you are talking about a legacy security, where the security   might be selling at a very big discount to par, it is not really clear how that price and rating map   into actual credit risk In other words, if I could buy a double-A-rated CMBS that is selling at   5 cents on the dollar and then I am haircutting it on top of that, the risk I am taking is probably   de minimis  So it is very important to recognize that there is a whole second set of complications   when you are talking about legacy securities because a lot of these securities are not selling at   par They are selling at deep discounts to par, so a lot of the risk is already embodied in that     June 3, 2009 12 of 20  price But the rating agencies don’t think of it that way  They are rating it as if it were an   instrument trading at par, and the risk of taking actually any losses whatsoever on that    That is certainly possible  I think that, in our   conversations with the different rating agencies, we have felt the least comfortable that S&P was   up to snuff in how they rate the commercial mortgage products  So you are absolutely right   Everyone could converge to S&P’s new standard—or maybe not  But at the end of the day, what   we really have to think about is that this shouldn’t be driven by one rating agency  It should be   driven by what we are trying to do with the program and what is an acceptable level of credit risk   to us Now, obviously, the acceptable level of credit risk to us is de minimis  So I am not   suggesting that we are going to be widening the program to take on a lot more risk, but I don’t   think we want to absolutely pre-commit ourselves to go wherever S&P drives the bus  That’s all   David, where would you put the unconstrained   equilibrium federal funds rate today compared with, say, the April meeting and earlier in the   year?  And roughly how much of that is driven just by the forecast turning out differently than   we expected versus how much of that is due to the easing in financial conditions that we’ve   seen?           June 3, 2009 15 of 20   Okay  "
8766,2009-06-23," I think another issue is, of course, that the reserve   requirements wouldn’t fall precisely on those who have the excess reserves  So you’d be   creating a lot of frictional cost by doing it that way   Yes, just very quickly On the agency MBS, I think   there is some notion that the rate of purchases will somehow be loosely linked to the amount of   originations and the effect on spreads  So we are a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of doing   the $125 trillion, but that’s also because originations were very, very strong, and they’ll   probably be weaker in the second half of the year  So the purchases will probably slow down a   little bit   To your point, President Rosengren, it would be really hard to accelerate purchases in   response to a backup in yields, because that would then run into the conflict of having only so   much authority over such-and-such a time period  I mean, talk about potentially having severe   cliff effects I’m going to buy more as rates go up?  What happens if rates go up more?  Then   I’m going to buy more, and then I’m also going to be out of ammunition  I think actually putting        June 23–24, 2009 35 of 261  that in practice without the FOMC sort of dynamically altering the limits of how much the Desk   could do would, I think, be very, very difficult   Right, but the Desk does not want to make a   presumption that you’re necessarily going to reload, and it’s probably inappropriate for the Desk   to make that presumption  So I think it’s a pretty complicated thing to do in practice   Don’t we have the ability to affect the rate at which   people can borrow through the interest on excess reserves?  If that really became a problem, we   would be able to affect that   All of the asset purchase programs are “up to”  They do   depend on the conditions at the time    The other problem is that they’re still balance sheet   constrained in terms of the amount of capital they have relative to their assets  You can see that   in a wide variety of areas; for example, the spread of jumbo mortgages relative to conforming   mortgages is still very elevated   I hope not  The issue from my perspective is that it’s   political In other words, the day that you find out that you’re no longer remitting positive   balances to the Treasury, there’s a nice, juicy news story, and then they go evaluate  Why did   this come about?  Because the Fed engaged in these large-scale asset programs and because of   asset–liability mismatch  Was that prudent for the Federal Reserve to do?                      June 23–24, 2009 49 of 261   You might not know ex ante which things are going to   have liquidity issues in the future   Having a lending program allows you to accommodate   those shortages that might occur ex post   Another alternative may just be to clarify in the   Humphrey-Hawkins report, rather than coming up with a whole new vehicle  It could just   provide a bit more language about what the intent of the programs is and about our thought   processes From my perspective, the statement and the minutes are not great vehicles for   communicating about this                 June 23–24, 2009 67 of 261  I’m assuming that we’re going to stay on the same path    I still think it would be useful to have something in the Humphrey-Hawkins report that explains   what this is And then, if we depart, I agree, I think we’d have a different directive   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we have to be really   careful about our communications in terms of discriminating between our ability to exit   smoothly and implying that we’re about to exit  I will probably come back to this point   tomorrow  The anxiety that I have about inadvertently implying to the market that we are exiting   soon is particularly high now, because the market has already priced in a lot more tightening than   most of us think is likely over the next year or two  That said, of course, we have to be prepared   for exit, and I think being prepared for exit and articulating that is really, really important in   keeping inflation expectations well anchored, and also in keeping the dispersion of inflation              June 23–24, 2009 89 of 261  expectations compact  So I think we definitely have to do that, but I think it’s tricky to do one   without implying the other   In terms of Brian’s recommendations on the facilities, I’m pretty comfortable with all of   it I do want to make sure the language stays where it is, though, and doesn’t get more definitive   about what happens in February  I think February is a long time away, and I wouldn’t want to   prejudge what we’re going to want to do or not want to do in February  I think where we are   right now in terms of the language is about right  It basically says there’s a possibility that we   might not extend it, so the market is put on notice  But it doesn’t necessarily commit us to   ending the facilities   On the TAF, I am on the other side of that issue from Don on the rate rise  It’s not a big   deal for me, but let me just explain why I am on the other side  I think raising the rate on TAF   will be seized upon by some as the beginning of raising interest rates  So it’s not the TAF rate   rise that bothers me per se  I can certainly understand the argument for doing that in the small,   but I’m a little worried that if we do it, people will say, “Oh, look, this is the very beginning of   the rate hikes, because they have now raised the rate on the TAF”  There’s also a second, more   subtle issue on the TAF, if we are actually going to go to the sporadic TAF auctions over the   longer term  We probably can’t really do that in a normal environment with a penalty rate  If   you think of the transition on the TAF, we’d have to move to a penalty rate, and then later on, as   we go to the sporadic auctions, we’d actually have to lower the rate again  That just seems a   little confusing to me  But my main concern is the signal in terms of monetary policy that people   might draw from raising the rate   On the LSAP, I don’t feel very defensive about what we’ve been doing  After all, we did   get a really good mortgage refinancing wave—that was the point of the exercise  It’s hard to              June 23–24, 2009 90 of 261  know how much of it was MBS versus Treasuries, and we’ll never really know for certain  But I   feel pretty good about basically having achieved that objective   In terms of Treasuries, I don’t think there’s any appetite for going much larger  I think   the choice is really between standing pat and going to, as President Yellen said, $450 billion and   extending it through year-end The advantage of the latter is that you don’t have to make up   your mind quite so soon, but the disadvantage is that it seems like a pretty weak response  It   shows a lack of sort of confidence in what the Fed is doing with this facility  So I guess I’m   slightly leaning toward standing pat, because I worry that the other option would be viewed as   too little to be significant I think the suggestion about hybrid ARMs makes a lot of sense  In   some ways, if we don’t do that, we’re basically distorting the relationship between the fixed-rate   agency MBS and the hybrid ARMs, and it’s not really clear why we would want to do that   Well, hopefully heaven can’t wait too long  [Laughter]   I just want to amplify what President Fisher said about the uncertainty created by all of the   Obama Administration initiatives  We heard from one large firm that this is really important,   especially in health care Why would you build a new wing of a hospital if you don’t know what   the reimbursement rates are going to be?           June 23–24, 2009 143 of 261  Generally, I think the economy is still very weak  I think we’re probably at or very close   to a cyclical bottom  The market reaction, though, is really mostly, to my mind, about pricing   out the tail risk of a depression rather than pricing in a strong recovery, and I think the market   over the last week or two has sort of been rethinking its reaction  What has been going on in the   labor market is pretty striking  The rise in the participation rate may be indicative of stress in   terms of balance sheets and people being forced back into the labor market, even though the   prospects aren’t very good   Past credit crises certainly suggest that the dynamics of recovery this time will be very   different The wealth shock is unprecedented Credit availability is going to be constrained for   quite a while There are significant rollover risks for large groups of borrowers—the commercial   mortgage market is probably the most significant one  And it’s going to take several years, I   think, for the financial system to get back to more normal functioning   One thing that struck me in looking at the macro data is how we’ve been benefiting from   unusually favorable income dynamics up to now  If you look at the trend of income relative to   hours worked and wages, real disposable income growth has been very, very strong—6½ percent   at an annual rate in the first quarter and on pace by the New York Fed forecast for a 42 percent   annual rise in the second quarter That has allowed the saving rate to rise sharply without   triggering a big fall in consumer spending  The problem is that the factors underlying the sharp   rise are all behind us the big increase in transfer payments, automatic stabilizers, the large   COLA for Social Security caused by the big run-up in energy prices last year, the tax cuts,   changes in withholding rates in April, and payments made to Social Security recipients in May   and June                     June 23–24, 2009 144 of 261  Looking forward, the trend in real disposable income is going to be much worse in the   second half of the year—we’re probably going to see actual declines  So we’re assuming that   consumption will rise despite the fact that disposable personal income is falling, and the saving   rate will fall as a consequence  But I think there is a risk to the downside, because maybe the   saving rate won’t fall and consumption will just be weaker than we anticipated   The other thing I am worried about is this  I think it’s very premature to rule out further   financial market disruptions  A couple of times in the crisis we’ve thought that things were   getting better, and then there was another shock  Obviously, when Lehman failed, we had no   idea what the macroeconomic consequences of that were going to be  One thing I am worried   about is that the TLGP is almost certainly going to end September 30, so that means financial   institutions are going to face more rollover risk for all the debt that’s coming due after   September 30  And we still have several very large, systemically important institutions that are   very fragile and that have broad international operations  We don’t have a resolution mechanism   to deal with them if they get into difficulties  And the political will to help these firms if they do   get into trouble, I think, is quite a bit subdued compared to what it was a year ago  So I think   that’s something to be concerned about   On inflation, I think the near-term outlook is that core inflation is going to moderate from   where it has been  The tobacco taxes are sort of a funny anomaly—how you raise taxes   shouldn’t really affect the inflation numbers, but it does in certain cases  Inflation expectations   seem to be well anchored despite some worries about monetization of the debt, and we have a   very large output gap To make sure that we keep inflation expectations well anchored, I think   we need to do more in articulating why will be able to exit smoothly  The biggest upside risk on   inflation to me would be a broad loss of confidence in the US abroad caused by worries about              June 23–24, 2009 145 of 261  fiscal sustainability and the independence of the Fed  The only way I can see getting a big   inflation problem any time soon is if the dollar were to collapse  There’s probably some risk of   that, but I think it should be very low as long as we communicate clearly that we have the tools   to manage our exit smoothly and that we are committed to long-term price stability, regardless of   what the fiscal authorities do Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The statement is one way we   communicate, but we also communicate in speeches  I just want to reemphasize one more time   that it’s really important in our communications to distinguish between stressing how well   prepared we are to exit, in the sense of having the necessary tools, and actually exiting  I think   we have to be really clear on that, or else we are going to confuse people into thinking we’re   about to exit because we’re talking about our ability to exit  We obviously need to demonstrate   that we have the ability to exit to keep inflation expectations well anchored  But we don’t want   them to think that we’re going to exit soon, or sooner than we actually think, because that will   boost the expected path of short-term rates, which will raise long-term interest rates, and,   therefore, choke off recovery  So it’s tricky   If you think of long-term rates as having three major components—the expected path of   real short-term rates, inflation expectations, and risk premiums—you can sort of put it in that   context Making it clear that the economy is pretty weak and that we don’t think there’s any   meaningful inflation risk, so we can keep short-term rates low for an extended period, should put   the focus on that first component, keeping the real rate path expectations well contained    Making clear that we have the tools to exit smoothly, so we can keep inflation in check over the                  June 23–24, 2009 197 of 261  longer term, should work on that second component by keeping inflation expectations well   anchored It also should work on the third component, because if we keep inflation expectations   well anchored, there will be less dispersion in terms of inflation expectations, and that   presumably will result in a lower risk premium That’s sort of how I think about it conceptually   in terms of the task at hand  It’s not easy, but I think we have to be very, very careful in how we   go forward communicating   In terms of the LSAP program, I think the tapering is not as big an issue for Treasuries,   because the amount of Treasuries that were purchased is not that large relative to the flow of   issuance I think we can do it without actually saying it explicitly  We can just purchase   Treasuries at a little faster rate than the $300 billion rate over six months, and so at the end we   won’t have quite as much left, so it will just taper off  The other problem with talking about   tapering is that it implies that you’re done  If we start talking about tapering, people say, “Oh,   they’re done” I think it’s premature at this stage to make strong statements about what we want   to do or not do with the purchase programs going forward, especially if the environment turns   out to be worse than we expect   On the first paragraph, I agree with Governor Tarullo  The first paragraph does sound   sort of upbeat I’m not really sure how you would fix it—maybe you could try to have some   language that suggests that none of this is a real surprise  In other words, the economy is   evolving pretty closely to the forecast that we actually had, so the improvement is not a shock to   us It’s just that there are lots of other issues still outstanding that make us worry about the   strength of the recovery over the longer term  So it’s a little bit upbeat relative to what I think   we really think around the table              June 23–24, 2009 198 of 261  In terms of the statement, I’m in favor of B  On the last, bracketed sentence, my question   is really  does it reassure, or does it make the market more worried about our ability to exit and   about the timing of exit?  I’m really not sure  I think you could argue it both ways, as people   around the table have done My view is, if we’re not sure, we probably shouldn’t include it,   because I go back to what Governor Warsh said  This is not the greatest medium of   communication I think I would exclude the last sentence, just because I’m not sure how the   market will react to it  It’s probably better to take that up in the Chairman’s testimony or in the   Monetary Policy Report or in speeches  Thank you   I would cut that second half of the sentence  "
8795,2009-08-11," Just to amplify President Rosengren’s remarks, we were   already distorting the market by just buying fixed-rate mortgages  So you could argue that, if   you were to purchase fives, sevens, and tens, actually you’d be reducing the amount of distortion   because you’d be bringing those rates back into better alignment with where they have been        August 11–12, 2009 19 of 165  historically So I’m not convinced that the distortion argument goes against the ARM purchases    I think you could argue just as strongly that it gives a case for the ARM purchases   Right now you are pushing people into fixed-rate   mortgages because those yields are so much lower than the ARM yields because you’re   intervening in the one market and not the other   I was just curious where the staff came out in rank   ordering of these different proposals and whether they were viewed as complements or   substitutes?  Should we on embark all three, or should we go forward with one faster than the   other?  They were three separate briefings, but I didn’t get a sense of how to think of them in   total   If I can just interject very briefly   The triparty repo is probably going to be changed very   substantially, and so I think that the clearing bank issue will be resolved in the context of that   adjustment  It won’t be the separate issue in terms of how we are doing the reserve management    Triparty repo has to be altered, irrespective of the excess reserves issue   I have a question about the brokered fed funds market   versus the other It seems as though we are a bit captured by the brokered fed funds market   because that is where we have the rate information  But couldn’t we actually get the rate   information on the bank-to-bank funds market if we really made an effort and because we   regulate these entities?  [Laughter]  And if that were the case, we might not want to have the   brokered funds market be the dominant element driving our decisions  It is just an observation   question    Then you don’t have to worry about the GSEs   contaminating your observations of the brokered funds market  You know, a lot of this is an   effort to take the GSEs and the fact that they are contaminating that market  There might be an   easier way to ignore that market and go to the broader market    Yes, not so much anymore    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like I think most people   around the table, I am pretty confident that real GDP growth will be positive this quarter  Much   of the economic news has been better since the last meeting, with a wide range of indicators   suggesting that the recession is either over or will be over very soon  For the remainder of the   year, the economy should be boosted by three factors that a lot of people have cited around the   table—recovery in housing and a significant rise in motor vehicle sales, the effect of the fiscal   stimulus program in supporting domestic demand, and a sharp swing in the pace of inventory   investment  In fact, if the inventory swing were concentrated in a particular quarter, we could   actually see fairly rapid growth for a brief period     But I expect that, as in the 2001–03 period, the recovery will be slower than usual, at   least over the next year or two In particular, I expect that consumption is likely to grow only   modestly First, growth of real disposable income will probably be weak by historical standards    As I noted at the last meeting, there are a number of special factors that boosted real disposable   income in the first half of the year, helping to offset a sharp drop in hours worked and very   sluggish hourly wage gains  These special factors will be absent during the second half of the   year Second, households are still adjusting to the sharp drop in net worth caused by what will   likely be a persistent decline in home prices and last year’s fall in equity prices  This suggests to   me that the desired saving rate will not decline sharply as the recession comes to an end  As a   consequence, consumer spending is unlikely to rise much faster than income  In other words,   weak income growth will act as an effective constraint on the pace of consumer spending  Third,   the financial system is still in the middle of a prolonged adjustment process  Banks and other   financial institutions are working their way through large credit losses, and the securitization        August 11–12, 2009 96 of 165  markets are recovering only very slowly  This means that credit availability will be constrained   for some time to come, and this will also serve to limit the pace of the recovery   Despite the big buildup of slack in the economy, the core measures of inflation have been   somewhat sticky  I don’t think this will last Thus, I think the risks on inflation are still likely to   be on the downside over the next year or two There are two reasons why I think core inflation is   likely to decline going forward First, the variables that respond to labor market slack, such as   the employment cost index, have already fallen quite sharply  This suggests that the output gap   is exerting downward pressure on labor costs, which is a key component of overall costs in many   industries Second, during the first half of the year, core services inflation has been lower than   core goods inflation I think this is meaningful because core services inflation exhibits much   more inertia than core goods inflation and because it is unusual for inflation for core services to   be running lower than core goods inflation in the first place  I don’t expect that we will see this   pattern persist for long, and I suspect that it is more likely that core goods inflation will moderate   than that core services inflation will pick up in the near term  So I would expect the overall core   inflation rate to come down  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  First I want to make two   brief comments, one on the dry tinder concept that we brought up at the last meeting and the   other one on potential changes in the NAIRU  The reason I want to bring these up is that I think        August 11–12, 2009 143 of 165  they are both relevant in terms of our communication strategy and our ability, by consistent   messaging, to keep inflation expectations well anchored  If we do not speak with a relatively   consistent voice, I think we run risks in that dimension   The last time the view was expressed that excess reserves sitting on banks’ balance sheets   are essentially dry tinder that could quickly fuel excessive credit creation and put the Fed behind   the curve in terms of tightening monetary policy  I have to admit that, in terms of imagery, this   concern does seem compelling  The banks are sitting on piles of money that could be used to   extend credit on a moment’s notice  However, I think this reasoning ignores a very, very   important point  Based on how monetary policies have been conducted for the past several   decades, banks have always had the ability to expand credit whenever they like  They don’t need   a pile of dry tinder in the form of excess reserves to do so  That’s because the Fed has   committed itself to supply sufficient reserves to keep the federal funds rate at its target  If banks   want to expand credit and that drives up the demand for reserves, the Fed automatically meets   that demand in its conduct of monetary policy  So in terms of the ability of banks to expand   credit rapidly, it makes no difference whether they have lots of excess reserves or not  I think it   is an important point   In terms of the NAIRU, there has been some discussion that the NAIRU may have moved   up I certainly do not dispute that idea and its implications  But I think there is an implication   that is sort of implied by some that this might be a reason to exit from our current stance of   monetary policy somewhat earlier than otherwise  I think we need to be careful about   exaggerating the potential import of the possibility of a somewhat higher NAIRU  The key   question in a world where the unemployment rate is currently 94 percent and likely to rise   higher is how much the NAIRU has increased  To get an idea of what might be in the feasible              August 11–12, 2009 144 of 165  set of outcomes, we looked at the CBO’s estimates of the NAIRU, which extend back 55 years    I am not saying that the CBO’s estimates of the NAIRU are perfect, but they are an interesting   starting point We found that the largest three-year increase in their estimate of the NAIRU over   this 55-year period was 03 percentage point, and at its highest point in this fifty-five-year   history, the NAIRU was still below 6½ percent   So what do I make of this?  Well, it implies to me that, even if one thinks that the NAIRU   has increased, it is implausible to think that it has increased sufficiently to change the story   meaningfully over the next couple of years  We have a large output gap that is going to take a   long time to close  Thus, arguing that the NAIRU may be higher is likely just to confuse market   participants about the issue at hand unless we can credibly claim that the NAIRU has increased   so much that we are going to hit this very, very quickly  I do not think that claim is plausible    So I would be counseling people not to make this argument because it is going to confuse people   about how quickly we are going to exit from our monetary policy regime   With respect to the statement, I favor alternative B as revised  I think the case for   expanding Treasury securities is very weak—first, given the improvement in financial conditions   and the economic outlook  When we did this in March, it was with considerable reluctance, I   think, but it was because the outlook was really quite grim, and the outlook has improved   significantly since then Second, there are lots of uncertainties about what this would mean for   inflation expectations, and that is the part of the Treasury purchase program that was always   wrought with some peril, and we found out that there was really some risk associated with that in   terms of that dimension  Third, market participants do not expect us to expand it  So I think that   we should stick with alternative B as revised, where we basically say we’re bringing it to an end   with the taper I think Governor Warsh is absolutely correct that the tapering is not necessary for     August 11–12, 2009 145 of 165  Treasuries but it is a good signaling device to imply what we are likely to do with the other   programs   Financial conditions have improved considerably since the last meeting  I think that is   important  It means that abstracting from other factors, such as the GDP revisions, the optimal   unconstrained funds rate is considerably less negative now than it was at the last meeting  But it   still remains below the zero bound by most measures at a relatively high degree of confidence    That suggests to me that a steady-as-she-goes policy for the time being is the right one  That   means keeping the pre-commitment of an extended period in place and completing the purchase   programs that we had committed to earlier  I have a strong presumption that, as we go forward,   we are going to finish the agency MBS program  On the agency debt program, I am sort of   agnostic I don’t think it is really that important whether we stop at $150 billion or we go all the   way to $200 billion But with the agency MBS program, the market has a strong presumption   that we are going to do the whole thing, and I would hope at the next meeting, assuming that we   are still on the same economic trajectory that we think we are going to be on, that we would   commit to doing the whole thing at that meeting  Thank you  "
8821,2009-09-22," I just want to amplify on Brian’s answer  First, I think   the effect would be 15 to 30 basis points at a minimum, because by the end of this week we’re   going to have done about $895 billion of agency MBS purchases So to cap it at a trillion means   you are only doing $105 billion as opposed to $355 billion  So it’s a pretty sizable discrete   difference Second, the market would take it as an independent signal about how concerned or   unconcerned the Fed was with the economic outlook  They probably would also pull forward the   timing of Fed tightening  So there’d probably be a separate channel in terms of the effects on                   September 22–23, 2009 13 of 212  yields I think Brian’s 15 to 30 basis points is conservative, if you add those two effects   together   You’re pretty close to ending it if you only have   $105 billion to go   I had a question for Jim  Obviously as we contemplate the   agency debt and agency MBS purchase programs, the issues are related to our ability to actually have the   sort of “suspenders” in place, in terms of reverse repo or term deposit facilities, to be confident that we   can actually do that if we needed to  The reverse repo instrument, as you described, is a size constraint   for the dealers How confident are you that the reverse repo program  can be successfully introduced to a   broader set of counterparties? Highly confident?  Not so confident?  I think the answer to that question is   relevant for thinking about our balance sheet size Also, are there potential legal impediments, or is this   just an operational issue?    I guess what I’m asking is, over the longer term—you said nine   months from now—could you drain a trillion dollars of reserves if you had to?  Are you pretty confident   you could do that?  At the end of the day, that’s really the key question   Actually, there are two questions  One, do you think interest on excess reserves would be   sufficient? I do, but I think other people would have some questions about that  So then the second   question is, to guard against the potential risk of that not being sufficient, what are the “suspenders”?   Then the issue is Are you highly confident that you could get the “suspenders” up in operation   eventually?  I don’t think year-end is necessarily that relevant, but if you told me that you couldn’t get it   up by midyear 2010, I would start to be nervous   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t know if we should   talk about the agency MBS purchase program today or tomorrow, but it is 415, so today seems   like a good time  I think your comments on the exit were very appropriate in the sense that if we   really think that the exit is manageable, then you really have to take that concern off the table in        September 22–23, 2009 51 of 212  terms of thinking about the agency MBS purchase program  So the discussion is then based on   how do you want financial conditions to evolve over the next, say, 6 to 12 months?   My view is that the end of the agency MBS purchase program is going to tighten   financial conditions over that time frame, in any case  We can argue about how much it’s going   to tighten, but it’s going to move in that direction  So the question is Given that we’re already   on a path that financial conditions are going to tighten, why would you want to pare back this   program?  That would just exacerbate the tightening in financial conditions at a time that policy   is not as accommodative as we would like  If you look at the Bluebook, the unconstrained   federal funds rate path is minus 4 percent  So I really don’t see the logic for why we’d want to   back away from this program, if we stipulate that we aren’t worried about the exit problem   If you are worried about the exit problem, then I can understand why you could care   about whether the balance sheet was $100 billion bigger or smaller  My view is that not only   should we do the entire $1¼ trillion, I think we should commit to doing that $1¼ trillion at this   meeting for three reasons   I’m happy to defer until tomorrow, if you’d like   Okay Fair enough                     September 22–23, 2009 52 of 212  Thank you  I was remiss yesterday in not introducing   Angela O’Connor, sitting next to Brian Sack, from the Markets group  So I apologize, Angela    Welcome   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy is clearly   doing better  All indications are that we will have a pretty strong bounce in activity during the   second half of the year—3+ percent annualized real GDP growth seems likely, and the risks over   the near term are probably to the upside, I think, of the Greenbook forecast, because inventory   cycles can be very powerful   That said, I still think it is very premature to declare victory for several reasons  First, a   good portion of the growth will come from the swing in the pace of inventory accumulation   rather than strength in final demand  Second, the banking system is still impaired  Bank credit   outstanding has been declining Small businesses and commercial real estate sectors are   particularly starved for credit, and that is likely to continue for some time  Third, payrolls are   still falling, and the unemployment rate is still rising  Fourth, we don’t know how households   will respond to the sharp drop in net worth at a time that household debt burdens remain high  I   can imagine a combination of higher household saving and increased labor market participation   as baby boomers postpone retirement  The first would damp demand; the second would raise the   amount of slack in the labor market  Fifth, we are already in the process of removing   accommodation—the purchase programs are going to move to the slower pace, the liquidity   programs are being gradually unwound, and other government support to the financial sector,   such as the money market fund guarantees and the TLGP, are being withdrawn   At a time when the unemployment rate is very high and is still rising, and when there is   ample slack in the economy, I think we want to be cautious in moving too quickly to take back   additional accommodation What we want is a robust recovery that pushes the unemployment   rate down quickly—that’s what we are going for That doesn’t seem to be in the cards  Nothing              September 22–23, 2009 108 of 212  that I’ve heard around the table suggests that that’s the expectation of the members of the   Committee   Until we actually see that robust recovery, I think we’re getting well ahead of ourselves   in talking about removing additional accommodation  Although some are worried about the   longer-term inflation outlook, over the next year or two, to me, the risks seem very much on the   downside Core services inflation has come down a lot; core goods inflation seems likely to   follow, given the large amount of excess capacity available in the US and abroad; we’re already   below a rate of core inflation consistent with our longer-term forecast for the core PCE deflator;   and core inflation typically falls during the early stages of recovery  In fact, if the recovery were   to turn out to be more robust than expected, I would expect that would lead to a further surprise   on the productivity front and potentially even more downward pressure on inflation over the next   year or two Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, a two-hander   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think that I have some   sympathy with taking out the “first quarter/second quarter,” but we have to recognize that the   Desk has to have instructions on what it actually has to do, so there’s an issue of what their   baseline is in terms of their action  If we take out the language about “first quarter/second           September 22–23, 2009 159 of 212  quarter,” there still needs to be an understanding in terms of what is communicated to the Desk,   so that at least they know the starting point of the taper trajectory   Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I just want to talk to   some points that President Plosser raised about inflation expectations  I completely agree that   inflation expectations matter I think we have to be careful, though, that our concern about   inflation expectations does not imply to others that we’ll be forced to take back accommodation   sooner On the inflation expectations front, we can actually make considerable progress by   explaining to people clearly why we can exit I thought it was interesting that everyone here has   stipulated that we can exit, but I don’t think that the market believes that everybody on this   Committee believes that we can exit  I think it would be helpful to the markets if we did explain        September 22–23, 2009 172 of 212  that, and that would help keep inflation expectations more anchored  I also think that we could   help keep inflation expectations better anchored by explaining that we think inflation will be   subdued given the large output gap We can actually accomplish both goals—explain our policy   a little better and work at keeping inflation expectations anchored  So I think communication is   something that we need to continue to work on  We’ve made quite a bit of progress this   summer—your speech and testimony, Mr Chairman, on the exit strategy helped  But I think the   more people who are confident that we can manage our exit, the more helpful it will be on the   inflation expectations front   Yesterday I was hoping to talk about large-scale asset purchases  [Laughter] Now as   next to the last speaker, I think I’m going to be very repetitive, but I do think it’s important to   commit to do the entire $1¼ trillion, and a lot of people already touched on the reasons    Governor Kohn talked about the fact that the trajectory of the unemployment rate is still   unsatisfactory, and I completely agree It’s less unsatisfactory than it was before, but it’s still   very unsatisfactory, so taking back any sort of accommodation that is discretionary to us at this   meeting seems inappropriate  In terms of the specific reasons that I was going to give yesterday,   the first is that this is what’s expected  If we don’t do what the market expects in this case, it   would lead to an inadvertent tightening of financial conditions, and not just directly in terms of   the effects on agency MBS yields because of the potential lack of additional purchases, but also   because it would be a new signal that we’re closer to exit in a broader sense  Remember, if you   compare where the market is in terms of the timing of raising the federal funds rate and where   the Greenbook is, there’s a pretty big gap So, for the market to be surprised, we’re going to   have to move faster than the market expects  It seems to be a pretty strong presumption that   we’re probably going to go slower than the market expects           September 22–23, 2009 173 of 212  Second, we are pretty far along in this program, so this idea of not completing it gets   difficult if you also want to do tapering that lasts through the end of the first quarter  By the end   of this week we will have purchased, what, $895 billion roughly?  That leaves $355 billion, with   twenty-seven weeks until the end of the first quarter  That means we’ve been purchasing at   $25 billion a week, roughly, up to now  If we decided to do the whole amount, we’re still cutting   the rate of purchases roughly in half over the next six months  If you imagine that we cut the   purchases to $20 billion a week between now and the next meeting, we’d only have about   $235 billion left at the next meeting, and then we’d have to say  Well, do we really want to have   the taper be so dramatic that we cannot actually do the whole program?  I just think that we have   to recognize that we’re so far along in this program that it’s extraordinarily likely that we’re   going to want to complete it  In that case, I don’t really see the benefit of retaining this very   small degree of optionality relative to the high probability that we’re actually going to go   through with this program   Last, this is a new point, surprisingly, although Brian did raise it in his comments   yesterday When we did implement the tapering language for the Treasury purchase program,,   we also committed to do the entire $300 billion at the same time  So there is a risk, and I don’t   know how big a risk it is—probably a slight risk—that if we don’t take the “up to” language out,   the market may note the difference  We committed to the entire amount when we did tapering   with the Treasury purchase program, and in this case, we’d be committed to tapering but we’d   keep the “up to” language in I think that will create unnecessary ambiguity that will create some   risk So obviously I’m in favor of taking the “up to” language out  In terms of the other   language, I have some sympathy with this idea of being a little bit more vague, but my problem   with that is, how does the Desk then know what to do  I think there’s a bit of a tension there  I        September 22–23, 2009 174 of 212  don’t think there’s that big a problem bringing back the purchase programs  If the economy   behaves in a really bad way, I think the market would probably expect it  I think if we say “by   the end of the first quarter” that doesn’t really rule out bringing it back if things go adversely   On the question of “wide range,” I agree with Governor Kohn  I think “all available   tools” is the broadest phrase “Wide” is less broad  “Range” is less broad than that  I think it   makes sense for us to err on that intermediate step, and maybe we can go to “a range of tools”   two or three meetings from now    You raised it I mean, is that how you thought of it?   Because it’s settlement issues  "
8848,2009-11-03," That is what I was going to say     I think our feeling at the time, President Lacker, was that   it was due to the fact that there was a structural dollar shortage in Europe  So there was a strong   time-of-day effect  It wasn’t just a counterparty-risk issue   Part of the problem is that we never have had knowledge   of how much reserves we actually did need to add during the day because we don’t have a real                        November 3–4, 2009 28 of 201  sense of whether the banking system has the appropriate amount of reserves So you could   respond multiple times during the day but end up adding way too many reserves or adding—   There was also an operational issue—late in the day, the   market gets much thinner  So there is also a timing issue in that, the later you go in the day, the   less—you know, the money market business is a morning business  But, yes, you could have   conceivably tried to do more    I think our feeling at the time was that we were not   confident that multiple interventions during the day would have actually helped us hit the target   better    I had more than a two-hander                                       November 3–4, 2009 38 of 201   Thank you  On the counterparty issue, I guess the question   I have would be, Will there really be much interest by smaller counterparties given that giving funds   to us is not really different from giving funds to the US Treasury in the T-bill market  It’s not as   though we have a very special thing here that’s going to be particularly attractive to small investors    So it seems to me that we want to find out how much interest there is before we design a very   complicated mechanism that might or might not be of interest to them  And I would reinforce the   Chairman’s view that there’s no reason, if there is an interest, that you couldn’t go to the large ones   first and then broaden it out over time  I think it’s very clear that you want to be able to have the   capacity to go large—to President Lockhart’s point earlier—and if you can’t do a lot of money, then   this is really a bit of an illusion in terms of its effectiveness   Let me just go through the other ones very quickly  RCAs on hold, I agree with that  I think   cash operations, real-value operations, make sense  We just have to be very clear that it’s just a test    As far as Mexico is concerned, I share a lot of Governor Kohn’s concerns about going from   generalized market problems to country-specific problems  One way to get around that might be to   require that Mexico continue to be rated investment-grade  I think they’re triple-B plus  So if they   were to drop below that, then you could argue that you’re really morphing from something that’s               November 3–4, 2009 39 of 201  more into a country-risk issue  Obviously the issue I think you are raising, Governor Kohn, is the   issue of our getting involved in true credit risk with a sovereign entity, and that’s something that I   think we should be very uncomfortable about if we really think that is above a meaningful   threshold  Other than that, I think the four counterparties—the ECB, the SNB, the Bank of Japan,   and the Bank of England—make perfect sense to keep in practice, and I think the counterparty-risk   issues there are pretty negligible   I just had one very quick interjection  One of the values   of the whole foreign exchange swap program during the crisis was not the swaps per se or the   dollars that were extended but was the international policy coordination signal that was sent  It   is really hard to quantify the value of that, but I think it was actually very helpful to perceptions   that central banks around the world recognize that this is a global crisis and responded   collectively  I think that actually was helpful     November 3–4, 2009 43 of 201  Yes  What was interesting as we went through the crisis   was that, for the foreign central banks, there was clearly a very high threshold against using their   own dollar reserves, liquidating their Treasury securities or whatever, to fund their domestic   banks We know that because they didn’t do it, and they told us that they didn’t want to do it   because they thought it would be very confusing to the market in terms of what they were up to    Was this some sort of foreign exchange intervention?  Or was it a sign of distress particular to   their country?  We also know that there was a pretty high threshold because we actually charged   them quite a bit for the foreign exchange swap lines relative to the fact that they are basically   virtually a risk-free rate, yet they chose that rather than to liquidate their dollar reserves  So I   think you have to recognize that there is something special about the dollar reserves holdings that   they have that they don’t want to mess with  There was a cost for them to engage in dollar   reserves sales that seemed to be fairly significant as we went through the crisis   May I ask a question?    You said much more than 1 basis point  Can you give   me a rough order of magnitude?    Okay Thanks         November 3–4, 2009 88 of 201  Thank you  The economy appears to be evolving very   close to what we expected Real GDP is expanding at a moderate rate, but some of the   supportive elements, such as the swing in the inventory cycle and special programs like “cash­  for-clunkers” and the first-time homebuyer tax credit, are temporary and thus may exaggerate the   underlying strength of the economy  At the same time, potential retardants, such as the decline   in household net worth, the high level of household indebtedness, and the constraints on credit   availability, do not appear to have subsided since the last meeting  Financial conditions, broadly   defined, have not changed significantly either  Generally, I would think as the economy   improves that we would actually expect to see an easing of financial conditions  So the fact that   that hasn’t happened over the intermeeting period is slightly disturbing   The inflation outlook has not changed materially either  The core PCE deflator has risen   only 13 percent over the past year, down more than a percentage point from a year ago    Moreover, cost pressures are very subdued, with the employment cost index for civilian workers   rising only 1½ percent over the past four quarters  And the high unemployment rate implies to   me that these wage pressures are likely to be muted for a long time  Modest growth in   compensation per hour, combined with the spike in productivity growth, means that unit labor   costs are falling quite rapidly Thus, I think we are where we were at the last FOMC meeting—   many quarters away from any need to tighten monetary policy            November 3–4, 2009 99 of 201  That said, we should recognize that we are already tightening on at least two dimensions    First, a number of government support programs are ending, and we are tightening the terms of   our liquidity programs  Second, the Treasury purchase program has been completed, and the   agency debt and agency MBS purchases are on track to taper off by the end of the first quarter    That underscores the need for caution at this moment   With respect to the agency MBS purchase program, I am where Brian Sack is on this  I   expect that the option-adjusted spread will widen somewhat going forward  It is difficult to sort   out the timing of this widening because it depends on the relative weight one assigns to stock   versus flow effects But I suspect that traders will view the current spread level as unsustainable,   causing them to go short agency MBS or short to spread, which would be long Treasuries and   short agency MBS, on an anticipation of a backup in the yield or spread with the end of the   program  I am not sure when this process will start, but I would not be surprised at all if we did   not see some widening in the spread by our January meeting  Of course, if that happens, that is   likely to lead to somewhat higher mortgage rates, and that will inhibit the nation’s housing   recovery   A few comments on President Bullard’s note on output gaps  First, I think it is great that   he is writing memos like that and circulating them to the rest of the Committee  I think it is   really important to understand where we agree and where we differ, and I think these memos   help to sharpen that point That said, I do find it unconvincing that the output gap, after the   1981-82 recession, could be less than 1 percentage point, as shown in figure 4 of his memo    Theoretical models maybe can generate that result, but that makes me doubt the theoretical   models, not take that figure in hand  It would imply that the NAIRU moved virtually hand in   hand with the rise in the actual unemployment rate, and I think that is quite unlikely        November 3–4, 2009 100 of 201  Second, I continue to be disturbed, in President Bullard’s framework, about, What is the   true underlying model?  What drives short- and medium-term inflation expectations?  When you   commented yesterday, you said it’s the Fed’s credibility, but then what drives the Fed’s   credibility?  And how do we close the model?  I certainly agree that inflation expectations are   very important  I think we all agree on that But if those expectations depend in part on current   and expected future output gaps, then you can’t completely ignore the output gap   Third, in the memo President Bullard suggested that the housing bubble could be   interpreted as “a large upward deviation from the normal or potential level of output”  The idea   is that real GDP overshoots potential during the boom by roughly the amount of the   unsustainable output in housing  I don’t really understand that  If housing was a bubble and we   produced too much housing, this does not mean that potential output was much lower  We could   have produced things other than housing We presumably had the capacity to move around   resources, labor and capital, to do so So the housing bubble, to my mind, did not materially   change potential output, only the composition of actual output  That is how I would look at it   Fourth, the behavior of core inflation measures following recessions is pretty compelling    In the United States, on average, the core inflation rate has fallen about 2 percentage points   during the first 18 months of an economic expansion  If we take the worst-case cycle from our   perspective of inflation, core inflation rose about ½ percentage point  So there is a lot of   variance cycle to cycle, but overall the evidence is pretty compelling that core inflation tends to   fall during the early phases of economic expansions   In general, I think the empirical evidence for output gaps and inflation is less than   decisive for some very obvious reasons  One, we don’t have many business cycles to study    Yes, there are many years of data, but not many business cycles  Second, we measure inflation              November 3–4, 2009 101 of 201  and output gaps poorly And, third, there is oftentimes not much variability in our measures of   core inflation and output gaps That is certainly true of the last couple of cycles  Thus, it is not   surprising to me that it is hard to find a robust empirical relationship  But that is different from   saying that there isn’t a relationship  I am pretty confident now that inflation is low and the   output gap is high Thus, I expect the historical experience to hold; during early recovery   periods, core inflation is more likely to fall than to rise  Is that absolutely certain?  Of course   not We just don’t have enough data to be absolutely confident  And other factors that influence   inflation expectations could derail such an outcome, but we have to go with what we know now    If it turns out that this cycle starts to evolve very differently, then we will have to adjust in a   timely manner   My perspective is simple  The unemployment rate is very high; core inflation is low    Given our dual mandate and the stability of long-term inflation expectations, this implies that our   focus should be on getting the unemployment rate down and that this is likely to be our focus for   an extended period Thank you, Mr Chairman    Likely   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B I   think that people have raised important points, that the changes in the language will be noted,   and that people will be trying to parse out what those changes in the language mean  There is   some risk associated with that, especially given the fact that the public knows pretty clearly that   we are also contemplating the broader question of the possible sequence of our statement   language over time  That said, I think the changes themselves are pretty innocuous, and my view   would be that there is a little risk there  I think I know which direction the market will move in   response to them, but my judgment would be that they are small rather than they are large  The   first change just clarifies what the conditioning factors are in terms of our view of exceptionally   low for an extended period, and the second change is really just explaining what we are actually           November 3–4, 2009 167 of 201  planning to do on agency debt I don’t think we really have an alternative to that, because if we   kept in the “up to $200 billion,” what would we do at the next meeting?  What would we do at   the meeting after that?  At some point we would be saying right before the program ends that we   are doing up to $200 billion, but we’re not We are doing $175 billion  So I think that one we   just have to do to clarify the direction   In terms of the discussions of asset sales, I think the issue of sequence—in what order   you do things—as we exit is hugely important  I am not pre-committed to any ordering  I   certainly want to hear all of the arguments, but I don’t agree at all that asset sales would be   gentle to the market at this time  I think asset sales to the market at this time would be   completely ungentle, especially given the primary dealer survey results, which showed fewer   than 50 percent thought that we would ever do asset sales  I think it is an open-ended question,   isn’t it, Brian?  So to go from something that we would never do to something that we would do   first, I think we have to do a lot of explaining and conditioning for the market to understand that   it was not a big deal So if we decide to go down that path, we’ve got a lot of work to do with   the market participants before we do it   I just want to talk a bit about the possible sequence of actions going forward  One thing   we don’t ever really have detailed discussions about is what the language means, and I think you   have to understand what the language means before you decide when you need to change the   language I have asked a bunch of people about what these words mean, just to get a sense of   what the common understanding is And there isn’t one  But I am going to throw out as a   strawman my view of what the words mean, because that will then condition when you might   want to actually change these words        November 3–4, 2009 168 of 201  My view is that “extended” means that no tightening is likely for more than six months,   so the time frame is pretty far out  So in making the consideration today whether I want to   include the “extended” language, I have to think about whether it is likely that I am going to   want to tighten monetary policy in the next six months  And given my forecast, I don’t see that   as likely I am with Governor Kohn  I don’t see us tightening in 2010  I think we are going to   talk a lot about it, but I don’t think we are going to do it for a very long time  The “for some   time” language, rather than the “extended period,” implies to me no tightening for three months   or more  We are not going to tighten at the next meeting  It is possible that we could tighten the   meeting after that, but that is sort of the frontier  And the “before long” language seems to me to   be signaling that we are likely to tighten at the next meeting, in fact   Now, what gets confusing is when we use two things together, as in alternative C in   Brian’s handout We removed the word “exceptional” and changed it to “low levels of the funds   rate,” and we also changed the timing from “extended period” to “for some time”  I think that is   going to be totally confusing to the market  I think the market would actually take that as that we   are tightening at the next meeting  We are moving from exceptionally low to low immediately,   and then we are going to stay at low for a meeting or two  So I think we have to be very careful   when we change the language that we change one element, not two simultaneously  Then, I   think we will get ourselves in a lot of trouble  Thank you, Mr Chairman   If there is starting to be a reaction to this, there may be   some value to having a background conversation to make it clear that this is not a change  I   wouldn’t do it beforehand because we don’t know that we have a problem  But if the market   does take it the wrong way, which I think is a low probability, you might want to have a   background conversation   That is probably not sufficient  [Laughter]   There is a bit of risk, but there is always going to be risk   when we change language The problem with that, of course, is that we lock ourselves into the   statement more and more, which then makes it even a bigger risk when we change language  So   it’s a very bad dynamic   That is more an output gap idea, I think      Groundswell  "
8875,2009-12-15," I wanted to introduce Steve Friedman from the Markets   Group in New York Steve runs the forex area  So he’s partners in crime with Mr Sheets on   swaps and other things Welcome, Steve   As one of those people who used to receive those   surveys, I know that they usually go to the economists who sit on the desk  If they’re uncertain   about how to answer the question, they’ll talk to the traders  So I think there’s probably a little   gap between the economists’ views and the traders’ views, but generally the traders are   consulted   I just want to add that the issue on redemptions, though,   is also colored by what you want the portfolio to look like in the longer run  Let’s say we start   with a portfolio that was bills, notes, and bonds, and was roughly in proportion to the market; but   it’s not clear that that’s necessarily the portfolio that we want in the new world as we transition   to a new monetary policy setting  That decision on redemptions is partly about balance sheet   size, and it’s also partly about where we want to take the portfolio over the medium to longer   run    Can I make an interjection?   Two things  One, Mr Hatzius, who is the chief US   economist at Goldman Sachs right now, did win the Blue Chip Forecasting award for accuracy   this year [Laughter]    And, two, I think I contributed something to his training    [Laughter] So it’s not surprising that our views are not that far apart   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic outlook has   clearly improved since the previous meeting, and we all seem to agree on that  On the real   activity side, here’s what strikes me as most meaningful  First is a more solid foundation for   consumer spending, as David Wilcox pointed out—a higher underlying compensation trend, as   well as slower job losses and rising hours worked last month  Second is consumer spending   gains—core retail sales in November were quite solid, for example, and real consumer spending   looks likely to grow at a moderate rate this quarter  Third, as Nathan pointed out, is trade   improvement fueled by export growth, not just export growth on its own, but also supported by   pretty strong economic expansion outside the US  And, fourth is something that hasn’t been   mentioned yet—it looks as if some of the TARP monies are going to be used to fund a modest   jobs program, so the trajectory of fiscal stimulus may not be as steeply downward as we go   through 2010 as we anticipated earlier   But I don’t want to put too much weight on any of this  First, I think much of this   improvement was anticipated  I think it’s more that we’re moving along the path that we   expected, rather than we are moving to a distinctly better path  Second, there are significant   constraints in terms of credit availability, and I don’t see any sign that those have changed very     December 15–16, 2009 77 of 247  much since the last meeting  Third, we still have a tremendous amount of political uncertainty   about health care reform, financial reform, and tax policy  In talking to our directors, they make   it very clear that this is a factor influencing their hiring behavior  Although job losses have   slowed, this seems to be almost exclusively due to much slower layoffs than due to a pickup in   hiring   So for the New York Fed, Richard, the bottom line is more confidence about the   sustainability of the recovery, but still an expectation that the economy will slow a bit from the   current pace in 2010 That said, I think the risks to our forecast are shifting towards the upside   from the downside   We should also recognize that we face a very disappointing path for unemployment going   forward So even if the economy is on a somewhat stronger growth path, that would be very   welcome right now, and I would argue we should not offset that with changes in our policy   On the inflation side, I think the outlook has not changed much  We have TIPS five-year,   five-year forward inflation measures—it may in fact be slightly higher than that, but it’s hard to   know because the inflation risk premiums are hard to extract  And some other indicators   certainly show less anxiety about the inflation outlook  For example, the fears about commodity   prices and the dollar seem to have calmed down quite a bit since the last meeting  Interestingly,   the mid-month University of Michigan reading had an almost bizarre drop in the median one-  year and five-year inflation forecast—maybe it was just a fluke, but it was interesting   nevertheless   Given the large amount of federal borrowing and the imminent wind-up of our large-  scale asset-purchase program, I am, frankly, quite surprised that long-term rates have not   climbed more sharply  And I take that as another sign that investors are either not that worried        December 15–16, 2009 78 of 247  about the long-term fiscal outlook or particularly worried about the risk of higher inflation    Thank you   We’d like to have an input   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m very happy to see that   we’re going to have the discussion on sequencing in January  I think it’s going to be very, very   important to see if we can reach a consensus view on strategy and tactics  The market is   definitely wondering what those strategy and tactics are going to be  Until then, I think it would   be useful not to debate this too much in the press, because I think that just creates confusion  I   notice that in the primary dealer survey, the communications score we got this time came down a   bit, and I think some of our discussion about asset sales versus no asset sales might have   contributed to confusion on that front   I’m not going to say where I stand right now on how to do the sequencing, but I do want   people to start thinking about two broad issues  One is the timing of asset sales, and on that, I   think there are two major views  one, starting with draining reserves and raising the short-term   rate with asset sales held in abeyance, maybe used, maybe not; and, two, conducting asset sales   first, and then moving on to raising short-term interest rates later  I think that’s a really   important thing that we’re going to have to sort out  The second broad issue is the sequencing of           December 15–16, 2009 134 of 247  reserve-draining operations versus the increase in the IOER rate  The market thinks that we’re   going to drain a lot of reserves first and then raise the IOER rate, but we may decide to do the   reverse So I think we need to have a thorough discussion about that issue   In terms of the statement, I favor alternative B  I’m with pretty much everyone else    We’re withdrawing quite a bit of accommodation, frankly, as we taper off the asset-purchase   programs and phase out most of the liquidity facilities over the next few months  We don’t   really know how important liquidity facilities are in terms of their backstop function, so until we   actually take them away, we’re not really going to know exactly how much accommodation is   being withdrawn   I think the “extended period” language still works  I thought it was interesting that the   primary dealer poll suggested that, if you keep it in, then it’s going to be at least three more   meetings before the Fed might tighten  Obviously, it’s actually four, because you would take it   out potentially at the next meeting, and then there would be three more meetings after that  So   that fits pretty well with the informal poll that I talked about at the last meeting, where “extended   period,” in my view, was at least six months  So I’m glad to see that the dealers are on the same   page on that as I am   As far as President Kocherlakota’s suggestion on holdings, I’m uncomfortable with that    Here’s the reason why I understand what you’re driving at, that there is this question of   redemptions  But “holdings” suggests a two-sidedness that “purchases” does not  I think if you   put “holdings” in there, you’re inadvertently going to raise the question of whether asset sales are   now on the table in a much more assumed way than what we might want to imply there  So I   think that’s the problem with it  I understand the motivation, but “purchases” is one-sided,   “holdings” is not        December 15–16, 2009 135 of 247  Finally, on the new issue of CMBS, I know that’s a decision for the Board  I think that in   the relatively near future the Board does need to clarify with the market, though, whether that’s   going to be extended or not extended  There’s a pretty long runway for people to develop that   and bring it to market, so I would say by late January or early February it would be useful to   clarify whether that’s going to go away or whether that is going to be extended beyond June 30    Thank you  "
8903,2010-01-26,"  We are rethinking that now  [Laughter]    I just have a question for Jim on the table at the bottom   of page 3 and the similar table that Brian had—so it’s a good question for both of you  This is   the belief system of the survey respondents, and there’s empirical evidence of a relationship   between the spread and the amount of reserves, but there is really no empirical basis that the   spread increases as the IOER rate goes up  So is there any theoretical basis for thinking that the   spread should increase as the IOER rate goes up?  The reason I am asking is that it is one thing to   have people believe something, but if there is basis for the belief, I would put more weight on it   than if there is not basis for the belief  So do we have a story that explains why the spread might   widen as the IOER rate goes up since we have no empirical basis?    Okay    I agree with that, but why does that arbitrage become   less effective as the IOER rate climbs?    That was in the middle of chaos    So does this staff believe this?    It depends on where the money is coming from    Yes  It depends in part where the money comes from    Imagine a bank that every day has excess reserves, and then you have a term deposit facility, and   it just moves some of those excess reserves that it has every day into the term deposit facility    Well, that is not going to really affect anything else  It’s really if the money is getting pulled   from other sources  If that bank were selling bills to fund the term deposit facility, it would be   something different  So I think it really depends on where the money comes from  I think the   argument is that, at the very beginning of this process, the money is probably moving from an   overnight bank reserve to the term deposit facility and nothing else really is going on, so the   pressure is de minimis  But as you go further, then you are starting to rearrange    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just, first, on the discount   rate and the TAF, I’m completely on board  I just want to present one issue  What you do with   the “extended period” language immediately following what you do with the discount rate is   really significant  If you changed it in February and then removed the “extended period” in   March, it would be a very different signal to the market than if you kept the “extended period”   language in place  If we think we are going to keep the “extended period” language in place in   March, then I think you are going to be able to communicate pretty clearly  But if you take it   January 26–27, 2010 89 of 260    away, then people are going to start to connect the dots even if you didn’t intend it that way  So   I think doing it in February is better than doing it in March, just to get it out of the way and tie it   up with all of the other things that we are doing on the liquidity side   In terms of the broader set of issues, it is really interesting to hear everybody  There are   probably 17 different views  I start with, what is our goal here?  Our goal is to communicate   clearly  And why do we want to communicate clearly?  We want to communicate clearly   because we want to keep the risk premium from widening  We want to keep volatility from   increasing  And we want to keep inflation expectations low  The tension is that it is hard to   communicate clearly when you don’t know how all of these things are actually going to work in   practice  So there is a tension between laying out as much as we can, subject to precluding us   learning as we go  And so I think this is going to be very, very challenging in terms of the   communication fronts  I think the markets do need guidance, but we are going to have to be very   careful in crafting our guidance so that we don’t unnecessarily limit our ability to learn as we go,   because we are going to know a lot more 6 months or 12 months from now than we know today   In terms of what to do, my view up until maybe a week ago was that we could exit   smoothly by using just the IOER tool  So my preference until a week ago was to use the IOER   first and drain reserves only if the relationship between the IOER and the funds rate turned out to   be very sloppy  Why drain the reserves if you don’t really need to do so?  We could reduce the   risk of that sloppiness by doing things like reserve collateral accounts or reverse repo agreements   with the GSEs  So that was where I was  I am no longer there, and so let me explain why I have   changed   It still makes sense to take those moves to tighten up the relation between IOER rate and   the federal funds rate, so I think it still makes sense to explore doing the reserve collateral   January 26–27, 2010 90 of 260    accounts  But I have changed my view because there are two other things going on  One,   inflation expectations have gradually drifted up, and we tend to keep dismissing that  But there   does seem to be some updrift, and it does seem to be tied to some residual anxiety about our exit    You can see that in terms of the skew in swaption prices; there is a small probability placed on a   very large increase in inflation by some proportion of the populous  That makes me feel that our   credibility here is really, really important  The second thing is that the market participants, when   you take this survey, have a very strong view about how we are going to sequence it  It was not   as broad a range of views as in this room  The market view is that we are going to drain a bunch   of reserves, then we are going to raise the IOER rate, and later we are going to do some asset   sales   So if we are really pretty close to indifferent between these two strategies, it seems to me   that communication is going to be a lot easier doing it the way that the market expects rather than   doing something very different  Then we have to re-educate the market about why their view is   wrong and our view is right  So I think that where the market is today is not immaterial in terms   of how it’s going to affect our ability to communicate  In terms of the fact that market   participants are worried about inflation, I don’t share those anxieties at all  But my view is, even   if I don’t share them, we have to consider them in terms of how we exit  There’s no reason to   take a risk unnecessarily that inflation expectations become unanchored  So if draining the   reserves first demonstrates the efficacy of the tools and that makes people more assured that we   can exit smoothly, then I think that’s a pretty strong argument for doing it in that order   Regarding asset sales, I do not believe we should use them prior to draining reserves or   raising the IOER rate  I think they are a blunt tool  We have a lot of experience in terms of how   the IOER rate affects financial conditions  We have basically no experience in terms of how   January 26–27, 2010 91 of 260    asset sales affect financial conditions  So in terms of risk, I think that I would put asset sales   later  I wouldn’t rule them out as we go down the road, but I would definitely do the   sequencing— reserve drains, IOER rate, and then maybe asset sales later, depending on where   we are going   Regarding the longer-term issue of our framework, I heard around the room that it was   either a floor or a corridor system from most of the people who talked about it  It seems to me   that we don’t have to make the decision between those two things quite yet  We are going to   learn as we go through this process  I guess I feel that it is premature to decide what we want   before we have a chance to actually learn it because we are going to learn a lot over the next few   months  That is about it  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy appears to be   evolving along a trajectory very close to what we had anticipated several months ago  The end   of the deep inventory liquidation cycle has led to a strong bounce in economic activity in the last   quarter, but final demand growth remained weak  Because the boost from the swing in   inventories will prove temporary, real GDP growth is likely to slow sharply during the first half   of 2010  Consumption growth is likely to remain subdued as real disposable income rises only   slowly and households respond to high debt burdens and lower net ratios of worth to income by   continuing to save a higher proportion of their incomes  I’m not sure what will happen to the   household saving rate, but flat to higher seems much more likely than a decline from current   levels  As a result, the type of dynamic in which recoveries get strong support from housing and   consumption appears likely to be mostly absent in 2010  For 2010, we anticipate a growth   trajectory somewhat weaker than the consensus  But relative to the degree of uncertainty about   many aspects of the outlook, I would argue that the differences in the real GDP forecasts around   the table are actually pretty trivial, reflecting relatively minor differences in views about how   factors such as credit availability, the desired saving rate, and the timing and speed of recovery in   housing will influence the level of real activity over the next year   For myself, I’m particularly uncertain about how increases in labor demand will feed   through to the unemployment rate  I notice that the central tendency projections show a very   January 26–27, 2010 146 of 260    narrow range, but I think the outlook there is highly uncertain  Hours worked and the   participation rate have both fallen sharply, suggesting that, even if labor demand picks up, this   may not translate into a meaningful decline in the unemployment rate anytime soon  I’m also   very uncertain about what productivity growth is going to do this year  Last year’s spurt was a   surprise  It’s probably going to prove temporary, but I’m uncertain about whether we are going   to go from above trend to below trend this year or we’ll settle down close to the longer-term   trend  And I don’t know what the longer-term trend is either anymore  So, as a consequence of   all of this, even if I knew what GDP growth would be this year with certainty, I’m very uncertain   about how it actually maps back into the unemployment rates   There are four issues that are troubling me to various degrees  I’m going to mention   them—the order has no significance  First, I wonder what to make about the gradual updrift in   inflation expectations embodied in five-year, five-year-forward break-even TIPS measures,   which I talked about a bit yesterday  My instinct is not to worry for now, but at what point are   the increases big enough that they have to become a significant policy concern?  As I said, I’m   not that worried yet because the rise is not borne out by most survey measures of inflation   expectations  And the fact that the 10-year, 10-year-forward measures are below the 5-year, 5-  year-forward measures suggests that the measures may be somewhat tainted by technical factors   In that vein, as Brian Sack mentioned yesterday, the rise may be partially explained away   by the relative paucity of the supply of TIPS relative to nominal Treasuries  Less relative supply   may be holding down TIPS yields, and this might lead to higher break-even inflation measures    At the same time, I would not dismiss these developments in their entirety  There is evidence   that market participants are still worried about our ability to exit smoothly, and this is suggested   by the skew that President Kocherlakota and Brian mentioned yesterday in terms of swaption   January 26–27, 2010 147 of 260    prices, in which investors are willing to pay more for protection against a rise in rates than   against a fall  If worries about exit are the explanation for the rise in five-year, five-year-forward   break-even inflation measures, then this argues not for a tighter monetary policy regime but   instead for measures to reduce this perceived risk—in other words (1) an early explication of   how we will exit in order to reduce uncertainty about our ability to do so and (2) a belt-and-  suspenders approach, not just relying on the interest on excess reserves tool but also   demonstrating our ability to drain a large amount of excess reserves prior to tightening monetary   policy    The second thing that I’m worried about is that I don’t think we know much about the   consequences of our exit from our various emergency liquidity facilities and large-scale asset-  purchase programs  We don’t know how important the absence of these backstops might be if   there were future shocks to a still-fragile financial system  We also don’t know what the end of   the large-scale asset-purchase program means for long-term rates and financial conditions more   generally  Now, this uncertainty will presumably resolve itself over time, but right now I think   this uncertainty implies patience with respect to our conduct of monetary policy   Third, I’m worried about the risk of a spike in risk premiums and a tightening of financial   conditions caused by worries about fiscal sustainability  In particular, the circumstances in the   EU strike me as likely to get worse before they get better  Greece wants to do less in terms of   fiscal consolidation  The EU wants them to do more  And that type of game of chicken can end   badly  Despite the fact that Greece had a successful five-year note sale earlier this week, their   situation could end quite suddenly  The ability of Greece to credibly pay higher interest rates is   limited by the size of their deficit and the fact that they have a very large debt-to-GDP ratio    More important, this isn’t just about Greece  The contagion could be significant  After all, there   January 26–27, 2010 148 of 260    are many countries, both in Europe and even closer to home, with large deficits that are   dependent on the kindness of strangers   Fourth, I’m worried that we have made little fundamental progress in rebalancing the   global economy  We need greater foreign exchange rate flexibility, and we need less dollar   reserve accumulation by foreign central banks  Over time we need to have a lower consumption   share of GDP, and the Chinese need to have a higher one, but I don’t see much progress in this   area  This leads to two concerns  (1) that the global recovery will be more muted, as there is not   a ready replacement for the US consumer to serve as the engine for global growth and (2) that   we are building up potentially big cliff effects as the imbalances, the high rate of reserve   accumulation, and the gap between current exchange rates and where longer-term sustainable   exchange rates are moving grow ever, ever larger  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  I think   it is very premature to foreshadow tightening  As Governor Kohn noted, growth is projected to   be much weaker than what we would actually like, and the unemployment rate is much higher   than we would like  Slack is abundant  Core inflation is low  So I think that alternative B still   seems very, very right     In terms of market expectations, I have no problem contradicting market expectations, if   that’s appropriate  But in an environment where the economy is evolving close to our   expectations, it would be sort of odd for us then to turn around and contradict market   expectations  That implies either that we are capricious or that our communications strategy up   to now has been very, very poor, putting the markets in the wrong place  I don’t think the   markets are in the wrong place, so I’m not really sure why, given that things are evolving very   close to what we expect, we would want to contradict those expectations at this time   In terms of language, I would not insert the word “holdings” for “purchases”  I think it   would be confusing at a time that we are still purchasing assets, and it could be taken as   signaling that asset sales might be undertaken soon as part of the exit strategy—in other words,   first  And I don’t think the Committee has clearly come to a conclusion on that point   January 26–27, 2010 199 of 260    In terms of paragraph 2, I don’t feel strongly about it, but I find that “energy prices have   risen in recent months” does not really work, for me at least, because (1) I think it overstates the   importance of energy prices in shaping our views and (2) energy prices have come back down   quite a bit recently  So I think I would probably take that out   On the TAF, I think we should just say that we don’t expect to conduct any further   auctions beyond that date because that’s what we do expect, and why not just get it out?     Yes, I think that’s the point  I think you are factually   correct, but the question is, What impulse do we want to actually send to the market in terms of   market expectations relative to what we are actually likely to do?    I think there is one question  Roll them into what?    Right now, when they come due, you rebuy the thing that matures  If a   ten-year matures, you roll that into a new ten-year    Yes  There are also some operational issues  How do   you roll into bills?  There may not be a bill auction on the right day, and so there are some   complexities  "
8930,2010-03-16,"  Yes  I just wanted to introduce Joshua Frost—he’s   sitting between Brian Sack and Jamie McAndrews—from our Markets Group in New York   3 Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the consensus   view that the outlook has not changed much at all since the last meeting  I’d like to point out just   two things  Consumption is a bit stronger, but I think you also have to note that the   compensation trend was revised down, so the saving rate is also lower, and that may exert some   constraint on how fast consumption can continue to grow  On the capital spending side, I think   it’s true that we’re seeing some strength in technology spending, but I think, as others around the   table have noted, policy does seem to be inhibiting the bigger kinds of investments—for   example, whether to locate a plant in the United States or overseas?  So I’m not sure how big or   sustainable this bounce in technology spending is going to be                                                     3 The materials referred to by Mr Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   March 16, 2010 65 of 146    In terms of risks to the outlook, I want to talk about two things  I want to talk a little first   about this issue of disinflation  I handed out these two figures because I thought they were pretty   good at getting at this whole issue of what’s happening and how important shelter is in terms of   the disinflation that we’re seeing  Figure 1 basically looks at core CPI inflation with and without   shelter, and on both bases you’re seeing disinflation  Obviously, shelter is a big factor in terms   of pushing down the level of the core so much, but I think you can’t dismiss the low level of core   just on the basis of shelter; and that’s consistent with President Fisher’s and others’ remarks on   the trimmed mean  Figure 2 looks at what’s happening to all of the components of the core PCE   index prior to September 2008 and afterwards  Looking at this chart, you see a lot of data points   below the 45-degree line, and that implies that disinflation is broad  It’s interesting that the two   dots that are the furthest above the 45-degree line are used motor vehicles and new motor   vehicles; and the used motor vehicles, as Glenn pointed out to me when we were talking about it   during the break, was partly due to the “cash-for-clunkers” program and what’s happening in   terms of its effects on the supply of used cars  You’ll also notice on this figure that the housing   bubble, in red, does not really stand out relative to the other components  So I think this tends to   underscore the fact that the disinflation that we’re seeing is pretty pervasive   The second thing I want to talk about very briefly is the fiscal sustainability issue  I think   it’s a risk to the outlook  I have two concerns  The first concern is that when market participants   become worried about fiscal sustainability in the US, they may start to price in bigger risk   premiums, so long-term rates would go up  And, the second concern is that, if that were to   happen, it could actually provoke or necessitate earlier fiscal consolidation  Either or both of   those things would actually exert constraint on economic activity  I think this risk can’t be   completely ruled out, given what we saw happening in Europe  The Greece situation is clearly in   March 16, 2010 66 of 146    a better place than it was six weeks ago, but a lot of other countries in Europe are in similar   positions, and they have much more economic weight; and our own budgetary situation isn’t   very good either  So the risk of contagion, perhaps from Europe to the UK and then on to the   US, can’t be completely ruled out   Both these risks—disinflation and fiscal consolidation—obviously underscore in my   mind why it’s very premature to tighten monetary policy now  I’m very much on the side of   keeping stability right now in terms of the monetary policy course and the message that we’re   sending people  But we’ll talk a little bit more about that in the monetary policy round  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor strongly alternative   B  In my view, it’s not time to change the “extended period” language or, in fact, to do other   things, beyond what we’ve already done in terms of phasing out our liquidity facilities and   ending our LSAP programs, to indicate that we’re moving in any way closer to tightening   monetary policy  First, there’s no significant change in the growth outlook, and, on the inflation   March 16, 2010 117 of 146    side, there is more evidence of disinflation than there was earlier—inflation expectations have   declined a bit  Second, if we were to do anything to move in the tightening direction, I think that   would create credibility issues for us  We’ve said the discount rate change was not part of   tightening  If we then were to change the language or do other things that indicated tightening, it   would be contradicting what we had just said  Expectations are very much on the side of no   change in the language  That’s not a binding constraint, but if we contradict those expectations   that we are ourselves tried to foster, there will be a credibility consequence for us that I think we   would regret   Regarding the language of B, I’m not a fan of the last sentence in paragraph 2  I don’t   think it says much, but I think the more important problem is that I’m not sure how it parses with   the sentence that comes immediately before  Is price stability greater than, less than, or equal to   subdued inflation?  I’m just not sure how to fit those two sentences together in a meaningful   way   In terms of the C′ paragraph, I think the problem is that we haven’t agreed on the   sequence or strategy  So how can we import this thing in to the statement that we haven’t agreed   on yet?     Regarding the financial imbalances issue that President Hoenig raised, I think this would   be a good topic for a future FOMC meeting, so that we can discuss this whole issue of financial   imbalances, asset bubbles, monetary policy, supervision, and regulation  How should we think   about all of that?  One reason to do this is that I think the view is changing, and I’m not sure   where everybody on the Committee is, and it would be useful to reevaluate this  I think we   clearly found out in this cycle that the consequences of waiting for asset bubbles to burst and   cleaning up after the fact was very unfortunate—the tradeoffs were much graver than we   March 16, 2010 118 of 146    anticipated  So I think that would be a good topic for a future FOMC meeting  I know we don’t   have as many two-day meetings anymore, but I’d still like to put my two cents in for that  "
8953,2010-04-27,"  We have looked at it  The notional credit default swap   market for the government sector is very small relative to the outstanding supply of debt, unlike   the corporate sector, where the credit default swaps can be many magnitudes  That does not look   like a big, independent source of risk      Thank you, Mr Chairman  And thank you, staff, for   great work  Keep it up  I know you will  We’re certainly putting lots of demands on you, that’s   for sure   My preference is to provide guidance only broadly in terms of what the sequence of tools   is likely to be  It seems too soon to provide details  After all, I think that exit, in terms of trying   to tighten financial conditions, is not likely to happen soon, nor should it happen soon    Providing details now would be premature, as it would foreclose future options and might imply   to market participants that a nearer-term adjustment to policy was going to take place than what   we actually anticipate doing  I would favor outlining in the FOMC minutes, assuming that the   Committee can come to a reasonable consensus, a sequence that goes like this  The Committee   is going to change the “extended period” language at some point, then reserve draining will   begin in size, the interest on excess reserves rate will be raised, and only after that will asset sales   commence at a slow and deliberate rate   I view early asset sales as inappropriate for several reasons  It’s a blunt tool that we don’t   have much experience with  While the staff estimate is that modest asset sales would be worth   25 to 35 basis points, I thought the survey results were interesting in that even very modest asset   sales of $50 billion per year, according to the market participants, would cause a 20 basis point   backup in yield, and $150 billion a year would cause a 40 basis point backup  I think the reality   is that we don’t know how large the effects would be, we just know the direction  Also, I would   note that asset sales are not anticipated by market participants any time soon  Even for agency   April 27–28, 2010 57 of 206                   MBS sales, the probability of sales in the next two years is reported at only about 25 percent in   the survey  In addition, we can conduct monetary policy effectively with an enlarged balance   sheet, so I think the costs of delay on asset sales are quite low  We could do asset sales sooner,   but I don’t see the benefits outweighing the cost  I’m not particularly troubled by the fact that   we have a large balance sheet  We have the tools to manage monetary policy despite that  I’m   also not particularly troubled by holding the agency MBS for a while longer  I don’t want to   hold it for 20 years, but a little longer is okay  They are de facto government-guaranteed  The   only risk we have is with respect to duration and convexity  Those risks seemed acceptable to   me, relative to the risk of tightening financial market conditions prematurely  I’m troubled   mostly by how far away we are from our dual mandate, to echo President Rosengren   In terms of the Treasury redemption issue, I think there’s no pressing reason to do this   now  Depending on what the Treasury did in terms of their debt management, it would increase   duration that would likely be held by the market and thereby lead to some increase in long-term   rates  I don’t see why that’s desirable at the current time  Also, the decision about redeeming   Treasuries depends a little, I think, on our decisions about what we want our portfolio to look   like over the long term  So I’d ask the staff to help us think about what that portfolio should look   like, and then use that as something to inform our decision about Treasury redemptions going   forward  I’d also note that market participants generally put a low probability on our deciding to   redeem Treasuries, so, if we were to do it and announce it, it would lead to some backup in rates   right now  Thank you    Yes, I just wanted to expand a little bit  The German   situation is particularly problematic because they have these state elections  This whole idea of   April 27–28, 2010 75 of 206                   aid to Greece is very unpopular, yet the German government clearly wants to come forward with   the aid, and they haven’t explained yet to the German voters that this isn’t a one-year package   anymore, this is a three-year package, and it’s going to have to be a lot bigger to be viable  I   think what the Germans are hoping is that the IMF and Greece will work out a three-year   agreement that’s very tough on Greece and then they’ll say to the voters, “Okay, we’ve got this   really tough agreement  Oh, by the way, now the aid package is for three years  It’s going to be   much bigger than we thought”  And they hope that they can get it through that way  That’s why   you’re hearing all of this tough talk out of Germany, because they’re trying to prepare the ground   for ramming this through at the end  What’s going on in Germany is pretty complicated, and   there’s a lot of politics and a lot of theater involved, so we’ll see if it plays out smoothly or not   over the next week or two    We’re looking at it  European banks are another   transmission channel  One could imagine that if we started seeing contagion to Portugal, Spain,   maybe even Italy, people will start to become worried about the European banks  Then you   could actually have a dollar funding problem again as US banks start to back away from   European banks  We don’t have the swap agreements in place  We don’t have any sort of   mechanism to provide dollar liquidity to Europe  So the LIBOR problem that we saw a year and   a half ago could potentially resurface  So there’s some real risk here   April 27–28, 2010 76 of 206                     I agree with that    But there still is a structural European dollar funding   shortfall  It’s not as big as it was     They have a book of business, and that book includes   funding their dollar assets  If their credit quality were to come into question, their counterparties   would back away  If US banks back away, even though the crisis isn’t with respect to dollar   assets, you could still have a dollar funding shortfall because of counterparty risk    I agree with what Nathan said  If it goes to Spain, the   European bank exposures are big enough to matter  And I think there’s a general perception that   the European banks have been very slow to recognize their problems and to raise capital  There   has been a bit more perception of regulatory forbearance in Europe, so if you have this piled on   top of it, it becomes a pretty big deal    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was going to talk about   Greece anyway, but I didn’t realize it was going to keep getting so much worse in the last   48 hours  Where we are right now is that the IMF and the Greek government are negotiating a   package, and they hope to complete those negotiations by the end of the week  Should they   actually continue, as we expect, those negotiations are expected to lead to a three-year program,   €75 billion, or maybe even a little bit more, that would allow Greece to roll over all of its   maturing obligations over that period  I think the Greeks are willing to agree to this, because   April 27–28, 2010 82 of 206                   their alternatives are horrible  Obviously, agreeing to it doesn’t mean you actually will   implement everything  It buys you some time, though, at least, to get that first disbursement that   you need to be able to roll over the €9½ billion of maturing debt that they have due on May 19   The problem at this point is that the markets have moved well beyond this  As of this   morning, two-year Greek sovereign debt yields rose to 25 percent, which, if you do the math,   implies either a very high probability of restructuring or a very big loss, if there’s a restructuring,   or some combination thereof  So the markets are basically saying that the Greek debt level, even   with this package, is probably not viable over time   I think the Europeans are still going to press ahead and try to get this out by the weekend    The next hurdle for this will be the German electorate  They have not been told, as far as I am   aware, that there’s going to be a bigger package  They’ve been told that it’s going to be a €25 or   €30 billion package, of which the German share would be about €8 billion  Obviously, if it is a   €75 billion package—€25 billion IMF, €50 billion Europe—the German share is going to be   quite a bit higher than what they’ve been told  I think the German official view on this is, “Well,   we’re going to show how much the Greeks are doing”  This is going to be a very austere   package, with four years of fiscal retrenchment accumulating to something on the order of   13 percent of GDP  So they’ll use that to show that the Greeks are doing enough  But we’ll see   The ECB is looking at the issue of what happens if the Greek sovereign debt is   downgraded by Moody’s  Yesterday it was downgraded to junk status by S&P  If it were   downgraded to junk status by the other rating agencies, then it would no longer be eligible as   ECB collateral  Lucas Papademos was on the call  He said that the ECB does have emergency   measures that it can take to ensure that liquidity is forthcoming  I think he was pretty reassuring   on that score, even though he didn’t want to get into the details of what those emergency   April 27–28, 2010 83 of 206                   measures might actually be  The Bank of Greece can lend to the Greek banks, so that seems to   be okay at this point   The second big issue, of course, is that the contagion has already begun to Ireland and   Portugal, and, to a lesser extent, to Spain and Italy  The good news is that they’re at better   starting points than Greece in terms of their debt-to-GDP ratios and in terms of their current   account positions  Some countries, like Ireland, have already demonstrated quite a bit of social   cohesion and are already adopting pretty significant fiscal consolidation  The bad news is that   there’s nothing beyond what these countries can do for themselves  There’s no discussion, at   this point at least, of packages being cobbled together by Europe to provide aid to these other   entities  So Europe may aid Greece, but, if there’s going to be a package for Portugal, Ireland, or   Spain, at this point it’s only from the IMF, and that means a much smaller package  So I think   the big thing over the next couple days will be to see what Portugal, Spain, and Ireland say about   their willingness to do fiscal consolidation and how credible that is, because that’s really the   firewall at this point  They’re certainly going to be urged to do as much as they can, but we’ll   see if that’s sufficient   In terms of the channels of contagion back to the United States, I think there are several   potential channels  First, at a minimum, if all of this goes really, really well, you’re going to   have a lot more fiscal consolidation in Europe a lot sooner than we had thought a year ago  If it   goes well, it means that Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and maybe to a lesser degree, Italy, are all   going to undertake fiscal consolidation that’s going to happen quite soon  So Europe is going to   be much weaker than we had thought   April 27–28, 2010 84 of 206                   Second, obviously, the dollar is another source of impact on us, and I think the   Greenbook looked at that in some detail  The trade weighted value of the dollar hasn’t really   actually moved much, so I think the consequences from that channel are pretty small   Third, there’s obviously a risk of contagion through the banking system, because, as   Nathan outlined yesterday, the European banks hold a lot of sovereign debt in Europe—not so   much Greece, not so much Portugal, but when you add in Spain and Italy, it gets to be a very,   very large number  One risk here, of course, is that US banks could start to back off from   European banks, or the healthy European banks could start to back off from the weaker ones, and   then you’d start to see funding pressures among the banking community in Europe  So far, we   would say we’ve seen just a little inkling of dollar funding pressures to date  Interestingly,   yesterday the German Eurodollar futures contract went up by—what was it, Brian, five or six   basis points?    Six basis points, at a time when all other yields in the   US were tending to go down  And there are some reports of people pulling back a little bit in   terms of cutting their lines to the Portuguese banks  It isn’t at the level yet where it’s going to   have any great consequence if it stops where it is now  But, as we’ve seen in the past, oftentimes   it can go from very little things to very big things very, very quickly  I think the minimum effect   on us is going to be a drag on our economic growth, if things go well  If things go badly, the   effects are going to be bigger  My view is that this is just one more reason why we want to stay   where we are right now in terms of our monetary policy course  And I feel very strongly that we   don’t want to do anything today that’s surprising to markets  So on the Treasury redemptions   April 27–28, 2010 85 of 206                   front, I fully support the idea of having the staff look at this in more detail and bringing it up   again at the June meeting, but I wouldn’t do anything today   Because I’m starting the policy round, I have a couple of other things to touch on that   aren’t about Greece  There’s another issue in terms of financial stability that’s a bit of a risk to   the outlook, and that’s the credit ratings of major US banks  Apparently, the credit rating   agencies are looking at the regulatory reform legislation as possibly quite negative for how they   would rate US banks, because if the legislation results in much diminished potential for   government support to the banks, the rating agencies might decide to eliminate or reduce the   degree of uplift to the ratings that is provided by government support  Right now, major US   banking institutions get anywhere from one to four notches of uplift to their ratings from the   implied government support  If the legislation comes through in a way that’s very austere or   limiting in terms of the government to support the banks, the rating agencies could actually   downgrade the banks as a consequence  This could become a big deal if these rating agencies’   downgrades were big enough to cause the short-term funding ratings to be downgraded to A2/P2   Theoretically, at least, this could happen for four major institutions—Morgan Stanley, Goldman   Sachs, Bank of America, and Citigroup  If it were to happen, these institutions would probably   encounter liquidity problems over the medium-term horizon   We looked at what would happen for these four institutions  Three of the four would be   fine on a 30-day horizon—they have a big enough liquidity buffer to handle 30 days—but, after   that, all of them would run into difficulty  I don’t think that the likelihood of this happening is   particularly high, especially at a time when US banks have raised a lot of capital and have much   greater liquidity buffers than they had before, and when CDS spreads for these institutions have   come down dramatically  But I wanted to flag it as a risk, because the rating agencies have   April 27–28, 2010 86 of 206                   brought this up as a potential issue  They haven’t said what they are going to do  It’s sort of a   timing issue the implementation of Basel II is going to happen later, and US financial   regulatory reform is going to happen earlier, so there’s a little bit of a mismatch in terms of   timing here, which is just another risk   In terms of the economy, abstracting from all of these financial stability issues, to my   mind, things haven’t really changed very much since the last meeting  GDP is on a little bit   stronger track, inflation is a little bit weaker, so that combination is mostly offsetting  I’m not   particularly excited about the strength in GDP  I’m very sympathetic with David’s remarks   yesterday about the fact that job trends are still very weak and the income trends are very   anemic  The fact is that we’re going to lose a lot of support that we’ve had from inventories, and   we’re going to lose some support that we have had from the fiscal side  And state and local   governments are clearly going to be tightening their belts  So I think that the outlook really   hasn’t changed that much  I notice that, when I look at the longer-term forecasts of the   Committee for 2011 and 2012, there’s very little change to GDP or the unemployment trajectory   relative to last time; the only thing that has really changed is that inflation is actually projected to   be a little lower  All of that seems to be very consistent with the idea that nothing really has   changed, so there’s no real reason to change course  Thank you    Thank you  I just want to give you an update on the   Greece situation as it continues to unfold  There was a press conference in Berlin today that   went pretty well—the market reacted favorably  It’s because they basically reinforced the idea   that they are going to do this thing for Greece without restructuring  There was an unconfirmed   press report that the size would be scaled up—there were numbers as high as €120 billion, but   subsequent to that Spain was downgraded a notch by S&P to AA from AA+, and the enthusiasm   then evaporated completely  This just tells you that this is a very fluid situation  Even though   there are some upticks in the mood occasionally, it’s still getting worse, generally, and I think   we’re going to have to keep our eye on this very, very closely over the near term  As I said   before, I think it really reinforces the notion of not doing much at this meeting   I think the outlook is also broadly consistent with that  The near-term economic growth   outlook is a little bit better  Inflation is a little bit lower than what we want  The medium-term   outlook hasn’t changed appreciably since the last meeting  In the Bluebook, most of the   unconstrained federal funds rates are below the current rate, and most of them haven’t changed   much, either, since the last meeting  So it seems to me that, given that the Greek situation is   creating a huge amount of uncertainty, and given that we don’t want to create any drama, and   considering everything that has happened since the last meeting, it all points to alternative B and   keeping the “extended period” language in  My sense is that the Committee’s view is that, if   we’re not going to do anything about Treasury redemptions, then we don’t need paragraph 4 at   this meeting, and I would concur with that   April 27–28, 2010 167 of 206                    I favor doing as little as possible      We should ask for a little more than those two words   [laughter]  “You’ll need it!”  "
8978,2010-05-09,"  Mr Chairman, this is Bill Dudley  I think in our   discussions here, the general view has probably been to replicate as nearly as possible what we   had before, because the market has comfort and knowledge of that, and we also have a good   experience with it  If we followed what we had before, we would have a penalty of 1 percentage   point  And the real decision I think we would have to make is  Do we want to make it   unlimited, that is, a fixed-rate tender swap, or do we want to cap the amount?  I would favor a   May 9, 2010 13 of 42             fixed-rate tender, with the market taking as much as it wanted at the penalty rate, as we did the   last time    Yes  Different countries had different auction cycles    They followed the TAF, so there was a 28-day TAF and an 84-day TAF, obviously  In addition   to that, they had weekly cycles   I think that that’s really a second-order consideration, because they have to decide what   the appropriate maturity would be, what would work best from their perspective  Of course,   what would be different this time is that we wouldn’t be reintroducing the TAF  Instead, they   would just be conducting TAF-like auctions independent from us    We also don’t know what the take-up of these swap lines   will be in practice So it would seem to me that it would be premature to consider whether   sterilization was appropriate when you don’t even know the magnitude of the swaps that will be   outstanding    Well, it depends on how they’re structured  They could   be structured as a fixed size, or they could be structured as a fixed-rate unlimited tender  In the   last rounds after Lehman, we did them as fixed-rate unlimited size  The reason for that, of   course, is that we’re not making a statement about what amount of liquidity the market demands    We’re just saying that we’ll supply whatever liquidity, at a penalty interest rate  That worked   pretty well, because, as markets normalized, the amount outstanding went down, and it wound   down very smoothly as the process unfolded   Actually, I would argue that if we were to propose a fixed size, we probably would get   more demand than if we did an unlimited tender, because with a fixed size, people would be   worried that it will run out  But if it’s unlimited, there’s less anxiety—it serves as more of a   backstop to the market than as something the market has to use  I would think, from a balance   sheet perspective, that a fixed-rate tender would result in less demand relative to a large FX swap   program    We can publish the amounts of the auction sizes for each   of the counterparties that we have  They’re doing an auction, they’re announcing the results, and   we could just aggregate that information and publish it as it happens  Each time they have an   auction, we could publish the individual counterparties and total results    I support doing this  Obviously, it would be better if we   could get greater concessions and fiscal consolidation in Europe  But the reality is that the swaps   will mitigate the bad feedback loop that’s occurring because of the intersection of the sovereign   risk problems with the state of the European banks  If we weren’t to do this now, I think things   would just get worse, and we would be forced into doing it later  The reality is that doing it   earlier will actually mitigate the extent of the problems to some degree  But we shouldn’t fool   ourselves  The swaps are addressing a symptom of the problem  The underlying problem is the   European fiscal situation, the credibility of their fiscal plans, and the health of the European   banks  This just will mitigate how that spreads  Still, I think it’s worth doing, because, as we’ve   seen, the propagation mechanisms and these amplifying dynamics that we’ve seen in the earlier   parts of the crisis can be pretty important  So I think anything we can do to get out in front of   that is a good thing rather than a bad thing  "
9001,2010-06-22,"  I want to follow up on that point, and then I have another   set of questions  We could potentially alleviate the supply issues by doing other swaps if we   wanted to, as opposed to actually selling assets outright, right?  We have other 55 percent   coupons in our portfolio, so, in principle, if we wanted to address the market functioning, we   could think about doing other swaps  Is that correct?    So, on the market function issue, that might be worth   evaluating, in order to see if it’s a good idea or not   The second thing I wanted to ask is about reserve-draining tools    Sure     I understand  The question I want to ask is on the   reserve-draining tools  As I see it, we have four of them, right?  We can run off maturing assets,   we can do asset sales, we can do term deposit accounts, we can do reverse repos  My question   is  Have we really evaluated what our preferences are among those four things?  Do we pull   each lever equally, or do we prefer one lever over another?   June 22–23, 2010 11 of 213             A related issue is  How do we think about our preferences in terms of the cost?    Presumably the costs of all of these things are not going to be quite the same—either the interest   expense that we’re paying to borrow the money or the forgone interest in letting the maturities   run off  Has the staff started to do any work on this?    I presume that, once you do the test, you’ll get some   evidence about where the market wants to clear, at least for small quantities    But you still won’t know exactly what the supply curve   is for bigger quantities    Yes  I just want to suggest that the cost should be one of   the parameters, because there is an effect on the taxpayer in terms of how we do this, namely,   what the net amount of money that we rebate to the Treasury is  So I think that should be one of   the criteria, though certainly not to the exclusion of all the other criteria     As an arm’s-length transaction     Well, it’s because of the level of interest rates  It’s very   sensitive to the level of interest rates    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m where many others have   already expressed themselves  I would not want to do anything that would be or could be   construed as a monetary policy tightening in light of the fact that the economic outlook has   deteriorated since the last meeting  Financial conditions have tightened, and tail risks have   increased  I thought it was interesting that, in the submissions of the participants’ forecasts,   there’s a big shift in the Committee’s view about risks lying to the downside now in terms of   their growth outlook   With that in mind, while I don’t like the composition of our Treasury portfolio—I would   prefer it to be shorter-dated—I don’t think this is the time to make any changes  At some point I   might favor option 2, but not today   In terms of asset sales, I’m very much where I was at the last meeting, and that was with   the majority  I thought the majority of the Committee had come out pretty clearly that first it’s   language, then it’s interest on excess reserves, and then it’s asset sales  I would, if anything,   want to reinforce that, if we could, because there’s too much confusion in the marketplace about   whether the Committee has decided this or not   Regarding the swap, I think what Brian has proposed is very straightforward, completely   technical, standard operating procedure, and involves the least drama  So I very much favor   doing the swap    Thank you, Mr Chairman  From my perspective, the   major new development is that the risks to the outlook for economic growth are now skewed to   the downside rather than the upside  In my mind this reflects two issues  First, the upside risk to   growth that seemed somewhat possible a month or two ago seemed to have diminished  Much   June 22–23, 2010 99 of 213             faster growth would presumably have involved more rapid employment growth that would then   boost incomes, leading to ever stronger consumption growth, which in turn would sustain greater   payroll employment gains  However, the soft employment and consumption figures indicate that   this positive multiplier story hasn’t taken hold with any vigor  In addition, the boost from   inventory restocking is getting a bit long in the tooth, and, hence, manufacturing output is likely   not to keep rising much faster than final demand for much longer  So the upside risks that   certainly seemed real even a month or two ago now seem to have faded   Second, the European situation will likely depress US economic activity through at least   three channels  weaker final demand in Europe due to earlier fiscal consolidation; more trade   drag for the US, given the depreciation of the euro versus the dollar; and tighter financial   conditions due to greater risk aversion and worries about the European banking system  The   good news, of course, is that the Europeans do seem to be muddling through  There is a large   SPV in train that will backstop European government debt issuance, and, in the meantime, the   ECB is buying the debt of peripheral countries to prevent sovereign interest rates from rising   sharply, and the euro zone has announced a bank stress test for their largest banking institutions    The bad news is that there’s still considerable room for things to go wrong  This could range   from further market disruptions to political problems— for example, some governments could   balk at the fiscal consolidation demanded by markets, or other governments could balk at the   level of assistance that they need to provide to keep the euro zone intact   Although I’m generally heartened by the decision of the Europeans to do a bank stress   test, as we know all too well, the devil is in the details  The test has to be sufficiently stressful   and the results need to be disclosed in a sufficiently transparent fashion to allow market   June 22–23, 2010 100 of 213             participants to assess and judge the credibility of the exercise  So the proof of the pudding will   be in what the results are and how they’re disclosed to the market   The bottom line for me is that growth is likely to be moderate, with substantial risk to the   downside at a time that inflation is already too low rather than too high  Given that outlook, I   believe that our policy discussions need to become a bit more balanced than they have been over   the last few months  We have spent a lot of time discussing how we might want to adjust policy   in one direction, namely, exiting from our accommodative policy stance  It seems to me that we   should be thinking just as hard about how to adjust in the other direction, that is, how we might   want to escalate in terms of applying additional monetary policy stimulus  If downside risks to   economic growth were to materialize, the risk of a debt deflation trap would become more   serious  In that circumstance, what would we do to ease financial conditions?  One option would   be to reinvest maturing agency MBS proceeds  Another would be to engage in additional   purchases of Treasury debt and/or agency MBS  I think the bar to the former should be   relatively low, just reinvesting what matures, and the bar to further balance sheet expansion is   probably pretty high, but I wouldn’t rule that out as an option, either   Let me end with two final thoughts that involve risk to the financial sector over time  At   the last meeting I talked about the risk that passage of the regulatory reform bill could lead the   rating agencies to cut their ratings for some of our major banks  As you may recall, the credit   rating agencies were arguing that, by constraining the ability of the government to aid troubled   banks, the legislation might lower the amount of support the banks get in their ratings from the   government backstop  Well, fortunately there has been some welcome news on this front  Since   the last meeting, Moody’s and S&P have indicated that they do not plan to do anything quickly    It doesn’t mean that it might not happen over time, but it’s not going to happen right away  So   June 22–23, 2010 101 of 213             the risk that, once the legislation is signed into law, it will be immediately followed by credit   rating cuts of major US financial institutions has diminished sharply since the last meeting   The second thing I think worth mentioning is what is happening in Basel regarding the   capital adequacy requirements for banks  This is going to play out over the next six months, I   hope, if we can actually get an international agreement  Our very early analysis here is that   making US financial institutions sufficiently robust could require considerably more capital and   higher quality capital for some of them  If such requirements were phased in over a long period   of time, say, five years or so, it probably wouldn’t be a big problem for the large US banks,   assuming we had a sustained economic recovery  Retained earnings should allow most   institutions to build capital so they can reach the new requirements at the end of a relatively long   transition period without great difficulty  However, there’s a risk, because market participants   think that the US banks already have plenty of capital  So there’s a potential announcement   effect if all of a sudden people hear that the large US financial institutions need to raise quite a   bit more capital—it could be a bit of a shock to the market  So I’d say we should keep that in   mind as another potential risk  Thank you, Mr Chairman    It’s like St Augustine—“…but not just now”    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B, and   I’m fine with the coupon swap as proposed by the staff  That said, it wouldn’t take much in   terms of weaker economic data, lower inflation, and further financial market distress for me to   prefer alternative A  I am concerned, in particular, that any significant weakening in the   economic data from here could raise fears of a double dip, and that, in turn, might increase the   risk of further risk aversion and a further tightening of financial conditions, which would actually   June 22–23, 2010 158 of 213             make the double dip more likely  I think that, in those circumstances, alternative A would be   appropriate  I’m not quite there yet, but it wouldn’t take much to push me there   If economic conditions deteriorated and financial markets were to tighten, it would be   important at that stage for the FOMC to show that our toolbox was not empty and that we were   still willing and able to act to lean against such developments  I think a failure to act at that   particular point would be quite dangerous, because it would reinforce fears that there was limited   scope for further economic policy support, and that would create even greater fears of a double   dip  In terms of escalation, I think we’ve laid out what the options are  We could stop   redemptions of agency MBS, we could restart a purchase program of Treasuries and/or agency   MBS, we could change the language in the statement to try to commit to lower short-term rates   for a longer period of time, or we could cut the IOER rate   I think the bar to reinvesting maturing agency MBS should be pretty low, because that’s   really just maintaining the status quo  Letting the agency MBS run off is essentially a de facto—  very modest but, still, de facto—tightening of policy over time  I don’t think it’s going to be   very stressful on the economy, but I don’t think the bar to reinvesting the agency MBS should be   very high  I do agree with Governor Warsh and others that bar to expanding the balance sheet   should be considerably higher for a whole variety of reasons   In terms of changing the language, although it’s an option, I don’t have any really great   ideas that I think would be particularly helpful  “Extraordinarily low for an extended period” is   already pretty strong, and the market doesn’t seem to be off base in their expectations relative to   our own expectations  I suppose we could commit to some sort of price level target, so that any   undershooting on inflation over the next couple of years would be reversed down the road, but,   as we’ve discussed in the past, I think that has real communication difficulties right now   June 22–23, 2010 159 of 213             In terms of the interest on excess reserves that Governor Kohn raised as a potential   option, I think it certainly should be examined, and I’d like to see a little bit more work done on   what the costs and benefits of that are; that is, how much market dysfunction we’d create by   cutting the IOER rate further versus what the benefits would be in terms of the signal that we   would be sending to markets  Thank you, Mr Chairman    It’s creating an unnecessary ambiguity, I think  "
9028,2010-08-10,"  I would like to introduce Annmarie Rowe-Straker, who   is sitting next to Brian Sack  Annmarie is joining us from the Markets Group at the New York   Fed  Welcome, Annmarie, to your first meeting    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought the first round   today was interesting  It seems that people mostly agree on where we are, but there’s quite a bit   of disagreement about what we should do about it and how effective those actions would be in   shaping the outlook  In general, I think I’m pretty close to many others  The economy has hit a   soft patch  That does increase the economy’s vulnerability to adverse shocks  This has mainly   come about because the benefits of inventory restocking have petered out, while, at the same   time, the household deleveraging process probably has not yet been completed  My expectation   is that economic growth will be quite slow for the next couple of quarters and then will pick up   steam next year   August 10, 2010 60 of 160             On balance, my level of anxiety about the outlook is up only slightly from the last   meeting, but it was relatively elevated then, so I don’t take much comfort from that  On the one   hand, the evidence of slowing is more pervasive, both in consumer spending and in housing, and   private sector payroll growth remains anemic  But, on the other hand, there were some more   positive developments  In particular, the risks from Europe appear to have diminished   somewhat, as growth has been firmer than expected, and the bank stress test, while not ideal, has   taken place and has been more reassuring than disturbing  Also, as noted, financial conditions in   the United States have eased since the last meeting, with equities recovering a bit, the dollar   weakening, and long-term interest rates having fallen   In general, while I think there’s some risk of a double dip, I’d still see that risk as quite   low  After all, policy remains accommodative, financial conditions have eased, and credit   availability is starting to improve  Growth abroad remains solid, and the cyclical parts of the   US economy that could conceivably contribute to such a downturn, such as housing and autos,   remain at depressed levels, well below their long-term trends I think this is an important point in   assessing the risks of the double dip—in other words, to consider what sectors could turn down   and cause the double dip to take place  Moreover, the revisions to the NIPA data indicate that   the household deleveraging process may be more advanced than we previously thought, as   consumer spending during the recession was revised downward and disposable income growth   was revised upward  So there was a pretty substantial upward revision to the household saving   rate, which is now about 6 percent   Despite all of this, I have now moved to thinking that we should try to do more in terms   of providing support to economic activity  Several factors lead me to this position  First, it’s   going to take a long time—years, not months—to get back to our objective of full employment    August 10, 2010 61 of 160             So it’s hard for me to justify sitting here and not using our policy tools as aggressively as we can    Second, we are in a vulnerable period, during which an unexpected shock could push the   economy from a slow-growth path into a recession   Third, anything short of solid economic   growth raises concerns about the risk of deflation  With inflation so low already, even modest   further downward pressure on inflation could make this a real risk  In my view, it’s better to take   out some insurance now to reduce that risk than to wait and hope  Fourth, our current policy is   one in which the weaker the economy is, and the lower longer-term interest rates are, the faster   we’re shrinking our balance sheet, which is increasing the amount of duration that has to be held   by the private sector  This seems a bit perverse, to me, in an environment in which the economy   is weaker than desired to start with  At a minimum, offsetting the shrinkage of our balance sheet   by reinvesting maturing agency debt and agency MBS would seem appropriate in order to keep   the policy setting from automatically moving in a tightening direction as the economy weakens    But that is drifting into the monetary policy discussion, so, I’ll say more on that later    I have two points  First, one way to think about it,   President Lacker, is that, to the extent that these mortgages are being refinanced, if you’re asking   the private sector to hold them instead of having the Fed hold them, you’re asking the private   sector to take on quite a bit more duration, and that’s going to show up in longer-term rates that   the private sector demands, right?  I think the choice should be comparing the option of our   holding it with the private sector holding it and deciding whether we’re comfortable with making   the private sector hold it and what the implications of that are for longer-term rates   Second, I just want to ask Brian a very quick question  The statement as proposed is “at   the current level”  Would you feel more comfortable saying “around the current level”?  It’s a   very small point, but we’re not going to be “at the current level”    But it’s going to move around, though, by, say, $10 or   $15 million, right?    Okay    Thank you, Mr Chairman I favor option B  I believe   the case for reinvesting the agency debt and MBS is very compelling  After all, if we don’t   reinvest, we’re basically in a perverse situation  The weaker the economy and the lower long-  term rates, the faster we allow our balance sheet to shrink as a result of the MBS prepayments,   and that shrinkage of the balance sheet increases the duration we force on the private sector,   limiting the scope for further declines in interest rates that would support economic activity  I   don’t see how that can be desirable in the current circumstances  I think we fell into this regime   by accident, by circumstance  We see that there’s a flaw with the current regime  This policy   August 10, 2010 132 of 160             action, in my mind, is fixing that flaw  That flaw was sort of latent a few months ago, when the   economy looked better and interest rates were higher  But as the economy has weakened and as   long-term rates have come down, the threat has gone from latent to something that’s real  Our   balance sheet will shrink quite rapidly over the next year or two at the current level of interest   rates if we don’t do something to offset that   Now, regarding President Lacker’s point—namely, that market participants are moving   out at the long end and bringing down long-term rates, so that’s quantitative easing being   effective—I see that as a good thing, and I think the reinvestment amounts to not standing in the   way of or inhibiting that  I think we want to encourage that as long as the unemployment rate is   as high as it is and as long as the inflation rate is low   Regarding Governor Warsh’s point, I think the messaging is really, really important  I   would much more favor a message that was on the side of saying that this is a small change to fix   a flaw in our regime caused by the weaker the economy, the lower rates, etc, etc, rather than on   the side of saying it’s a new big policy initiative, because I don’t really think things have   changed that dramatically from the last meeting  I do believe that it’s a big step to expand the   balance sheet beyond where we are right now, so I think the messaging is really important  I   think we can do that in the minutes, and I think the Chairman can do that in his discussions with   the press   In terms of what we should be reinvesting in, my view is it should be completely   determined by what we think is going to be most efficient in terms of its effect on financial   conditions; based on the Desk view, right now that’s reinvesting in the Treasuries, but, two   months from now, that might be reinvesting into agency MBS  So I’d want a decision to be   based on the market as it evolves rather than a decision that’s made for all time   August 10, 2010 133 of 160             I’d also like to talk about how long we’re going to do this  Is this program $400 billion   or $600 billion?  I have no idea  I think we’re making the decision at the time based on our   outlook today, and our aim is that we don’t want to have a de facto tightening of monetary policy   caused by weakness in the economy as our balance sheet shrinks  One meeting from now or two   meetings from now or three meetings from now, we might decide that things had improved   enough that we’re going to allow the agency MBS to run off again  I don’t think we should in   any way lock ourselves in to how long this is going to last  We should do it based on the outlook   and how things evolve going forward   Regarding the language, in paragraph 2 I like Don’s final gift to the Committee, “at levels   lower than are desirable over the long run” for exactly the same reason that Governor Tarullo   gave  It was always a little ambiguous before—“Inflation is likely to be subdued for some time”    Well, “subdued inflation” is good as long as “subdued” isn’t below the levels that you view as   consistent with price stability  I think adding “at levels lower than are desirable over the long   run” makes it very clear that we think inflation right now is too low, and I think that’s a useful   point to add to the statement  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I don’t know  I think it’s not a very powerful phrase   August 10, 2010 138 of 160              I think that’s risky    The accommodation could change depending on a whole   bunch of other things    The first phrase is pretty neutral—of course we’re trying   to help support the economic recovery  "
9053,2010-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy’s forward   momentum continues to be disappointing relative to both our objectives and forecast  The boost   to activity from inventory restocking is mostly over, but the apparent desire of households to   deleverage further and significant constraints on credit availability remain in place   That said, in general, I don’t view the incoming data since the last meeting as changing   the picture very much  Earlier in the intermeeting period, the data were very weak, especially   related to housing, but more recently the activity has been stronger, and this has been mimicked   by financial markets  First we had a pretty significant tightening of financial conditions  Then   there has been a return of the risk appetite so that financial conditions are broadly unchanged   since the last meeting  I do think, though, that the sensitivity of markets to the economic outlook   is important, because it implies that financial markets are likely to evolve in a way that will   reinforce the direction of activity either up or down  So that increases the risk to the outlook   In terms of the anecdotal evidence from our business contacts, they follow very similar   themes  First, businesspeople are very upset about the Administration, probably as angry as I’ve   ever seen them  This reflects both the perception that they’re being demonized and policy   uncertainty on a wide variety of subjects, such as health care and financial reform  Second, the   businesspeople indicate that they will be very quick to batten down the hatches if the economy   appears to be softening significantly, but, despite this, they indicate that economic conditions are   improving  Thus, their complaints do not seem to be matched by their actions  My view is that   this frustrating period, in which the recovery is weaker than we would desire, is likely to   September 21, 2010 58 of 151             continue for a while longer, but a double dip still appears unlikely  As time passes, the financial   system’s health should continue to improve, leading to better credit availability The   deleveraging of the household sector continues, so this process is probably now closer to the end   than the beginning  Finally, it’s hard to have a double dip when the cyclically sensitive sectors,   such as housing and consumer durables, are already very depressed, monetary and fiscal policy is   accommodative, and the rest of the world is still growing at a decent pace   Despite that, I don’t think we should take too much comfort from this  It is difficult to   judge the risk, because we don’t have very much experience with this type of business cycle   And, on the other side, every time the unemployment rate has risen by 03 percentage points or   more on a three-month moving-average basis, we’ve actually had a downturn  So my point is   that it wouldn’t take a huge shock to set the dynamics in motion that could actually lead to a   recession   It’s difficult to be confident about when a stronger self-sustaining recovery will take hold    I expect that when it finally arrives, it will arrive quickly, but until then, we remain in a very   vulnerable position  The persistence of such a sluggish economic expansion creates the real risk   of further disinflation, and this is an outcome to be feared, because further disinflation, of course,   would raise the real interest rate and, thereby, reduce the degree of monetary policy   accommodation at the lower bound  Put simply, we’re not that far from outright deflation, and   inflation expectations appear to have become less well anchored to the downside since the last   meeting  Thus, despite the fact that I believe the risks of a double dip are low, I continue to   believe that we should give strong consideration to providing additional accommodation  When   combined with how far away we are from our twin mandate, the risk of deflation argues for   doing more   September 21, 2010 59 of 151             What types of shocks could push the economy downward?  Well, one risk certainly   remains Europe  While economic growth in the second quarter was generally stronger than   expected, it may prove transient  Moreover, there is a risk of further market turbulence there    Already we have seen a substantial widening of sovereign debt spreads in Ireland because of   concerns about the cost of recapitalizing the banking system  Another risk here remains the US   municipal sector  Although debt instruments typically get the first call on municipal cash flows,   there is a risk that voters will start to balk and demand that services be maintained over debt   service  Further defaults, such as what took place recently in Harrisburg, could potentially   destabilize the municipal bond market, which is mainly supported by retail investors   In terms of the Basel process in which we recently obtained agreement on capital   standards, I think the early reading is encouraging  Investors appear to be confident about the   ability of large banks to meet the standards as they gradually come into force, mainly through   retained earnings  There’s little evidence that the banks are being forced to pull forward meeting   the requirements, which do not become fully effective until the beginning of 2019  But there still   remains some risk  First, I think market participants don’t fully understand how much risk-   weighted assets for some banks have actually increased  This is especially true of banks with   large trading operations  So market participants are probably understating these banks’ capital   needs  Also, there remains a risk that, if the standards were pulled forward significantly so that   banks could somehow pay dividends more quickly, the standards could still lead to further   deleveraging and credit constraint  Finally, I think that it’s important that there are also going to   be adjustments from the imposition of Dodd–Frank, and some of those changes may have   consequences that we do not fully appreciate Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I believe we should provide   additional monetary policy accommodation  The economy is too weak, inflation is too low, and   we are too far away from our full employment objective  But I believe that there are several   competing options for action on the table that are open to us, and we haven’t reached consensus   September 21, 2010 118 of 151             on them  I also think each option does have some risks associated with it, so I agree that we do   need more time, especially for the staff to do the necessary work, for us to reach a consensus,   and for us to prepare market participants for what we are ultimately going to do  I support   alternative B at this meeting, and, unless the economy improves markedly soon, I would expect   to prefer a statement like alternative A at the November FOMC meeting   With any policy move there are both costs and benefits, and the Chairman made that clear   very nicely, I thought, in his speech at Jackson Hole  In this regard, there are several things we   can do to reduce the cost of further monetary policy accommodation  First, I think one of the   most important ones is that we can be a lot more disciplined in terms of how we communicate to   markets  I was very unhappy about the press stories that came out after the last FOMC meeting,   because some of the stories delved all too accurately into the specifics of the meeting—who said   what and what the staff briefings were—and I think that is completely privileged information    It’s completely inappropriate for any of that to be disclosed to market participants  If it’s going   to be disclosed, that should only happen in the minutes, after all of us have had a chance to   comment on the draft—that’s the way that should get out  I think it’s noteworthy in that regard   that in our survey of primary dealers we got the lowest grade in terms of the quality of our   communications since we began asking the dealers that question in early 2009, and I think that   was in spite of the Chairman’s efforts  At Jackson Hole I think he gave a very good, clear   speech that was on target, and despite that we got a very low grade  So I think the leaks very   much hurt us in that regard   Second, I think we can do a better job in providing more clarity to market participants   about the framework we’re using to shape policy  People around the table laid out a number of   choices  We can keep the current framework, continue to emphasize our dual mandate, and   September 21, 2010 119 of 151             explain a little bit better how further disinflation is inconsistent with achieving full employment   We also can shift the framework a bit, if we decide that that adjustment would make it easier for   us to achieve our dual mandate  The only reason to shift it is if we think that’s going to make it   more likely that we’re going to accomplish our objective  In this regard, I would strongly   encourage the staff to investigate a lot of the things that have been raised today, such as moving   to an explicit inflation targeting regime per alternative A1 or using the price-level regime that   President Evans laid out  My own opinion is that exploring a price-level target regime is   worthwhile, because such a regime does have advantages relative to an inflation targeting   regime  It’s more powerful in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, because   shortfalls in inflation have to be made up in future periods  It also may have a potential   advantage in terms of credibility, because by introducing it you’re admitting the prospect that   you will miss your inflation objective over the short run, while having an inflation target and   then missing it does have potential risks for credibility  On the disadvantage side for price-level   targets, as President Yellen laid out, they’re a lot more complicated, there are a lot more moving   parts, a lot of communication challenges  The devil is in the details on this one  So I’d like the   staff to work on the details so we can see how big a devil it is   Third, I think we can do more to reduce the risk that market participants will be unsettled   by further balance sheet expansion  That means we need to explain more clearly how it would   work  For example, if we decide to do it on a continuous basis, what does that mean?  What are   the units of change that we might like to use?  That is, we don’t move the funds rate 7 basis   points, and then 12 basis points, then 18 basis points—we move in increments of 25 basis points    So presumably there has to be some sort of analogue to that in terms of how we adjust the   balance sheet  I think that doing all of these things, so that market participants understand why   September 21, 2010 120 of 151             we’re doing what we’re doing and how the process will unfold over the longer term—not just   between this meeting and next meeting—should help improve the probability that inflation   expectations will be well anchored and that policy will achieve the desired results   Regarding the language for today’s statement, I think the key issue is  What are we   trying to shoot for in terms of what the markets think about what’s going to happen in   November?  I’m sure everyone around the table has a different view of what they’re shooting   for  In my own opinion, I want to have the markets view us as likely to move at the next meeting   if we don’t get an acceleration, a meaningful improvement, in economic activity  So I want   language that is consistent with that  If, after this meeting, the market thought there was a   60 percent probability that we were going to move at the next meeting, I think that would be   about right  I don’t want it to be much higher than that, because I don’t want it to be a foregone   conclusion, where we’re sort of locked in  But I don’t want it to be much lower than that  I   think it’s really important to remember that policy isn’t symmetric now—being late is far worse   than being early  I don’t want us to get in a position where we just temporize from meeting to   meeting, saying that things are a little stronger, so we can wait another meeting  Then we’d get   further and further behind, and, if a shock arose, we’d actually have a deflation problem  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Can we just ask Brian and Bill their view of how the   market would take this?  Obviously, it’s just an opinion, but I think it would be useful to hear it    Yes  "
9076,2010-10-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Turning to the first question, I   don’t have strong views concerning the proper policy framework—I see pros and cons for each    The qualitative dual mandate approach of option 1 is most consistent with what we’ve done up to   now, so it probably has the least risk of unintended consequences, but it’s not very robust  The   inflation objective approach provides more structure, but I worry about a few things  For example,   what would happen if there were a commodity price shock that temporarily pushed headline   inflation above our target?  How would we explain that?  What would the implications for policy   be?  There’s also the issue of credibility if we were to keep falling short of our target  In addition,   as has been raised already, if we’re going to express our inflation objective, don’t we also have to   share our objective with respect to the NAIRU?  But what is the NAIRU?  Right now, it presumably   differs in the short run when we have extended unemployment compensation benefits and a   depressed housing sector versus the longer run when presumably it’s lower  At the same time,   October 15, 2010 42 of 62             taking the NAIRU out and just going with an inflation objective seems to elevate the importance of   inflation at a time when the very high unemployment rate would seem to be our first priority  With   respect to price level targeting, I find the regime potentially attractive as a device to anchor inflation   expectations better, but I do worry about our ability to communicate the framework clearly   In addition to thinking about the framework, though, I think there’s another important issue   to discuss  Assuming that we do proceed with additional LSAPs, I think it’s at least as important   that we reach a consensus about how this policy is likely to evolve in response to different sets of   economic developments over time  I think we need to do this to serve ourselves, so we have some   understanding about our reaction function going into this process, as well as to enhance our ability   to communicate our thinking clearly to market participants  If the market evolves in line with our   forecast, do we stick with what we’ve already announced?  If it’s weaker, do we escalate?  If it’s   stronger, do we reverse course?  What are the thresholds to moving?  How often are we willing to   adjust?  Are the thresholds to doing more versus reversing course symmetric?  Or is there some   inertia to policy that creates a bias to keep going in the same direction?  If we embark on another   round of quantitative easing, market participants will want to know how this policy is likely to   evolve in light of incoming information  I think we want to be as clear as we can to them about this   in advance, because without such clarity, the risk premium would be higher and there would be   more volatility and uncertainty about our future actions   The second question is  Would you favor more LSAPs?  Yes  I believe that the experience   since the last FOMC meeting should make us more confident that LSAPs are a useful tool to ease   financial market conditions  We’ve essentially run an experiment  Before the last meeting, the   market put a low probability on additional LSAPs  Now the market puts a significantly higher   probability on additional LSAPs  Since that meeting, we’ve seen a rise in the equity market of   October 15, 2010 43 of 62             about 3 percent and a decline in 10-year Treasury yields of about 15 to 20 basis points  The dollar   has also weakened  So, whatever you thought of additional LSAPs four weeks ago, I think you’d be   more favorably inclined today  The markets have reacted in a way that is consistent with our desire   to push the economy closer to our objectives, and I think there’s not much evidence that the   decision to do additional LSAPs has created anxiety about our ability to exit smoothly  Although   five-year, five-year-forward TIPS break-evens have increased a bit since the FOMC meeting, this   just reverses the declines that we saw during the summer, so we should actually be heartened rather   than disheartened by this  Also, implied volatility on a forward basis remains very low, signaling a   lack of uncertainty about the path of long-term rates in the future; for example, the implied volatility   of the 10-year swap rate three years ahead—which, presumably, would be around the time we might   want to start to exit—is at a post-crisis low point   Against the benefits of LSAPs and easing financial market conditions, of course, we have to   be cognizant of the cost  But I think it’s important to stress that the costs aren’t invariant—we can   affect the cost by how well we communicate with market participants and the public  We can   explain clearly why we’re doing this, what we think it will and will not accomplish, lay out how our   program is likely to evolve in light of the incoming information, and explain how we will be able to   exit smoothly without an inflation problem over the long run  To the extent that we communicate   effectively, this will reduce the cost of an LSAP program to an acceptable level, so I think that the   benefits will clearly exceed the costs   How would we implement such a program?  I’m not in favor of either the “shock and awe”   approach or the continuous adjustment approach—I want something in the middle  I want   something that’s broadly consistent with the way we’ve adjusted the federal funds rate over time—  typically in 25 basis point increments but sometimes larger, mostly in the same direction so there’s   October 15, 2010 44 of 62             some autocorrelation, sometimes with higher thresholds to reverse course or to start an easing or   tightening cycle  In the current environment, we might think of operating in $250 billion   increments or perhaps slightly smaller  At first, I’d do a bit more, because I think we’re far away   from our objectives, so we’d want to do the equivalent of the stimulus that we’d want to provide if   we could actually push the funds rate as low as we’d like it to be  I would be very hesitant about   having lots of volatility in the LSAP program—I wouldn’t want us to increase the program at one   meeting, then cut it at the next meeting, and then, at the next meeting, increase the program again  I   think that would be bad for the program’s effectiveness, because, as we’ve seen, this is about the   market’s expectations of how much we’re ultimately going to do  If we keep toying with those   expectations, we’re probably going to increase the risk premium and make the program less   effective   Do the statements work?  I’m happy with the statements  I think they provide a better   grounding to explain our actions, but, as I noted before, I think we need to do more to communicate   how the LSAP program would work in practice over time, from meeting to meeting, answering   questions such as, “What might cause us to do more?” and “What might cause us to reverse   course?”  I think the statement isn’t going to be sufficient for that purpose, so I very much favor   press conferences by the Chairman  I think that’s the one point we discussed today where we pretty   much have a consensus, assuming the Chairman is up to doing it  But there are other options  The   Chairman could give a speech in the days immediately following the meeting that could accomplish   the same goal before anybody else spoke and potentially muddied the waters  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
9096,2010-11-02,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I completely support what’s   been expressed here  I talked about it a little bit at the last meeting, in fact  I think there’s one   other issue that could be explored in a bit more detail  That issue is not what happened before   the meeting, but what happens after the meeting in terms of pulling together behind what the   FOMC’s decision is, so that, if someone doesn’t agree with the FOMC decision, it’s not re-  litigated endlessly in the press afterwards  Also, if there are disagreements—and I believe that   it’s completely legitimate to have disagreements—they are discussed in a way that doesn’t   impugn the motives or intelligence of the people who made the decision in an affirmative way  I   think that’s extremely important  I think people need to be able to express their views, but, at the   end of the day, it’s about the Committee and about the Federal Reserve System, it’s not about   any individual  So, once decisions are made, I think people should pull together and support   them to the degree that they can    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Normally, I don’t comment   much about prospects in the New York region, but I did spend three days in upstate New York   last week, so a few observations might be in order  First, there’s no meaningful change in the   debate between smaller businesses and bankers  Small businesses see the banks as continuing to   constrain credit sharply  In contrast, the bankers view themselves as awash in liquidity, with   large deposit inflows, plenty of funds to lend, and a willingness to do so  I’m not surprised by   this  Given the current uncertain economic outlook, I’d expect us to be in a situation in which   borrowers who are creditworthy don’t want or need credit, but those who are less creditworthy   do need funds but are unable to get them easily   Second, the mood in upstate New York can be summed up in two words, and I think this   probably applies more broadly  “hunker down”  In other words, most businesspeople are   waiting for others to move first  I take this as evidence that even a modest amount of additional   stimulus could have outsized effects over the longer run by changing the dynamic from the   current stasis to one in which additional demand growth led to employment gains that improve   confidence  I think an improvement in confidence might cause businesses to loosen up a bit, and   all of a sudden we’d be in a virtuous cycle  I also think that, in this respect, the models that we   use don’t really capture that kind of “tipping point” concept   Third, we were received quite warmly, despite many questions about what we do and   why we do it  The questions ranged from our unusual interventions during the crisis to   understanding why some of us might think that another round of large-scale asset purchases   might be in order  People generally do want to understand what we’re trying to accomplish and   the tools that we have available to do this  Therefore, to the extent that we can explain our goals   November 2–3, 2010 75 of 238             and actions clearly, I see this as helpful in boosting confidence and in supporting our own   credibility   Fourth, among the community bankers, there was considerable angst about profitability,   both from the forthcoming regulatory burden of the Dodd-Frank Act and from the effect of an   extended period of low short-term rates on net interest margins  My view is that we need to be   smart about how the Dodd-Frank Act is implemented; in particular, we don’t want to   inadvertently create a competitive advantage for larger banks that might have scale economies in   dealing with that increased regulation  On the issue of the low level of short-term rates and the   effect on bank profitability, I think the answer here is to do all we can to get the economy   moving, so that the low level of short-term rates does not extend beyond the next year or two   In terms of the national outlook, I don’t see much change from the last meeting  The   economy is currently on a growth trajectory of about 2 percent, which is not sufficient to   generate enough employment growth to push down the unemployment rate, and I think that’s   really the key to boosting consumer and business confidence and generally a more favorable   dynamic for the overall economy  Some data were a bit stronger—in particular, the consumption   data and the durable goods orders data  But against that were more disappointing things, like the   trade performance and the renewed weakness in home prices and uncertainty about how the   foreclosure problems will be resolved  A double dip still seems unlikely to me, and the Federal   Reserve Bank of New York forecast continues to anticipate that the economy will gradually   strengthen in 2011 and 2012  But, to my mind, the economy remains vulnerable to negative   shocks at a time that we’re not that far from outright deflation  So, despite an okay baseline   view—in the sense that the economy is going to grow faster—I think the case for further   November 2–3, 2010 76 of 238             monetary policy stimulus, implemented with care, especially on the communications side, seems   compelling   Finally, I have a few thoughts on financial stability  There really do remain a number of   important issues outstanding for some major US financial institutions  For several, there are   significant housing-related issues—the poor documentation standards accompanying foreclosure   filings and the potential for private-label security holders to put back to the issuers mortgages   that do not comply with the warranties of the original securitizations  At this juncture, the put-  back issue appears to be potentially more serious because of uncertainty about how the state   courts will rule on these matters—in other words, how significant must the error be to allow the   mortgage or security to be put back to the original mortgage issuer—and because there’s a   potentially large magnitude of dollars involved  Although the put-back issue will undoubtedly   take many years to resolve, there’s a risk that an adverse judicial decision for the mortgage   originator could pull the time frame forward and lead to renewed safety-and-soundness concerns   for those institutions that securitized a large amount of private-label mortgages   A second issue is the risk that the combination of bank holding companies with poor   earnings and the diminution of government support as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act could lead   to downgrades in credit ratings—I’ve talked about this in the past  If this occurred, there could   even be funding issues for certain institutions  For now, the rating agencies appear to be patient,   but this situation could change during the first half of next year, especially if lackluster earnings   persist, which then leads to questions about the sustainability of individual firms’ business   models   Third, I think market participants may be a bit too sanguine about the effects of the   Volcker rule implementation on bank profitability  The major banks are trying to define the   November 2–3, 2010 77 of 238             Volcker rule very narrowly as only pure proprietary trading  But the intent of the legislation   suggests a wider application, and that could have more far-reaching effects for banks’ trading   businesses, and I’m not sure this is fully incorporated in market prices or market expectations    Thank you    I think that’s in the statement    It says $600 billion in the first paragraph and $250 to   $300 billion in the second paragraph    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  The   issue of whether to do another round of LSAPs is really—as both proponents and opponents   have made clear—about costs versus benefits  I think we mostly agree that the benefits of the   LSAPs decline with size, so each additional dollar of LSAP has less benefit in terms of reducing   longer-term rates and easing financial conditions, while the costs increase with size, so, as we do   more, the costs of this program increase in terms of exit difficulties or balance sheet risk  This   means that at some point these diminishing benefit and rising cost lines must intersect, and what   November 2–3, 2010 192 of 238             we’re really arguing about is where that point is  In addition to the intersection of those lines, I   think we also need to focus on what we can do to shift that cost line—it’s not as if it’s   immutable  The better we communicate to markets about what we’re doing and why, the more   we can reduce the cost of the LSAP program and push out the point where those two lines   intersect   On the issue of communications, I think we can reduce the cost of LSAPs by being clear   on three issues  First, I think we can explain very clearly why this does not represent   monetization of the debt  The two are very, very different  Unlike monetization of the debt, the   increase in the size of our balance sheet will be temporary, not permanent—as soon as we see the   economy coming back to the point that we think the dual mandate is going to be satisfied, the   program is going to end  Monetization of the debt, in contrast, involves increasing the balance   sheet and creating inflation that you live with forever   Second, I think we have to continue to work on explaining to market participants why we   can exit smoothly from this period of monetary policy accommodation when the time comes    There are still people, very smart people, who think this is ultimately going to lead to an inflation   problem  My own view is that the ability to pay interest on excess reserves gives us the ability to   limit credit creation, so we will not have a longer-term inflation problem   Third, I think it would be useful if we leaned a bit against the idea of a currency war  I   find, as Governor Tarullo does, a lot of this disheartening, because I view the LSAP program as   having effects on the currency markets that are very similar to what happens when we reduce   short-term interest rates—the program changes interest rate differentials, and that has effects on   currencies  I don’t think that’s meaningfully different in kind from traditional monetary policy   easing measures   November 2–3, 2010 193 of 238             In terms of the benefits associated with further LSAPs, I think we can increase them by   explaining very clearly why we’re doing this—we’re doing this to ease financial conditions in   order to support economic activity consistent with our dual mandate obligations  The better that   market participants and the general public understand the rationale for our actions, the more our   actions will be confidence-inspiring, which will increase the magnitude of any benefits   Now, in terms of considering the benefits and costs of an additional LSAP program today   as compared with a few months ago, I’d say the evidence in favor of the benefits has become a   lot more compelling, because we’ve essentially run a test over the last six weeks as the market   has gone from pricing in a very low probability of LSAPs to pricing in a much higher probability   of LSAPs  What has happened over that period of time?  Financial conditions have become   much more accommodative, bond yields are down, equity prices are up, and the dollar has been   slightly weakened  Also, inflation expectations have risen, which was actually quite helpful,   because it reversed the earlier decline we saw during the summer when deflation risks were   becoming a more prevalent fear in the market   The Tealbook underscores this by pointing out that the unconstrained federal funds rate   now, given the expectation of the LSAP program, is actually a little bit higher than it was in the   prior LSAP  So the Tealbook is basically saying this is a substitute for further cuts in short-term   interest rates, which we can’t do because of the zero lower bound   In terms of the issue of continuous adjustment versus “shock and awe,” I favor providing   the most clarity we can to market participants while, at the same time, retaining some discretion   to increase or reduce the program size as the economic outlook changes going forward  I view   the $600 billion figure in alternative B to be the amount that we are highly likely to want to do,   so that the threshold for rolling it back is significantly higher than the one for doing more  I   November 2–3, 2010 194 of 238             think it’s preferable to communicate this bigger figure to the market; if we were not to do so, we   would create, I think, unnecessary uncertainty about our future actions  Since the LSAP program   is mostly about stock effects rather than flow effects, introducing more conditionality than   necessary would just undercut the power of this action to ease financial market conditions, which   is what we’re seeking to encourage  Doing it this way also gives us the benefit of allowing us to   take a little break for several meetings to see how things are evolving, so we actually have some   time to judge how the program is working and whether the costs and benefits are still in the   direction that we currently anticipate   I have two final points  First, I’d like to keep the door open to changing the type of   securities purchases, should market conditions change significantly  If, for example, agency   MBS spreads were to widen significantly, then I think we should keep an open mind about the   wisdom of shifting a portion of future purchases from Treasuries into agency MBS  No one has   mentioned that, and I’m not saying that I think it’s likely that we’re going to want to do it—I just   wouldn’t want to rule it out categorically   Second, I think we need to be very clear about our expectations of what this LSAP   program is going to do  This is not a panacea, and I think we need to communicate that clearly   to market participants  I’d really expect today’s announcement to have very small effects on   markets  Brian and I have a little bet on whether the market is going to react slightly positively   or slightly negatively to this announcement  But the emphasis is on the word “slightly”  It’s   already priced in to a very large degree, so this is not going to be a big surprise, and we shouldn’t   judge the success of the program by what the markets do today—we should judge the success of   the program by what the markets have done over the last six weeks or so   November 2–3, 2010 195 of 238             In terms of language, I think there’s a pretty strong consensus for substituting   “disappointingly” or “too” for “unacceptably” in alternative B  I’m not a fan of moving A4 into   B4, just because I think it wouldn’t do very much  I think the markets already have an   expectation of mid-2012, and I think it just creates one more moving part that makes it a little bit   more difficult to explain and interpret  So, at this meeting, I’d favor doing one major change   rather than two  I don’t like “up to”  I think we’re highly likely to do $600 billion, and putting   in “up to” qualifies that more than I feel is appropriate  Thank you, Mr Chairman    You could say “such as”    You could qualify it with the words “such as”    I think, in particular, the sentence does that    I’m where the Chairman is    I’d like to make one point about the 35 percent limit    That’s being driven not by the Desk actions, but by what people are actually offering  And so I   think it is really important that we understand it’s not the Desk actively seeking to drive the level   of securities up, but it’s the offerings of securities that happen to be cheap relative to other   securities in the market    There are also the FAQs that will provide more nuance  "
9122,2010-12-14,"  Our exposures are very short term, though, right?    Well, there is a cost whenever official institutions start   to pull back, because they can send adverse signals  So I think you want to make sure that you   do that after full consideration    Does the ECB have a preference in terms of the length   of extension?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I generally agree with the   sentiment that has been expressed around the table, namely, that the US recovery is picking up   some momentum and that activity will also be supported next year by the likely shift in fiscal   policy, so that the expansion does appear to be more sustainable and the downside risks do seem   to have fallen a bit  The anecdotal reports that we’ve been getting from both bankers and   retailers are encouraging, and they suggest that credit availability continues to improve and that   households are more willing to open up their wallets  That, of course, was borne out by today’s   retail sales report   However, I think we should be careful about not counting our chickens before they hatch   for a couple of reasons  First, as others have noted, we’re actually further away from our dual   mandate now than we were at the last meeting, with a higher unemployment rate and a lower   underlying trend for inflation, not just today, but, as President Rosengren pointed out,   prospectively as well  Second, there are still plenty of risks out there that could impair economic   growth  As David Stockton mentioned, the housing sector is under significant pressure, and   most house-price indexes are showing renewed weakness  Nearly 25 percent of those   households with residential mortgages are under water; that is, the mortgage debt currently owed   exceeds the current value of the home  This widespread prevalence of negative equity increases   December 14, 2010 55 of 127             the likelihood of so-called strategic defaults by households  Some recent work by Fannie Mae   shows how serious an issue this could be  For households with underwater mortgages that are   delinquent 60 days or more, the fraction of strategic defaulters is larger for those with higher   FICO scores, not lower FICO scores  This finding indicates the vulnerability of housing to   strategic default  So the fact that tougher underwriting standards have led to higher FICO scores   among recent vintages of borrowers doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re protected in this regard   Also, there are still considerable risks to the macroeconomy stemming from   developments in the financial sector  Nathan Sheets laid out the issues in Europe very, very   well  To my mind, the European authorities have not yet taken steps to provide clarity about   what happens in 2013 when the funding from the EFSF expires and the peripheral countries will   need to regain their access to private markets, nor have they created a firewall around Spain  I   think, really, those two steps may ultimately be necessary to stabilize the situation  The major   issue in Europe, of course, is the question of who is going to bear the adjustment burdens  Is it   the ECB or the EU governments?  Is it the citizens of the weak peripheral countries?  Or is it the   holders of the bank and sovereign debt?  I think that’s what’s making this crisis very, very   complicated in terms of how it plays out  It suggests to me that the crisis will likely continue to   intensify over time in a very irregular manner, with the required political and fiscal responses   taking place only after sufficient market turmoil forces the necessary compromises  This, of   course, is very dangerous for two reasons  First, the amount of distress is unlikely to be   independent of the timing of the interventions—dawdling is likely to lead to worse outcomes   than earlier intervention  Second, in the middle of the crisis, it’s hard to reach good decisions,   and there’s greater risk of mistakes and political miscalculation  To date, the spillover to the   US outlook from Europe has been very limited  However, we can’t rule out the possibility that   December 14, 2010 56 of 127             developments in Europe could deteriorate, and we could have a wider flight from risk, or that   developments in Europe could put renewed pressure on our own financial institutions   The second important risk worth attention emerges from the municipal bond market    Many people, when asked about systemic risk, put the municipal sector high on their list  This   has gotten some more attention in recent weeks, as we’ve seen a very sharp rise in municipal   bond yields  But this seems to be mostly about higher supply—actual and prospective—rather   than about investor flight  The failure of the Congress to extend the Build America Bond   program is leading to lots of this issuance before the program expires at the end of the year  The   demise of this program also implies that the supply of traditional long-dated tax-exempt   securities is likely to increase substantially next year  Because tax-exempt yields are driven   mainly by appetite from the household sector, supply changes have typically had outsized   impacts on relative yields in this market compared to other markets, such as the Treasury market    Although the rise in yield appears to be due mainly to supply effects, this doesn’t mean the   market is safe from other nasty surprises  In fact, by focusing more attention on the municipal   bond market, I think the backup in yields makes the market more sensitive to adverse credit   events, should those develop    Finally, I want to return to something that I’ve been talking about for several months—  the potential for credit rating downgrades of major US financial institutions as the credit rating   agencies think about the reduction in government support caused by the Dodd-Frank Act  This   actually seems to have taken a turn in a more positive direction  Yesterday, apparently, Standard   & Poor’s told at least two major firms that their stand-alone ratings would be upgraded by one   notch  This means that, if S&P subsequently reduces the government support by a notch, the   December 14, 2010 57 of 127             firms end up at the same place, and that’s important, because ending up in the same place means   they would not have their short-term debt ratings downgraded to nonprime   S&P also said that it is going to defer any decisions about how the Dodd-Frank Act   affects the uplift to ratings from the government until January  So the news is not settled yet    It’s unclear whether S&P will treat all the major firms in the same fashion  But at least in the   last 24 hours it has taken a turn in a more positive direction  So there seems to be somewhat less   risk that we’ll be in a situation where a large securities firm has a short-term credit rating below   prime  That’s something that makes me nervous, because no investment bank has been able to   operate successfully for any extended period of time with a nonprime short-term rating  So   we’re not out of the woods yet, but things look a little bit better  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I’m not sure what to make of that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m glad to see that Richard   and I are on the same page today, just as we were when we were children  [Laughter]    I do want to talk about how we communicate as a group   to the market and the public  I think we’ve done a very poor job relative to what we’re capable   of, and I think that judgment is borne out in a number of ways  One way is the low score we   received in the recent primary dealer survey conducted by the Desk, even though the survey and   its comments said the Chairman did a very good job on 60 Minutes  That was cited by a number   of the respondents   It is not helpful for opponents of any policy we embark on, whether asset purchases or   other actions, to criticize the policy in public in harsh terms as soon as possible after an FOMC   meeting is over  I really do think there are right ways and wrong ways to disagree  I think   dissent is completely appropriate, and I’m not trying to discourage that  I think the right way is   to say that reasonable people may disagree, but this is the decision made by the Committee  This   is why the Committee is doing what it’s doing, and here’s how the Committee expects this   particular policy action is likely to work in practice   I think the wrong way is to paint the consequences of the decision in more apocalyptic   terms and/or to create doubts and fan fears about the ability and/or will of the FOMC to execute   policy successfully  In my opinion, some of the most recent comments we’ve seen have   undermined the effectiveness of the most recent round of LSAPs  I say this not only because of   our poor communications score, but also because the evidence suggests that a good portion of the   backup in bond yields is due to a higher risk premium  When I ask myself how the higher risk   premium got there, obviously it was the critique of the Fed by outside observers, but I think we   also did a little bit of that to ourselves  I think the higher risk premium stems from uncertainty   about our commitment to the program—in other words, would we be cowed by the criticism—  and thereby represents a loss of credibility on our part   December 14, 2010 106 of 127             That being said, it isn’t the only reason that bond yields have risen  I think there are lots   of other reasons, and they’ve been talked about this morning  First, expectations going into the   last meeting were for a somewhat larger program than what we actually initiated  Second,   Treasury supplies likely increased due to the shift in fiscal policy, so the net supply held by the   public is going to go up relative to what the public expected  And, third, the economy looks like   it’s on a more solid growth track  So these three factors all interact  More stimulative fiscal   policy implies faster growth, and it implies more net supply, as well as a smaller expected LSAP   program   Overall my policy view hasn’t changed  The LSAP program still makes sense, and it’s   helping at the margin  We have damaged its effectiveness to some degree  I think it’s important   in reaching this conclusion to note that some of the primary risks of the asset purchase program,   such as dislodging inflation expectations to the upside or causing a free fall in the dollar, have   not materialized in any way  Instead, the dollar has been strengthening, and the increase that   we’ve seen in the yields have occurred entirely in real rates rather than in break-even inflation   rates, at least as we measure them from November to today  So I’m with pretty much everybody   else, not quite everyone, in supporting alternative B  I think we want to have a “low drama”   meeting as Governor Duke said  So I don’t mind playing possum either  I think the small   changes contemplated in alternative B are right  They acknowledge some of the intermeeting   data  We still have a long way to go in terms of our dual mandate   A very accommodative policy stance to me is still fully appropriate  Any retreat from our   LSAP program at this juncture I would view as disastrous, not just because yields would back up   further, tightening financial conditions, but also because such a shift would significantly   undercut our credibility  We would be viewed as weak and as intimidated by outside criticism   December 14, 2010 107 of 127             and political pressure, and that would be, I think, devastating to this institution  To my mind,   this would cause our independence and our will to keep inflation in check over the longer term to   be questioned  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9146,2011-01-25,"  I wanted to introduce Julie Remache, who is sitting next   to Brian Sack  This is her first time at an FOMC meeting  Welcome, Julie    In essence, we’re buying the bonds that people don’t   want, as opposed to buying the bonds that they really want to hold    I have a quick question  How should you think about   the asset sales piece, because that’s different from the interest rate path?  The interest rate path,   January 25–26, 2011 58 of 282              presumably, reflects the pursuit of our dual mandate and the financial markets’ reactions to the   economic environment  The asset sales piece is, in some ways, discretionary—we could do it or   not do it, and we could do it quickly or do it slowly  How do you think about that when you’re   doing this analysis?    It is not completely invariant to the losses you realize,   because there’s a term premium that you earn if you hold it until maturity and that you don’t earn   if you sell the asset early    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions on   fiscal policy  First, in exhibit 3, I was a little surprised to see the state and local government   showing a positive fiscal impulse this year  It didn’t track all the articles I’ve been reading about   big imbalances and layoffs, so I’d just like to understand what the source of that is   My second question is on the payroll tax holiday at the federal level  How do you see   that working through the economy in terms of the data?  Are people going to smooth that out, or   January 25–26, 2011 83 of 282              could it show up in the first quarter as an outsized effect, since this is going to be concentrated   there?    I was worried that it might be hard to read the numbers   over the next couple of months, because if you get strong consumption, you’re not going to be   sure if that’s just a temporary factor or not    And the pressures could come from the spending side    They could be spending on pensions and health care    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, speaking for myself, I   have a very inelastic demand for cotton, and I don’t see any leisure suits in my future, regardless   of what happens to cotton prices  [Laughter]   I think we all agree that the economy has regained some forward momentum  It is now   on more solid footing, and the prospects for a virtuous circle have improved  In other words,   faster final demand growth stimulates more rapid employment and income gains, which, in turn,   provides further support for household and business spending   At the same time, I wouldn’t get too excited about all of this  The pace of economic   growth is still pretty tepid relative to the depth and duration of the recession that preceded it    And while the labor market is improving, the rate of private-sector job creation has not yet been   sufficient to push down the unemployment rate in a sustained manner  Even if we were to start   to see more sizable employment gains, I think we should be inclined to let that run for a while,   given the amount of slack that currently exists in the labor market  This is going to necessitate   some patience on our part  I think policy should remain accommodative long after economic   growth picks up to a more robust pace   In terms of the debate about the level of NAIRU, I thought the staff papers were   excellent, and what I took away from it is that NAIRU probably is somewhat higher than it was   before, due to the extended unemployment compensation benefits and increased mismatch  But I   think it’s important to stress that the effect of the extended unemployment compensation benefits   is almost certainly going to be temporary rather than permanent, so I’m not sure that it’s that   January 25–26, 2011 122 of 282              relevant over the longer term, and there is, as the papers point out, a cyclical component to   mismatch  More importantly, we probably shouldn’t spend too much effort trying to fine-tune   our estimates of NAIRU today  Whatever it is today, it’s likely far below the actual   unemployment rate  Thus, in my view, the mostly modest differences that we have in our point   estimates shouldn’t have substantial implications for monetary policy currently  Moreover, it’s   important to emphasize that we will be able to fine-tune these estimates once we see how   compensation and unit labor costs respond to faster economic growth and to the drop in the   unemployment rate, which, I hope, will take place this year   On the inflation side, I think the big story in the news is the continuing rise in commodity   prices, which is lifting headline inflation above core inflation  However, I think it’s important   not to overreact to this development either  The pass-through of commodity price pressures into   core inflation has typically been very limited in the United States, and headline inflation is still   below nearly all participants’ estimates of the inflation rate consistent with the FOMC’s dual   mandate  Moreover, underlying pressures outside of commodities are still very subdued  I   would note that unit labor costs are still declining on a year-over-year basis, and profit margins   are elevated relative to historical norms at this stage of the business cycle   One area that I do think we have to keep our eye on is inflation expectations  Five-year,   five-year forward TIPS measures are at acceptable levels, and survey measures still don’t show   any meaningful increase in longer-term inflation expectations  But if we did get a significant   increase from here, that would be a concern  To my mind, at this stage of the business cycle, and   given the amount of excess slack in the economy, it would be a rise in inflation expectations that   would be the most likely way that we’d get a sustained upturn in actual inflation   January 25–26, 2011 123 of 282              Therefore, I think we have to be mindful of our own role in influencing inflation   expectations through how and what we communicate to market participants  I think we need to   emphasize our ability to exit smoothly from our enlarged balance sheet when the time comes,   even if that time lies far off into the future  And we have to emphasize our commitment to do so    I think we need to be very clear in our communications about why we’re keeping monetary   conditions very accommodative—that is, because we’re so far away from our dual mandate  But   we also need to emphasize that our keeping conditions accommodative today does not   compromise our commitment to keep inflation contained over the longer term   In terms of financial stability risks to the outlook, let me just discuss two areas briefly—  Europe, and state and local government finances  With respect to Europe, I believe that the   “muddle through” course continues to remain the most likely outcome  The leadership of the   core European countries is fully committed to the euro  This means that, if expansion in the   capacity of the EFSF is required, it eventually will be forthcoming  But the road is likely to be   bumpy, because this is a very complex bargaining game that makes it difficult politically for the   necessary aid to be extended before it’s absolutely needed  Right now, we seem to be in a sort of   a peculiar place  Market participants expect the resources will be supplied to protect Spain, but,   because of these expectations, market conditions are generally stable, and this means that the   policymakers aren’t under much pressure to provide this backing immediately   In terms of state and local government finances, the rise in municipal bond yields has   sparked much discussion of credit risk  However, I think the increase in yields is at least as   much due to a shift in the demand–supply balance as it is to a fundamental deterioration in debt   funding capacity  The demand from the household sector has cooled as poor mutual fund   performance had led to outflows from municipal bond funds  In response, yields have had to   January 25–26, 2011 124 of 282              back up sufficiently to attract so-called crossover investors, such as insurance companies, taxable   income funds, and hedge funds  And although many states have large deficit holes to fill this   year, the aggregate amount of the shortfall is actually not that big  If you sum it across all of the   states, it looks to be about roughly 1 percent of GDP  The much bigger problem for states and   localities is really the longer-term unfunded commitments for pension and health care retirement   benefits  This may ultimately lead to a hard landing, but I don’t see that happening this year   Finally, the debt ceiling could become an issue this spring  I know this usually turns out   to be just theater, but it does strike me that there’s more capacity for mischief here than usual    Apparently, some members of the Congress are discussing how payments can be prioritized, so   that the impact of a binding debt ceiling would constrain discretionary spending but would allow   payment on Treasury debt to continue  If we really go down that path, it would imply that the   debt ceiling could be pretty messy  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  In   terms of language, I think it’s okay to be a little cautious in terms of upgrading our economic   outlook, as Governor Warsh suggested; if the news comes in good, then we can upgrade the   outlook in the future, and I don’t see any reason to race ahead right now   In terms of the rest of the language in B, I think we should make the fewest changes   possible  I don’t see any reason to disturb the expectations that the market has that we’re likely   to do $600 billion of large-scale asset purchases  So I would not include the language about the   $80 billion  I just think that adds complication and detail that’s not really necessary, and I don’t   think Brian thinks that’s necessary or helpful    And as far as the language about “will” or “continued,” I   think it’s just better to leave well enough alone  I just think there’s no reason for change  If we   make the change, people are going to be confused about why we’re making the change  If the   meaning is almost the same, what’s the point of making that small adjustment?   In general, I just want to add two other thoughts  I think we are a little bit at risk of   getting ahead of ourselves here in the whole discussion about where we’re going  If I remember   correctly, there was a lot of excitement last winter about improvement in the economic outlook,   and we shifted our focus away from other means we could take to make monetary policy more   accommodative and shifted it toward exit, and that turned out to be premature  So I think we   have to remember that we haven’t gotten that much good data for that long  We’re very far away   from full employment, so I think a little bit of patience is appropriate   I think that’s also important in terms of our communications because we don’t want to   give people the sense that we’re itching to exit just for the sake of exiting  If we were to do that,   it would cause people to tighten financial conditions, and that could actually potentially harm the   economic growth outlook  Obviously, if the inflation news turns worse, and if the economy is   growing very robustly, then, of course, it’s appropriate to change  But I think it’s very important   not to get ahead of ourselves; we actually need to see economic information that warrants a   change in policy   Finally, let me thank the staff for all their efforts preparing the material on the SOMA net   income and the different environments for interest rates and the asset sale program  I thought   that was very useful for understanding the risks  But I would emphasize that I consider these   issues very secondary to the policy objectives of achieving our dual mandate  In fact, I’d be   quite happy if we had a very strong and sustained expansion that led us to tighten monetary   January 25–26, 2011 188 of 282              policy and that resulted in a sharp decline in our net interest income  In that case we’d obviously   be a lot closer to achieving our dual mandate, but also the revenue-generating effects of a strong   recovery would almost certainly overwhelm the effect of a drop in Federal Reserve remittances   to the Treasury  The goal here is not to maximize the Federal Reserve’s remittances to the   Treasury    It’s a little weird to take it out, given that it’s still very   weak and that it was in the last statement    No, but I’m saying that in the December statement we   had, “while investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak”  To take that out   implies that somehow that’s no longer the case  And that hasn’t changed    Another option is to change the phrase “the economic   recovery is continuing”  Instead, we could say something like “the economic recovery has   strengthened somewhat”     No, you could just say “and the growth rate is still not   sufficient…”    I would say “has strengthened somewhat”    It is just a question of where you want to put it on the   dial    You could say “appears to have strengthened”    That was Governor Warsh’s strategy    That’s a good summary of it    I think it’s highly unlikely, though, that we would want   to do that    How about during lunch?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with Jeff on the   communications  We don’t want to make it look like we are trying to clamp everything down    In fact, we want to frame it so that we’re actually opening things up and communicating to   people in a fair, transparent way, so that everyone has equal access to the information   It seems to me there are two broad guidelines that we’re trying to conform to  One is not   to communicate material, non-public information to privileged parties; we want to avoid that at   all costs  Included in that material, non-public information would be, of course, any talk about   what happened at the FOMC meeting, because that is material and it is non-public; for example,   one wouldn’t talk about what someone said at the FOMC meeting  I don’t know that we have to   define each of those little pieces, and, instead, if we use the category “material, non-public   information,” I think we all know what that is and can make judgments about that   The second broad guideline is a bit more difficult—we shouldn’t participate in any forum   or meeting that provides a commercial benefit to that party  This is particularly relevant to   accepting speaking engagements  Therefore, for example, I shouldn’t go speak at Goldman   Sachs and talk to their clients  And I would never do this in a million years, believe me, and the   reason is that Goldman Sachs benefits from that  I’ll give you an example of how far this can go    I had a phone call from someone that used to be my boss who wanted me to give him a reference   to another financial firm, and I refused, because I felt that if I gave him a positive reference,   which he probably deserved, I was generating a commercial advantage for that person  So we   don’t want to do anything that provides a commercial advantage to a party   Now, the reason why this gets tricky is that it’s hard to say where it ends  Speaking at a   financial firm for its clients is obviously out  Speaking at an advisory firm for its clients or that   January 25–26, 2011 218 of 282              is going to use the information somehow, is obviously out  But how about a university?  I gave   the commencement address at New College  Well, it’s probably beneficial to New College to   have me as their commencement speaker, and that is probably creating some commercial   advantage to them  So does that mean I can’t be the commencement speaker at New College?    Here’s another tricky example  Let’s say you’re going to meet with the board of directors of one   of the banks in your District  Well, it’s good for that firm to have that contact—it probably   makes the board of directors feel better about being on that bank’s board  I think that’s probably   okay, but there’s a gradation of cases, and I think it’s very hard to draw the line precisely at the   point where the commercial advantage is significant enough that it’s out of bounds  One that’s   clearly out of bounds is talking to a firm that’s a Fed watcher—that person you spoke to is going   to take that information and sell it for profit   I think the principle is clear, but exactly how far down you go is a little bit more difficult    Maybe we can specify examples that are very clearly out of bounds, specify gray areas, and then   specify some things that we think are acceptable, say, doing a speech for a nonprofit   organization    Trade organizations    Well, that’s an interesting question—for a university, for   example    I don’t know   January 25–26, 2011 219 of 282               Remember that you’re not disclosing material, non-  public information  There are two separate things here  But I think this is tricky  I think the   education one is the particular one that we need to spend a little bit of attention on   Let me just make a few other points  I actually am in favor of reporting all meetings  I   think this is just a transparency thing  If you don’t report them, then people are always going to   be suspicious of whom you’re meeting with, and if we’re all doing the right thing and meeting   with the right people, then we shouldn’t be embarrassed by whom we’re meeting with  I just   don’t think it’s that big a deal to report it   I think it’s useful, as others have said, to have a third party in attendance when possible,   be it someone from research, communications, or the executive office  That provides protection   if you ever get into a “he said, she said” situation, because the third party can actually repudiate   what the person reported you said if you didn’t actually say it   I would prefer to have a formal policy, even though the formal policy may just be these   high-level principles  It seems to me that we want to have something written down  I’d much   rather tell the Congress that I have a formal policy than an informal policy  How could I justify   saying, “Oh, we just have an informal policy about how we communicate”?  I think that would   be hard to defend   Finally, on the staff issue, this is a red herring, in my opinion  Speaking for the New   York Fed, we went through the crisis for years and dealt with all sorts of special stuff  As far as   I’m concerned, nothing ever leaked from anybody  So I don’t think it’s a staff issue  I really   think that’s off point  I think it is about us, how we behave, how we talk  I don’t think the staff   is the problem  I really, really don’t   January 25–26, 2011 220 of 282               A written record of whom you met with would be part of   that formal process, right?    Regarding what particular things?  "
9176,2011-03-15,"  I should point out that there is probably a bit of   overoptimism in the analyst estimates  If you look at their earnings forecasts over time, they   tend to be optimistic in terms of what earnings actually occur  So that probably causes that   equity risk premium measure to be biased upward a bit    Nathan, I wish you the best of luck in your search    [Laughter]    Let me put it this way  If there was an easy solution to   be found—the private sector has hundreds of people that have searched everything to find it  So   you have to be skeptical that there’s a better way    I feel like I am going to be the proverbial two-armed   economist today  On the one hand, even though real GDP in the first quarter looks to be   somewhat weaker than we expected a month ago, I think you could also say that the growth   outlook remains considerably better than where we were last summer  In particular, we look   closer to a virtuous circle in which rising demand boosts employment and income, which lifts   confidence and spurs further gains in demand  I think the improvement in labor market   conditions is particularly important in this regard  But on the other hand, there are two big new   developments on the supply side that give one pause about being too optimistic about both the   growth and the inflation outlook  The first risk, of course, is that oil supply disruptions lead to a   further increase in oil prices  The good news is that Saudi Arabia still has considerable excess   capacity and has indicated a willingness to use it  The bad news with respect to the oil price   outlook is the high level of uncertainty and the likelihood that the tails are fat  I find it very hard   March 15, 2011 65 of 165              to be confident about what is going to happen next  Is this a temporary upward blip that will be   reversed as soon as the Saudi oil production fills the gap?  Or is this just the early stage of a   much more substantial shock as political instability spreads?  Even in the more benign scenarios,   as the Saudis pump more oil and their excess capacity shrinks, there will be less room to absorb   other shocks  For example, what is happening to the Japanese nuclear electricity generation   capacity is another shock  And, of course, if Saudi oil production itself were to be disrupted for   any reason, then we would be in a very tough spot   Similarly, on the inflation side of the ledger, on the one hand, price pressures remain   muted outside of commodities, and wage trends remain soft  But on the other hand, I am   becoming more worried that inflation expectations could become unhinged  There are four   factors that are causing a little more anxiety on my part  First, the commodity price pressures   that are already in train are likely to push headline inflation, as measured by the PCE index,   above 2½ percent on a year-over-year basis by the middle of this year  Although this increase   will likely prove temporary, I think it still could, nevertheless, have consequences for our   credibility, especially if other countries are responding to similar pressures by tightening their   own monetary policies   Second, consumers, as I found out in Queens last week, generally believe that prices are   rising considerably more quickly than inflation statistics  [Laughter]  People see higher prices   every day when they go to the grocery store or the gas station, so even though we rely on the   reported inflation statistics, the beliefs of the average consumer are quite different  And I think   that’s potentially important for our credibility as well   Third, we already see some updrift in inflation expectations  Although the TIPS five-  year, five-year forward measure has increased only very modestly, the most recent reading of the   March 15, 2011 66 of 165              University of Michigan consumer inflation expectations is more disturbing  I could take a little   bit of consolation from the notion that some of this always happens when there is a big increase   in gas prices that shows up in the 1-year measure, but then some of it drifts into the 5-to-10-year   measure  But it is a pretty big increase; it is the highest level since August 2008  In New York,   we run a separate survey; our longer-term measure, which is a 2-to-3-year forward inflation   expectations measure, has also drifted up, but not quite as much as the Michigan survey  In that   survey, consumers are also showing more uncertainty about what inflation is going to be in   future years   The fourth consideration is that this is all happening at a time that we are doing monetary   policy in a very different way, where our balance sheet has expanded very sharply  Even though   I think the interest on excess reserves is a tool that will be completely sufficient to keep inflation   in check, there are people who are much less confident that that tool will work  So our enlarged   balance sheet I also think is a factor that potentially threatens to undermine our credibility, even   if we are actually right that the IOER is sufficient  I think that points to us doing a better job to   educate people about our ability and determination to use the IOER rate when the time comes to   restrain credit demand  I think we can do a better job on that front, actually, making the case that   we have the tools, because we have not completely solved that problem yet   Another risk area that Nathan touched on is what is going on in Europe  The euro   sovereign debt/banking crisis isn’t over by a long shot yet  I think on the positive side of the   ledger, as Nathan pointed out, the EFSF has been bolstered  I think another positive is that Spain   has made some progress in differentiating itself from some of the more troubled European   sovereigns  In Europe, we hosted a luncheon on Friday for the Spanish minister of finance and   the governor of the central bank, the Bank of Spain  We brought in a bunch of investors, and I   March 15, 2011 67 of 165              think the officials made a pretty good case that Spain is different from the other peripheral   countries  For example, they pointed out that this debate about how much money the cajas need   is not really that interesting, because even if they need €50 billion as opposed to €15 billion,   that’s still well within the capacity of the Spanish government to supply  Second, they pointed   out that Spain is actually doing pretty well competitively  They haven’t lost any market share in   international goods markets, and the country has begun to tackle some of the tough structural   problems in terms of their labor market  So that is the good news   On the side that is not so good, while the financing agreement helps strengthen the   financing mechanism, I think a number of things have actually taken a turn in the wrong   direction  The first thing that has gone in the wrong direction in Europe is that the political   support among voters in the core countries, to provide aid to the peripheral countries to finance   their ongoing deficits and refinance maturing debt, seems to be eroding at the same time the   willingness of the peripheral countries’ citizens to countenance further belt tightening is waning    So we run a risk that we are going to soon get to the point where the leadership on both sides that   want agreement can’t deliver politically what they need to do in terms of what they want to see   happen  I thought it was noteworthy that the new Irish government refused to commit to raise   the corporate income tax rate in Ireland in exchange for a 1 percentage point reduction in the   financing costs of their rescue package  That told me that positions are starting to harden   Second, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the debts of some of the peripheral   countries will need to be restructured  This creates a bit of a Hobson’s choice  On the one hand,   failure to move forward on that front in terms of restructuring makes the outlook more murky,   and makes it impossible for these countries to begin to tap the markets on their own again on   reasonable terms  On the other hand, moving forward with restructuring puts increased pressure   March 15, 2011 68 of 165              on the banks throughout Europe that have large exposures to these peripheral sovereigns  So   they are in a very difficult spot   Third, there is the risk that the current round of European stress tests will not be imposed   in a way that resolves whether the core banks have sufficient capital  Remember, last summer   there were stress tests, and those ultimately lacked credibility, because the Irish banks passed the   stress tests, and then several months later they were in a great deal of difficulty  A couple of   problems have been raised about the stress tests that they are planning to conduct  The first is   that they are going to use national definitions of Tier 1 capital that differ quite a bit, rather than a   common Tier 1 standard  Also, the press reports that I have read also suggest that the sovereign   debt stress that is going to be assumed is not very severe  In fact, it may at times be less stress   than what is currently implied by the 10-year government bond yields in some of the peripheral   countries  So it’s hard to take a stress test very seriously if it’s not more stressful than the yields   you actually see in the markets today   And fourth, the market anticipates the ECB will be beginning a tightening cycle at the   April meeting  I think that action is going to underscore the growing gap between the optimal   policy for the core countries, such as Germany, which I think is actually pretty close to full   employment versus the peripheral countries in which economic activity is contracting and slack   is actually growing   At the end of the day, I continue to think that they will muddle through in the end,   because I think the commitment of the political leadership in the core countries to Europe is   intact  But I think it is going to be very messy    Would you read the proposed change?    It’s still a subdued trend, though  It’s a trend, as   opposed to a recent movement    Okay  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before I talk about   the choices for this meeting, I just want to talk briefly about the risks in terms of higher inflation   expectations for our choices over the medium term   In the economic go-round, I raised my concerns that longer-term inflation expectations   could become unhinged, and that would obviously be problematic in terms of inflation  But I   want to stress here that I also worry about the other side of the equation, that premature   tightening could wrack a recovery that is still fragile  In this regard, the US experience in 1937   is quite instructive  Commodity prices were rising quickly then, wholesale inflation was   climbing noticeably, and even consumer prices were rising despite a tremendous amount of slack   in the economy  What happened in 1937 is that Federal Reserve officials changed their   communication strategy and began emphasizing the risks of higher inflation, and they also raised   reserve requirements  What happened was that the US economy quickly fell back into   recession  So we should be concerned about inflation expectations and the risks that could add   to inflation, but we really should understand that it is a two-sided risk   March 15, 2011 121 of 165              With that said, for the time being, my preference is to be as patient as we can be and to   work as hard as we can through our communications to try to keep inflation expectations well   anchored  Some of this we can control through our communications; some of it we can’t control    But we should do the things we can do to keep inflation expectations well anchored by how we   communicate with the market   In terms of today’s decision, I would support alternative B  I think it accomplishes what   we want to do  It recognizes the improvement in the outlook  It makes it clear that we do not   expect commodity price pressures to feed through to underlying inflation  And I think it makes   no changes, as written, in terms of our policy message   There is no question in my mind at this point that we should complete our $600 billion   Treasury purchase program, because it is helping to achieve our objectives  I don’t think it’s   necessary to taper purchases as we come to the end of the program  I don’t think there’s any   likely substantive benefit  Market participants do not expect tapering  So I think that putting it   in would just create questions about what we are up to, as opposed to actually accomplishing   anything constructive   I would not insert the “$80 billion a month” phrase for the same reasons that we didn’t   insert it last time  It would needlessly create uncertainty about why we put it back in   In terms of the other changes, I am happy with the Kocherlakota change and the Williams   change  As for President Fisher’s change—I’m perfectly comfortable living with   “unemployment” as opposed to “unemployment rate”     “Trend” “low” is a funny construction    I’m not sure, but—    I think it’s fine the way it’s written    I think “transitory” is a little better    I want to observe that before doing this, I would imagine   we will be more inclined to change the statement when the Chairman is about to give a press   conference, because he will be there to be able to explain it very quickly  So it may actually free   up the statement a little bit compared to what it is right now, where we are very hesitant to   change the statement, because we’re always worried about how people will interpret it  This   would probably mitigate that issue a little bit    It helps lower the temperature level    As late as possible so that you could actually get it out   before the bond markets close    There is a compromise  By extending the blackout a   little bit longer, through the end of Thursday, there’s a quiet day  So the Chairman speaks,   there’s a quiet day, and then on Friday people can speak  Friday is not a great day to go out   because you don’t get that much coverage as you go into the weekend  So if people need to   speak on Friday, they can  So that might be a way of balancing those two things   I think it would be useful to have a little gap between the Chairman and other people   because you don’t want to get into “he said/she said” kind of stuff  So separating it by a full day   might be helpful that way    Why not?    That would be nice    So we should assume the April meeting starts at noon?  "
9200,2011-04-26,"  You’d be going from minus 4 to 24 basis points    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My preferences pretty much   track option 1  First, I prefer to start with ending the reinvestment of agency debt and agency   MBS  While I agree with President Kocherlakota’s point on the pro-cyclicality of agency MBS,   and because I made that point last August—[laughter]—I would point out a couple of important   caveats that I think make it less important right now  One, the amount of prepayments is actually   quite low today  Two, if we are actually tightening and long-term rates are going up, then the   prepayments will drop even further  We won’t be in that range of where the pro-cyclicality is   very powerful  And, three, if the economy is strengthening and housing turnover picks up, the   April 26–27, 2011 69 of 244              pro-cyclicality will actually go the other way  We will get more housing turnover, and there will   be more churn in the agency MBS market from a healthier housing market  So I am willing to   accept what I would view as more limited pro-cyclicality in exchange for wanting to shrink the   balance sheet  Second, I would end the Treasury reinvestment  And third, I would eliminate the   “extended period” language   Now, whether you do these as a package or you do them in a sequence, I think it really   depends on economic conditions at the time  I really don’t want to prejudge whether we do all   three together, or whether we do one and then the other and then the other  It depends on why   we are tightening monetary policy  I can imagine if we were tightening monetary policy because   inflation expectations were rising, we might want to do it in a more subdued sequence  But if we   saw that the economy that was very strong, we might want to do it all together as a package   Second, I’d drain a large quantity of reserves  I don’t think this is absolutely necessary   for the conduct of monetary policy, but to the extent that people are worried about the large   quantity of the reserves in the banking system and that this could lead to an inflationary problem,   we should take steps to attenuate those concerns   Third, I would raise the interest rate on excess reserves  I do believe this tool is sufficient   to manage monetary policy  The signal I take away from the change in the deposit insurance   premiums and its impact on the IOER–fed funds rate spreads is that the arbitrage works pretty   efficiently because we had a little test case here where we basically changed the arbitrage   conditions slightly, and we had a slight impact on the IOER–fed funds rate spread in a way that   was pretty predictable  So this tells me that I think the arbitrage is going to work pretty well    We’ll see a federal funds rate that is modestly below the interest rate on excess reserves   April 26–27, 2011 70 of 244              And then, last, I would sell the agency MBS and agency debt assets, and I would do so at   a measured, predictable pace  I don’t think it’s necessary to sell these assets; I’m less hung up on   the fact that we have agency MBS assets on our balance sheet  But in the medium term, I think   the Committee has a consensus that we want to go back to an all-Treasury portfolio  If you want   to get there in any reasonable time frame, then you are going to have to sell agency MBS   I don’t believe it makes sense for time-varying sales tied to changes in interest on excess   reserves  I think it is too complicated and too difficult to explain  Also, if the sales effect works   through changes in expectations on how fast the stock is likely to change, shifting around the   sales rate will cause changes in people’s views of what the future stock is likely to be  I think   that will create volatility in longer-term rates and might even lead to a higher risk premium and   higher long-term rates as a consequence  So I think that’s a risky strategy   I generally believe that the sales rate should be relatively slow, because faced with a   choice of a flatter yield curve or a steeper yield curve, I would favor a flatter yield curve  The   more you rely on asset sales, the more you are going to steepen the yield curve, which I think   potentially has negative consequences for financial stability  Also, the more asset sales you do,   the more likely you are to incur losses on your portfolio that can create political difficulties for   the Fed and potentially pose a threat to the Fed’s independence  So, on the asset-sales side, I   would like to go relatively slowly  The asset sales pace, of course, could be adjusted, but I think   the bar to adjustments should be pretty high because I don’t think we want to create uncertainty   about what those stock effects are likely to be over time   With respect to question 4, I think that we all agree that we want to go back to a SOMA   portfolio that is no larger than what is consistent with implementing our monetary policy   framework  But we should recognize that that size might be somewhat different, depending on   April 26–27, 2011 71 of 244              whether we are going to a floor system or a corridor system  We might want a slightly bigger   balance sheet if we are headed to a floor system  I think it is premature to decide whether we   want a floor system or a corridor system, because we are going to find out a lot about how well a   floor system works over the next few years  If that system works very well, we might decide that   the simplicity, in terms of how you actually implement a floor system, might make it attractive    So I wouldn’t want to rule it out a priori   I think we should be heading back to an all-Treasury portfolio, but we shouldn’t be   heading back to the same Treasury portfolio we had before  I think we should have a Treasury   portfolio that is much more weighted toward short-term Treasury securities, so that in a crisis   you can just let the Treasury securities run off very quickly—you don’t have to sell Treasury   securities, and you don’t have to worry about whether you are taking losses  At some point, it’s   going to require us to actually buy a bunch of short-dated Treasury securities, if we agree that   that is a good portfolio to have  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Can I respond to that?  I think what you are describing is   an environment where you don’t want to be tightening at all  If you start tightening and then all   of a sudden decide you don’t want to be tightening, then I don’t really have a problem reversing   the agency MBS reinvestment policy    Thank you, Mr Chairman  On the activity today, I think   I share the views of many people around the table that, while activity looks better than last   summer—faster job growth supported by a healthier financial system, and a trade sector that   looks more likely to make a persistent contribution to growth, which I think is very valuable—  it’s disappointing relative to where we were at the last FOMC meeting, with real GDP growth in   the first quarter quite slow and the rebound in the second quarter quite modest   I think what is striking to me is that this is occurring at a time that fiscal and monetary   policy is on very stimulative settings  The state of monetary policy ease will start to moderate if   we complete our large-scale asset purchases, and fiscal policy is going to turn significantly   restrictive in 2012, even in the absence of additional fiscal measures by the Congress  We   calculate that we are on track for fiscal restraint in 2012 of about 1 percent of GDP, which is   pretty sizable if the economy is going into that growing at a 3 percent-plus type of rate   In terms of the first-quarter GDP print, I agree with David Wilcox’s comments, it does   seem to overstate the weakness  The ISM surveys, the industrial production data, the consumer   spending, and the labor market developments all seem more positive than that  So either we will   have upward revisions to the data over time or the production will go into inventories  We’ll just   have to wait and see how that plays out   I do think, though, that there are some significant risks to economic growth posed by   higher energy prices  I note that the magnitude of the increase in the oil bill for households is   roughly comparable in size to the payroll tax cut  The problem is that the payroll tax cut is   April 26–27, 2011 143 of 244              temporary and reverses the beginning of next year, and it’s not clear how long the energy prices   are going to stay elevated   On inflation, I think that there is no great surprise that the higher oil prices are feeding   into headline, and, of course, there’s a little bit of spillover into core  Where I’m maybe a little   bit more concerned than the staff is on inflation expectations  I think you can point to the data   and say, well, they’re still reasonably well anchored in the sense that the University of Michigan   consumer expectations five-year measure has come down in the April survey after going up a lot   in March, and you can point to different measures of five-year, five-year forward TIPS   breakevens showing different things, but I do think there’s quite a bit of risk here if you take a   look at the whole picture  We have very stimulative monetary policy with a large Federal   Reserve balance sheet  We have fiscal policy on an unsustainable path  We have significantly   higher gold prices, significantly higher silver prices  We have a dollar that’s actually weakened   quite a bit over the past few weeks  I think that while you could still argue that inflation   expectations are well anchored, if I worry about what is going to happen next, I think the risks   are very predominantly on the side that they could become less well anchored   In terms of the systemic risks that we face, there are a number of things that are   concerning  Nathan touched on some of them  The European problem is not going away; there   are at least four problems there  First, Greece is lagging behind where they need to be  In other   words, they are not performing up to their commitments, so that means that they need more   resources  Second, the political constraints I discussed at the last meeting are becoming more   binding as core European countries are less willing to provide that additional aid that Greece in   fact needs  Angela Merkel has suffered some political setbacks, and the Finnish elections   showed that those who do not favor aid are gaining political ground  So as a consequence of   April 26–27, 2011 144 of 244              that, some of the German authorities have put restructuring on the table after keeping that very   much off the table for many months  This is not a timely development, because it obviously sets   in place very bad dynamics leading to much higher interest rates in the periphery, lower prices,   and that, of course, just reinforces the likelihood that the restructuring will have to take place  It   also raises the potential needs, because if the Greek debt were restructured, then the Greek banks   would be impaired by a greater margin  So you not only need more money for the Greek   government to continue its operations, but also for the Greek banks to be able to stay in business    It is not at all clear where those resources would come from  And as Nathan pointed out, this all   increases the contagion risk to Ireland, Portugal, and even Spain  Spain up to now has been able   to sail away from the rest of the periphery, but there could be political setbacks in Spain, so I   don’t think that they are out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination  The final problem in   Europe is that there is really no viable exit strategy  The financing mechanism that is supposed   to succeed the EFSF would be a financing mechanism in which the debt issued from that facility   would be senior to the existing debt, so all of the incentives are for private investors to exit  All   this means is that all of the debt of the periphery is now getting concentrated in public hands—  either the ECB directly holding the debt, the ECB financing the debt, or the EFSF funding the   debt  So it’s not really clear how this is going to play out over the medium to longer run   A second issue is Japan  The supply constraints have gotten most of the attention  What   struck me, though, when I was there a couple of weeks ago is that there is also a pretty sizable   demand shock in Japan  Tokyo is as quiet as it’s ever been, and a lot of the leadership in Japan is   talking to people about how you need to go out and go back to business as usual, go to parties, go   out drinking, do all these sorts of things  But nobody feels like doing that  And I completely   understand that  One, it is a terrible tragedy, and people are in mourning  But, two, you can’t   April 26–27, 2011 145 of 244              get away from what has happened, because every day there are aftershocks  We were in Tokyo   for 36 hours, and there were at least six earthquakes in that 36-hour period—one of them when I   was actually speaking  The chandelier started to swing, which is a little disconcerting, [laughter]   because every time one of these earthquakes starts, you don’t really know what the ultimate   magnitude of the earthquake is going to be  So I think it is very difficult for them to get back to   business as usual   The Middle East–North Africa also remains an issue  I guess the news there is that not   much has spread beyond Libya to other oil producers  But the bad news is that it looks like a   complete standoff in Libya  Also, the bad news is that Saudi Arabia has basically said they were   going to pump additional crude, but the crude either isn’t forthcoming or it’s not demanded   because it’s not as high quality as the Libyan crude  The Saudi promises haven’t actually led to   additional supply, and there is not actually an oil response to that increased willingness of the   Saudis to pump oil  So it seems to me the risks there are very much on the side of oil prices   staying higher for longer, and crimping real income   Then, finally, we have our own little set of risks that we talked a little bit about earlier—  the Treasury debt limit ceiling  I think that there’s a real risk here, in part because the two sides   are really far apart, and because they are both looking for political advantage going into the next   election cycle  There is really a risk that the brinkmanship turns into miscalculation  And the   risk there is greater because the markets aren’t taking it seriously, and people can say, “What’s   the big deal?  Markets aren’t worried about it, so let’s go to the edge”  I wouldn’t make much of   the S&P putting the US on negative watch  I think that is just catching up with reality  I think   what really matters is what the Congress does or doesn’t do over the next couple of months    Thank you   April 26–27, 2011 146 of 244               Thank you  I support alternative B  In terms of our   large-scale asset purchase program, we should finish the $600 billion  Stopping here would send   an inappropriately strong signal that we’re starting to remove accommodation relative to the   actual effect that the $170 billion would actually have  You would have a very strong market   reaction relative to what the actual effect would be on the balance sheet   April 26–27, 2011 205 of 244              With respect to future large-scale asset purchase programs, I get the sense from the   Committee that the bar is quite high for a couple of reasons  One, deflation is no longer a   significant risk  Two, the economy looks better than last summer, and three, which hasn’t been   mentioned, there is more interest rate risk as the size of our balance sheet increases  So while the   language in paragraph 3 is neutral in terms of prepared to adjust up or down, I view the bar as   pretty high to further large-scale asset purchase programs, at least at this time based on what we   know about the outlook today   In terms of the statement, there is this question about whether inflation expectations are   “stable” or whether inflation expectations are “generally stable”  You know, we debated this in   New York, and we came to the conclusion that “generally stable” was probably a more accurate   description of what we’re actually seeing  And I guess my preference is to have paragraph 1 call   it how we see it and not shade it because of worries about market reaction  That said, I do agree   that the change will be noticed, but I think that being as accurate as possible is important in terms   of maintaining our credibility  Putting in the word “generally” could actually be productive in   the sense that it might show a greater concern about inflation expectations, which might keep   inflation expectations better anchored  It could prove beneficial to us rather than problematic,   and I do favor putting in “generally”   In terms of President Plosser’s suggestion of historical norms, I guess my problem there   is  What time period does “historical norm” apply to?  Does it include the 1965–82 period?  And   how do we feel about it being within historical norms?  There’s no view of whether the idea of   historical norms is acceptable or not, so I think it’s a little vague in terms of how people would   interpret it   April 26–27, 2011 206 of 244              In terms of paragraph 2, I favor keeping the last sentence unchanged, “in the context of   price stability,” because it avoids this low-high-low pattern of that paragraph in introducing so   many different concepts  I think it keeps the paragraph simpler, and, to President Lockhart’s   point, maintains our practice of only making changes when we think the changes are actually   necessary and a distinct improvement  If people don’t want to do that, I could accept it  I could   certainly accept inserting the word “headline” or “overall” as the modifier to the inflation rate in   that paragraph  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I think it’s easier just to keep it the way it is    Earlier in that paragraph we do say that we expect these   effects to be transitory, so we are setting up the idea of why we think that we’re going back to   price stability  If we hadn’t mentioned the transitory nature, I would be more in agreement with   you, but we do mention it  So that, I think, sets up what follows  "
9229,2011-06-21,"  Thank you  I have two sets of questions  One, how   have the models done in terms of forecasting?  You show the current forecast, but if you back   things up six months or a year ago, or two years ago, how have they actually done?  And when a   model does poorly, how do you assess that?  Is that because there were shocks or because the   model was misspecified?  How do you interpret what is a good model versus what is a bad   model?   My second set of questions is going to maybe go in the same direction as the Chairman   was going  How do you think about balance sheet constraints in the context of these models?   For example, right now you have changes in credit standards and credit availability  Do the   models just take those and translate them into a particular shock?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My preference,   unconstrained, would be to omit the entire sentence that begins, “In particular, the size of the   securities portfolio,” because I think it unnecessarily commits us to the direction of a corridor   system  But failing that, I am willing to live with the sentence as it stands without the bracketed   language  Let me explain why that’s my strong preference  My view is that there’s no reason to   commit to a corridor system now  In the next few years we will learn a lot about operating a   floor system  It doesn’t make sense to commit to a corridor when we don’t have all the available   information to make an informed choice about whether we prefer a corridor system or a floor   system  And the costs of waiting to get this information are very low, because market   participants are not at all focused or care about whether we make this choice today  So if we   wait, nothing bad happens; there is really very little cost to waiting   June 21–22, 2011 35 of 282              Now, I agree with President Plosser that, if there was no possible chance that a floor   system could be superior to a corridor system, there would be no point in waiting to get new   information  But I do think that there are a number of reasons to think that the floor system   might potentially be superior  So I want to talk about some of the potential benefits of a floor   system   The first thing is that if we had a floor system, there would be more reserves in the   banking system, and that might actually help the payment system operate more efficiently  With   a corridor system, in contrast, you are going to have more intraday credit extension, and you are   going to have more interbank transactions as people try to get to flat, vis-à-vis one another  As a   result, there is going to be more interconnectedness through the banking system  With a floor   system, we anticipate that some of the major payment systems like CHIPS and DTC would have   fewer payment fails, because there would be more lubricant in the system  There would be   earlier settlement times, and you would have fewer delays in terms of executing payments  And   there would be less congestion in terms of settling the systems at the end of the day  A second   potential benefit of a floor system is that excess reserves could help banks satisfy their liquidity   requirements more easily because there would be more liquidity in the system as a starting point    Third, it’s very possible that a floor system might be operationally more efficient  If you think   about how the SOMA Manager would execute operations on a day-to-day basis in a corridor   system, every day the Desk would have to do a careful calculation of money demand, money   supply, and how much reserves need to be added or drained from the system  A lot of those fine-  tuning operations would probably go away in a floor system because the little shocks to money   demand and money supply would not have consequences for the actual level of short-term rates    As a result, the operations conducted by the SOMA Manager would be much simpler  And   June 21–22, 2011 36 of 282              fourth, a floor system might reduce the volatility in short-term interest rates that is caused by   those shocks in money demand and money supply  In other words, the SOMA Manager makes a   forecast of how many reserves the system needs to keep the funds rate at its target  But to the   extent that the SOMA Manager makes a bad forecast and does not hit the desired demand for   reserves in the system, then that introduces volatility into short-term rates   Now, in all of this, I’m not saying I favor a floor system  I’m not arguing for a floor   system over a corridor system  All I am arguing is that it is bad policy to rule out a floor system   at the current time given the chance to learn a lot about how a floor system operates in practice    Now, Charlie said just now, and in his note, that in the April FOMC minutes, the Committee   members generally favored a corridor system  I went back and looked at the minutes, and I don’t   read it quite the same way  Here is what the minutes said, at least the sentences I picked out of   the minutes  “Some participants also noted their preferences about the longer-run framework for   monetary policy implementation  Most of these participants”—those who had noted their   preferences—“indicated that they preferred that monetary policy eventually operate through a   corridor-type system”  So that’s most of some participants, and “most” of “some participants,”   as far as I can tell, doesn’t necessarily mean a majority  I think the staff actually counted seven   people who expressed a preference for a corridor system  Another important thing is that this   was really not put on the table as something that we are actually considering, corridor versus   floor  Do we want to rule out a floor system at the current time?  This is not something that we   really discussed or debated at the last meeting  So what I’m asking is to keep the current   language in place, without the bracketed language  I think that is a reasonable compromise    Let’s learn before we commit to either a corridor or a floor system   June 21–22, 2011 37 of 282              Charlie raised the issue that a floor system would presumably allow a balance sheet of   any particular size  I would offer President Plosser the notion that we could commit to keeping   that off the table by language that might say something like, “the smallest balance sheet   consistent with what is needed for the efficient execution of monetary policy”  So if you’re   really worried that a floor system might lead to an unlimited balance sheet size, we could take   that off the table by basically committing to the smallest balance sheet necessary for the efficient   implementation of policy  I think that would address your concerns that the balance sheet would   be this discretionary tool of policy    I think we do know that, because we have a federal   funds market even today, with a balance sheet that is much bigger than what we would operate   under a floor system    Right  But I think we have a balance sheet today that is   far greater than what we would have under any reasonable floor system that we would think to   operate  And we haven’t flooded the market, so I don’t think that’s a fair comparison    That would be fine    I agree with Governor Yellen’s statement because,   exactly as she says, saying that you are not going to keep the federal funds rate low for an   extended period does not necessarily mean you are going to tighten three to six months later  It   depends on the data    I’m comfortable with the memo as amended  I agree   with taking out the time references  I think the only time reference that one might want to   June 21–22, 2011 52 of 282              continue to include is the “over a period of four to five years,” but I think that’s too narrow, four   to five years, because as this plays out, if you ended reinvestment and the agencies are writing   off for several years, you might want to have a broader range  So I’m completely happy with   how the Committee decides  I don’t feel strongly about it, but I think that one is a little different   than the other time references    Yes, I heard that there might be support for actually   making it an addendum to the minutes—something pretty close to what we actually talked about    Is your proposal to circulate something tomorrow?    Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman  There has obviously   been a lot of press about Maiden Lane II sales, and Maiden Lane II sales have been cited as a   factor—in fact, some people would even claim primary factor—for the weakness in the   nonprime RMBS market, but also more broadly than that, CMBS and a whole variety of   different asset classes  As Brian said, we feel very strongly that this is not really the main factor    The deterioration in housing and the decline in risk appetite seem to be much more important    It’s hard to believe that $15 billion market value of assets could generate such large effects,   especially when it’s important to recognize that the nonprime RMBS market is actually shrinking   over time because there’s no new issuance  So this is a market that’s actually amortizing over   time   I want to give you briefly an update of where we stand  The next big event is going to be   on July 15, when we actually publish the results  I’m going to give you a heads up about what   those results are going to look like  The good news is that the sales that we’ve actually done   have gone very, very well  We’ve put out nine bid lists  We sold $10 billion, face amount,   which is roughly one-third of the portfolio  So we’ve achieved $47 billion of actual proceeds,   and we’re running about $400 million ahead of our December 31 marks which, if you remember,   were the basis of AIG’s bid for this portfolio  Part of that reflects the fact that we have positive   carry on these assets, but a lot of this reflects the fact that the bids we got for these assets were   June 21–22, 2011 62 of 282              quite a bit higher than our marks  There’s been no issue in terms of, Do you get bids for the   assets, to sell the assets?  We’ve had multiple bids on all of the assets  We haven’t faced the   issue of being left with “cats and dogs” at the end; we can sell everything  There are bids for   everything  We may not necessarily like the bids that we get, but there’s actually plenty of   demand to take these off our hands   The bad news is that there has been, as Brian showed in one of his charts, a significant   decline in prices in this market  As a result, the outlook going forward for prices for the   remaining two-thirds of the portfolio is quite a bit less favorable than the prices we’ve actually   achieved to date  If we sold everything that we hold today at the current market prices—  instantaneous, no positive carry—we would achieve overall a $11 billion profit, which would be   smaller than the $1½ billion profit that we would have gotten if we’d accepted AIG’s offer    What’s our response to this?  Well, our response is we’re going to slow down the pace of sales to   reflect the deterioration in market conditions and to reflect the fact that we’re in the summer   months where there’s going to be fewer people around  So you’ll see fewer bid lists from us, and   we may also reduce the proportion of securities that we actually sell  Up to now we’ve sold   75 percent of the securities that we put on offer, and we may be a little less aggressive than that    Now, in all this, time is our friend  We have a positive carry as these securities amortize  If we   slow down and prices stay steady, we’ll actually do better than the $11 billion  So that’s where   we stand, and I’d be happy to take any questions    Because these are risky assets, there’s a big risk   premium on these assets  So the yield on these assets is actually high relative to a risk-free asset    With respect to AIG, the issue about not accepting AIG’s offer was not really about the price that   they were paying for the assets, it was the fact that we thought that there were significant   financial stability issues associated with selling what have obviously been very risky assets all to   one entity  We also were concerned about the lack of a level playing field in the sense that these   assets should be available broadly to whoever wants to buy them  We committed, when we   started this process, to basing the rate of sales on market conditions, and market conditions have   deteriorated  We’re also in the summer months where demand is less because there are fewer   people at their securities firms  For those reasons, we’re going to slow down a bit    Yes  I think we are worried about it, and I think one of   the issues is, what happens to people’s willingness to take that entity as a counterparty?  So it’s   not just their own funding, it’s also their transactions in, say, the OTC derivatives markets  One   thing that is very hard to assess here is, what is the damage to the franchise?  And how does that   manifest itself over time?  You could have a situation where nothing happened very dramatically   on day 1 or day 90, but the franchise of the entity would erode over time  The bank’s funding   costs are also likely to be higher, and that’s also a competitive disadvantage in terms of   generating reasonable returns on equity  All of these things might have a medium- to long-term   effect  I think it’s a little harder to judge from historical experience, though, because usually   what happens is, when you get downgraded to A2/P2, you’re on your way to something even   worse  And so you never really know what would happen if they were downgraded to A2/P2,   but then their earnings performance subsequently improved  We just don’t have a lot of   examples of that type of survival   June 21–22, 2011 88 of 282               There’s a difference between a bank and a bank holding   company, and how do you fund the nonbank subsidiaries?  That’s really the key issue, I think    The chart showed exports above imports  Are the   imports weak relative to our actual growth rate?  In other words, do we think there is import   June 21–22, 2011 96 of 282              substitution going on?  And if so, how much, and how significant is it?  You can have trade   improvement for three reasons  One, our exports are strong; two, our economic growth is weak;   and three, our imports are weak  But import substitution could be another factor  We hear a lot   of anecdotal reports about the United States getting more competitive relative to China and other   places  I was wondering if that is showing up at all    Thanks    Thank you  First of all, I want to thank the staff, Dan   and Nellie  I thought that was a terrific presentation that covered a lot of material, and there   were some interesting exhibits that presented the information in a way that I hadn’t seen it   before  It was extremely helpful   I want to talk about two issues that I have been talking about for a while, Europe and the   federal debt ceiling  On Europe, let me be very brief  I suspect that we will avoid a catastrophe   in the near term as Greece reluctantly agrees to do more and the private sector participates by   rolling over some debt on a “voluntary basis”  But even if we get this outcome, we should not be   very comfortable with where we are  The intersection of what Greece can or will do, and what   the core countries demand—especially from a political perspective—continues to shrink, and we   seem very close to a null set  We might not get to a null set this time, but we are not very far   from getting to a null set  I can easily imagine Greece falling short of its objectives 6 to   June 21–22, 2011 100 of 282              12 months down the road, and then we will have another episode, and at that point we actually   could reach the end of the road   With respect to the debt ceiling, I would only reinforce Brian’s comments  We are on a   very risky course  No one knows precisely what will happen if the debt limit is not raised in a   timely manner in August, but we do know it will be a mess  Not only would there be short-term   disruptions to financial markets and the macroeconomy, a default, even if temporary, could have   a lasting effect on US debt costs and the role of the dollar as a reserve currency  So I would   encourage everyone in this room to raise the alarm in their public comments and in their private   discussion of this  The Chairman spoke about this issue I think quite forcefully recently  I think   the more people that make it clear that this is really serious, the better  I am particularly worried   because the financial markets up to now are so relaxed that the debt limit will be raised in a   timely way, and I worry that this is going to give false comfort to those that think a temporary   default would not be particularly harmful  And I think we really need to lean against that notion   as hard as we can    I have some sympathy with what President Lacker is   saying  You don’t want to give comfort to make the debt default more likely  But at the same   time, if a debt default were to occur, you don’t want to make it much worse in terms of the   consequences  You are balancing those two basic issues    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As widely noted, we’ve hit   another soft patch  The key question is, what are the causes?  Only by understanding the reasons   for the soft patch can we gain confidence about its duration and the medium-term trajectory of   the economy  It’s clear that some special temporary factors played a role  First, the run-up in   gasoline prices crimped real disposable income, and this weighed on consumer spending and   June 21–22, 2011 130 of 282              confidence  Supply disruptions stemming from the Japanese catastrophe limited motor vehicle   output, and may have also depressed demand, as incentives were cut and some popular models   were in short supply  In addition, there is considerable sentiment for the view that the ongoing   housing market mess has played a role, with renewed weakness in home prices crimping   household wealth and dampening confidence  And the price declines may have caused   prospective home buyers to hold off, even though housing affordability has improved   dramatically over the past few years  Bankers and other business people we talked to also cite   regulatory uncertainty, although it’s hard to see why, if this were indeed important, it would bite   so abruptly   Regardless of the cause, the weakness of the economy has to be viewed as quite striking   at a time when monetary policy is viewed as very stimulative and the healing process following   the crisis is evident in a number of areas, including household debt service burdens and credit   availability  I would argue that there is a bit of a puzzle here  I’d like to suggest that there may   be another factor—namely, monetary policy may not be as stimulative as we think it is  In this   regard, I’m not arguing that monetary stimulus is less powerful than normal because of the   housing mess or the fact that there are still necessary balance sheet adjustments in train  I’m   making a different argument—that the degree by which monetary policy at a given   accommodative setting stimulates real economic activity may diminish over time  This is not   something that we’ve had much experience with, because normally the economy responds quite   rapidly to easier monetary conditions  As a result, this will not show up empirically very clearly   in our models or via econometric estimation  Put simply, we typically don’t stay at very   accommodative settings very long, so we don’t have much empirical evidence by which to judge   this   June 21–22, 2011 131 of 282              Let me explain what I mean in a bit more detail  Monetary policy at a given setting   might provide less lift to the economy over time because either the linkage between the federal   funds rate and financial conditions or the linkage between financial conditions and the real   economy may weaken over time  For example, as short-term interest rates stay low, the yield   curve will flatten and stock prices will rise, but eventually the yield curve will have a more   normal shape and the stimulative effects of monetary policy will peter out  Japan would be a   good example of this  Similarly, the effects of easier financial conditions on aggregate demand   may also diminish over time  Consider, for example, the prospective homebuyer or car   purchaser who responds to a drop in interest rates by moving up the timing of the purchase  The   homebuyer or car purchaser who purchases today will then not purchase tomorrow  To the   extent that monetary policy influences the timing of purchases, its effects will peter out over   time   If I am correct that the degree of stimulus at a given rate setting to the economy lessens   over time, this has a number of important implications  First, we might need to increase our   degree of accommodation to have the same desired effect as earlier  Of course, this may not be   easy to do at the zero lower bound and with an already enlarged balance sheet  If we cannot or   will not do more, we should expect the recovery to be less robust because monetary policy has   lost some of its power  Second, it implies that exit might need to wait until later because   monetary policy will become less stimulative over time just as a natural matter of course  There   may be less reason to exit early because the degree of monetary policy stimulus naturally wears   off over time  Third, early tightening might actually exert considerably more restraint than we   anticipate if policy is not providing that much of an impetus to economic growth at present  We   don’t have much experience sitting at the zero lower bound for years, and I hope we won’t repeat   June 21–22, 2011 132 of 282              this in the future  That’s why I think we must be open-minded and challenge our assumptions   that the current stance of monetary policy is as stimulative as we think it is  I have encouraged   my staff to work on this issue, and I would encourage others to do so as well  Thank you    Thank you  I support alternative B  I think the economy   is very likely to do somewhat better in the third quarter, as some of these transitory factors   depressing activity fade  I also think it’s not time to change policy, given that, it’s fair to say, the   pass-through of the commodity price pressures into generalized prices of goods and services has   been a little bit higher than what we were anticipating  That said, just like we spent a lot of time   doing contingency planning on what we’d do on the exit side, I think we need to do contingency   planning on what we’d do should economic growth disappoint and inflation begin to decline   again as some of these commodity price pressures fade  Alternative A presents one option in   terms of changing the communication by committing the “extended period” language to a   June 21–22, 2011 193 of 282              particular length of time and adding a commitment to the balance sheet through the middle of   2012  But I think there are a lot of other options that we need to consider, and I would strongly   encourage taking that up   Second, I think in general the statement is a considerable improvement  I still don’t think   it’s quite where I’d like it to be, and I don’t want to make changes at this meeting, but I do think   that it needs to evolve a little bit further over time  Because what we want is paragraph 1 to be a   report on what we’re seeing, it needs to be a statement of objective measures of what the data   are  This allows us, then, over time, to call it as we see it without a lot of consequences in terms   of what this implies about what we are actually going to do  And paragraph 2, then, would be   about how the Committee views the outlook in light of this objective information  We’re getting   there, but we are not quite there yet  And I think a number of other people have cited this “loss   of momentum” as more of a subjective evaluation of the data rather than a statement of what the   data are, and I have some sympathy with that  Paragraph 2 also has a number of things that you   might think should be in paragraph 1  “The unemployment rate remains elevated” and “Inflation   has moved up recently”  Those are statements of facts, so you could argue that those really   belong more in paragraph 1 than paragraph 2  I wouldn’t suggest making any of these changes at   this particular meeting  Taking out “The unemployment rate remains elevated” at a time that the   unemployment rate has been moving higher would be very odd, and the market would have   trouble interpreting it  But I think over time it would be really good to have paragraph 1 be the   objective statement of facts and paragraph 2 be our interpretation of it  I think we need to   continue to work in that direction   Finally, let me just make a couple of comments about what other people have raised  I   certainly agree with President Rosengren today that, in your press conference, it is very   June 21–22, 2011 194 of 282              important that the discussion about the exit strategy is stated in a way that does not imply an   early exit  I know you’ll do that fine  It is really important that people don’t think that spending   so much time on this contingency plan means that exit necessarily lies close at hand   With President Williams, I am sympathetic with his point about what the current degree   of monetary policy accommodation means; that was consistent with some of the comments that I   was making yesterday  I don’t feel strongly about it, but if the group would want to remove that   reference, I would be happy to take his amendment    Yes  I’m less concerned about alternative B creating the   wrong impression because you are going to give a press conference, and you are going to have   the projections  And the projections, I think, in some ways will speak for themselves    I have a very quick question of what we mean  When   we say that “The pace of sales is expected to be aimed at eliminating our holdings … over a   period of three to five years,” do we mean from today, or from when the sales start?    So do we need to clarify that?  Because one could read   that either way      Yes  I think you need to clarify it, so people don’t   misinterpret that    That’s why we’re including “three,” because if you start   later you’ll have a smaller portfolio, so you’d want to start faster  I wanted to clarify that, so that   there is no ambiguity    The whole issue of “three to five” is that you just don’t   know when you’re going to start  And since you don’t know when you’re going to start, you   don’t know how big the agency MBS portfolio is going to be at the starting point  You can   imagine a situation where we start very late, and we don’t have a very big agency MBS portfolio,   so we want to make it a short period of time of sales  Or we start very early and we have a much   bigger portfolio—that’s the logic of having a little bit more range there    And they’re running off at what rate, roughly, Brian?    Okay  That’s a good point    We have to get the market disruption idea in there    I can live with four to five years  I just wanted to point   out that if we did exit late, we might decide to go faster  But there’s enough wiggle room here   that I don’t think that people are going to produce this five years from now and say, “Well, you   said”    Is the idea to include it in the minutes, if we can get to   closure?    And we’re putting in “once sales begin”  "
9254,2011-08-01,"  What I’m going to do is talk a little bit about where we   are today and what we need to think about going forward  First, I think we have to recognize   that there is still some risk that there will be no deal, so we’re not out of the woods yet  I think   we need to know, one, what would happen if there wasn’t a deal in terms of markets, and two,   how we would respond  In other words, what’s the contingency plan?  I think we were a little   surprised last week by how rapidly things did deteriorate, even though people in the market   thought there was going to be a deal  And if there wasn’t a deal, people in the market thought   there was still not going to be a default, so the probability of a default as we went into the   weekend was de minimis, yet there were pretty strong market consequences  If we get to a point   later this week that the vote is negative in the House or Senate and there’s no deal, I think things   are going to fall apart pretty quickly, and we’re going to have to be able to respond very, very   fast  So the more we can get on the same page now, the easier it will be to respond to that   eventuality  I think that’s something we’ll just have to do   Now, if there’s no deal, I’d think that how this would evolve would be that the Treasury   would commit to pay principal and interest, and other payments would soon be delayed as the   Treasury ran out of cash  The key question at that point would be whether the Treasury’s   commitment to pay principal and interest is a sustainable, credible commitment  You could still   have default on Treasury securities in two ways, despite the Treasury’s commitment  First,   prioritization—in other words, putting principal and interest ahead of payments to Social   Security and Medicare, to the troops, et cetera—might not prove to be sustainable  And second,   August 1, 2011 39 of 53              you could have a Treasury default if the Treasury auction process wasn’t sustainable—in other   words, if there was a failure of the Treasury auctions to allow the Treasury to roll over its   maturing debt  We can’t do very much about the prioritization not being sustainable politically,   but I do think we can do something about the risk of the Treasury auctions failing  I think we   should care about that because I think there would be huge consequences if there was a Treasury   auction failure; that would, I think, precipitate a default—or certainly ratchet up the probability   of a default—substantially in people’s minds, and I think that would have a huge impact on   financial conditions in the capital markets   So the question is, how can we influence the outcome and lessen the risk of Treasury   auction failure?  Let me tell you just a little bit of what I’m worried about  We already saw last   week that money market funds were building up cash and corporations were pulling money out   of money market funds and converting them to cash  We could get into a dynamic where, if we   really had a “no” vote this week, this whole process could ratchet up very, very dramatically  In   that situation, Treasury bill rates would probably go up significantly  Volatility in the Treasury   bill market would increase dramatically  And I think as a consequence of that, it would be   reasonable to assume that the probability of a failure in the Treasury bill auctions would go up a   lot  So the question is, could we do something to reduce the risk of that kind of negative   dynamic?  I think we could  We could basically make it clear that the Federal Reserve is   prepared to intervene to ensure orderly money market function  Now, in terms of Brian and   Bill’s memo, doing RPs was part of ensuring orderly money market function  But I think it goes   beyond that  It could also include the Fed’s willingness to buy Treasury bills if things got really,   really disorderly   August 1, 2011 40 of 53              What I’m proposing here is not that we go in and start buying Treasury bills willy-nilly    What I’m proposing is more of a communication to market participants that the Federal Reserve   is going to backstop the efficient function of the money markets, and that could include doing   RPs and it could include doing Treasury bill purchases, but we would only do it in extremis, if   we thought things were getting out of hand   Now, in terms of some of the criticisms of the Treasury bill purchases—first of all,   people say we’d be monetizing the debt  Well, that’s not really true, in the sense that the debt   limit would be binding, so the total amount of Treasury debt outstanding would be fixed because   we’d be at the debt limit  Second, I think it’s superior to a lot of other ways we could intervene   because although our balance sheet would go up, as soon as the crisis had passed, the bills would   run off and so it would be very rapidly self-liquidating  I think it’s far superior to doing a 13(3)   facility for money market mutual funds; if you think about how we would do that, we’d have to   set up an SPV, and the SPV would buy Treasury bills from the money market funds  So we’d   have something that was less broad and more convoluted, creating more of a moral hazard vis-à-  vis the money market funds rather than something where we’re just backstopping the money   market more broadly   I think if this was communicated properly and done correctly, this would be a backstop   which would basically keep people playing in the market, and we wouldn’t have to actually use   it  We saw in the financial crisis a number of times that having credible backstops keeps people   playing and keeps markets functioning  And keeping those markets functioning is key to   actually avoiding very adverse equilibriums  If everyone thinks the market’s going to fail, the   market will fail  We are the bastion that determines whether you end up at the bad equilibrium   or the good equilibrium  So communicating that, I think, would be very helpful   August 1, 2011 41 of 53              If we get to the point where we’re unfortunate and the House or the Senate votes “no,”   things are going to get worse in a hurry, and I think we have to be prepared at that time to rapidly   respond either through another meeting or through a notation vote  What I would be   recommending would be three things  (1) a statement that the FOMC would act as needed to   maintain orderly conditions in short-term money markets; (2) a change in the directive to make it   clear that maintaining orderly conditions in short-term money markets is part of the Desk’s   directive; and (3) some statement, probably from the Chairman, explaining what we’re doing and   what we’re trying to accomplish, and that our interventions would be only in extremis to ensure   orderly market function   So that’s what’s on my mind  Now, I want to come back to Bill English’s questions  I   clearly support 1 to 5  Reverse RPs and RPs, 6 and 7—I’m happy to do either of those if I think   it’s consistent with maintaining orderly money market function  But that, to me, is the primary   criterion  If we think the money markets are disorderly, what can we do to make them more   orderly?  If those interventions are helpful to make the markets perform in a better way, then I   think we should contemplate them  I don’t favor number 8  I think the 13(3) facility for money   market funds is a very problematic approach, and I think having a backstop—a willingness to   buy Treasury bill securities short term—would be much superior  And 9 and 10, doing the   defaulted securities—well, I really hope we never get to that point, because that’s going to   basically mean that the Treasury has actually failed in terms of their intention to maintain   payment of principal and interest  But if we got to that point, in my mind, it would be a   weighing of the costs and benefits  What’s the cost to the financial market function of having   these defaulted securities trading in the market?  How much is that going to contribute to the   breakdown of the government securities market versus how much is the cost politically to be   August 1, 2011 42 of 53              seen as intervening in the Treasury market and buying defaulted securities?  I think it’s really   hard to say ex ante where that cost–benefit calculation would come out, so that’s one where you   have to look at the circumstances at the time  I think it would be very hard to make up your   mind today  Thank you, Mr Chairman    This is one person’s view  I think that what we’re   seeing is basically a response to the risk that the debt limit would not be raised in a timely way,   and people are getting into cash and therefore that is putting upward pressure on repo rates    Because we hope that the bill will be passed in the next 24 hours or so, a reasonable expectation   would be that these pressures should subside over the next week or so  I would be more inclined   to wait a little longer, to see the outcome of the legislative process and see if these rate pressures   come down  Otherwise, I think doing it right now—let’s say, tomorrow—would raise questions   about why we were doing it and what we were concerned about for something that might not last   more than a few more days  That’s my view  "
9276,2011-08-09,"  In terms of the stock market, I agree with Brian’s view,   but there’s a different view as well, which is looking at the stock market irrespective of what   bond yields are  Just looking at 10-year trailing earnings, the P/E ratio is actually quite a bit   above the long-term, historical average  Someone like Shiller would say the stock market is   actually very overvalued today  I don’t think that’s the right way of looking at the stock market,   but there is an alternative view of stock valuation that leads to a quite different conclusion    As someone who used to do this for a living, let me just   say that the surveys are filled out predominantly by economists who sit on the trading desks    They’re basically going to write down what they think is going to happen as opposed to what   they want to see happen, because they want to basically get it right, and getting it right is what’s   important to them in terms of their call to the markets    Thank you  First, I’m going to talk about financial   market developments, and then I’ll talk a little bit about the economic activity data we’ve seen   August 9, 2011 67 of 162              My view is very similar to Brian’s that the market reaction is really about the   deterioration of the economic growth outlook  If you look at the confluence of the market   indicators—stocks down, credit spreads wider, flight into safe-haven currencies, drop in   Treasury yields—all are consistent with anxiety about the growth outlook  What’s dangerous   about this, of course, is that there’s a risk that this becomes a self-fulfilling process—that   markets weaken, which then causes people to revise down their economic growth forecast, which   leads to further market weakness  Letting this run unabated is not without considerable risk, and   I think the risks are higher than normal because, one, the economy was very close to stall speed   even before this, and, two, the market understands that there’s a lack of potent policy tools that   can be used to arrest this   I think that the market developments that are most disturbing to me right now are what   we saw yesterday with bank stocks falling very, very sharply and CDS spreads widening  What   was interesting was that the stocks that fell the most were those for the weaker institutions  I   guess that’s not really surprising because obviously they’d be hit most by a poor economic   environment  But we did hear something that was actually very interesting  It was that the   inability of some banks to buy back their shares may have been contributing to greater price   weakness in their stocks  This could be because people who were putting on short positions   knew that these companies would not be able to resist as easily as other companies  I think that   the key issue in terms of this dynamic is that it’s not obvious what the banks can do to break it    It’s not as if the bank could say, “I’ll go out and raise more capital,” and that’s going to make   everybody feel better, because that’s going to be taken as a signal that the bank may actually be   weaker than what people thought  The key questions on this note are likely, one, will this   dynamic continue, and, two, will it lead to funding pressures?  And where I guess I would be   August 9, 2011 68 of 162              particularly nervous is among the broker–dealers  So far we haven’t really seen much evidence   of this, but that would be a very, very dangerous channel  And, three, will this lead to credit   rating downgrades?  In other words, if this process goes on long enough, will the credit rating   agencies feel some need to respond to the deterioration in the stock prices and the widening   credit default swap spreads by cutting the credit ratings, which then could feed back through in   terms of the funding, which would be pretty dangerous?  Now, S&P said yesterday that the   government downgrade would not lead them to mechanically downgrade the ratings of the major   financial institutions, but that’s now, and things could change as we go forward   In terms of Europe, I think that it is disturbing, first, that we’re seeing renewed bank   funding pressures  Money market mutual funds are shortening their tenors, and they’re   shortening them now to financial institutions that were really pretty protected and not being   swept up by this a few months ago, especially some of the major French institutions  We’re   seeing it in markets more broadly in terms of widening in the FX dollar swap basis and a bit of   upward pressure in dollar LIBOR rates  It’s hard to know if this is it or if we’re going to see a   lot more of that, but it is certainly disturbing  The second issue in Europe is that there really is   no long-term plan  The ECB’s intervention—the fact that they’re willing to buy Italian and   Spanish bonds—buys you some time  But in some ways, the ECB intervention is very   inconsistent with the commitments that have been made in terms of the EFSF because there has   been no commitment made to increase the size of the EFSF beyond €440 billion  If you really   bring Italy and Spain into the picture, the EFSF needs to be orders of magnitude larger than that,   and so far at least, the German officials have said that they have no intention to expand the size   of the EFSF  Until that changes, I guess I’m going to be pretty nervous about how this is all   going to play out   August 9, 2011 69 of 162              In terms of the economic news, as President Rosengren mentioned, we decided to   circulate a memo just talking about the conditional probability of recession given how weak   output growth has been  I’m not sure I would take those probabilities literally  Obviously every   business cycle is different, but it does, I think, show you that we are at a very dangerous point in   terms of how slow the economy is growing and what that typically foreshadows regarding future   outcomes in terms of recession  The second thing I just want to say is that I wouldn’t take much   comfort at all from the payroll employment data  As David said, it wasn’t quite as horrible as it   could have been, but it was pretty bad  Aggregate hours worked were up only 01 percent; that’s   not very strong  And I would emphasize that this is not very timely information; this is the   survey for the week that includes July 12  To the extent that there was a deterioration in   confidence and business activity in the run-up to the debt limit fiasco, we haven’t seen that yet in   the employment data  It’s very possible that the next employment report could actually be quite   a bit weaker than that one  And the last thing I would say in terms of the employment report is   that the household survey was much weaker, with, as David mentioned, the drop in the   unemployment rate due solely to the decline in the labor force participation   From my perspective, the weakness of the economy was very well established even   before the market retrenchment  On top of that, we have the risk that these market dynamics will   continue, and that suggests to me that we should do more on the monetary policy front  Now, I   agree with President Hoenig that the problem is one of deleveraging at the household sector and   at the government sector, and monetary policy cannot solve the deleveraging problem  That’s   something that has to take place  But I would argue that the rate at which this deleveraging   process takes place does matter, and monetary policy can affect the rate of deleveraging  And by   affecting the rate of deleveraging, it can determine how many things actually break in the   August 9, 2011 70 of 162              financial system, and I think that can be important  So I still think there’s a role for monetary   policy, even though I agree with you that this is really mostly about deleveraging  Thanks    We could talk about that    It’s two or three meetings according to some    [Simultaneous speakers]    We have a couple more people who’d like to speak    I think people are very much overstating the degree of   commitment in that language  It says “currently anticipates that these conditions are likely to   warrant”  It’s qualified all over the place  I don’t understand why people view this as some   binding commitment  It’s not a binding commitment  There are all sorts of escape clauses  I   don’t understand why people view this language as so binding that they’d be willing to dissent    This is the Committee  The Committee has a forecast  Now, people may disagree with the   forecast, but is it unreasonable for the Committee to have a view, that the Committee, in its   totality, today anticipates that this is what is likely?  That’s not binding   August 9, 2011 130 of 162               If the projections change, then the date could change    I think it’s off the table for now    Yes     Thirty seconds  First, we have to do what we can do  I   completely agree with Governor Tarullo  This notion that “It’s someone else’s fault, so that   means we get to abdicate our responsibility”—that’s just ridiculous in my opinion  Second, I   August 9, 2011 134 of 162              think that what you proposed is the absolute minimum of what we need to do today  I’d be   prepared to do more, but that’s the absolute minimum  And third, I think people are dramatically   overstating the degree of commitment in saying that “we anticipate that something is likely based   on our current projections”  It just doesn’t bind us in any meaningful way  All it does is provide   more clarity to the market and replace something that today is completely empty  The “extended   period” language today is absolutely empty    Well, it’s empty in the sense that it means that we’re   going two or three meetings out, that’s it  So the “extended period” language today doesn’t   really add very much  This actually provides a lot more than that, so I completely support you    I’m a little concerned about whether the market will   jump to the view that we’re going to do QE3 because you have this language  “The Committee   August 9, 2011 139 of 162              will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings”  I just think you might   want to be aware of that potential    Let’s get the new language read, if we could     That’s been standard  That was in there last time  "
9303,2011-09-20,"  Can I ask a follow-up question, Mr Chairman?    How about if we look at the TIPS market itself?  You   have TIPS yields in terms of the probability of deflation within a TIP that’s already booked a   bunch of inflation versus a newer one    What does that show?    That shouldn’t be distorted by liquidity and things of   that sort    Thank you    Well, you have some TIPS securities that have been   outstanding for a while, and there’s a bunch of inflation that’s accrued, and so if you get   deflation from here, that still gets embedded in the price—you give back that inflation that   you’ve achieved because it’s been outstanding for a while  But if a new TIP has just been issued,   you have deflation from here; you don’t have to give that back    Yes, exactly    If I could amplify on your remarks—because I used to   do this—I would comment that basically the people in the market are trying to think along with   the Fed  They’re trying to think, “Well, if I were in their shoes, what would I do?”  And I   believe this has been the case for many years  It’s just a little bit more vivid now because we’re   engaged in using policy instruments that we haven’t used historically, but believe me, for the   past 20 years, people have been thinking very hard about, “Is the Fed going to move at this   meeting  If they’re going to move, how much are they going to move?”  And that’s all been   priced in  I completely accept your point that at the end of the day, we have to do what is   September 20–21, 2011 13 of 290              appropriate, not just because the market has priced it in  But regarding the convergence of the   marketplace and our actions, I don’t think it’s surprising in the sense that the market is observing   us and learning from us and solving for what our reaction function is    So moved    What do we mean by “target”?  Do we mean “target” as   in when we think about starting to normalize policy or “target” as in a long-term objective for   unemployment?  “Target” can mean different things    Absolutely    Thank you, Mr Chairman  This has been a pretty   abstract conversation, and I think that bothers me a little bit because we actually have to make   real decisions tomorrow about what we’re going to do to support economic activity  This is hard   because we’re really searching for the best tools and framework consistent with making financial   conditions more accommodative, and we’re reaching the limits of that effort  At the same time,   we also want to select those tools and frameworks that don’t box us in, in terms of future action    I think that over the past few years, we’ve been a little bit too single-meeting-centric, and we   need to think about how what we decide today affects our range of choices and options at the   next meeting and the meeting after that  It’s important that we make choices with respect to   tools and framework that don’t box us in going forward  We also have to recognize that   anything we do, we’re doing it in a very uncertain environment  If things evolve in a very   different way than we anticipate, we have to make sure that our credibility is robust to those   unanticipated developments  I think that is something we have to think about as well   The staff has done a lot of great work, and there are a lot of alternatives on the table    They all have their warts, and that’s reflected to some extent in the conversations around the   table  In what follows, I’m going to advocate a few things, but I do have reservations about   September 20–21, 2011 80 of 290              almost all of the options to one degree or the other  I think that in a lot of ways we’re trying to   select the least-bad options in some ways to provide additional monetary policy stimulus  Just   because they’re not great doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do them, as long as the benefits exceed the   costs   Now, in a perfect world, I would prefer another sizable LSAP program for two reasons    First, I think we are more confident about how it works relative to the maturity extension   program  We have some theory about how the MEP would work, but we haven’t actually   observed it in practice  We might see a greater disruption, for example, of market function than   we anticipate  My understanding is that, as proposed, we would own as much as 70 percent of   the outstanding CUSIPs in some of the longer-dated Treasury issues, and we really just don’t   know what that means in terms of market function  Also, the MEP would require us to sell   short-dated securities  So it might increase yields in the short-dated sector by more than we   anticipate  Second, I believe that, the staff memo notwithstanding, an LSAP of the size that the   staff memo has proposed probably is going to be more powerful than the MEP  I was a little   skeptical of the staff memo using the 10-year duration equivalence as our sole metric in   weighing the MEP versus the LSAP  That implies that $1 of 30-year Treasury purchases is   worth about the same as a little bit more than $2 of 10-year Treasury equivalents, and I’m just   not sure that’s right  I wouldn’t be surprised at all if preferred habitat and other things could   cause that relationship to not be quite that straightforward   Another reason why I think the LSAP would be more powerful than an MEP program is   that it’s potentially open ended in terms of size  We can only do the MEP program once  Once   we’ve done our duration extension, we’re done, and the market knows that  The LSAP program   would be more powerful because it would also change expectations about what might happen in   September 20–21, 2011 81 of 290              the future should the economy deteriorate more than what we expected  I worry somewhat about   an MEP program because it might actually send a signal that we’re done—this is the best thing   we could come up with, this is all we’ve got, and we’re done  And I think that would be very   disturbing  If we do go forward with the MEP program, I’d certainly like to have some   communications that strongly imply that the LSAP is not dead under all conditions  In other   words, if things got bad enough, this could be brought back and put on the table  I think it’s very   important in our communications that we don’t signal that we’re out of ammunition   Now, I said in a perfect world I would favor more LSAPs, but we don’t live in a perfect   world, as we all know  There are some really significant political constraints that make an LSAP   a less-attractive option  If we were to do an LSAP, there would be a huge political uproar  Now,   I don’t really think that just because we get an uproar means that we shouldn’t do a program    But if the uproar undercuts the efficacy of the policy, then you have to treat that as an   environmental factor, and you have to view that as relevant in conducting policy in the real   world  The attacks on LSAP policy—the claims that we’re monetizing the public debt, the   claims that we’re playing politics—really would generate two bad consequences that we have to   take into consideration  One, it would undercut the effectiveness of policy, and two, it would   undermine our credibility  Let me just be very clear here  I’m not saying that we shouldn’t do   something because of political pressures  We should resist political pressures  We should do   what we think is right, but if the political pressures mess up the policy, then we have to take that   into consideration in the policy that we pursue  At the same time, I think we should probably be   more aggressive in pushing back against these political pressures, because we can have some   impact in changing people’s perceptions about how damaging an LSAP would be or wouldn’t be   in the future   September 20–21, 2011 82 of 290              If an LSAP is off the table for the time being, what would I propose?  Well, the first thing   I want to propose—I want to put this on the table now even though it’s not part of the   questions—is that I think we should invest the maturing agency MBS back into agency MBS    And the reason for that is Brian’s chart 17 and handout, which showed that the mortgage basis   between mortgages and Treasuries is now wider than it has been at any time in the past six years,   except for the heart of the crisis  So we’ve really seen about a 45 basis point widening in the   mortgage basis, and I think that if our goal is really to make financial conditions more   accommodative, this is a very good way of doing that  The second benefit of doing that is that   there will be a surprise to people, and so we’ve actually put this back on the table when people   thought it was off the table  And I think it actually would tend to compress the mortgage basis   by maybe more than the actual purchases because people would realize now that if the mortgage   basis widens out, the Fed is likely to intervene, and that would make holding mortgage-backed   securities less risky for private investors  The third benefit of reinvesting the maturing agency   MBS into new agency MBS is that it would also mean the MEP program would be a little bit   smaller at the margin  Some of the market disruption issues in terms of us owning 70 percent of   long-dated Treasuries would be squeezed down a bit  My understanding is that we’re   anticipating over the next year that about $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities are going to   mature  Obviously, it depends on the path of interest rates and a whole bunch of other things,   but if that was the case, that would mean that rather than buying $600 billion of long-dated   Treasuries under the MEP program, we’d be buying $400 billion  So I think you really would   reduce considerably some of the market disruption issues that bother some people about the   MEP   September 20–21, 2011 83 of 290              What about interest rates on reserves?  I’ve wrestled with this a lot, and I guess I think   that at the end of the day, I’m 60–40 against rather than 60–40 for, but don’t ask me precisely   why, [laughter] because it’s really hard  We all agree that it would have a very small benefit in   terms of financial conditions, but what we have to weigh against that is the cost  And the fact is,   it’s very, very hard to assess what the cost is because I think what everyone is worried about with   respect to reducing the IOER is that there’s going to be a set of unintended consequences in   terms of what happens to money market funds, what happens to the money market more   generally, what happens to it if you have negative interest rates  We just don’t have a very good   way of dimensioning how significant those costs are  So it’s a judgment call  If the sense of the   Committee was the other way, I would go the other way, but I’m modestly against, just because I   think that the benefits in terms of financial conditions are very tiny and I’m uncertain about what   the costs are   Question 2(a) was on explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s long-term   objectives, like paragraph 2 of alternative A  I’m certainly willing to do this, but I personally   think the benefits of doing it are actually very modest  I think that the SEP projections already   show what our long-term outlook for unemployment and inflation is  The distribution is pretty   tight  The market participants already interpret these projections as our objectives  So we could   do it, and I don’t have a real problem with doing it, but I just don’t think that this idea that   somehow this is a huge major advance in what the Committee is doing is accurate   Regarding question 2(b), “Do you approve of the general idea of providing more explicit,   quantitative information about the Committee’s reaction function?”  I do, because I think   providing more information about our reaction function will reduce uncertainty, and that will   reduce risk premiums  It will enable market participants to more accurately map the implications   September 20–21, 2011 84 of 290              of incoming economic information in terms of the likely path of short-term rates  I think policy   will then automatically adjust to incoming information in a countercyclical way, and that’s a   positive  We’ve been talking about these parameter values as triggers  I guess I view them a   little differently  I view them more as an escape clause  If they are reached or other conditions   fulfilled, then we might tighten monetary policy  I guess I don’t view them as a trigger event    So I think that’s something that we’re going to have to settle if we go down this path as a   Committee—exactly what do these parameters mean when they’re reached?  Are they triggers or   are they escape clauses?  We should include both inflation and unemployment rate parameters   that might be viewed as necessary conditions for a rise in short-term rates, but I also think we   should include the date at which we think those conditions might be satisfied  And keeping the   date in there is important because if we just provide employment and inflation parameters market   participants are still going to try to work out what that means in terms of a date  If we don’t give   them a date, they’re still going to work out what the date is  And if they’re going to work out the   date, why not provide them with the date and give them more accurate information?  At the end   of the day, what they really care about is the path of future short-term rates, and therefore that   date is very key in terms of determining their expectation  Now, in terms of keeping the date in,   I don’t see the date as standing by itself  I see it as the logical consequence of our projections of   when the parameter values will be met  So the date is a follow-on from the parameter values    It’s in there, but it’s only in there because the parameter values are what drive it  Concerning the   date, if we had it in there, I wouldn’t be overly precise about adjusting it meeting to meeting  I   don’t think we want to say, “It’s August, and then it’s September, and then it’s back to August”    I would anticipate that, just as for the federal funds rate, we adjust in quarter-point increments,   we might adjust this in quarterly or six-month increments   September 20–21, 2011 85 of 290              The next question was on the language in paragraphs 2 and 4 of alternative A  I think   there’s some reluctance to proceed with paragraph 2 for a whole variety of reasons, but one of   them is this notion that the Congress might need to be informed of actually pursuing an explicit   inflation objective before proceeding with that  If you thought that was an issue, I think there’s   another way to go  A lot of people around the room thought that maybe we shouldn’t go with an   explicit inflation target and should rely more on the SEPs  In my mind, as an alternative, you   could dispense with paragraph 2 altogether, and in paragraph 4 you could add a sentence after   the parameter values that read something like this  “Because the unemployment rate is projected   to remain far above its long-run projections for the next few years, the Committee is willing to   tolerate temporarily a move in inflation slightly above the rate it projects is likely in the long run   in its central tendency SEP projections”  What that would be basically saying is explaining why   the inflation parameter is 2½ percent rather than 2  It’s not a target  It’s just something that   you’re willing to tolerate for a short period of time because you’re so far away from your   employment objective  It makes it clear that the Committee is not changing its long-term goal   for inflation  I think that is a potential alternative to paragraph 2 and it’s something we can   discuss further   In terms of the SEP, just a few general thoughts  The SEPs can also be part of this whole   process  Right now we have an SEP in which we write down our forecast, but the SEP could   actually be used as part of this trigger mechanism development process  We could ask questions   in the SEPs that said, “When do you think your forecast is going to hit these parameter values?”    And people could answer that question, and it would be interesting to see how people mapped   the parameter values in terms of where they came out regarding dates  So maybe we should   think about the SEPs as providing a somewhat richer mechanism for figuring out what   September 20–21, 2011 86 of 290              appropriate triggers are and what appropriate exit dates are  I have a lot of sympathy with people   around the table who say the statement can only do so much  I think we’ve been asking an awful   lot of our poor little FOMC statement over the past couple of years  And maybe we need to   think about alternative ways to take a little bit of pressure off the statement  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Just one idea that people have batted around, which I’m   not sure is a good idea, but people have talked about an alternative of going slowly to a lower   IOER to see what happens?  Because I’m not sure it’s a good idea, I’m not really supporting it    That’s something that I don’t think the staff has really looked at in detail  For example, an   alternative is that you move it to 20 and you see what happens  And if nothing bad happens—  [laughter]—you keep going    You walk onto the ice pond    Larry, your view on the likelihood of recession was   independent of events in Europe—at least that’s how I took it  So let’s say, Steve, that you’re   wrong and I’m wrong; Europe does not muddle through, and we get the worst case  How does   that, then, affect the view of the US?    It didn’t seem negative enough to me when I read it    [Laughter]   September 20–21, 2011 119 of 290               I think what’s hard to capture is that if something bad   happens in Europe, it’s not just a GDP feedback loop—it’s a market feedback loop  And I think   back in 2008, we underestimated how powerful that can be    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As we’ve all, I think, noted   around the table, the economic outlook continues to disappoint, with the near-term growth   prospects weak and increasing downside risks to growth  At the same time, the inflation data   indicate somewhat greater underlying inflation pressures at present  I’m much more worried   about the former than I am about the latter   In terms of the reasons why we don’t have forward momentum, most of the reasons don’t   have that much to do with monetary policy  Monetary policy is a factor, but a lot of other things   are going on  First, I think that the failure of Democrats and Republicans in Washington to play   nice has actually been quite damaging to household and business confidence  Second, we’re not   getting the full benefits from lower longer-term rates in terms of refinancing because   September 20–21, 2011 158 of 290              homeowners have mortgages that are under water, and those mortgages are very difficult to   refinance  High GSE fees are also an important factor  Third, as noted by many, the struggles in   Europe to wrestle with the inherent contradictions of the euro-system model remain an important   impediment to easier financial market conditions, and they pose the greatest downside risks to   the growth outlook  Fourth, I think when the outlook does turn darker, this leads to a sharper   pullback in confidence than before the financial crisis  Businesses and households that   remember the dark days of 2008 and 2009 are quicker to react to indicators—for example, big   declines in the equity market—that might foreshadow future weakness than they were in the   past  Fifth, I hear a lot from businesses about how regulatory uncertainty is weighing on activity    I really have a lot of trouble judging how important this factor is, but clearly it’s cited often, and   we know what the sign is at least  It’s in the negative direction  And then finally, I do think   monetary policy has been a factor here because we’ve overstated the impetus of monetary policy   to economic growth  We believe that monetary policy is more powerful in pushing the economy   forward than it actually has been, and this is something that I raised in previous meetings  I think   what’s happening is that we’re sitting here with what we believe is a very accommodative stance   for a long period of time, but the accommodation is essentially wearing off in the sense that a   given stance of monetary policy has less effect on financial conditions over time and the   financial conditions have less effect on real economic activity over time  So you start needing   increasing monetary policy accommodation to have the same impetus to economic growth   On the inflation side, I think we do have to acknowledge that the underlying inflation rate   has drifted up more than generally expected, with the core CPI now running 2 percent on a year-  over-year basis, but we have to also recognize that 2 percent on the core CPI is not a really high   inflation rate  We need to put that in context  I take considerably less signal from that than   September 20–21, 2011 159 of 290              developments on the activity side  First of all, some of the factors pushing up inflation are likely   to prove temporary, tied to the rise in commodity prices passing through into other goods and   services and the temporary supply disruption that we saw to motor vehicle production, which   then fed into auto prices  Second, one of the things that is causing a rise in core inflation is the   rise in rents, and it’s hard to get really worried about the rise in rents as a start of an ongoing   inflation problem, given that the overhang of unsold homes that’s emerging from the foreclosure   process continues to be very, very sizable  Third—and this is, I think, the most important thing   for me—labor cost pressures remain very subdued  The average hourly earnings are 19 percent   year over year  The employment cost index is about 2½ percent year over year, and inflation   expectations are well anchored  I thought the recent GM settlement was a sign of lack of   inflation pressure in the pipeline, as they basically signed for a bonus as opposed to ongoing   wage increases  So I don’t see much risk that the rise in core inflation will prove persistent  I’m   pretty comfortable with the Tealbook forecast, which has core inflation gradually trending down   over the next year or two  When precisely that happens, I don’t know  If core inflation drifts up   for a few more months, that wouldn’t really change my mind about the longer-term outlook   I think that, as everyone has noted, on the financial stability side, the biggest risks stem   from Europe  The next few weeks, in particular, are going to be very problematic because it will   take at least this long for the 17 European parliaments to enact what was agreed to on July 21,   and we all have to be discouraged by how long it’s taken—from July 21 to when this is actually   enacted  In the meantime, no further broadening of the EFSF seems likely, which is important   because we really do need that to backstop Italian and Spanish debt issuance  During this period,   there’s lots of scope for event risk, ranging from the Greek government not doing enough to get   the blessing of the IMF and EU for further disbursements to difficulties in passing the legislation   September 20–21, 2011 160 of 290              in the parliaments of Europe  I think the Slovaks have said they’re not going to pass it until   everyone else has passed the legislation  If someone else takes the same posture, well, when   does it actually get passed?   The intensifying funding pressures for European banks are an issue, and of course,   there’s the prospect of further sovereign and bank credit rating downgrades  Yesterday, for   example, out of the blue, Italy was downgraded by S&P, and you certainly have to know that if   there’s going to be surprises on that front, they are all going to be in one direction  Last week   was actually a good one among the past few weeks, but as we saw yesterday, these things can   turn around on a dime  I wouldn’t take any comfort from that   In my view, in addition to the European governments demonstrating that they’re willing   to take the necessary steps to keep them on a sustainable fiscal path—the governments have to   do the right thing—two other steps are really needed  First, there needs to be a more credible   backstop for primary Italian and Spanish sovereign debt issuance  In other words, doing the   right thing isn’t enough  The market is going to demand your demonstrating that over a longer   period of time  So you need something in the interim to get you over that gap  In my view, a   credible backstop that caps debt service costs would help reassure market participants that the   fiscal path was in fact sustainable  This also would be important because it would lessen jitters   about the European banks, although more capital for the banks might still be needed, even with a   fiscal sustainable path  The underlying problem, at least to my mind, is not bank capital but   uncertainties about the long-run fiscal sustainability  You take that uncertainty away, and a lot   of the bank issues become a much more manageable problem  I hope that once the parliaments   approve the current set of proposals, the next step will be figuring out how to leverage the EFSF   resources to create a credible backstop  The second problem is that the European leadership   September 20–21, 2011 161 of 290              needs to be clearer about how all of this is going to work over the medium term  Right now, we   have the ECB buying sovereign debt, but what happens after that?  A greater fiscal integration   really does appear to be necessary, but there’s no visibility on how that’s going to come about   In terms of the impact of all of this on the United States, I guess the good news to date, at   least, is that beyond much lower bank share prices, US banks have not been greatly affected    Their funding, unlike that of their European counterparts, is really holding up—we don’t really   see signs of any problems for the US banks  And as noted by others, their capital levels and   liquidity buffers are much greater than a few years ago  But I don’t take a lot of comfort in that    If the EMU were really to rupture, the damage to the US banks and the US economy would be   extraordinarily severe, almost regardless of what we do here to prepare ourselves  That’s why I   think the most important thing we can do is encourage the Europeans to recognize the danger and   act proactively  We have been doing that in several ways  We have been encouraging the   Europeans to extend the maturity of their dollar swap auctions  The 84-day operation was at   least partly at our suggestion, and we’ve tried to make it very clear to the ECB that people in the   United States are unclear about the ECB’s willingness and ability to lend to European banks  So   we’ve tried to encourage them to be more public about the capacity, the willingness, and the   ability of the ECB to lend to backstop their institutions  Jean-Claude Trichet has pointed out   more recently, I think, some pretty interesting numbers  The ECB currently is lending about   €500 billion to European banks  The total collateral pledged to the ECB is €1½ trillion to   €2 trillion  Thus, there’s plenty of capacity there, and the total collateral in the system that could   be pledged to the ECB is €4 trillion to €5 trillion  So it’s true that a few very unhealthy banks   have run out of collateral, Greek banks and a few others, but most banks actually do have the   capacity to borrow from the ECB  To remove the sense of uncertainty, at least a little bit, the   September 20–21, 2011 162 of 290              Europeans and we could point out to people that there’s really not a problem with liquidity for   European banks  The ECB has the capacity to provide them with liquidity in euros and in   dollars   I would not take any comfort in the fact that bilateral exposures to particular banks and   countries look manageable  We always say, “Well, how big is the US exposure to Italy,” or   “How much is the US exposure to German banks?”  And on a bilateral basis, everything always   looks pretty manageable  The 2008 experience, I think, underscores the fact that there are   numerous contagion channels, and so bilateral measures of risk exposure provide really a lot of   false comfort under these kinds of circumstances  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I’ll give my answer, and then Steve can give his answer    My take on it is that getting it through the parliaments is so problematic that they don’t want to   add any noise to the process by talking about their need to upsize it or leverage it  I think they   want to get it through the parliaments first with its expanded powers  And then once they have   the expanded powers—it’s like TARP in the United States  Once TARP got through, it got used   for totally different things than what it was originally proposed for  [Laughter]   September 20–21, 2011 163 of 290               My view is that after the parliament has passed the   legislation, there may be fuller discussion about how to leverage the EFSF to maybe backstop   Spanish and Italian debt, but there’s a reluctance to put that on the table today because that could   make it much more difficult to actually get it passed through all of these parliaments    Very much so    What I hear the staff saying is that the effect on Treasury   yields is quite small because, one, you’re not moving that much money away from the Treasury   market and, two, the program is still going to be as big or bigger than expectations  In addition,   it will also have a pretty sizable effect on the mortgage basis because it is unanticipated  It’s   going to change the whole risk–reward perception of private investors in the mortgage market   because they are going to realize that if the mortgage basis winds out dramatically, the Fed is   now more likely to intervene, and that’s going to change the dynamics in the mortgage market    Now, why would you do it in terms of who gets the benefit?  Well, I think the marginal   propensity to consumer of people who are refinancing is probably pretty high relative to other   participants in the economy who might be affected by that couple of basis point backup in   September 20–21, 2011 201 of 290              Treasury bills  And, too, there’s an ancillary, broader benefit to the extent that you can make   housing markets slightly less distressed  While the benefits are obviously hard to quantify, if the   housing sector is in a little bit better shape, that has a whole other set of benefits    Assume you have a demand curve for mortgage rates,   the demand will be slightly stronger for housing than it was before if mortgage rates are a little   bit lower, and I think that has consequences for households    My critique of that is, I think it is very important that the   first paragraph be a statement of what we see, not a view about our forecast or our expectations    It should be a description of our view of reality  When you say “is expected to,” then you are   getting into something more forward-looking, and I am not in favor of that    I would say that’s too strong    Not off the table  The bar is high    I was very clear yesterday that we have to set policy   based on what we think is right  But if the politics wreck the efficacy of the policy tools, then we   have to take that into consideration as an environmental factor  There is an important distinction   between the two    If the policy caused people to think that LSAPs would   lead to a big inflation problem or loss of confidence in the Fed’s credibility, the policy would be   less effective, and so we might decide that the cost-benefit analysis is no longer favorable    You’re not not pursuing the policy because of the political pressure, you’re not pursuing the   policy because the political pressure is going to undermine how well the policy instrument works   in practice  That’s an important distinction, I think    I think it can work through a whole variety of ways  It   could affect inflation expectations; it could affect our future credibility  I think there are a lot of   channels    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, a couple of   observations on the Taylor rule  I’ve never liked it, and I particularly don’t like it in the current   set of circumstances  The reason I don’t like it in the current set of circumstances is that I think   that it doesn’t really work well because we know that the equilibrium real rate of interest is not   anything close to 2 percent, which is assumed in the rule  We could actually solve backwards    We’ve seen the economy perform very, very poorly despite what’s supposedly a very stimulative   monetary policy  Well, why is that?  Because the monetary policy hasn’t been as stimulative as   we thought, and that underscores one fundamental flaw of relying on the Taylor rule as your   guide to policy   A second problem with the Taylor rule is that we have an economic situation where the   losses are very asymmetric  If we turn out weaker than we want or expect, there’s a really good   chance we’re going to end up in a debt deflation, Japanese-style trap and we’re not going to be   able to get out  The losses on that side are very high relative to the losses if things turn out to be   a little bit better than we expect, and if we get a little bit more inflation than we expect  In that   environment, even if we thought that the Taylor rule was the right formulation, we should be   following a policy easier than the Taylor rule because of this asymmetric loss function  That’s   about the big picture stuff  Let’s get down to the statement   First of all, I’m a little bit worried that the markets are going to take what we do today as   us being done  In other words, we’re doing the maturity extension program because the bar is   September 20–21, 2011 245 of 290              too high to do an LSAP, and so that’s it  We want to lean against that expectation  In   alternative B, paragraph 6, rather than have the phrase “employ its tools as appropriate,” I would   prefer to strengthen that a little bit to say “to employ the full range of its tools as appropriate”    Keep it open ended, indicating that we could do more should things continue to go badly, which   they very well might over the next six weeks  The second point is on paragraph 4  I do favor   investing MBS into MBS  But I would flip the sentence order in paragraph 4  I would put the   new policy action, “To help support conditions in the mortgage market, the Committee will now   reinvest…” and then I would follow with the second sentence, “The Committee will maintain its   existing policy”  This would give a little bit more prominence to the new policy action rather   than the thing that you’re maintaining  In terms of 3′ versus 3, I have quite a bit of sympathy   with what President Bullard has been saying on this, but I don’t think it works in this particular   case of the maturity extension program because you can do less, but you can’t do more  You’re   limited at $400 billion by the nature of the constraints on our balance sheet  If we were ever to   do an LSAP, I would be inclined to do 3′ because there is some value to having something that   you can stop earlier or you can keep going  But in the case of the maturity extension program,   there is no option to keep going beyond nine months  So I think that 3′ is actually weaker than 3,   and I do not support it in this particular set of circumstances   In terms of alt A, I would prefer to have more information that we could share with   people about our reaction function  I don’t think the date is really sufficient, but yesterday’s   conversation made it very clear there was no consensus on how exactly to do that  We should   look at the SEP and try to discover what our ranges of views are on this subject, both in terms of   what triggers would be interesting to us and whether any broad consensus would come out of   September 20–21, 2011 246 of 290              those numbers  We may find that there’s no consensus and that this is a blind alley, but if there’s   a reasonable consensus, then maybe the SEP is something that can support this going forward   And finally, I absolutely favor contingency planning in this environment  This is about   as dark as the Committee has been regarding the downside risks that I can remember since   maybe the dark days of the fall of 2008  The European situation, in particular, looms very large    We absolutely have to have contingency planning not just about our monetary policy stance, but   also about what liquidity facilities we would deploy and in what manner  In other words, what’s   our program escalation should things go in the wrong direction for market functioning?  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    That’s fine with me      It should be a vote for B    Are you proposing a videoconference or something like   that?  "
9328,2011-11-01,"  Thank you  I have a question  It seems like the way you   have presented it implies that the nominal GDP targeting implied a lower trigger or a lower   threshold for exit  Do you need the actual framework of nominal GDP targeting to generate   these outcomes?  Or could you just actually have the lower trigger threshold?  And would that be   sufficient?  I mean, how does the staff view the articulation of the framework vis-à-vis how that   maps into the trigger?  I am not sure I am being clear    I am trying to get at a point—how much of the benefit   do you get by having the trigger values out there versus the framework out there?  I am trying to   understand how you parse those two things    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought the staff work was   excellent and thank them for all their efforts   November 1–2, 2011 74 of 282              I am not convinced our current framework is obviously inferior to some of the alternative   frameworks that have been proposed  I think market participants do know what our long-term   inflation objectives are  If you look at the SEP’s long-term inflation, it is in a very narrow range    I think market participants have a pretty good understanding that we have something close to a   quadratic loss function  All you have to do is compare and contrast how we have reacted to the   inflation and unemployment news in the US compared to Europe, and you see quite a bit   different path   What we should be focusing on is not so much frameworks but providing more insight to   the public about what our reaction function is  My emphasis would be on reducing the   uncertainty about how we would likely react under a wide range of circumstances  By doing   that, we can accomplish two things  One, we can reduce uncertainty about how monetary policy   is likely to evolve, which should have favorable implications for risk premiums, therefore,   making financial conditions more accommodative  And, two, it would help markets to think   along better with us, so it may enable market participants to better anticipate our future actions    That means prices could adjust more rapidly to the receipt of new information on the economy or   political developments that might affect the outlook   Now, having said that, I want to provide more information about our reaction function  I   don’t think that is a very simple task  Not only are there 17 different reaction functions around   the table, but it is also difficult to reduce those reaction functions into a simple two- or three-  parameter mapping  For example, specifying what the unemployment rate and the inflation rate   forecast is likely to be as a precondition for exit, is probably too simplistic for most of us; other   parameters might also be important, for instance, speed limits—how fast the unemployment rate   November 1–2, 2011 75 of 282              is falling or inflation is rising—or the risk around the central forecast—if there is a very big skew   in the outlook   Despite this, I think we can do more to overcome some of these problems  First, we can   provide greater detail about our individual forecasts, and we could aggregate this detail into   consistent central tendency projections with respect to the inflation rate, unemployment rate, and   the path of the federal funds rate   Second, we can explore in greater detail the degree of agreement within the Committee   about what parameter values would be important in their view in influencing when exit might be   likely  If the dispersion turns out to be relatively narrow, then we could actually move down this   path, hopefully over the next couple of meetings  In this respect, in terms of the trigger values, I   would much prefer escape clauses rather than triggers, because it gives us a little bit more   flexibility  It allows a little bit more nuance  The fact that you only have two parameters with   escape clauses is implicitly saying that those aren’t the only things that are important to you  In   my mind, expressing parameters with respect to inflation and unemployment is quite a bit   superior to a date  For one thing, we are probably going to move the parameters around a lot less   frequently than we want to move around a date  I have a lot less uncertainty about what my   parameter values on unemployment and inflation are likely to be than I do about the date  I have   no idea when we are actually going to exit  I have a point forecast, but there is a wide range   around that  Conversely, I have a relatively narrow range around the parameter values of   unemployment and inflation that might trigger an exit   In terms of the types of foreign commitments discussed in the staff memo, I am skeptical   that there are significant benefits, because I don’t know how we can tie our hands credibly—a   point that many others have made—and I don’t think the model assumptions about how market   November 1–2, 2011 76 of 282              participants form their expectations is necessarily correct, coming to the point about your   brother-in-law   Finally, I worry that making binding commitments might be viewed as potentially   reckless in a world where the outlook is highly uncertain  If people thought we were making   binding commitments and then we got a very bad draw relative to our modal forecast, we would   then be committed to generating something that could be potentially a very unpleasant outcome    Market participants would price that in immediately as a potential risk   In terms of the alternative frameworks, I have some skepticism about a nominal GDP   targeting regime  It is very difficult to explain, and it seems to bless outcomes in terms of   growth and inflation combinations that we might not be happy with  It seems to suggest that   5 percent real GDP growth and 0 percent inflation is equivalent to 0 percent real GDP growth   and 5 percent inflation  The former would be terrific, and the latter would be pretty horrible    Explaining that in the context of nominal GDP target would be very difficult   In terms of price-level targeting, I see some value in environments in which deflation   expectations are a problem  The PLT could be helpful in those particular circumstances in   anchoring inflation expectations  Thank you, Mr Chairman    It’s fair to say that we don’t think Treasury has adjusted   their behavior in response to our behavior  It sounds like that’s the key point    Deposits would probably be a little less  Their bank is   probably a little smaller    I would guess more, because remember, they bought   Washington Mutual, which had a lot of core deposits  The repo books have generally come   down over the past couple of years  I would guess more, but I don’t think it’s so significant that   you’d think they were in a very different position    Yes, just a few things  This is the first significantly   sized FCM, futures commission merchant, that’s failed in a way that they didn’t actually port the   customer accounts off smoothly to some other entity  There’s a little bit more uncertainty here   because it has never happened like this before  In the past, there has always been a smooth   transfer of accounts   The second thing I would say is that it underscores how fast liquidity can dry up for a   firm  This is another firm that, while I wouldn’t say they were fine a week ago, they didn’t look   like they were headed to collapse, and a week later they’re dead  That is going to reinforce   November 1–2, 2011 106 of 282              people’s anxiety about firms that are wholesale funded without any obvious lender-of-last-resort   support from the central bank  I think as long as other firms stay out of trouble, it’s not an issue,   but if they get into trouble, people may actually pull back faster as a consequence   And the third thing, of course, is that this was triggered in part by, as Brian mentioned,   European sovereign debt exposure  To the extent that things in Europe deteriorate, other firms   are viewed as having exposure to Europe, and that’s another aspect of this  But so far we would   say, and I think Brian and I would both agree, that the selloff in the market today really has very   little to do with MF Global    SIPC is on the case now as a trustee, so they are trying   to manage these accounts  But I think there is definitely some freezing of assets and people not   being able to execute this stuff    FTC rules on it for the FCM  And they were not a big   firm, about $40 billion or $45 billion in assets, but they were very big in the commodities space    I think this is probably viewed as a pretty idiosyncratic   case  But, like I said before—wholesale funding model, dependence on repo, exposure to   Europe—our base case is that the contagion channel should be small, but there is some risk    Brian, would you agree with that?    If you feel we are going in the right direction rather than   seeming to go in the wrong direction in terms of market sentiment, you would probably be less   nervous about this    Yes     What was unusual in this case was the fact that in the   segregation of the customer accounts there was a shortfall, and that is gumming up the works, in   a different way than you would expect in a normal case    I don’t know I think there was a press report about the   CME saying that they were aware of problems with the customer—    —segregated assets, but I don’t have any details on that    Yes  Morgan Stanley, we believe, has a very large   liquidity cushion  The MF Global experience showed you that whatever liquidity cushion you   have can run off a lot faster than you expect  Morgan Stanley is starting with a much better   balance sheet than MF Global was, and they have been actually earning money  One of the   precipitating events for MF Global was that they took a very large loss in the most recent quarter    That was really what started this thing spinning last Tuesday    I don’t think this was about people shorting the CDS and   driving down the stock price  This is all about the fundamentals of the company; that would be   my opinion    I don’t think we know whether they are insolvent or not    We know they can’t meet their obligations, but that doesn’t mean when they are all liquidated   that the value of the assets couldn’t be a lot greater than the value of the liabilities  We don’t   know that  The fact is that their long-term debt, which they have a small piece of, is trading at   about, last time I saw, in the 35 to 45 percent per dollar range, which suggests that the market   thinks that they are most likely to be insolvent  But we are not going to know for a while    It was inefficient in the sense that there was not an   orderly bankruptcy process  It would be much better if there had been a way to move the   customer accounts to new firms, so that they didn’t get trapped  It was messier than optimal  Is   it systemic or not?  Fingers crossed, we hope not    I have a question for Steve  I want to clarify something   you said  When you were talking about the bank capital issue in Europe, you said “asked to   raise”  I’m not sure I would characterize it quite that way—in the sense that it’s a shortfall based   on a 9 percent capital ratio, but they’re not really forced to raise it; they’re just supposed to get to   a 9 percent capital ratio   November 1–2, 2011 130 of 282               Okay    They’re not really raising    All they have to do is get to the right ratio at the end of   the day  They could shrink to get to that ratio; they can change the risk-weighted assets  I just   wanted to clarify that    But that’s a loose EBA instruction    Thank you  The way I would characterize the outlook   is, we got a little bounce that we were hoping for  The positive of that is that the sharp drop we   saw in household and business confidence does not seem to have led to a pullback in hiring or   spending, but I think we shouldn’t get overimpressed by 2½ percent growth in the third quarter    Some of the bounce was due to temporary factors such as autos, and the increase in consumption   was accompanied by a pretty big drop in the household saving rate, which may indicate that   there is actually some stress on household balance sheets  And finally, some significant   obstacles to growth remain     In my mind, there are three key determinants of the outlook over the next few quarters    The first one is Europe, and we saw earlier how powerful the contagion was back to the US,   especially in terms of those financial intermediaries, like Morgan Stanley, that have very limited   access to the Fed’s lender-of-last resort function  If Europe goes badly, then there is a real risk to   the US financial system; and then, by extension, to financial conditions; and then to the real   economy  So although the bilateral exposures don’t look so great, the actual consequence would   be quite severe  On Europe, I agree with Steve’s characterization that there is lots of assembly   required, probably a few missing parts, and no real assurance that it’s going to work in practice   A couple of things I would note  The first thing about the Greek restructuring that’s   really quite interesting is that even with a 50 percent haircut, full participation of all of the   private-sector participants, optimistic assumptions on growth, and the fiscal austerity package   being implemented, they still end up with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120 percent in 2020  Now, the   November 1–2, 2011 169 of 282              reason why this is happening is that as more and more Greek debt gets socialized into official   hands like the ECB and the IMF, the haircuts to the private sector have very diminished   consequences to the total Greek debt burden  So I think that really raises a question  Is   50 percent restructuring enough, or is this the first in a series of Greek restructurings?  Or is   Greece ultimately going to default?   The second issue associated with the Greek restructuring that’s noteworthy is, it’s not   clear that this is being done in a way that actually makes other sovereign debt look more   attractive  You could argue that it makes it look less attractive because, one, you now have the   precedent of restructuring in place, and, two, as we discussed earlier, if the CDS are not   triggered, then you no longer have a way of hedging your sovereign debt  So I think in some   ways, this actually makes the rest of the European debt look a little bit less attractive  If you can   subordinate the Greek debt holders, the more that the ECB buys of Irish, Portuguese, Spanish,   and Italian debt, you’re essentially de facto subordinating those holders as well  And I think at   some point, they’re going to catch on to that   The second thing I would say about Greece—we talked about this before  the bank   recapitalization  They have a €106 billion shortfall  But press reports indicate that very little of   this is expected to be met by new investor equity  In fact, most of it’s going to be done by   retained earnings, changing business model, and deleveraging  I think one of the real key   questions is, how does that deleveraging hurt economic growth—and then does that feedback   make it more difficult to make progress in terms of fiscal consolidation?   Lastly, there are two more issues with Europe—the next one is, does the EFSF actually   have enough capacity to do all the things that they need to do?  The reason we have this   20 percent first-loss piece is that the EFSF has only €440 billion of capacity, and a lot of that   November 1–2, 2011 170 of 282              capacity is already spoken for in terms of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal  So you have a pretty   Rube Goldberg type of machine, and nobody really knows if investors are actually going to have   much appetite for this debt that has a 20 percent first-loss piece  And then the final thing, the   thing I think was probably the most disappointing regarding the European announcement—  there’s really no vision yet at all about where Europe is headed over the medium to longer run    What’s the exit strategy of all of these programs?  How are they going to enforce conditionality   in terms of fiscal consolidation on an ongoing basis?  How do these countries reenter the market   and actually issue debt to private investors two, three, four years down the road?  I’m pretty   pessimistic about what’s actually going to transpire in Europe  So that’s issue number one   Issue number two is housing, and I think there are a lot of problems there  Obviously, the   first problem is the high loan to value  Mortgage holders are locked into high-coupon   mortgages, and that’s basically impeding the power of monetary policy to actually support the   housing sector and household consumer spending  The second problem is the slow pace of   foreclosures that you highlighted, which is bad in itself, but it also creates a greater incentive to   default because if you already know it’s—what was it, 397 days until the foreclosure actually is   ended?     Sorry—900 days  You can live in the house for a long   time rent free before they actually catch up with you  Also, you have the problem of getting the   Real Estate Owned once it’s foreclosed back into the market  We have a very peculiar situation   right now where rents are rising despite the fact that we have a glut of unsold homes  And that’s   a really peculiar situation  Now, the good news, of course, is that the Administration is taking   another stab at helping high-loan-to-value households refinance  But as I read it, the program   November 1–2, 2011 171 of 282              seems pretty limited in scope, and the terms are not as generous as they could be  Also, the   Administration program is focused just on that one aspect of housing   I view housing as really essential because if you stabilized housing and housing prices   did stop falling, not only would that be good for the housing sector itself in terms of provoking   more demand for housing, but I think it would also be very important for household wealth and   household confidence  So it could actually have pretty significant effects for consumer   spending  But I don’t think we’re there yet   The last issue is fiscal policy  There are two real issues here  First, fiscal policy, in the   absence of policy action, is going to be turned sharply restrictive at the start of 2012  I think   we’re understating the potential significance of that  Second, we have policy dysfunction in   Washington, and that’s also important because it has an independent effect on household and   business confidence  In this respect, the outcome of the supercommittee deliberations is   important, not just for what they do or don’t do in terms of long-term fiscal consolidation—but   also, if they do something tangible, it will actually be good for household and business   confidence, and if they don’t, it won’t, because then we’ll just be on hold through the next   election   My view is that we’re going to see moderate growth over the near term  But until these   three issues—Europe, housing, and fiscal—are addressed in a way that takes them off the table, I   view the risk as very much tilted to the downside  Now, if all of them were addressed positively,   I could actually see the economy surprising on the upside  And the reason for that is, a lot of   people are on the sidelines, holding back, because they’re uncertain about the outlook  When I   talk to businesses, especially small businesses, I actually hear a lot of people say, “I’m okay, but   I’m not doing anything right now”  So if we could just take care of these three problems, we   November 1–2, 2011 172 of 282              could actually have a pretty good outlook  But unfortunately, there’s not a lot of power in this   room to do much about it  My own view is, we should be highlighting these three issues, and,   especially on housing and fiscal, we should be pressing the Washington policymakers, both   publicly and privately, to do something about these things  Thank you    Can I ask a clarifying question?    President Evans, in buying more assets, do you have a   preference in terms of what you would buy?     Thank you  First, I want to talk a little bit about the   “significant” point  I feel really strongly that it has to stay in, because if you take it out, you’re   basically saying that you now think the downside risks are insignificant  Does anyone around   the room think that the downside risks are now insignificant?  I agree that we were surprised by   November 1–2, 2011 230 of 282              the reaction of the markets last time to putting “significant” in  But it’s very different keeping it   in as opposed to taking it out  If you’re taking it out, you’re trying to make a statement that you   think the risks have really declined significantly     I just don’t see any evidence that the downside risks have declined significantly—in fact,   at all  The European situation is probably at the worst place that it’s been  It’s also completely   inconsistent with what we’re saying in the SEPs  If you look at the SEP results, uncertainty   about GDP growth went up compared with June; downside risks to GDP growth are the same as   June—11 versus 6  If you look at the risks to unemployment, they have gone up since June  So   how do you reconcile taking “significant” out here, and then you have all of this uncertainty that   you’re going to discuss in the SEP results?  I just don’t see the benefit  I think it could be really   embarrassing for the Committee if you take it out, Europe falls apart, and people go back and   say, “Well, what were you thinking?  Didn’t you see what was going on in Europe as you were   going into the meeting?”   Now, in terms of other things, obviously I’m going to support alternative B  I prefer to   stick with the date rather than move to the quarters  I understand the argument for the quarters,   but we’re on a trajectory here where we’re hoping—at least some of us around the table are   hoping—that by January we can arrive at a framework where we actually specify triggers or   thresholds  And in that case, the thresholds will be the key thing, and then the date will follow   from that  I don’t think it really makes sense to go to quarters and then go to this new thing—  you’re going in a zigzag pattern  So I don’t really oppose the idea of the quarters conceptually,   but I don’t think it really fits in, in terms of the trajectory of how we might like to move through   the meetings   November 1–2, 2011 231 of 282               Okay  Well, let me continue  The other thing I want to   talk about is, we need to really think clearly through what our escalation options are in the near   term, because there are significant downside risks  So I think we could actually not have the   luxury of getting all the way to January to pursue the thresholds approach  Regarding the near-  term escalation option, there are really two things that I would favor if we had to go down this   path  One is that I much prefer MBS over Treasuries at this point, subject to the capacity   constraints in terms of how much we can do without disrupting market function  And the reason   why I favor MBS over Treasuries is, it’s easier to make the case that this is more directly tied to   one of the key issues that we’re facing, which is housing  It’s easier to tie it more directly to   private-sector financial market conditions, and it also would have less political noise associated   with it  I don’t think that we should pay that much attention to the political noise per se, but the   political noise can make policies less effective  So to the extent that there’s less political noise of   doing MBS versus Treasuries, I think it is significant in terms of the efficacy of the policy   choice   Regarding where we’re heading over the next couple of meetings, I very much hope that   we can get to the point where we can actually turn the date into thresholds, with the date actually   following from the thresholds rather than just standing out there in space  As I said yesterday,   November 1–2, 2011 232 of 282              I’m very uncertain about what the date is  I’m considerably less uncertain about the thresholds,   so I think the thresholds are, in some way, a better metric to give the markets  The second thing   with thresholds is that they give the market the ability to update its view of how long policy is   going to stay accommodative dynamically as it gets new information and the outlook changes    So that’s something that I’m hoping we can work toward  Obviously, I think it’s going to be   difficult   The second thing I think we need to think about—and this is something that we talked   about; we got a briefing from the staff at the videoconference—was that we may need to think   about bringing back a better liquidity backstop for our financial system if Europe really gets into   great difficulty  The very rapid failure of MF Global underscores the fact that the broker–dealers   in the United States do not have a credible lender-of-last-resort backstop  And so it’s very   possible that we may have to do something very quickly on the liquidity front to backstop the   financial system  One thing I think that it’s very important for us to stress in our public remarks   is that despite the Dodd–Frank Act, we still have both the ability and the will to perform our   lender-of-last-resort function, because I think there’s a little bit of confusion in the market about   whether we would actually be willing to act  Obviously, we didn’t have a discussion at that   videoconference, but my reading of the body language is that there’s quite a bit of support on the   Committee that lender of last resort is a legitimate central banking function  I think we should   make it clear to people where the Committee stands on that in our public commentary  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    I think this is a really great question  You really don’t   want to point fingers  "
9356,2011-11-28,"  To clarify on the release of the primary dealer survey,   we’re talking about releasing just the questions, not the actual results of the survey    I strongly support this  I think creating a more effective   backstop for dollar liquidity is important  The way that it’s being proposed will signal   international policy coordination; we’ve seen historically through the crisis that international   policy coordination is perceived by the market very favorably  And cutting the rate will   encourage somewhat more usage, which will help destigmatize the facility  A destigmatized   facility is a more effective backstop than one that’s heavily stigmatized  I think the outcome   we’re trying to seek here is that by having a more effective dollar backstop, we’ll have less   forced deleveraging by European banks of their dollar books of assets  How fast they deleverage   those books of assets has real consequences for the United States’ economy  That’s really the   connection in terms of what’s in it for us; I think there really is something in it for us, and we   shouldn’t lose sight of that    Yes  I think you’re absolutely right—we don’t know for   sure  We want some increase in usage because if we didn’t get an increase in usage, it would   just show us that the swap lines were still very stigmatized  So we want some increase in usage,   which would serve to destigmatize the swaps, make them more effective as a backstop, and   therefore keep more private-sector players in the game  I think you’d see some increase in   usage  How much depends on how well we actually are destigmatizing the facility so it serves as   an effective backstop  I don’t know if it would be substantial or small  All we can say is that   reducing the rate from 100 basis points to 50 basis points does two things  One, it increases the   economics of using the swap facilities to a degree; and, two, it allows people who had been   staying out to now say, “Oh, it’s now okay to use this facility”  If you have a number of people   use it rather than just two or three, then the facility becomes destigmatized, and so it becomes   more effective as a backstop  That’s how I see it   November 28, 2011 28 of 40               I just wanted to make the very simple point that we think   it’s highly unlikely that we’d ever be lending foreign currencies to US depository institutions or   other financial institutions  So all of this discussion about how these bilateral swap lines would   actually work in practice is, as you said, hypothetical—extremely hypothetical  My   understanding of why the bilateral swap lines are even on the table is that this is just something   that the other central banks would like to see to signal the greatest degree of international policy   coordination, as opposed to a need that we think we actually are, under any reasonable scenario,   likely to ever have  "
9371,2011-12-13,"  Two questions  If you looked at the estimated stall   probability and put down your forecast for Q4, what would it look like?  That’s question number   one  Question number two is the saving rate—if you look at the personal saving rate, it has   declined a lot, but if you look at other measures like flow of funds, they don’t show   commensurate kind of declines    GDI in the fourth quarter should be quite a bit better I   would guess because you have inflation coming down  You have okay employment growth   December 13, 2011 19 of 198               Okay  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly agree with the   consensus around the table that the near-term activity data show more forward momentum in the   economy  For us, it looks like real GDP will grow around 3½ percent or a little bit more at an   annualized rate in the fourth quarter   However, I still would be quite cautious about the implications of this for growth in 2012   and beyond  Two things that I want to highlight  First, we still have not made much progress in   terms of the housing sector  To the extent that households and lenders fear that home prices will   December 13, 2011 63 of 198              fall further, this fear affects both the demand for housing and the supply of housing credit, and   this constrains activity and reinforces the downward pressures on housing prices  If this dynamic   could be broken, it would be a very positive development, which would make me more confident   in the outlook  If households and lenders had a more optimistic view about the trajectory of   home prices, this would increase housing demand and the supply of credit, and that would   stimulate residential investment  Moreover, if we actually could see rising home prices, that rise   would support household confidence and wealth, and also provide support to consumer spending    I have been making the case publicly for a number of actions that could be taken to help support   the housing market  The Administration’s proposals to reinvigorate the HUD program are one   element of that, but there is much more that should be done and could be done to support the   housing sector, and I would encourage all of us to make those points, because that is something   that the Congress and the Administration could actually make further progress on   The second thing I want to talk about is Europe  I think the considerable risks of Europe   are worth highlighting  The good news, of course, that Steve talked about was that the European   authorities have continued to move in the direction that reinforces the commitment to fiscal   discipline and should provide greater resources to backstop sovereign debt issuance as these   countries take steps to get on a sustainable path and restore their credibility  Steve highlighted   all the number of steps that have been taken in that respect  However, I still have much doubt   whether this will be sufficient  First, it is unclear whether the backstop for private debt issuance   by such countries as Spain and Italy is sufficiently strong to encourage private investors to roll   over their maturing debts, let alone take on new debt  You simply may not be able to put the   toothpaste back in the tube now that investors understand how risky their sovereign debt   holdings are  It’s not just a question of the risk of default; it is also how volatile the market is,   December 13, 2011 64 of 198              where Italian and Spanish bonds can move 2 to 3 points in a day up or down  Even if they now   have much more of this debt than they want, how do you induce these investors to continue to   roll over their holdings as they mature?    The second issue, of course, is the ECB’s role  To the extent that the ECB does not   provide a solid backstop, this also sends a negative signal  Either the ECB is implicitly voting   thumbs down to what has now been negotiated, or the ECB is simply unwilling to provide such a   backstop regardless of the credibility of the fiscal commitments  Either way, it is a negative    There is no credible backstop  What is needed is a sufficiently credible backstop that reduces the   perceived risk of investment in sovereign debt, thereby encouraging private investors to roll over   their debt  To the extent that there is a less solid backstop, this is actually likely to lead to exit by   the private sector  And it is important to note that this has a perverse impact in that as the   holdings by the ECB and IMF climb, private holders perceive themselves as being increasingly   subordinated relative to the ECB and IMF, and that perception sets off a very bad dynamic  The   more the ECB purchases, it actually makes the existing stock held by the private investor   perceived as more risky   Third, there are other risks that we can face down the road  First, the fiscal austerity will   cause the economies to underperform, causing the countries to fall short of their budgetary   targets  Second, the poor performance will lead to further credit rating downgrades that will   undermine the efficacy of institutional structures like the EFSF  Or, the political process will   ultimately not support round after round of fiscal austerity   Europe has not committed to move to a fiscal compact in which fiscal resources are   pooled and obligations are mutual  There is no proposal for a path to a euro bond  Instead, the   so-called compact is simply an agreement to do what was not done before—keep each individual   December 13, 2011 65 of 198              country’s fiscal house in order in the future  This agreement means that the core issue—the   inherent shortcomings of a currency union with 17 independent sovereign countries without   fiscal integration—has not been addressed  As I see it, European economic performance at best   will be very poor and will restrain our exports  That’s the upside  At worst, the European Union   will come undone  In this case, obviously, the consequences for the US and US financial   institutions will be very severe, even though the direct sovereign debt exposure of major US   financial institutions to Europe is pretty modest   Up to now, the consequences of the crisis on US economic activity appear to have been   quite muted  Although European banks are actively deleveraging, there is little evidence that this   is significantly constraining credit in the United States  And although US bank shares have   fallen and CDS spreads have risen as the crisis has intensified, funding for the major US banks   and their broker–dealer subsidiaries has held up surprisingly well to this point  The credit rating   downgrades by S&P, which brought down the short-term ratings for a number of major US   bank holding companies to A2, has only had a very minor impact on these companies’ funding   or on their liquidity buffers, at least to date  But even here, I wouldn’t take too much positive   signal from this  Wholesale funding can be very fickle  The risk here is exacerbated by the fact   that we do not have a good lender-of-last-resort regime in place to support the major broker–  dealers of US firms either here or with respect to their large UK operations   Finally, a few comments about the swaps  I think lowering the swap rate was a good   decision  We saw a significant pickup in usage for the 84-day auction  That sent two messages   one, that there actually was a real need for dollar funding by these European institutions; and,   two, the fact that there was pretty broad participation should be effective in destigmatizing those   auction facilities  That should make the swaps a more effective backstop  The negative of the   December 13, 2011 66 of 198              swap decision is that swaps have now gotten the attention of the Congress, and there are really   two concerns about the swaps one is the lack of transparency and who the ECB is actually   lending to; and, two is the concern that somehow we are taking on a lot of risk     We should defend the swap program as very much an appropriate lender-of-last-resort   function of a central bank  We should explain to people what this swap program does in terms of   mitigating the degree of deleveraging that the European banks have to undertake, and that by   mitigating that deleveraging, there is really a positive consequence in terms of less strain on the   supply of credit to households and businesses  We haven’t really gotten our message out about   why we did this, why it was effective, and why this swap program is in the US’s interest  This   program isn’t just a freebie for the Europeans  Thank you    Thank you  I am willing to support Alternative B at this   meeting  I see the logic of taking a pause at this meeting  One, we see an improvement in the   recent data  Two, we see a high level of uncertainty about US fiscal policy and Europe  And,   three, we are contemplating some pretty significant steps in January where a policy action tied to   those communication steps might make it more powerful   Barring a significant change in the outlook, however, I would be inclined to pursuing   something along the lines of Alternative A at the January meeting  In particular, a focus on   purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities would be a good thing to do because it would   provide greater support to the economy relative to the alternative of additional Treasury   purchases  Alternative A, paragraph 4, talks about extending the date to the end of 2014—that   makes sense to me given where we are in terms of our own outlook  It would be useful if we   could get to the point where we could actually provide some guidance about what that date   means  Why did we decide on that date?  Because there were some unemployment–inflation   parameters associated with that, and it would be good for us to communicate that   December 13, 2011 109 of 198              In terms of thinking about further policy steps, the fact that the upside risks to inflation   appear to have subsided is very important  Future policy steps are about benefits and costs, and,   to the extent that inflation pressures really have come down significantly, the costs of future   policy actions are very definitely diminished  One of the earlier risks of large-scale asset   purchases was that these purchases were going to lead somehow to a significant increase in   inflation  There is very little evidence of that, and that reduces the cost of future action   In terms of paragraph 5, President Kocherlakota has convinced me; don’t make the   change  When you are making a change, people really scrutinize it  I don’t think that there is a   compelling case that things are so different at this meeting that we really would need to change   paragraph 5  I would be inclined to keep it the way it is    I support that change    Little split between the hawks and doves there    [Laughter]    Then it’s all worthwhile    I want to thank the subcommittee  This is very difficult,   and you made a tremendous amount of progress  I support the principles of providing the policy   projections in the SEP  However, the information provided by these projections would be even   more valuable if it were possible to associate each FOMC participants’ projected policy rate with   the projected policy paths for output growth, unemployment, and inflation   While the problem of unconnected information about the participants’ path of inflation   and real activity is already an issue in the current format of the SEP, when you include the policy   projections on top of that, it is just going to exacerbate the problem  In particular, under the   current format, it would be unclear why people are outliers in terms of their policy projections    December 13, 2011 162 of 198              Is it because they have different views on inflation or real activity?  Or do they have different   views in terms of the Fed’s appropriate reaction function?   Now, you could address this in a number of ways; let me just outline two alternatives    One alternative, which is the more difficult one, is to change what we mean by central tendency   projections, so that the central tendency is described across all of the variables of the forecast   jointly rather than each variable individually  That is going to be very difficult, because you are   going to have to figure out how that methodology works, and how you weight this year’s   forecast, next year’s forecast, and the following year’s forecast   If that’s not acceptable or possible, another alternative, which is much more   straightforward, is to publish each participant’s forecast without attribution  There would be   17 different forecasts identified anonymously for real GDP, the unemployment rate, inflation,   and the federal funds rate, or 16 if the Chairman chose to be excluded  I would suggest that we   should actually take a straw vote on this to see if there is support for this  I would probably   group the 17 into two groups—voters versus nonvoters—because it is relevant to market   participants where the outliers lie  That would even provide more information, but that is not   essential to this proposal   In terms of the balance sheet, I certainly support inclusion of the question  Do   respondents differ materially from the Tealbook?  With respect to publication starting in January,   I support that  But my view is that the ultimate objective should be along the lines of what   President Kocherlakota proposed, that we really should be trying to, at the end of the day, work   for a Committee view, rather than a collection of individual views  That is what our longer-term   goal should be   December 13, 2011 163 of 198              In terms of the statement, I can support the draft statement as it currently reads  There   are a few little changes that I would make  In paragraph 3, I would prefer the inflation objective   to be 2 percent “over time,” as opposed to “over the longer run”  That is actually what you are   really trying to achieve—to have inflation average 2 percent over time   Paragraph 5 is a bit vague right now, and that is part of the big-tent problem  I certainly   would be open to exploring if there is a way to make it less vague over time  Wherever we end   up, though, with paragraph 5, I think the Chairman is going to have to take the lead in explaining   what he thinks paragraph 5 means  You have to take paragraph 5, and then explain what flexible   inflation targeting means in terms of where you are  If the unemployment rate is high and the   inflation rate is high, you are probably going to think differently about things than if the   unemployment rate is high and the inflation rate is low  It would be very useful to the Chairman   to run through a few examples to take this very abstract paragraph 5 and give it a sense of how   the Committee is likely to think about it   As far as the living, breathing will, it is fine to reaffirm the document each generation    But like the consensus view around the table, I view this as constitutional, and so I would be   fixing the bar pretty high for making changes  I don’t think the statement should be up for a vote   where we make little language adjustments each year  There have to be real, substantive reasons   to make a change to the statement  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9395,2013-10-16,"  You mean the composition of receipts versus outlays?    The refunds go out early, and the receipts tend to come   in late  So I would imagine that February–March is probably pretty problematic    I was just going to make the point that Governor Powell   made, that the presumption that you could get to November 1 is predicated on two assumptions    one, that the Treasury is going to run down that cash balance to a much lower number, and, two,   that the auctions that are taking place over that period actually do occur and do settle  So there is   October 16, 2013 14 of 50    a risk of something going wrong even if you have more runway than you think  And I think we   would want to reflect on that a little bit    We had the Treasury bill auction—what, last week?—  where some of the dealers did not bid an amount equal to their market share of primary   dealership  They did not show up to their pro rata share  If two dealers wouldn’t show up to   their pro rata share, there’s always a risk that more wouldn’t  And they could actually potentially   have a failed auction    And the TAF also has the flexibility that you’re bidding   the date for settlement forward  So it doesn’t really solve your current liquidity need  I’m not   sure it’s that well suited for this particular set of problems    The auction takes place on day T, but then doesn’t settle   for several days, that’s how the original TAF was set up  So you have that delay between the   day when you bid and then you find out whether you actually won in the auction, and then you   get the money several days later  You can’t solve your term liquidity through the TAF    Presumably it would make it easier to continue to   auction securities because you’d know that anything that defaulted would subsequently have a   place to go    October 16, 2013 20 of 50     Assuming all of this gets resolved in a smooth way,   which is our hope, I think it would be very useful to get out, now, 1 to 5  If we do agree on 1 to   5, we should get that out in the marketplace  I think we saw it with the TPMG—the fact that the   minutes were out there was actually helpful to get it out in the debate  Now, I know that the   Treasury never wants to get this out in the middle of the situation because they view that as   making it more likely that you won’t get to agreement on the debt limit, but once we get it out   once, it will be out there forever, and I think that would be actually very reassuring  I think that   if we can find some low-risk medium, perhaps the minutes to this meeting, to get out the idea   that we agree on 1 to 5 in these kinds of situations would be very helpful    I take Governor Tarullo’s point, but you could list the   things that you are willing to do without saying that that’s exclusive  I mean, it could be “plus   whatever additional measures are necessary consistent with the Federal Reserve’s financial   stability mandate”  It’s being specific about certain things, like that we’re willing to take   defaulted securities at the discount window, which is quite different than saying what you would   do in terms of open market operations—for example, in terms of reverse repos  I think you can   be specific on certain technical issues, and you can be general on broader open market   intervention issues  I think you can reconcile those two views    Simon wanted to jump in    We couldn’t hear her either, Sandy    Simon, can I just add one thing?  I think there is a   general view that people have trouble perceiving why we wouldn’t do that, because they   recognize that not only do we wear the fiscal agent hat, which I think they are quite sympathetic   to, but they don’t understand our silence on monetary policy and financial stability issues  So I   think we’re in an awkward position when we don’t clarify our role in terms of financial stability   and monetary policy issues  This is going back to President Kocherlakota’s point    I support giving discretion to the Chairman on 6 and 7,   because you don’t really know exactly how market conditions are going to evolve  And you may   not always be able to call the FOMC together to decide, if things are moving very, very rapidly   Six seems like a little bit of an obscure one  But I can also imagine a problem where you could   actually have a lot of liquidity hoarding, lots of large cash balances built up at the clearing banks    And I can imagine that you might want to find another avenue for that cash to flow, and that   might be through the reverse repurchase full-allotment facility that we have in place today  One   thing you could do with respect to 6 is to give the Chairman the discretion to either raise the limit   or just take the ceiling off altogether  This isn’t going to be relevant once this is fully in place,   perhaps, but in the near term, if this comes up over the next few months, we might want to have   the ability for the money not to pile up at the banks but to have another way of flowing to the   Fed  So I think 6 is something we should think about   On 7, I think the repo market is much more the money market now than the federal funds   rate market  You know, in the old regime, you could sort of say the federal funds rate market   was really this deep, liquid market  But in the current regime, the fed funds market is tiny  The   repo market is really, really big, and so I think that you definitely want to have the ability to react   if the GC repo rate climbs above your target range of 25 basis points  I not only think it’s   completely consistent with our monetary policy mandate, but there’s also a financial stability   October 16, 2013 38 of 50    aspect to this as well, because if that’s happening, markets are probably going to be very   disrupted  I also think that there would be a separate benefit of potentially doing this  It would   have the effect of signaling that the Federal Reserve is concerned about what’s happening to   market functioning  And to the extent that we did intervene, that would be helpful in terms of   calming markets down  Imagine the opposite, if the repo rate climbed to 50 basis points and the   Fed just sat there on our hands  You can imagine that could lead to a whole bunch of knockout   effects, behaviors that we can’t even anticipate today that could actually make this an even   bigger financial stability issue  So I think it’s worthy to do for its own sake, from a monetary   policy perspective, but I also think there is a financial stability angle as well as a signaling effect   of the intervention that is much broader than the action itself  "
