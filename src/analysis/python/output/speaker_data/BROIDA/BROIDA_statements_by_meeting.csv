3,1976-03-29,"  I might add, Mr Chairman, that the original request we received from this  Mr Merrill was for the full Memorandum of Discussion  And in the course of the pleadings, the  request was narrowed to factual portions  I don’t know why [it was] narrowed, but that was all  that the judge was faced with in making this order  He requested factual portions     Perhaps     We ascertained it not by consulting with the foreign central bank but by  consulting with the staff [at] the New York [Federal Reserve] Bank  They gave us a judgment  on each of these points     The information was in the public domain     They sat down with the memorandum and read it all the way through and  identified those passages that pertained [to] information not in the public domain     No, that’s not--let me put it this way  There were a number of cases in  which they felt that the public interest would not be served by making this information available,  but we could not find any basis within the criteria that we had agreed upon for withholding it   And we talked it over and they agreed reluctantly, or less so, to our decision     This question gets rather subtle, Governor Holland  There was  information here on our own operations which is in the public domain  The question was     3/29/76 - 5 -    whether, by giving this information to the plaintiff, we had set a precedent such that, in the  future, we might have to make equivalent information available before it came into the public  domain     It was primarily on this issue that they expressed some concern     That’s correct   SPEAKER(?)  And that is the only thing that’s being appealed as of now?     Three weeks     We’ve left a little form on top of your packages for you to indicate  whether you would like these materials mailed to you at your [Reserve] Bank or whether you  don’t want them and would like us to destroy them  If you check the appropriate box, sign your  name and leave them at your place, we’ll pick them up  If you want to carry them with you,  leave it unsigned     Yes sir     3/29/76 - 9 -      Very, very few, Mr Chairman  I’d say perhaps [from] eight of the 12, or  maybe one or occasionally two comments, but most of the time we get no comment from the  [unintelligible]      I believe so     If a member dissented, that, of course, would be recorded, and his reason  for dissenting would be noted     All the law requires is that the vote, pro and con, be shown  The tradition  has been that there’s an explanation for dissents, [but] that would be at the member’s option,  obviously     That’s what I was going to suggest, Mr Chairman  We mentioned it in  the Record of Policy Actions this time; we could simply omit it and indicate that the Committee  had decided to stop setting two-month ranges for RPD and be more eclectic with respect to  reserve measures     Seven, Mr Chairman     Nine, Mr Chairman     Four     Eleven, Mr Chairman     Looks unanimous, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, as I understood the earlier agreement, it was that the  Record of Policy Actions would say that the Committee was considering a variety of reserve  measures and experimenting and was to decide which was the best  "
25,1976-04-20,"  Mr Chairman, thus far the Committee has not chosen to consider the  longer-run targets as a formal policy action  This originated in the inclination not to publish the     4/20/76 - 33 -           longer run--originally not the longer-run or the short-run targets  If it were a policy action, they  would have always been published  For a long time--until December 1973--we didn’t publish  the short run  Until April ’75, we didn’t publish the long run     At any time the Committee desires, it can make these a formal policy  action, in which case we will publish them as formal votes and show them in the Federal  Register, which we have not done but which is required for formal policy actions  They publish  the directive in the Federal Register, so we could agree to publish both the long-run and the  short-run targets in the Federal Register also     Mr Chairman, I think the consequences would be only good  In fact, it  was felt for a long time that the Committee would be in a much better position if these were  formal policy actions     I think all members have their hands up     Seven, Mr Chairman     Eight     Ten, Mr Chairman     Eight     Ten, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, would the Committee also like to instruct the Manager to  take account of various reserve measures, since we are no longer specifying RPD [reserves  available to support private nonbank deposits]?     During the course of study and experimentation     Chairman Burns           Yes  Vice Chairman Volcker    Yes  President Balles         Yes  President Black          Yes  Governor Coldwell        Yes  Governor Gardner         Yes  Governor Jackson         Yes  President Kimbrel        Yes  Governor Partee          Yes  Governor Wallich         Yes  President Winn           Yes   Eleven to nothing, Mr Chairman     Just that, the policy record     That’s right     Well, we do, of course, tape--we transcribe these meetings in preparing  the Memorandum of Discussion  We try to render the substance of discussion in official form,  omitting repetition and compressing the statements  But I think if the Committee was putting a  transcript of the meeting in the public domain, it would be unfortunate that we also put the  Memorandum of Discussion, however honest the rendition, simply because people could pick at  every single sentence in the thing  Every difference in it would be a subject for public comment   SPEAKER(?)  Wouldn’t it be a virtual impossibility to prepare both in terms of time, too?     Well, if we had sufficient staff  The transcript we have now is a rough  and ready one  We would have to be much more precise and careful in catching every specific  word  If we were going to publish it, then we could make it in better form, in other words     Not without distorting the discussion, I don’t believe  Facts are  introduced in passing in a large proportion of the statements that are made  Or what may be  considered arguable as facts, the court may find other facts, and I think it would make a hash of  the discussion if we had to suppress every fact     The decisions of the Committee, the actions of the Committee, would be  made public either in the Record of Policy Actions or in the Minutes of Actions, which are  available for public inspection downstairs  The kinds of material we’re proposing for  memoranda to files were informal understandings, agreements, and decisions, such as the--well,  to take the most recent example, the Chairman suggested this morning in connection with the  Swiss swap debt that a subcommittee work with the Treasury to see if we can get a Treasury     4/20/76 - 60 -           takeout  That’s an informal understanding, there was no vote, there’s no decision  We’d put that  in files and I would consider that to be procedural business of the Committee--that has no place  in the public record      The understanding was that the Desk would actually taper off the  holdings, but there was no formal change in the dollar limit as specified in the authorization  At  some point, a subcommittee was appointed to work with the staff on that and report in six  months  At that time, the Committee presumably would make a formal decision either to retain  or discontinue operations in bankers’ acceptances, and that would be reported     Oh, I’m sorry  There, there was no decision  And there was no formal  action  There was a proposal to go into finance bills, and the Committee decided not to adopt a  proposal     It has been treated consistent with our past practice as not a formal vote of  the Committee  They simply declined to accept a staff recommendation     Well, we can put as much or as little of that kind of understanding in the  Record of Policy Actions as the Committee desires  In the last six months of ’75, for example,  there were such understandings at almost every meeting, and we reported them in the Record of  Policy Actions  There was some discussion earlier this year about the desirability of excluding  that kind of--not reaching that kind of understanding formally, so that there would be no need to  report it  But if the Committee chose to report it, it certainly could be done     No, no, I was suggesting that the Committee would not reach  formal--would not formally reach an understanding with respect to the interpretation of the funds  rate; matters would be left to the Manager’s interpretation       Yes     If individual members make comments of that sort  The Memorandum of  Discussion plays it straight  If the members make such suggestions, it appears  If the Chairman  proposes this as part of the vote, then it would so appear     Mr Chairman, I think that is one possible arrangement, but I might point  out that the Minutes of Actions and the Record of Policy Actions are prepared for two rather  different purposes  The Record of Policy Actions is in compliance with a requirement of section  10 of the Federal Reserve Act that the Board include in its annual report a statement of all  decisions on open market policy taken by the Committee, the reasons for them, and the votes on  them  And it is confined primarily to policy actions, although from time to time we take  advantage of it to report actions that are of wide public interest, like changes in the guidelines for  operations in agency issues     The Minutes of Actions are more pro forma--a document which reports all actions of the  Committee, including all of the routine actions, such as approval of the minutes, agreement on     4/20/76 - 63 -           the next meeting, and so forth, and which for the most part are not [of great] public interest  We  do not maintain a distribution list; we make them available on file downstairs for anybody who  cares to consult them     Mr Chairman, our present practice is that, as soon as we can after the  meeting, usually the next day, we place on file downstairs a report of all actions taken by the  Committee except the policy actions which are specifically deferred under the rules     Yes     No sir, Mr Chairman  I think there might be some positives--that you  would not want to encumber the Record of Policy Actions with a lot of pro forma actions  The  cost goes the other way, of combining them--     It’s in two parts     Ten, Mr Chairman     I think there are four 5-week intervals in a year and eight 4-week  [intervals]     Eight times     Ten  I guess it’s unanimous  "
53,1976-05-18,"  That’s correct     May I add, the Memorandum of Discussion, of course, is a rather different  document from a verbatim transcript  It’s condensed and written in the third person and is  presumably a more efficient record of the meeting  But also, as I understand it, the parts of the  verbatim transcript that are not made public need be held only for two years and need never be  made public, whereas the Memorandum of Discussion, under present practices, is made public  after five years  But if there is a verbatim transcript under the Government in the Sunshine Act  that is made public in part or in whole, I think the Committee would certainly not want to have a  competitive report of the meeting in [existence] at the same time     I would say I agree with you, Mr Chairman, that there’s no present plan  to release them, but this is fully within the domain of the Committee, and the Committee at any  time could decide to make any package of these public  The occasions may well arise in the  form of requests under the Freedom of Information Act; presumably the response would be on an  ad hoc basis     There is a category of matters with respect to which the Committee  reaches conclusions that do not constitute formal policy actions or formal procedural action  A  case in point is the agreement in principle reached at the last meeting with respect to the matters  under discussion now  This was deliberately not a formal action, but it seemed to the staff  worthwhile that some record be made of that discussion, and we would simply propose to note it  in a memorandum to files     Now, at the March 29 meeting, a special meeting, there was an understanding that RPDs  would be dropped from the specifications  The specifications themselves, for reasons that have  been discussed earlier, are not formal actions, and so a change in the variables for which the  Committee makes specifications could not be a formal action  But in the staff’s view, [there]  should be some internal record of considerations underlying that action     We do     In this draft Record of Policy Actions for April, there is such a sentence     The point is that there is simply a sentence stating that the Committee  decided to drop RPDs without any record whatsoever of the discussion     5/18/76 - 6 -           No sir     I would recommend that the Committee not have any record of a decision  with respect to the policy  I take it the zone of indifference is part of the policy decision beyond  what’s in the Record of Policy Actions  I think it might be dangerous and inappropriate to have  it--a secret record of a policy decision that goes beyond the public record of policy decision  So  anything having to do with the Committee’s policy decision, I think the full account should be in  the Record of Policy Actions and no other record maintained     There was no decision on that point     It has not gotten into the Record of Policy Actions        They are in the Record of Policy Actions, President Balles The situation  briefly is this  If a matter is agreed by the Committee to be a policy decision or part of a policy  decision, certain consequences follow In particular, the information must be published in the  Federal Register, it must be made available in the Record of Policy Actions     It must be included in the Record of Policy Actions Now, subject to the  lags, and if the court rules, if the appellate court upholds the District Court , the facts will have to  be made available on the day of the meeting  The Committee, in the past, has not been willing to  publish the full specs on the same basis as it has published the directive  For a long time, it was  disinclined to publish the long-run or the short-run [monetary aggregate] targets, but then it  agreed to publish the short-run but [not] the long-run     It now has agreed to publish [in] full, but not immediately--to defer publication of the  long-run [targets] until the Chairman testifies in one of the quarterly hearings  So long as the  Committee is not willing to accept the consequences of having the specs as part of the policy  decision, it cannot appropriately treat them as part of the policy decision  If the Committee  [can’t] accept all of the consequences, then it can’t treat them as part of the policy decision     At present, since the District Court order has been stayed, they would be  released in the Record of Policy Actions on whatever schedule that might [unintelligible] is  released, whatever the lag that is [determined for] release  If the District Court is upheld, then it  would be immediate release     Chairman Burns   Yes  Vice Chairman Volcker Yes  Mr Balles   Yes  Mr Black   Yes  Mr Coldwell No  Mr Gardner   Yes  Mr Jackson   Yes  Mr Kimbrel   Yes  Mr Partee   Yes  Mr Wallich   Yes  Mr Winn Yes   Ten to one, Mr Chairman     I might add, Mr Chairman, that we do not make a policy record for every  meeting, only those for which there are policy actions, and if, as the Chairman suggests, there is  a discussion with no formal policy action that it need not be--     We have in the past included in the following Record of Policy Actions an  indication that there had been an intermeeting [meeting] and the subject is--there’s a case in  point in this draft of April records, there’s a footnote with respect to the March 29 meeting     Ninety     The lag period     Mr Chairman, most of the intermeeting consultations that we have had,  they have generally been by telegram rather than telephone, have involved modifications of the  instructions issued at the previous meeting, and apply to the remaining period until the next  meeting  If they were not reported at the same time as the decision which they modify, the  public might well conclude that the Manager [of the System Open Market Account] is violating  his instructions, whereas in fact he’s been acting under modified instructions     Chairman Burns  Yes  Vice Chairman Volcker Yes  Mr Balles   Yes  Mr Black   Yes  Mr Coldwell Abstained  Mr Gardner Yes  Mr Jackson   Yes  Mr Kimbrel   Yes  Mr Partee   Yes  Mr Wallich Yes  Mr Winn   Yes   Ten for, and one abstention     Mr Chairman, in the Committee’s rules regarding the availability of  information--as noted in the memorandum from Mr O’Connell and myself to the  Committee--section 2715(a) cites, as an example of the policy of deferred availability of  information, the Committee’s release of its directive and information pertaining thereto 45 days  after the meeting  We recommend simply that the Committee amend the rules to delete that  language  As an example, it is not essential to an understanding or the thrust--it does not modify     5/18/76 - 14 -         the thrust of the rules and it would obviously be in conflict with the action the Committee has  just taken to release the record shortly after the next meeting       Chairman Burns Yes  Vice Chairman Volcker   Yes  Mr Balles   Yes  Mr Black   Yes  Mr Coldwell   Yes  Mr Gardner   Yes  Mr Jackson   Yes  Mr Kimbrel   Yes  Mr Partee   Yes  Mr Wallich   Yes  Mr Winn   Yes   Unanimous, Mr Chairman     No      I don’t recall the discussion     Five, Mr Chairman     Five     Seven, Mr Chairman     President Volcker?

It may only be speculation, Tom, but wouldn’t it be interesting if his  $20,000 of government securities are of high-coupon issues that are now selling at a premium?

240,1976-12-20,"  As a matter of actual procedure, the Chairman, typically at the end of the  meeting, will read the proposed directive language, and [he] then reads the specs, and then the  roll is called  For record purposes, we have always followed the practice of indicating that the  formal vote was on the directive, and it was understood that the directive would be interpreted in  accordance with numerical specs     But the specs were not treated as part of the vote because, had they been so treated, their  publication would have been required by law, and for a long time the Committee was not  disposed to publish them  There is no longer any reason for that procedure because the  Committee is now publishing them in the Record of Policy Actions  And this is one reason for  putting them in the directive, so that the vote will cover both the language of the directive and  the specs     12/20-21/76 - 4 -           We would continue to publish the directive as we always have, but now  the directive would include the numbers     That’s right     I might add, Mr Chairman, that the District Court order that is now on  appeal requires immediate publication, not only of the directive, but of the interpretations  thereof     Mr Chairman, I’ll try to speak in my function as Secretariat and keeper of  the record  This matter was discussed at one time, in fact several times in the past, as I  recall--you and several other members of the Committee took the position that you would not  want to split hairs  The court ordered the Committee to publish its directive; you would not want  to attempt to defend a position that the numerical specification was not part of the instructions of  the Desk, and therefore, you would prefer to go beyond the court order if it should be limited to  the directive     The procedure has been, and this language is unchanged from the present  instrument, the procedure has been for the Committee to note, without objection, renewal up to a  year  Beyond a year, the Manager has to get a formal authorization from the Committee, and  we’ve always recorded formal votes in the minutes if the line’s been outstanding more than a  year     Eight     Chairman Burns         Yes  Vice Chairman Volcker   Yes  President Balles Yes  President Black    Yes  Governor Coldwell   Yes  Governor Gardner   Yes  Governor Jackson   Yes  President Kimbrel   Yes  Governor Lilly   Yes  Governor Partee   Yes  Governor Wallich   Yes  President Winn   Yes   Unanimous     Two small matters     Mr Chairman, the staff recommends that the Committee follow the usual  schedule and release the Memoranda of Discussion for 1971 in January  We’ve reviewed the  memoranda and recommend that the consultation with the National Bank of Belgium and the  Treasury--two short passages--be withheld  They’re identified in the attachment to my  memorandum     12/20-21/76 - 72 -        "

566,1977-12-19,"  Since the May meeting, there was one in August, following the August  meeting      There was one on May 6, and one on August 5  Those were the only    two--     12/19-20/77 - 20 -            Earlier, Mr Chairman, they were very much more frequent, in ’73, ’74,  and ’75  If I can remember the count I made, it was eight, nine, and six intermeeting telegrams  to change the funds rate range  In the last two years, there were only two each  I think that’s a  consequence of the movement of the aggregates rather than a change in procedure      I think it was before Governor Wallich came on the Board     Not an additional  The subcommittee can authorize an additional 200, but  the total would be 500     Starting today, the Desk has authority to do 300 million before the next  meeting  The subcommittee can make it 500     With the Germans--     12/19-20/77 - 46 -           Yes     We normally take out the specifications shown last time with the strike- throughs on page 5,     Last time the specification [unintelligible]  And the specifications last  time at that point were in the form of the words in the current level  So following our standard  procedure, we struck it, but the Committee can, of course write them back in     Three, Mr Chairman     Eight       Chairman Burns   Yes  Vice Chairman Volcker    Yes  Governor Coldwell Yes  Governor Gardner Yes  President Guffey  Yes  Governor Jackson Yes  Governor Lilly Yes  President Mayo     Yes  President Morris Yes  Governor Partee      Yes  President Roos No  Governor Wallich     Yes   Eleven to one, Mr Chairman  "

656,1978-03-10,"  Mr Chairman, we are ready to begin        [Roll call of phone participants]      Mr Chairman, I suggest that the formal vote, which the Committee would   be asked to take later, be on a delegation of authority to the Chairman  The staff would like some  time to work out specific terms of that [delegation] before putting it to the Committee for a vote  It  would involve a delegation to proceed to negotiate with the Treasury and the Bundesbank an  increase in the swap line to $4 billion, subject to the details being satisfactory  As I say, the staff  will work the language out and it will be distributed to the members by memorandum and by  telegram as soon as the language is available--perhaps early this afternoon--for a formal vote       Mr Chairman, I think the instruction to maintain a rate of about 6-3/4   percent may achieve the objective, particularly since one of the two reasons for doing so is the  emerging conditions in the foreign exchange market  The record made this clear, so the objective  would be achieved by the simple instruction to hold the rate at 6-3/4            3/10/78              15   Chairman Miller     Yes   Vice Chairman Volcker  Yes   Governor Burns  Yes   Governor Coldwell Yes   President Eastburn  Yes   Governor Jackson  Yes   President Kimbrel  Yes   Governor Wallich  Yes   President Willes  Yes   President Winn  Yes     It’s unanimous, Mr Chairman    "
