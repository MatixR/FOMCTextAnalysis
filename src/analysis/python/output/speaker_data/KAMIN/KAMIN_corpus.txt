  Your first international exhibit presents an overview of   developments in selected international financial markets  As can be seen in the top  left panel, a key development over the past half-year has been the renewed slide in the   January 27-28, 2004 97 of 238    foreign exchange value of the dollar  The decline in the broad dollar (the black line)  was due entirely to depreciation against the major currencies (the red line)  The  dollar fell to record lows against the euro (the black line on the right) but also fell  substantially against the pound (the magenta line) and the yen (the blue line) as well  as all the other major currencies  In contrast, since last summer the dollar has held its  ground against the currencies of our other important trading partners, depicted by the  blue line in the left panel  The dollar appreciated against the Mexican peso, while  developing Asian governments generally continued to resist appreciation of the  currencies, as indicated by the stability of the Korean won      The other key development in international financial markets since your last chart   show has been the response to expectations of rising economic growth  As indicated  in your middle left panel, movements in long-term bond yields in major foreign  economies have mirrored the rise in US yields since last summer, as well as their  recent slight decline  Stock prices, on the right, extended their second-quarter  rebound through the end of the year, both in industrial countries and in emerging  markets  As shown in the bottom left panel, another indicator of improving  confidence, yield spreads for both emerging-market countries and industrial-country  corporate borrowers, continued to move down last year  With EMBI+ spreads now at  their lowest level since before the Russia crisis in 1998, some concerns have been  raised that borrowing conditions have become too easy, raising the possibility of  future financial crises  However, as shown on the right, gross capital flows to  emerging-market countries remain well below their 1997 peaks, even as cross-border  debt issuance by industrial economies has continued to grow      Your next exhibit describes the recent and projected recovery of global economic   growth  As indicated in the first row of the top left panel, our trade-weighted  aggregate of foreign real GDP, after languishing in the first half of 2003, is estimated  to have accelerated to a pace of nearly 4 percent in the second half  With monetary  and fiscal conditions in most economies remaining accommodative, the global high- tech sector on the rebound, and US growth projected to remain strong, we see  foreign real GDP growth remaining brisk through 2004 before slowing a bit next  year  This growth should gradually reduce the extent of economic slack abroad  It  should also support continued expansion of international trade; as shown in the top  right panel, the rebound in world exports over the past two years has mirrored the  turnaround in global industrial production       As indicated in the middle left panel, the acceleration in economic activity has   also contributed, along with the decline in the dollar and other developments, to  rebounds in oil prices (the black line) and other commodity prices (the red line)   Going forward, oil prices are projected to decline over the next two years, in line with  quotes from futures markets, as increasing supplies of Iraqi and non-OPEC oil  become available, while nonfuel commodity prices level off  With commodity prices  stabilizing and excess capacity projected to diminish only gradually, inflation rates,  shown on the right, are expected to continue moving down in Latin America and to  remain subdued in the industrial countries and developing Asia   January 27-28, 2004 98 of 238    Returning to the top left panel of your exhibit, the second row indicates that the  foreign industrial countries are expected to share in the global economic rebound, but  at a slower pace than the world economy as a whole  Industrial country growth is  expected to register just under 3 percent this year and next, and the path of euro-area  growth (line 3) is expected to be lower still  As shown by the red line in the bottom  left panel, industrial production in the euro area has moved up since the middle of last  year, while the rise in business sentiment indicators such as the German Ifo survey  (the black line) point to further strengthening  Going forward, the euro-area economy  will likely benefit from the rebound in global growth and from continued low interest  rates; however, it faces headwinds in the form of an appreciating currency and some  move toward fiscal restraint      In Japan (line 4 in the top left panel) GDP growth is expected to slow a bit in the   next two years from the 2½ percent pace registered in the second half of 2003,  notwithstanding the additional quantitative monetary easing announced by the Bank  of Japan last week  As shown in the bottom right panel, available indicators suggest  the economy is unlikely to fall back into recession  Machinery orders have moved up  on balance in recent months while unemployment is edging down  Still,  unemployment rates remain high by historical standards and are likely to restrain  future consumption  Moreover, much of Japan’s growth in recent quarters has been  due to buoyant exports to developing Asia; with growth in this region slated to slow  from its brisk second-half rebound, and with the yen having strengthened recently, the  stimulus from exports and export-related investment will likely diminish     The outlook for the emerging-market economies is described in your next exhibit    As indicated in line 1 of the top left panel, real GDP growth for these countries  rebounded at a 61 percent annual rate in the second half of last year and is projected  to grow at still brisk rates over the next two years  The rebound in growth since last  summer was due almost entirely to developing Asia (line 2), which grew at a  blistering 11 percent pace in the second half after contracting slightly in the first half   This rebound in part reflected the recovery of retail sales, tourism, and confidence  from the SARS epidemic  The rebound was also due to the continued recovery of the  global high-tech sector; as shown in the top right panel, industrial production in many  developing Asian countries has tracked the recovery in the global semiconductor  industry  Finally, developing Asian growth has been boosted by buoyant domestic  demand in China, including substantial state sector investment  As shown in the  middle left panel, rising demand has helped to push consumer price inflation into  positive territory—although much of the rise reflects higher food prices—and has  also pushed down China’s trade surplus a bit  As shown on the right, exports of  developing Asian economies to China (the red line) have soared, even as exports to  the United States and Europe have been much weaker  While much of the increased  exports to China are being drawn in by higher domestic demand, many of these goods  are being further processed and re-exported to third markets  This reorientation of the  region’s trade along more vertically integrated lines is evidenced in the bottom left  panel, which shows that the recent growth of US imports from Asia is accounted for  exclusively by higher purchases from China   January 27-28, 2004 99 of 238    In contrast to developing Asia, the recovery of growth in Latin America (line 5 in  the top left panel) has been tentative  This is due in large part to lackluster  performance in Mexico (line 6)  As indicated in the bottom right panel, since mid- 2003, Mexican exports (the blue line) have recovered in tandem with US industrial  production (the black line)  However, Mexican industrial production (the red line)  has only recently turned up  The earlier weakness in Mexican production likely  reflected runoffs of inventories, and with US demand growth expected to remain  strong over the forecast period, we are projecting a rebound in Mexican growth going  forward  Nevertheless, several factors, including the failure of Mexico’s government  to make progress on tax and energy-sector reforms, point to vulnerabilities in the  economy’s performance     Your next exhibit addresses the outlook for the US external sector  As indicated   in the top left panel, both US export growth (the blue bars) and import growth (the  red bars) were quite weak in the first half of 2003 but picked up substantially in the  second half  This pattern reflects the recovery of GDP growth, shown at the right,  with US growth (the red bars) and foreign GDP (the blue bars) both rebounding  from their subdued first-half performance  Going forward, continued rapid GDP  growth here and abroad is expected to keep both exports and imports expanding  briskly  I should note that, while beef exports fall nearly to zero for most of this year  as a consequence of import bans prompted by mad cow disease, this should have only  a very small effect on aggregate export sales      Because US growth is projected to exceed foreign growth and because the   responsiveness of US imports to income is believed to exceed that of US exports to  foreign income, the growth of imports would be expected to exceed that of exports,  all else being equal  However, lagged effects of the past depreciation of the dollar,  shown in the middle left panel, as well as effects of mild projected future depreciation  are expected to buoy exports and restrain imports going forward  In consequence, the  growth of exports is projected to exceed that of imports in 2004 and 2005   Nevertheless, because imports are substantially greater than exports, imports rise in  absolute amount by more than exports over the forecast period  This leads to a  further widening of the current account deficit, shown as the black line in the middle  right panel  Owing to growth in the US economy, the deficit as a percent of GDP,  shown as the red line, narrows slightly over the next two years     Returning to the middle left panel, our forecast of a modest further depreciation of   the dollar is based on the view that the widening US current account deficit and the  need to finance it will continue to weigh on the dollar  Nevertheless, the timing and  magnitude of any future additional decline is obviously quite uncertain  The bottom  panel of your exhibit breaks down the recent financing of the current account, shown  on line 1  Notably, the share of the financing coming from official sources (line 2)  has stepped up considerably over the past year, reaching about $250 billion at an  annual rate in the first two months of the fourth quarter  Conversely, net private  capital flows (line 3) have moved down  Foreign purchases of US securities (line 4)  declined from $418 billion at an annual rate in the first half of 2003 to a little over   January 27-28, 2004 100 of 238    $300 billion in the first two months of the fourth quarter  Interpreting these data is  complicated, however, as purchases in September and October were extremely weak,  whereas they bounced back in November  Data on foreign direct investment in the  United States (line 6) are available only through the third quarter of last year, but  these inflows also show a decline from 2003H1  Conversely, US purchases of  foreign securities (line 5) and US direct investment abroad (line 7) appear to have  held up well in the second half of last year  These data suggest that official purchases  of dollars increasingly are substituting for private capital inflows in financing the US  current account deficit and, as such, may be preventing the dollar from moving down  more rapidly than would otherwise be the case       Your final exhibit explores some alternative scenarios for the dollar  As indicated   by the black line in the top panel, the broad real dollar, though down considerably  from its peak in early 2002, is still well above its trough in the 1990s  Particularly  given the widening external deficit, a steeper decline in the dollar than our baseline  projection is a distinct possibility  However, the implications for the US and foreign  economies will depend upon the circumstances in which this decline takes place  The  middle left panel details several alternative simulations of the staff’s model  In the  first scenario, indicated by the solid red line, the fall in the dollar is triggered by  higher-than-expected foreign GDP growth  Such higher growth might plausibly be  due to the long-awaited rise in productivity growth among foreign industrial  countries, for example, or to a pickup of investment and consumption in developing  Asia  Specifically, this scenario combines a shock to the risk premium on US assets,  which would lead to a 10 percent decline in the dollar in the absence of changes in  monetary policy, with a shock to foreign domestic demand equal to 1 percent of GDP  in 2004 and an additional 2 percent of GDP in 2005  This combination of higher  foreign growth, indicated by the red line in the bottom left panel, and the lower dollar  leads to an improvement in the US current account balance, the bottom right panel,  and a rise in US growth of about ½ percentage point, the middle right     The second dollar depreciation scenario is a so-called disorderly correction—that   is, a rapid fall in the dollar that engenders a steep falloff in US bond and equity  prices as well  It is not clear how plausible this scenario is  The fall in the dollar  since early 2002 has not disrupted financial markets, nor did it do so during the  dollar’s previous correction in the 1980s  Nevertheless, this scenario arises  frequently in financial press commentary on the dollar  So to explore its effects, we  assumed the same shock to the dollar as in scenario 1 but added shocks to risk  premiums in other asset markets that lower US stock prices about 12 percent and  raise long-term bond yields 50 basis points  The combined effect of these shocks is to  leave US growth (the dashed red line in the middle right panel) down only a little  from its baseline path, as the adverse effects of higher interest rates and lower stock  prices are offset by the stimulative effect of the dollar’s decline on net exports   However, foreign growth is lowered about ½ percentage point below baseline,  reflecting both the appreciation of their currencies and lower US growth        January 27-28, 2004 101 of 238    Finally, while we view the risks to the dollar to be weighted toward the downside,  we cannot preclude the possibility that the dollar may rise above its projected path  over the next several quarters  Our projection of US real GDP growth exceeds that  of most private forecasters, and as the market’s assessment of US growth and  associated rates of return is adjusted upward, the dollar may be boosted as well  The  blue dashed lines in your exhibit trace out the effects of such a shock  While foreign  growth is boosted above its baseline path, US growth is restrained a bit, and the  current account deficit widens  To sum up, considerable uncertainty surrounds both  future movements of the dollar and the circumstances under which such movements  might occur  At the risk of saying something you may have heard here before, this  makes the outlook for the US external sector particularly difficult to pin down at the  present time  [Laughter]  Sandy will now continue our presentation       Yes, they are   January 27-28, 2004 104 of 238      They would most likely still go up, but I think you’re quite right     That is very much the case  I completely agree with you that the measure   you are proposing probably would be superior  The constant price data for all of these different   countries, which we were getting from their national data sources, were not available    Transforming it into SDRs is a very good idea and would be worthwhile     That is correct, and I think you’re quite right that transforming the data   into SDRs would be useful       Absolutely  That said, one of the issues we’ve been focusing on in our   forecast of trade is the fact that trade does seem to be much more sensitive to industrial   production than it does to GDP  That’s in part because much of trade is composed of   January 27-28, 2004 105 of 238    manufactured goods, which are more related to industrial production than to GDP as a whole  So   we think there are definitely a lot of fundamentals underlying this correlation  But I believe you   are quite right that the decline in the dollar has probably exaggerated the relationship presented   in that chart
