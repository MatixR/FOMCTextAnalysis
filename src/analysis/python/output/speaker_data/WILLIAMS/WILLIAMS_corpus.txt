  Under the Taylor rule, policymakers would need to weigh the  deterioration in economic performance associated with the zero bound against the  benefits of lower inflation in establishing an overall price objective  And to be sure,  not all of those benefits are captured by the model  The existence of a tradeoff raises  the question of whether there are other ways to design policy so as to mitigate the  effects of the zero bound in a low inflation environment  That is the subject of your  next exhibit   According to previous research, policies that are more responsive to fluctuations  in output than the Taylor rule do a better job of stabilizing the economy; modestly  increasing the responsiveness of the funds rate to deviations in inflation from its  target also appears beneficial  There are two aspects to this advantage  First, such  rules reduce the probability that inflation will be well below its target if and when a  major disturbance hits the economy, and thus they essentially take away one of the  ingredients of a deflationary spiral  A second advantage of such rules is that they  reduce the funds rate quickly when the economy weakens, thereby limiting the  severity of major downturns, again reducing the risk of deflation   The middle table puts some numerical magnitudes on these advantages  For this  exercise, we assume that the more responsive rule reacts twice as strongly to  movements in the output gap as the standard Taylor rule but is the same in its other  dimensions  As can be seen by comparing lines 1 and 2, the more responsive rule  damps fluctuations in unemployment relative to the Taylor rule  And as shown on  lines 3 and 4, the more responsive rule is also more effective at keeping the economy  out of deep recessions In fact, the more responsive rule under a zero inflation target  is able to match or better the performance of the Taylor rule using a higher inflation  target However, as was the case with the Taylor rule, performance under the more  responsive rule drops off noticeably when the target is reduced below 2 percent but  improves little when the target is increased to 4 percent   As noted in the bottom panel, adopting more responsive rules—especially ones  with even greater sensitivity to economic conditions than the rule analyzed here—  brings some potential disadvantages as well  First, the greater responsiveness of  policy to changes in economic conditions implies heightened variability of the fed  funds rate and more frequent policy reversals  Although these differences have no  direct implications for economic performance in the FRB/US analysis, they may be a  cause of concern for reasons not captured by our model  Second, implementing a  more aggressive response to the estimated output gap amplifies the risk and  magnitude of policy mistakes owing to faulty data and mismeasurement of the  economy’s productive capacity  Lastly, because more aggressive rules drive the fed  funds rate quickly to zero when the economy weakens and rates are already low, they  increase the risk of triggering a confidence crisis if investors become unnerved                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 15 of 194  whenever the Fed has no more latitude for moving the fed funds rate down further   However, such possible effects on confidence play no role in the FRB/US model    For these reasons, the FOMC might want to consider policies that become more  responsive only when it is in imminent danger of hitting the zero bound  Such  asymmetric responsiveness is the subject of your next exhibit  As described in the  upper panel, to illustrate this idea we consider a policy that under most conditions  follows the standard Taylor rule but that lowers the fed funds rate more quickly when  economic conditions are sufficiently bleak  In particular, we assume that whenever  the standard Taylor rule would prescribe a funds rate below 1 percent, the funds rate  is automatically set to zero  Such a policy has the advantage shared by generally  more responsive rules of quickly bringing to bear the maximum monetary stimulus  possible to offset economic downturns or deflation, thus enhancing average economic  performance  At the same time, the cost of higher interest rate variability and the risk  of policy mistakes are lessened because the greater responsiveness of policy is limited  to episodes of economic distress   The middle table compares economic performance under the asymmetric policy to  that obtained with the Taylor rule  With an inflation target of 4 percent, the Taylor  rule only occasionally prescribes a funds rate below 1 percent, so the overall  performance of the two policies differs little  But with a lower inflation target, the  asymmetric policy mitigates the falloff in performance resulting from the zero bound  without significantly raising the overall variability of the fed funds rate  As shown in  lines 1 and 2, under the asymmetric rule the increase in the variability of the  unemployment rate is less when the inflation target is lowered from 2 percent to zero;  lines 3 and 4 show a similar result for the frequency of deep recessions   As noted in the bottom panel, one possible drawback of the asymmetric rule is  that it may be less transparent  In particular, communicating the nature of such a  policy to investors may be difficult, and the market may have trouble understanding  its full ramifications  This is because an asymmetric policy, unlike the Taylor rule or  similar strategies, does not always respond to economic conditions in the same  manner  Thus, the private sector might mistakenly interpret a sudden drop in the fed  funds rate as a temporary aberration rather than a systematic aspect of the rule  This  transparency problem could prevent the rule’s benefits from materializing if investors  do not correctly incorporate the implications of asymmetric behavior into their  expectations, in particular by pricing into bond yields the greater probability of a zero  funds rate during economic slowdowns   Your next exhibit considers another strategy for mitigating the effects of the zero  bound This approach, unlike the strategies that we have discussed so far, responds  not only to current inflation but also takes into account past deviations of inflation  from target  A key feature of such a strategy is that it involves a promise to keep the  funds rate unusually low following an episode in which the zero bound constrains  policy One specific example of this approach is price-level targeting, in which  policy is set so that the price level rather than the inflation rate fluctuates around a                         January 29-30, 2002 Page 16 of 194  predetermined target path  Under price-level targeting, investors expect that any  shortfall of the price level from its target will be made up later, so that a period of low  inflation will be followed by an offsetting period of high inflation, and vice versa       Policies that promise above-average future rates of inflation create the expectation  that the future stance of monetary policy will be relatively easy for a time  Thus,  even with the funds rate presently constrained at zero, this expectation about future  policy contributes to expectations of higher future inflation and relatively low funds  rates As a result, real bond rates fall today and stimulate real activity  This effect on  expectations thus reduces the severity of recessions and lowers the danger of  deflation Such policies have attracted a great deal of attention by some researchers  and have been advocated as a possible strategy for the Bank of Japan in its current  situation Model-based research, including work carried out using the FRB/US  model, finds that under the assumptions of rational expectations and perfect policy  credibility, these policies can be very effective in reducing the stabilization costs  associated with the zero bound     However, the effectiveness of such policies depends crucially on that  credibility—on investors’ expectations being consistent with the promised policy   Under certain conditions, investors may doubt whether policymakers will in fact carry  through on their pledge For example, the public may question whether policymakers  would really actively seek to bring about high inflation following a period of low  inflation, or vice versa, rather than being satisfied with just stabilizing the inflation  rate at the long-run target If investors don’t believe the promise, then real bond rates  will not come down, and therefore such strategies will be ineffective at mitigating the  effects of the zero bound   Your final exhibit lists the main lessons from this line of research  First, in a very  low inflation environment, the nominal funds rate can be expected to hit zero  relatively frequently But in general, such an event is not an insurmountable problem  The economy usually recovers despite the constraint on policy because most  economic disturbances are sufficiently transitory and modest in magnitude  That  said, if deflation sets in, the ability of the economy to recover can be jeopardized   Funds-rate-based monetary policies can mitigate the effects of the zero bound in  several ways—by not pursuing too low a rate of average inflation, by responding  relatively aggressively to changes in economic conditions, and by promising higher  inflation down the road in the event that the funds rate gets stuck at zero  Finally, it  pays to stimulate the economy aggressively when the probability of hitting the zero  bound is high; at least from the perspective of the FRB/US model, there is no  advantage in “keeping your powder dry” That concludes our prepared remarks       One point that Dave raised that is crucial in thinking about model-  based analysis is that we are using an estimated model on thirty-five years of data during which   we have not seen a period when the zero bound was a constraint  Nonlinearities may pop up        January 29-30, 2002 Page 26 of 194  during recessions for short periods of time but are not a dominant feature of the data in terms of   their average behavior  So we really are pushing the envelope a bit with respect to what a model   can do And we recognize that One of the questions that people often ask in thinking about this   is, Are we getting enough recessions, or is our model too stable?  And in fact, as Dave mentioned   and as we described in our paper, we get some whopper recessions or depressions in this model    The shocks that we have in our simulations I don’t think grossly overstate or understate the risks   to economic performance  But whether the economy would behave as the FRB/US or any other   model predicts in a situation like that, we just don’t know, in large part because we just don’t   have that experience to incorporate into the model     To be clear on the analysis that we did in our paper and that we talked   about here today, running at that higher inflation rate was really just to repair the damage that   had occurred because of the zero bound  So whether or not we had inflation or deflation didn’t   determine what we did  If inflation were below where you would have had it for your policy rule   because of the zero bound, you would offset that through an easier policy for a while  So your   average inflation would still be right, but you would not be inflating just to inflate       I’d like to respond to a couple of comments you made regarding how   the model was simulated, just so I can clarify a few points          January 29-30, 2002 Page 36 of 194    With regard to the assumption of rational expectations, what we did in   the paper and in what we reported today was to assume rational expectations, meaning that the   expectations people form are those of the model  We also assumed that fiscal policy comes in   aggressively after five years to stop a “great depression” from occurring or at least to limit the   damage  One of the implications of that is that after five years the zero bound is not constraining   policy anymore  Basically, fiscal policy is replacing monetary policy; that’s the way we think of   it So in your example, you could think of the zero bound in play for five years, affecting the   five-year bond completely  But the ten-year bond would have five years for which it wasn’t   affected, and the thirty-year bond obviously would be affected even less  So the way we did this,   when we bring in the fiscal policy I think that is closer to what you consider a more reasonable   way of thinking about this—that it would only be going on for about five years     The expectations are still rational in the sense that, if we had deflation   for five years, say, the inflation rate would start coming back to zero gradually depending on the   quantity dynamics  It wouldn’t jump to zero, but it would come back gradually     Right, and that would depend on whatever your target was  So with   regard to what happens in the “great depression” scenarios, it’s clear that our FRB/US model   breaks down under conditions such as a 25 percent unemployment rate  Again, with fiscal policy   coming in, the rescue package avoids these situations generally  Our analysis has few of those     January 29-30, 2002 Page 37 of 194  events occurring and, one could say, “contaminating” our results  In our paper I believe we   reported that with a zero inflation target, we would have a major depression once every century   or so So I think that addresses those two questions   On the quantity effects, it’s true that what we are saying is that if quantity effects don’t   matter—the monetary base doesn’t matter—this is what the problem would be  Clearly, if one   were to layer on the effects that Marvin was talking about, that could lessen or change the results   we would get I would note that at the Vermont Woodstock Conference, Ben McCallum looked   at the question of how big the quantity effects would be, and his conclusion was that normally   they wouldn’t be that big But that’s a point that I think one might dispute      I’ll be referring to the exhibits beginning on page 26  In my  presentation today, I’ll lay out a few scenarios that illustrate the potential  macroeconomic fallout resulting from a significant decline in house prices, and I will  examine policy responses that minimize it     I’ll start by describing the possible size of the current problem—assuming there  is one As pointed out in Dick Peach’s presentation, there are serious difficulties in  accurately measuring both actual and “fundamental” house prices  But, for the  purposes of my presentation, I will take as a working hypothesis that house prices  are high relative to fundamentals—or, in terms of the decision tree that Glenn just  laid out, I assume that the answer to his question 1 is “Yes, the asset price appears  misaligned” As Josh Gallin indicated, it would take up to a 20 percent decline in  house prices to bring the price-to-rent ratio back in line with fundamentals  With  housing wealth standing at around $18 trillion today, such a drop in house prices  would extinguish $36 trillion of household wealth  That’s equal to about 30 percent  of GDP  Based on a marginal propensity to consume from housing wealth of 3½  cents on the dollar, this decline in wealth would entail a nearly 1½ percentage point  increase in the personal saving rate  And, according to estimates from the FRB/US  model, it implies a 40 basis point reduction in the long-run neutral real funds rate   It may be useful to put these figures into context by comparing them to those  associated with the stock market overvaluation reached in early 2000  Stock prices                                                        June 29-30, 2005 18 of 234  at that time were arguably some 50 to 70 percent overvalued  Correction of prices to  fundamentals at that time would have implied a reduction in household wealth of  $67 trillion, equal to about 70 percent of contemporaneous GDP  In the event, stock  market wealth fell by $46 trillion between March 2000 and March 2001, and at its  lowest point was down $85 trillion  There is considerable uncertainty regarding the  magnitude of the effects of changes in stock market and housing wealth on  household spending; nonetheless, it seems clear the magnitude of the current  potential problem is much smaller than, and perhaps only half as large as, that of the  stock market bubble  Of course, if house prices continue to soar—and in the San  Francisco Bay Area, at least, they show no signs of slowing—the magnitude of the  housing overvaluation problem will rise as well     A cautionary note worth emphasizing is that the monetary policy cushion  available today, as measured by the prevailing federal funds rate, is noticeably  smaller than it was in early 2000 at the peak of the stock market    The first question that comes to mind is What should monetary policy do, if  anything, about the apparent overvaluation in house prices?  The answer to that  depends crucially on the answer to Glenn’s second question “Do bubble  fluctuations result in large macroeconomic consequences that monetary policy  cannot readily offset?”  Therefore, I now explore the effects of a bubble collapse and  the ability of policy to respond effectively to them     I consider three scenarios in which a housing bubble deflates relatively quickly  I use the FRB/US model to quantify these effects  Note that for the materials posted  last Wednesday, I based my simulations on the April Greenbook projection  I have  since updated the simulations, and the ones that I will be showing today are based on  the extended June Greenbook projection  In each scenario, I assume that house  prices fall by 20 percent relative to the baseline over the next 2½ years   In the first two scenarios, I consider the effects of exogenous declines in house  prices that apparently come “out of the blue;” the third scenario considers the  possibility of an interrelated decline in both bond and house prices  For each  scenario, I consider two types of monetary policy response  The first is the optimal  perfect foresight policy that is very similar to those reported in past Bluebooks  The  path of policy is chosen to minimize the sum of the squared deviations of the  unemployment rate and the core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price  inflation rate from their respective targets and the squared changes in the funds rate,  with the latter receiving relatively little weight  Perfect foresight means that the  policymaker today has advance knowledge of all future shocks to the economy  I  assume that the inflation objective is 1½ percent and that the unemployment rate  target is 5 percent, equal to the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU [non-accelerating  inflation rate of unemployment]  The second policy is one that responds only to  events as they occur and does not respond directly to anticipated future  developments related to house prices  For this purpose, I use a modified version of  the Taylor rule, with a coefficient of 1 on the output gap and of ½ on the inflation                                                       June 29-30, 2005 19 of 234  gap, and with the long-run natural rate of interest that appears in the rule varying in  accord with sustained changes in housing wealth and bond premiums   The second page of my exhibit shows the results from model simulations of a  20 percent decline in house prices, where only the standard channels included in the  FRB/US model are in play  For comparison, I have also plotted the baseline paths,  based on the June extended Greenbook projection but modified under the  assumption that monetary policy is set optimally in the way I just described   Because a decline in house prices primarily influences demand, not supply, it does  not pose a difficult tradeoff between policy goals  In addition, according to the  model, the macroeconomic effects play out gradually and are moderate in  magnitude, giving policy time to respond  The optimal policy calls for a path for the  funds rate that averages about 3¼ percent during 2007 and 2008—about 40 basis  points below the baseline path  Under this policy, the unemployment and inflation  rates are nearly the same as in the baseline  The very small rise in inflation reflects  the effects of the depreciation of the dollar resulting from the reduction in domestic  interest rates   The modified Taylor rule is able to mimic the outcomes under the optimal  policy reasonably well, indicating that policy need not fully anticipate future house- price declines to be effective, but can simply respond to events as they unfold  Note  that if the house-price decline were larger (or the marginal propensity to consume  out of housing wealth bigger), then the policy implication would simply be to cut  rates by proportionally more      In summary, assuming that the FRB/US model does a good job of capturing the  macroeconomic implications of declining house prices, such an event does not pose  a particularly difficult challenge for monetary policy  One lingering concern,  however, is that the model may be missing other important avenues by which large  movements in house prices affect the economy  I now consider a scenario that  entertains that possibility     In the second scenario, I incorporate extra-model spillovers from falling house  prices, presumably reflecting a decline in confidence and an extinguishing of  household spending that had been fueled by equity extraction from mortgage  refinancing, as described in the “heightened spending response” simulation reported  in the June Greenbook  Importantly, the demand spillovers are assumed to have a  very different dynamic from the model’s standard wealth effect They kick in much  more rapidly and eventually dissipate so that they have no long-run effects  As  shown in the next page of the exhibit, owing to the extra drag from these spillovers,  the optimal policy calls for a series of rate cuts, bringing the funds rate to 2¼ percent  by the middle of next year  The funds rate does not again reach 3 percent until the  spring of 2007 The optimal policy is able to stem the rise in unemployment that  would otherwise occur at the cost of a modest and short-lived uptick in inflation                                                    June 29-30, 2005 20 of 234  The Taylor rule, however, is not as successful  It fails to anticipate the spillover  effects and responds too timidly once they occur  Still, it contains the rise in  unemployment to only about ½ percentage point above baseline and moves inflation  slightly more rapidly toward the assumed inflation objective  I should note that,  given the uncertainty regarding the size and timing of such spillovers, the ideal  outcome in the optimal policy simulation exaggerates the real-world ability of  monetary policy to offset the effects of such shocks   As I noted before, the thought experiment behind these first two sets of  simulations is that house prices fall in a kind of vacuum, without any relationship to  other events  Some commentators have argued that the current high level of house  prices is the outcome of a history of very low interest rates and past house-price  appreciation that has given rise to irrationally optimistic expectations of future  appreciation  Indeed, a simple estimated equation relating the current price-to-rent  ratio to the user cost of housing and past house-price appreciation does a reasonably  good job of explaining much of the run-up in house prices over the past several  years  If this explanation holds water, a potential risk to housing prices and the  outlook in general lies in the path of longer-term interest rates—which have been  surprisingly low, given prevailing economic conditions—and the usual behavior of  term premiums  Bond yields could return to more normal levels and in so doing  contribute to a downward trajectory in house prices    I explore such a possibility in the final scenario, which builds on Scenario 2,  and is the subject of the next page of my exhibit  I now add the assumption that the  term premiums on long-term bonds rise by 75 basis points, relative to baseline, over  the second half of this year and remain at these levels  This aspect of the scenario is  similar to an alternative scenario reported in the June Greenbook  This shock to  bond premiums by itself reduces the long-term equilibrium real funds rate by about  70 basis points  Optimal policy calls for the funds rate to fall below 1 percent by the  middle of next year and for the funds rate to remain below 3 percent through 2008   The optimal policy is just able to contain the rise in unemployment without  confronting the zero bound  The Taylor rule, on the other hand, responds too  gradually to events, and, as a result, the unemployment rate reaches 6 percent in  early 2007   This scenario presents a difficult challenge for monetary policy, especially in  light of the looming zero lower bound on interest rates under the optimal policy   More generally, it highlights that the risks posed by a house-price decline are  magnified if they occur in tandem with other events that damp economic activity       In addition, as Glenn mentioned, a house-price misalignment may misallocate  resources to housing-related activities  These conditions suggest considering  Glenn’s question 3, whether an alternative policy is needed that aims to deflate a  house-price overvaluation before it grows too large—the subject of the next page of  my exhibit  The potential effectiveness of such a preemptive policy, however, is less  than clear The basic empirical relationship between house prices, interest rates, and                                                    June 29-30, 2005 21 of 234  other factors, upon which such a policy necessarily would rely, is imperfectly  understood and may have changed over time  Moreover, as seen in the earlier  presentations, there remains considerable uncertainty over the degree of  overvaluation  Thus, the successful use of monetary policy to reduce the magnitude  of a misalignment of house prices would be a daunting task, even assuming that such   a goal were deemed desirable  This concludes our prepared remarks       In the optimal policy simulations, from the beginning of the simulations,   which is the third quarter of this year, you know the entire future path of house prices and any other   shocks that I add  So you are acting in anticipation of those future price changes     That’s correct  That’s why I was trying to compare it with the Taylor   rule—which doesn’t have that aspect of responding to developments as they unfold—to see how   well that would do     All I’m doing is the latter—reducing the overall housing wealth by 20   percent relative to the base     In terms of the FRB/US model, the only way that house prices and   housing wealth enter is through the aggregate                                           June 29-30, 2005 39 of 234    So, one of the shortcomings, even of a model with several hundred   equations, is that it doesn’t have the distribution effects     I think that the Greenbook forecast, as I understand it—and maybe Dave   should talk about this—is predicated on a particular assumption about the future path of housing                                                       June 29-30, 2005 43 of 234  prices and takes into account the kind of models that Josh was discussing  The staff looks at all the   empirical evidence, just as they do for every equation on every aspect of the economy  So,   monetary theory would tell you to come up with the best, most reasonable forecast and adopt a   policy that is appropriate to that path but also consider, as you’re saying, all the risks and the   distribution of the risks  It’s along the lines of some of the charts in the Greenbook, which show the   distribution of risks and then contemplate the implications for the current set of policy options over   that distribution of risks    I think the basic idea in the economic literature is that you first want to get a very reasonable   path, and that would be more or less your baseline  It’s not a path, I should say, that just keeps   housing prices constant or keeps any asset price constant  It should be the best forecast of these   asset prices that you can come up with, but subject, of course, to the fact that these are very hard to   predict      That would be the standard policy     Right  The Taylor rule would just be one example, of course, of a policy   that takes into account the information you have up to that point  It’s not optimal in some sense    It’s just a simple equation  It does represent this wait-and-see approach  I was using the optimal   policy to illustrate what you would do if you knew everything  It’s kind of a comparison                                              June 29-30, 2005 44 of 234    In fact, the third scenario that I considered involved trying to emphasize   that point—namely that, at least by some measures that people have come up with, there is a big   difference in where bond rates are relative to standard estimates of fundamentals  It’s actually a   much bigger problem for the economy than just the house-price effect directly, at least according to   the FRB/US model  More importantly, it could be one of the factors driving a big part of the house-  price appreciation In terms of needing strong house prices to keep the economy moving, the way I   view your third question is that if it weren’t for the house-price run-up, monetary policy would need   to be easier, given current economic conditions  And I think that’s absolutely right   One way to think about my scenarios is just to reverse the signs, especially in scenarios 1   and 2, and think about it as this as the positive stimulus we’ve gotten from a 20 percent appreciation   of housing prices and this is the positive effect we’ve gotten from some other factors  Especially   scenario 1, I think you can see that way   The reason I mentioned the misallocation of resources toward housing-related activities in   my presentation is that in quite a bit of the economic academic research about bubbles, the emphasis                                        June 29-30, 2005 57 of 234  is that they actually lead to, as Glenn mentioned, a misallocation of resources  Therefore, these gaps   between fundamental prices and actual prices should appear in the policymaker’s objective function,   in addition to inflation, output and employment  So there is a notion here that that’s just another   problem that you would want to balance off if you could     Now, I’d like to emphasize in my closing remarks that the assumption that you could affect   the bubble is very problematic  As Josh himself mentioned, these relationships between housing   prices and interest rates are just not as strong as one would think and not as strong as economic   theory would suggest
