2666,1984-12-17," Mr Chairman, with regard to the forecast, the Board staff's analysis may very well be what we'll see next year However, I believe the odds are somewhat more on the side of a shortfall Why do I say that? Well, I guess we all have a tendency to be parochial as well as having biases and in our District, although signals are certainly mixed and this could be considered just a pause, I think we're seeing what was a relatively nice growth in employment slowing considerably and at least two states have seen unemployment begin to rise Also, while the tax proposal could easily cut both ways, in the short run it probably will have a tendency to cause uncertainty And from our discussions with business people, the uncertainty is certainly leading to some inaction With regard to the satisfactoriness of 29 percent, I don't see it I would prefer that all my colleagues who think that it might be higher be correct I think the 3 percent level is still not satisfactory  I am particularly interested in commenting on the operating techniques I would certainly like to see M1 on an equal footing and would have to say that I'd like to see it on the podium where it could talk to us However, I would not leave it on that podium and let it talk without paying attention to other things In that regard, if I may paraphrase the Chairman, I do not think it would be appropriate to give a Mickey Mouse signal by going to absolute weight on M1, if that is not what is going to be done And I don't hear around this table that that would be the case I would say again that I believe it should give us some great information  I share the concerns about the exchange rate and commodity prices, perhaps again [reflecting] parochial considerations in the Midwest However, I am not sure that this body is in a position to effect any real changes in that regard and any psychological changes that we might see, if they were at the risk of inflation, I would not do "
2706,1985-02-12," Mr Chairman, the heart of the Midwest continues to dance to a rhythm that I believe the Chairman has played over the years, which leads us down a road called ""reduced inflation"" We would support alternative II and hope that we would not signal that we will be in the higher end of the range  I would also favor ""B,"" and I would pretty much echo Bob Black's comments I also have a little more concern about the accommodation and, therefore, lean a little more toward ""C"" "
2732,1985-03-26," Well, Mr Chairman, given your statement about the good conservative New England Yankees, I guess it might be argumentative for me to say that I'm from a District that's in the heartland of conservatism But at least I can say that we are centrally located and, therefore, somewhat contiguous to almost every area of fragility that has been discussed around this table On the east we border the problem with savings and loans; on the northeast, central east and northwest, the agriculture problems; and on the southwest, the energy situation However, because of that location we also touch upon some of the areas that my good friend at the right described as [experiencing] slow advancement, which can only be slow in terms of the standard of living that they've become accustomed to, I would say So, when it comes to the economy we get very, very mixed signals  We recently held our initial meeting of our advisory council on small business and agriculture and heard some very interesting comments We heard everything from statements that the only thing that will save agriculture is a complete government bailout, to statements that certain well managed agricultural areas that paid attention to their cash flows are doing very well, to encouraging  -23-    3/26/85  statements that there's still a belief that technologically we have the capability of competing very well in the agricultural area with anyone in the world Obviously, there's going to be a period of problems for those that did not manage well  I guess those mixed signals, as John Balles said, make it very difficult to describe the elephant However, our best estimate would probably be something along the line of the real GNP growth of the staff forecast or perhaps just a little less Perhaps of more concern to me is the fact that our estimate is also for somewhat greater inflation than the staff sees And given all of those mixed signals and uncertainties, I would suggest that perhaps the advisable course for the System is to move very slowly and in the areas of its strength Since I also have a slightly different opinion about what M1 tells us than one good Yankee from New England, I would say we should watch that very closely, not making moves of any magnitude I would share Karen's concern about having to do something major later in the year I certainly wouldn't want to see continued front loading of money that would cut our flexibility in the second half On the other hand, I would hope that we would take any opportunity to continue with what our strength is, and that is to continue the long- range battle against inflation  Well, Mr Chairman, I expect to pray to the Lord to get His attention then have Him judge me on my actions There is a lot of uncertainty I would agree with much of what has been said by Jerry and Si Although one might say that they differ, I think they differ only in the degree of the way to go about this Since my bias is toward continuing to make sure that we don't over expand, I would be tempted to lean toward ""C"" But given the uncertainties and other considerations, I would say something in between ""B"" and ""C"" with--sharing Si's feeling--perhaps a slightly larger borrowing target "
2756,1985-05-21," Since my District is contiguous in small part to Mr Boykin's, I'm glad that they have found they are at the end of the building cycle We have had space for lease in three of our offices for some time and have found that the overbuilding in those areas was recognized, at least by us, somewhat earlier Our discussions with business folks in our District reinforce some of the comments Jerry made about their lack of optimism and what Frank said about firms giving some serious consideration to moving manufacturing facilities However, I would say that in such discussions in the past  -17-    5/21/85  generally those folks were the most pessimistic right before things got a little better  The lack of any what might be called ""meaningful"" growth in the first half wasn't too much of a surprise to us and was fairly consistent with the projections that we had made As I recall, at the February meeting--and you testified about the central tendency [of forecasts] expressed around this table--we were somewhat of an outlier both on real output and inflation On real output we were 1/2 to 3/4 of a point [lower] and on the inflation side about 3/4 to 1 percentage point higher For the second half, even though there is that lack of optimism in the business community in our District, and in spite of the mitigating factors such as the strength in the dollar, I believe that the stimulation that we gave to the economy in the last half of 1984 and the first half of this year and the impetus of current rates and promise of a reduction in the budget deficit could give us stronger growth, perhaps even above that 3 percent plus level I would echo Bob Black's and Governor Wallich's comments that at this point in time surely we are looking at uncertainty but not a disaster, and that keeping our eyes on our long-term goals is certainly appropriate  Mr Chairman, I strongly endorse your recommendation that monetary policy be consistent with what we've been doing recently I'm concerned that, while monetary policy might work with lags, monetary messages work somewhat quicker And it seems to me that anything other than ""C"" gives a message of a move toward ease If we had to go with ""B,"" I'd agree with Roger that at least we should increase the borrowing level "
