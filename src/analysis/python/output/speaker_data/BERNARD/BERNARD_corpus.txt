Later in the intermeeting period And then I guess we need some numbers on the monetary aggregates The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of--   March through June at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent   That's the usual way it has been done  -16-    5/17/88   And the funds range?

  This would amend Paragraph 5 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations The new wording is found at the bottom of page 1 of Mr Fisher's memo dated September 13, and it would replace the first two sentences of the existing wording in the Authorization The new wording is as follows "Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration)" What this new wording replaces may be found

implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve  markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent"   The next sentence, if I have it down correctly and using the same tilt  as in the July directive would read "In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price  stability and sustainable

acceptable in the intermeeting period"   I will be reading from page 13 of the Bluebook, and then coming back  to page 12 for the last sentence The first sentence, then, is under the "New Alternative" heading  on page 13 "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks  conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of  around 5-1/2 percent" Then, moving just below that to the "Current Wording" section for the  second sentence "In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and  sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and  monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal  funds rate might be

The directive language is "In the implementation of policy for the  immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with decreasing  the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-3/4 percent In the context of the Committee's  long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful    11/17/98  consideration to economic,

Governor Gramlich Yes President Hoenig Yes President Jordan Yes Governor Kelley Yes Governor Meyer Yes President Minehan Yes President Poole Yes Governor Rivlin Yes   I will begin with that, Mr Chairman There is a change in   the very first sentence of the general paragraphs Basically, it involves dropping the   words “has moderated” So the first sentence would read “The information reviewed at   this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust” Moving on   to the operational paragraph, the draft language is shown on page 13 of the Bluebook It   would read “To promote the Committee’s long-run objectives of price stability and   sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in   reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of   around 4¾ percent In view of the evidence currently available, the Committee believes   that prospective developments are equally likely to

Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes    This would involve an additional paragraph to the Authorization   under section 1, as Mr Fisher was just mentioning The new paragraph 1(c) would read   “To sell US Government securities and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully   guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for   System Open Market Account under agreements for resale by dealers of such securities or   obligations in 90 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized   by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable   limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers”    This would involve an addition to the Domestic Authorization,   paragraph 4, as described in Don Kohn’s memo, which was circulated overnight The new   paragraph is “In order to help ensure the effective conduct of open market operations   during the transition period surrounding the century date change, the Committee authorizes   the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to sell options on repurchase agreements, reverse   repurchase agreements and matched sale purchase transactions for exercise no later than   January 2000”    I’m reading from page 15 of the Bluebook “To promote the   Committee’s long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable

average of around 6-1/2 percent”  And the statement in the press release would read    “Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and   of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly   toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future”

markets   consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 6-1/2 percent"     As for the balance of risks sentence, you have heard the introductory words,   but the rest of it would read as shown here  “Against the background of its long-run   goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth, and of the information currently   available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward   conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future"                Chairman Greenspan Yes            Vice

Meyer and I got to vote on this   one!    October 2nd    This language is on page 15 of the Bluebook  It’s a little hard to     8/21/01 80   find but it comes after Chart 3, which has the blue-shaded section in it  “The Federal Open   Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and   promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the   immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds   rate to an average of around 3-1/2 percent”  The balance of risks statement for the press release   reads “Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic   growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue   to be

objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets   consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 2-1/2 percent”    For the balance of

following  “The Federal Open Market   Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote   sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate   future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an   average of around 1¼ percent”   March 18, 2003 89 of 101

 Governor Kohn   Yes  President Moskow   Yes  Governor Olson   Yes  President Parry   Yes       The wording is on page 13 of the Bluebook  “The Federal Open   Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and   promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the   immediate future seeks conditions in

      The vote will be just on the federal funds rate?     The wording is on page 14 of the Bluebook  For the directive  “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with   maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent”     Then for the risk assessment sentences that are not part of the directive  “Against the   background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the   information currently available, the risks to the Committee’s outlook for sustainable economic   growth over the next several quarters are balanced; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the   next several quarters are weighted toward the downside; and, taken together, the balance of risks   to its objectives are weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future”

Vice President Stewart  Yes       It’s on page 10 of the Bluebook “The Federal Open Market   Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote   sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate   future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an   average of around 1 percent”  For the risk assessment sentences  “Against the background of its   long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information   currently available, the Committee believes the risks to its outlook for sustainable economic   growth over the next several quarters are balanced  The risks to its outlook for inflation over the   next several quarters are weighted toward the downside  And taken together, the balance of risks   to its objectives are weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future”     The wording is on page 10 of the Bluebook continuing onto page 11    “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster   price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with   maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent”  With regard to the risk-  assessment language, “Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and   sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee

Broaddus   Yes  Governor Ferguson   Yes  Governor Gramlich   Yes  President Guynn   Yes  Governor Kohn   Yes  President Moskow   Yes  Governor Olson   Yes    President Parry   Yes        I’ll be reading the directive wording on page 15 of the Bluebook and,   with regard to risk assessments, the first two sentences that the Chairman read to you from the   draft press release  That’s what is being voted on  With regard to the directive itself  “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with   maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent”  With regard to the   sentences going into the press statement  “The Committee perceives that the upside and   downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly   equal  The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and   now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation”     I’ll begin with the directive wording, which is at the bottom of page 11   in the Bluebook “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions   that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run   objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent   with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent”  Moving on to the risk   assessment, which is part of the formal vote, that would be the language under “B” on page 12   “The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable   growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal  The probability of an unwelcome fall in   inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in   inflation  With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be   patient in removing its policy accommodation”      Chairman Greenspan   Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner  Yes  Governor Bernanke   Yes  Governor Bies    Yes  Governor Ferguson   Yes  Governor Gramlich   Yes  President Hoenig   Yes  Governor Kohn   Yes  President Minehan   Yes  Governor Olson   Yes  President Pianalto   Yes  President Poole   Yes      March 16, 2004 88 of 107      As far as the directive is concerned, the wording can be found on page 14   of the Bluebook “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions   that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run   objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent   with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent”   With regard to the wording also being voted on, taking Vincent’s revised draft, sentence   number 6, of course, is unchanged from last time  It reads “The Committee perceives that the   upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are   roughly equal”  And then we have the revised wording under alternative B for sentences 7 and 8   “Similarly, the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance  At this juncture, with   May 4, 2004 100 of 112       inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be   removed at a pace that is likely to be measured”      Chairman Greenspan  Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  Governor Bernanke  Yes  Governor Bies   Yes  Governor Ferguson  Yes  Governor Gramlich  Yes  President Hoenig  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  President Minehan  Yes  Governor Olson  Yes  President Pianalto  Yes  President Poole  Yes       First, with regard to the directive wording, which is on page 14 of the   Bluebook  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will   foster price stability and promote sustainable growth and output  To further its long-run objectives,   the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with   increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1½ percent”    I will also read the sentence regarding the assessment of risks, which the Committee is also   voting on  But before I get to that, I was asked to note that in box 4 under alternative B—and this, I   guess, would be the fourth revision—the end of that sentence which says “prices evidently reflect   transitory factors” should read “prices seem to reflect transitory factors”  What I will be reading   now is the language shown under June FOMC in boxes 5 and 6  “The Committee perceives the   upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the   next few quarters are roughly equal  With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low,   the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be   measured  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to   fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability”       Chairman Greenspan  Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  Governor Bernanke  Yes  Governor Bies   Yes  Governor Ferguson  Yes  Governor Gramlich  Yes   August 10, 2004 88 of 103          President Hoenig  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  President Minehan  Yes  Governor Olson  Yes  President

Hoenig  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  President Minehan  Yes  Governor Olson   Yes  President Pianalto  Yes  President Poole  Yes     September 21, 2004 86 of 100            Let me mention that, as soon as the Board members come back, there   will be a picture-taking session  And unless there is a change in plans, you will be asked to   move to that end of the room        Yes, before lunch     [Recess]     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  [Applause]  Well, this is a   surprise  I don’t know what to say  Obviously, I’ve stayed on about a dozen years beyond the   September 21, 2004 88 of 100          time when I could have retired because I liked the work  I joined the FOMC Secretariat in 1968   and have enjoyed the experience immensely ever since  I’ve especially liked the work   atmosphere and the people I have been working with  In some cases, I’ve known you for quite a   long period  For example, as I look around the table, I’m reminded that two of you were fellow   staff members in the 1960s—President Poole and Governor Gramlich  And several of my   former colleagues from the 1960s became members of the Board of Governors, including Nancy   Teeters, Martha Seger, Lyle Gramley, Chuck Partee, and Bob Holland  Governor Kohn came   somewhat later  [Laughter]  Presidents Yellen and Minehan worked here at the Board as well    The one constant was the high quality of the staff and the Committee members with whom I   have worked  I’ve enjoyed my association with all of you over these many years, and I thank   you for the friendship that you have expressed and you, Mr Chairman, for your very kind words   this morning  Again, thank you all very much  [Applause]    END OF MEETING   September 21, 2004 89 of 100        Let me begin with the directive wording, which is on page 15 of the   Bluebook  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that   will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run   objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent   with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1¾ percent”   With regard to the wording in the press statement that is formally voted on, the second   full paragraph of the draft statement  “The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks   to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be   roughly equal  With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes   that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured  Nonetheless,   the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation   to maintain price stability”
