  But then it’s up to the President whether he acts or not    Was there a discussion last time about, or do you have thinking on,   when it would be appropriate to issue this?  Is it post-default?  Is it pre-default?  What’s the   thinking?    To amplify that  If the real risk is of a failed auction, then saying   something before it happens actually plays into whether it happens or not  It’s worth thinking   about that    I’m not totally resolved  I’m completely fine with 1 through 5 and more   than that  Just let me say that      As a policy matter, yes  I wonder, on a number of grounds, whether it is   wise for us to be disclosing the things we will and won’t do right now, a month and a half before   the next debt ceiling crisis  It seems to me you could argue—and I’d like to hear, obviously,   what others think—that the very thought that we actually countenance a debt default would be   destabilizing  You can also argue that—here is your game plan—if it actually looks like a good   game plan, then it will make it less likely that the Congress will feel enough pressure to actually   raise the ceiling  I do think that the right time to be making disclosures is before a default; you   don’t wait until after a default  I think you want to have a plan before there’s a failed auction,   and to be saying we’re here to provide liquidity and assure the orderly function of the short-term   money markets  And that, ideally, is enough to avoid a default  The real risk is of a failed   auction, is the loss of market access at any price  It’s not that I want to wait until there is a   default  I think that’s the wrong thing  But I wonder whether just dropping this in the minutes   on November 20 is wise    Let me just make one last point, which is that we’re doing two things   here  We’re acting as the Treasury’s agent, and we’re also concerned about the dual mandate    October 16, 2013 26 of 50    We obviously have an independent role to play, and I think that when financial stability threatens   our execution of the dual mandate, at that time we should communicate as we see fit  I see that   as coming later, but I guess that’s a good question    Yes, please  I want to come back to what the risk is here  I think the   risk is of a failed auction  Specifically, it’s a failed bill auction; it’s a bill auction where the bill   is going to be due in the middle of the next crisis  And if you look at options 1 through 5—  again, which I am happy to support—they don’t really help with that  Bills are excluded from   many of the options, and the discount window has got stigma  So I think you get to 6 and 7, and   really 7 is the one that puts us in a position to address what is in fact the main issue that we could   be facing here  You’re offering repo; you’re offering liquidity against short-term securities    And, again, I would be doing this, as Governor Tarullo suggested, in connection with an   announcement that we are providing liquidity to assure the working of the cash markets   As long as I’m talking, I find 8 and 9 to be loathsome  I hope that gets into the minutes    [Laughter]  But I don’t want to say today what I would and wouldn’t do, if we have to actually   deal with a catastrophe on this    Yes, under certain circumstances     Perhaps I can amplify what I meant by “loathsome”    I don’t disagree with a word of that  I’m just saying that these are   decisions you really, really don’t ever want to have to make  It’s a terrible decision to have to   make  And by my last comment, I meant to suggest that, in extremis, I wouldn’t rule it out  And   that’s kind of where you are at that point    The institutional risk would be huge  The economics of it are right, but   you’d be stepping into this difficult political world and looking like you are making the problem   go away  I mean, I wouldn’t say we wouldn’t do it or I wouldn’t support doing it   October 16, 2013 43 of 50     Can I amplify one question?  I see 7 as going much broader than   defaulted securities, though  I don’t see 7 as being limited to defaulted securities   SEVERAL  Right    Okay
