105,1976-07-19,"  We have consistently been underestimating the growth of the proxy  Historical experience accounts for part of the adjustment, the second part relates--    --to the fact that we--the targets have been higher    --than the actual experience  Secondly, business loan expansion has  been relatively modest in our projections throughout, but this time I think we also had a small  marginal downward adjustment in our expectations for business loans and hence a little bit less     7/19-20/76 - 45 -   expansion in CDs that are forecast  That also would contribute to our expectation of slower  growth in the proxy    That’s correct    Are you talking about M1 or M2?    That’s right  Our best judgment provided a forecast for M2 that is just  marginally below the current range, and we felt that under those circumstances the staff would  not specify a change, but the tendency was for our forecasters to provide somewhat lower deposit  flows rather than higher  "
336,1977-04-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     Judging from the behavior of the stock market, certainly last week, and  bond markets as well, financial market participants looked upon this action as quite a favorable  step and associated it with somewhat less upward pressure on interest rates and a lesser  inflationary impact  In our own staff forecast, we did have a slight impact on business  investment spending; in part that came later on from the removal of the business investment tax  credit as well as a somewhat slower pattern of consumption  I think we have not generally  allowed [for] much of the impact of an expectational sort within this forecast  Indeed, what  we’ve done is try to strip out the explicit impact of the rebate that was in our earlier forecast,  which to us seemed to be reasonable and on the moderate side    That is correct    On percentage terms, it’s probably just about a wash, certainly after  taxes    I have not seen recent Sindlinger reports  In the last three months or so,  he has been reporting a decidedly bearish attitude; but that coincided with an exceptional surge  in retail sales, which is very difficult to sort out    No, there is not    Well, we were working with assumptions that the rebates would begin  about mid-May    That, in a sense, falls out of the arithmetic  The rebate is assumed to  have a temporary impact on the level of GNP, and in the early quarters, quarters two and three in  1977, it boosted activity to relatively high rates of growth  Stripping that away, what we find is  that the rebate was having a dragging influence later on as the effect is wearing off  So we take  out--what is implicitly happening here is the underlying level of GNP is returning to its longer- run trend rate of growth    As indicated by the fact that our forecast is too low for the first quarter    The odds on the scenario?    If one were to look at our track record, you know what the odds would  be  But ignoring the past and simply going on, this is a conditional forecast, as you know, and  it’s premised upon the underlying GNP package, which we view as quite strong     Second, it is premised upon alternative B in the Bluebook longer-run path of 5-1/2 percent  M1  As you go on later this year and on into 1978, you get exceptionally large increases in  money velocity, which we have had in the past, obviously, but we are anticipating that the effect  of the downward shifting money demand function will gradually wear off  And looking at it  from the money demand side, I think the odds are quite good that you have an increase in interest  rates     The Treasury bill futures market anticipates roughly what we anticipate in terms of rising  rates [and the structure of the yield curve is telling us the same thing]  Outside forecasts that I  am aware of generally anticipate rising rates  And our flow of funds forecast is consistent,  looking at it from the credit market side, with rising rates  I think the question isn’t so much,  Will rates rise?  The question is, How much?  And I guess my own feeling would be that rates     4/19/77 - 8 -           may not rise as much as we have in here  If we’re wrong, that would be a more likely outcome  than that it would be higher  And that, in a sense, reflects my own judgment about the  uncertainty regarding money demand functions    Well, in our forecasts, we have continued high governmental borrowing  in the second half of the year  This quarter, as you know, is the quarter in which the Treasury is  not expected to raise any additional funds, or in fact may be a net repayer of debt  But it will  raise substantial funds in the third and fourth quarters  Secondly, we do have both private  business credit demands and household credit demands rising in line with projections of our  GNP  Third, the assumption in the Greenbook of the sustained 5-1/2 percent M1 growth--we  assume that there will be strong underlying demands for cash given nominal rates of GNP  growth in the double digit range  So it falls out, essentially, from our underlying assumptions    That is correct    I think it is really borrowing from the past  I think our analysis of the  auto market suggests that, during 1974 and 1975, with the recession and with consumer attitudes  depressed, the scrappage rate of autos declined very sharply; that is, consumers held on to their  autos much longer than usual  And in our view, a good deal of current strength is attributable to  replacement of cars that were not replaced on a normal cycle  And to that extent, it is a  transitory influence, and we should catch up  But in any event, I don’t think it’s so much  borrowing from the future as much as a catch-up phenomenon    Well, it takes a long time for this process to work through  We were  talking about, really, two years in which car sales were postponed  It is hard to sort out to what  extent that’s influencing the February-March numbers, and it might well go on [for] the balance  of this year  But you’re right, at some point that argument evaporates; then you’re talking about  that influence alone having a depressing factor on overall auto sales    Car sales were depressed in 1974 and 1975, and apparently there have  been substantial increases for full-size cars for 1974-1975 model years, and there are relatively     4/19/77 - 10 -           few of those available because that was a poor year for large-size cars to begin with and for total  cars in general    It would be line 16 on this table    That’s right    Correct    Well, the total acquisitions of deposits and credit market instruments  does decline over this period  It coincides with the period where households are also taking on  large amounts of mortgage debt and consumer installment debt  But I think the important  message is that the way in which households are induced to acquire additional market securities  is through the interest rate process, that market rates rise relative to deposit interest rates, and  hence they are induced to acquire less deposits and relatively more market securities  And that  does show up in these tables    Actually, quite a bit better than our other assessment  We would have  gotten much looser credit markets than the money supply analysis would have given  But that’s  a track record which doesn’t always hold    That’s right    Mr Zeisel will answer the first, and I’ll take it my hand at the second    The second question as I understand it relates to the performance of  investment and whether we’re getting good gains in investment only when we tend to get much  higher rates of capacity utilization  I think that [idea] is drawn generally from the performance  of the early ’70s to date, and I would hesitate to make a forecast relying on that alone  I think  what’s more important is that business attitudes have changed, and we are not getting a typical  cyclical recovery in business investment, and hence we will find later on that one could say the  excess capacity was a drag on activity     I think that’s important, but more important, I think businesses are quite concerned about  their financial positions, about the uncertainties regarding the economic outlook--importantly,  about the uncertainties regarding prospective profits in an environment where we do have price  performance that has varied a good deal in recent years, and we have on the horizon the energy  program  All of these sorts of things, I think, track into an environment of uncertainty which  would mean that you would tend to find businesses more reluctant at this point in the cycle to  extend themselves on major investment programs  But I’m not sure that this recent performance  represents more than a change in attitudes and the performance of the economy overall    Well, it’s very clear in our forecast that we do not--     We have not    I might note that we are quite concerned about the whole investment  area in a variety of ways and that we’re undertaking--     That’s right  That’s part of it  What I was saying is, we’re taking a  broader tack in our research program, focusing on the business investment sector, and this is one  part of the answer  We do not have any independent staff analysis to contribute at this point    We have not included it in our forecast  We have not had an  opportunity to analyze the program in detail  In fact, we don’t know all of the details and the  critical parts regarding rebate schemes, for example  It presumably would have a substantial  impact on the economy  The only other comment I can make, I guess, at this juncture is, one, I  think there is a risk of increasing uncertainty on the part of the business community, depending  upon how the proposals are perceived, and that would impact back on business investment  And  second is that it’s my understanding that the Administration is taking a longer-run view, so that  the immediate impact, aside from expectational influences, might be moderated by tracking the  proposals over a longer time horizon  But I don’t have any further comments at this time  "
363,1977-05-17,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]    I think the recent data that we have from the Life Insurance Association  of America--and it’s about three-fourths of the industry--indicated rising corporate commitments   The weak segment continues to be the commercial mortgages, but that, too, was just edging up a  bit  I think one of the comments that we sorted out from our contacts with the insurance industry  is that they are literally flooded with funds, and one of the problems, I think, is sorting out the  extent to which they’d like to invest in high-yield acceptable instruments relative to the amount  of money available, and I think they have more money than they see good commitments  available  Perhaps it’s that interpretation that they are placing upon the flow of funds    Well, I think the key area of business investment--that’s the one that has  fooled us for some time  And if we got into a situation where consumer spending slowed  substantially, we could find that business investment plans were deferred, and I think that would  pose a risk to our forecast     I might note, though, that in terms of our consumer spending projection, we have looked at  that very carefully because it is a place where our forecast differs from a number of outside  forecasters, for example  And just to indicate what we have in the second quarter, we’ve  assumed an increase in retail sales in May and June, 1/4 percent each month  That will get us on  average something like a 10-1/2 percent [annual rate] increase in personal consumption     5/17/77 - 3 -           expenditures this quarter, so we have already seen a massive burst of spending  And secondly, if  we move into the third quarter, we have in our forecast a dropping off in consumption  expenditures to about an 8-1/2 percent annual rate, so we have allowed, we think, for an  appropriate lull in spending  It gets much worse than that, I think  It could well be feedback, at  that time, in the business equipment area, which I think does pose a problem there      Well, I think, perhaps by later this year  We have raised our forecast for  this quarter in plant and equipment expenditures, and I think the third quarter looks very good,  given the orders and shipments data  But as you get on into the fourth quarter and early next  year, I think that’s where you might find something happening      We talked about that--among the staff--and I think our assessment is  rather low  But not minimal  I think there is a risk, of course, if consumer spending were to  slow and the momentum that we have now in industrial production [were to be maintained],we  could find inventory backing up a good deal  And concerns could arise similar to those that  developed a year ago     We’re familiar with the housing situation in Southern California,  especially, but I’m not familiar with the second mortgage situation      5/17/77 - 5 -            I’m not aware of any dollar magnitudes that are available on that  The  aggregate use of margin credit has been increasing and is now at a new high level  It’s about a  billion dollars over what it was six months ago  But I’m not aware to what extent it’s to  purchase securities as opposed to withdrawing the funds from the account    The System Research Advisory Committee    All right    Yes    I truthfully don’t know--this is a highly volatile series, as you know  I  think that is part of it; the weather effect may have been another  We have also heard at  McGraw-Hill that the bulge in March reflected some contracts that were just reaching fruition  about the same time, and it may be sort of a lumping problem over the February-March period   But I am not aware of anything  Jerry, maybe you are?    I’m sorry we don’t--    Fine    I think the gains in industrial production--I don’t have the numbers right  handy--were stronger through the first quarter on average  I think it is closer to 5 percent  And  given the strong surge in sales, the inventory numbers that we have, and what we would  anticipate for the second quarter, much of the production is going into final consumption  It is  not showing up in inventories     Most recently, in looking at the industrial production index, there has been a pickup,  however, in nondurable goods supplies, materials and supplies, and so if you look back in terms  of stable processing, we’re getting a buildup there, which will feed through  And I think that’s  where the inventories are now concentrated; it’s in its early production process  And I would not  view the current numbers as being out of balance  Jerry, would you have a comment?    I think it depends very heavily on one’s expectation for sales and--    That’s right, but the inventory growth that we have projected is really  quite moderate relative to sales, so we still have in our projection, in each of the four quarters  this year, a decline in the inventory-sales ratio      Well, the arithmetic, I think, is correct, so what one has to focus on is  the two parts of that ratio  Either you get a faster increase in production--a buildup in  inventories--or alternatively, sales don’t keep pace and production adjustments come along with  a lag and you get this buildup in the ratio because sales tend to falter while production is still  roaring along  We don’t have that in our forecast; it’s one of those things that obviously could  happen, and it did, indeed, happen last year    Right  It’s in the first quarter, I think; it begins to turn around, and in  the second quarter of 1978, we have it bouncing up    If we had something like we had a year ago, I think we’d be talking  about significantly less real growth in total  And I must say, personally, I’m getting a bit  discouraged with the behavior of markets in terms of pricing behavior relative to the strength of  markets  I think increasingly, the staff is convinced that transactions prices in many areas are  differing from list prices, and that’s in part confusing the situation, in that many industries are  attempting to push through price increases at every opportunity  And more recently, we have  had reports that, with the pickup in demand in certain areas, there’s been a very rapid increase in  prices, but at the same time, it has not been affected in terms of the actual transactions prices     And so it’s not at all clear to me--the impact of this so-called rolling readjustment on actual  transaction prices  I think that it could well be that you begin to get, in some areas like capital  goods, some price increases that we haven’t seen yet because there hasn’t been a good deal of  strength  In other areas, it may well be that list prices don’t change very much, so that the  indexes as they measure prices perhaps are giving us a poor reading       5/17/77 - 14 -           It certainly can’t hurt; it runs in the direction of lessening price pressures  I think this is  particularly important in the housing area, which is the one place where we have heard reports of  potential supply problems with wallboard, insulation, that sort of thing  So with a slowdown in  housing for example, I think it [unintelligible] the price problem--      They get in to the 85, 86 percent range    Jerry, would you--Jerry has been watching this particular situation    Mr Chairman, we have an explicit estimate of the Administration  proposal  Governor Gardner, [for] the first quarter of 1979, which is when it will become  effective, our estimate is that it will add 1-1/2 percentage points annual rate to total  compensation, 2 percentage points in the first quarter  of 1980, and 2-1/2 percentage points in the  first quarter of 1981    Yes, they’re consistent  We have a fairly easy corporate bond market   We’ve got a lot of institutional money around, and some drop-off in corporate bond market  borrowing  Our explicit forecast of a corporate bond rate is, by the end of this year, to the 8-1/2  percent area, which is only up about 1/4 point, so you do have a substantial flattening in the yield  curve as you go through the year  "
400,1977-06-21,"  We can obtain that number and provide it in a few minutes for you    The model is weaker, and particularly consumer spending is weaker   And the pattern on inventories is such that, at the end of the projection period, accumulation of  inventories is about the same  But in the earlier periods, the model is considerably weaker,  which would give you a somewhat weaker second half, particularly, than the judgmental  forecast     But I think the major difference is in this consumption area, which is clearly weaker  And  you end up with slower growth of real GNP over this projection [period] if you take the  monetary assumptions [as being] the same and just run the model without any judgmental  influence     Yes, right  That’s what happens  The saving rate drifts up higher  I  might note that it looks like the model is indeed going to be off on the consumption sector in the  first quarter and second quarter  It clearly understated the degree of spending     I think also the interest rate side--I don’t recall precisely what we had  for interest rates, but I do know by this time we had anticipated higher market rates, so that if  velocity is pretty much on course, I think what is off is indeed that interest rate levels are less  than we had anticipated given the kind of strength in economic activity that we now see  developed    I think that’s right  I don’t have the numbers back in the January- February period  It’s clear that over the balance of the projection period, we have M1 velocity  rising at around a 7 percent annual rate, which is really very high, as you know    Let me just note that we do have some numbers on this residential rent  index in the CPI, and in ’75 and ’76, that index had been rising at around a 5-1/4 percent annual  rate  And in the first quarter of this year, it’s 58 percent  The monthly pattern is, February, a  36 percent annual rate, 6 percent in March, 84 percent in April  So we seem to be on a  somewhat rising pattern for that particular measure of rents     That’s right    Well, the first quarter is partly influenced by the winter weather, which  presumably affected costs more than it did sales and profits  And on a quarterly average basis,  the pickup that you are talking about really occurred later in the quarter  So I think there’s a lag  phenomenon at work there that would affect the first-quarter performance     In addition, we do have the minimum wage increase--and at an annual rate you get a shock  effect in the first quarter, which presumably is also calculated in these figures  So some of that  ought to show up later on in the second quarter, but the second quarter does look very strong to  us, either, I guess, in terms of profits performance      Well, it’s in part this lag effect, believing that the first half is an  understatement of the underlying trend and that we have got special factors at work  We are not  as high on corporate profits as we were several months ago, [and the change] reflects, in part I  guess, the somewhat less optimistic view on corporate costs and, secondly, a somewhat weaker  picture for real GNP      I might also note, early in the year we had a high-employment surplus  of about $10 billion  And, in part, a transitory effect [is] reflected in that number, that is, gift  taxes shot up to something like a $6 billion annual rate in the first quarter  And that particular  number, of course, works into higher receipts  And so the first-quarter performance, I think, is  the wrong base to measure from      It’s a consequence of the change in the tax law last September, which in  effect changed the rules on gift taxes  And apparently a lot of gifts were made in December to  avoid the higher taxation implicit in January  And those were paid largely in the month of  February  And [in] the first quarter, it’s about a $5-1/2 billion to $6 billion annual rate, which in  effect also shows up in our numbers in the first quarter as a reduction in the saving rate by about  four-tenths  So that saving rate is a bit lower, as well, because of this effect     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]    For the June-July period?  We have it in one of these tables if I can  locate it  M1 in June of last year declined 12 percent and in July rose 71 percent      No    No, that is right  We are starting clearly at a June base that’s roughly a  bit higher  But essentially the same sort of thing in terms of, after two months or so, we assume  that resumption of growth will occur  That’s what we’ve built into our patterns this time  This is  two months after this massive bulge--     6/21/77 - 23 -          That’s right, if our forecast is right, it will be stronger this time around  than last     Well, since we have a little bit higher rate on average for that period, we  have a higher rate     We, by the way, are just about on track now in terms of [the second]  quarter  We had an 82 percent annual rate of growth, and we have about the same this time  So,  on average in the second quarter this year and last, there’s not much change     Well, this is the first July that we had this  [Previously there were two  instances] of this sort of experience--the third time around [will be] this July  In April, there  were clearly a number of things going on  We had three special factors, I remember, plus sort of  underlying transactions demands  So one of the issues is, how much do you allow for seasonal  impact of this Social Security check?  And, quite frankly, the reason I brought it up is to call it to  your attention, but also I’d like to put a little tone of uncertainty on it  I know the New York  Federal Reserve Bank has a somewhat smaller allowance--at least in our staff discussions early  on they have allowed something smaller than we have  So I think there is a good deal of  uncertainty as to how much one ought to put into this special factor      But that’s my point, I think, Frank, that this isn’t a seasonal  If it  happened every year, it would be up every year because you have a larger volume of money in  the hands of the Social Security recipients for a longer period during that year  But I don’t think  it is a seasonal at all     Well, the third of the month is on Saturday or Sunday or holiday  I  might say there’s a chance--    In dollar terms, a billion and a half  But let me just say for that  particular week, July 6, our weekly pattern consistent with alternative B has a not-seasonally  adjusted increase of $10 billion and a seasonally adjusted increase of $3 billion  So there’s a $7  billion seasonal adjustment there in that week already, so out of the three we assume that 1-1/2 is  associated with this Social Security affect    Yeah  Without it we would be down to a 58 percent annual rate of  growth in July     82    It’s that the change from [the week of] July 6 to [that of] July 13 is  different with the higher level in the first week  We have it all washing out in the first 15 days of  July  And that’s indeed what happened, if our interpretation is correct, in both October and  April--that it’s a first-half phenomenon, and it occurs largely in the first week, and a little bit in  the second week, and in the third week it’s all gone    You’re quite correct  I meant that the level of the money stock is not  higher after mid-July, but on average you are talking about--    With regard to New York, the only information that we have that seems  quite consistent--we’ve checked reasonably thoroughly on this--deals with the performance of  the commercial paper market  Many of the prime customers apparently were in the paper  market  We tracked down the names of some of those issuers who were large borrowers earlier  in April and May, particularly, and they seemed to have been candidates for New York City  banks  And perhaps the borrowing that would normally have gone to the New York banks  showed up in the paper market     With regard to the prime rate spread, it clearly has narrowed  I don’t know about further  narrowing  I think that the pressure would be there, given the New York banks’ performance on  business loans, and the Redbook clearly reports qualitative comments that business loan demand  at New York banks is relatively weak  And so I think that there would be some continued  pressure because of the preference of many of the borrowers to seek alternative sources of funds   And so I think that the pressures are in that direction for a narrowing of the spread    I wouldn’t be surprised to see anything, frankly, on a monthly basis, but  I think one of the factors tending to hold down July growth in our view is still some continuing  lag impact of the higher interest rates--that we ought to be having some marginal trending down  of what would otherwise be the underlying rate of growth of money demands holding interest  rates constant  So I think our guess at this juncture is quite good  But if I put all the special  factors together and what would likely come out, I think that we could very well be in for  somewhat higher rather than somewhat lower numbers  "
424,1977-07-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]    Before answering, let me just say that we’re having a great deal of  difficulty with the econometric model in the money demand function, which has been causing  most people difficulty  And so I think the confidence which we would associate with our  alternative M1 rates of growth and what the impacts are is less today than what it would have  been two or three years ago     For what it’s worth, in the first year, if you go from Q2 1977 to Q2 1978, a half a  percentage point less M1 is worth, in terms of real growth, according to the model, about 2/10 or  3/10 percent, and it’s worth 1/10 percent rate of growth on the deflator  As you stretch on in the  second year, the impacts become considerably larger, especially on the deflator  It’s worth about  3/10 lower price inflation there in the second year, and it’s worth about 5/10 or 6/10 lower real  growth    One-half--    The former  The rate of growth is about 3/4 percentage point more--I  think it’s the equivalent of 6-1/4 percent versus 5-1/2  It’s reflected in our projection most  explicitly in the fact that we have lower interest rates now associated with virtually the same  level of nominal GNP  But the incoming information, as we’ve read it, has, on average, been  weaker, and so it works out essentially to an unchanged overall position    We haven’t explicitly considered that, but we are aware that there are  some problems  The aluminum situation in the West is one  We understand that there are some  aluminum facilities in the Southwest that use natural gas that are not effective in today’s  environment  They are included in these numbers in the capacity side  But clearly, the energy  situation in some industries has reduced potential capacity, and it’s just very difficult to get at  that  So I think perhaps the energy situation has, in effect, lowered the full capacity utilization  rate from what it would have been otherwise  But by how much, it is difficult to tell    You recollect correctly, and I think the last time that it was done might  have been something like a year ago  And I believe that the major difficulty that we faced is our  own concern about measuring policy impacts in a model in which the money stock is quite  important, or interest rates are quite important  You specify one or the other--we’ve been  specifying M1--and we find that for the last two years, the equation has been off literally by 2  percentage points  And so it causes a great deal of difficulty  If it’s a shift that stops and we go  on from here, then we would have confidence in the output     I think it’s useful  We have been doing it at the staff level each month, looking at  alternatives, and so I wouldn’t have any difficulty in providing the Committee with the  information  I would just feel less comfortable than I would have some time in the past  But we  can certainly do it, and there is no difficulty in providing it    Mr Chairman, we can put that--    We can put that together  I would hope it’s quarterly and not monthly,  though    We have the compensation--    We have not explicitly sorted that out in our discussions internally   That was one of the factors that influenced us in showing a drifting up of compensation  throughout 1978    Well, we don’t have a very bullish housing market    Close to 2 million--    We are not disturbed yet by those indicators, but they run in the  direction that you pointed  And [with] the sales of new houses being down, along with the stock  of unsold houses or completed new homes rising quite sharply in the last few months, it looks  like there is something happening that’s quite different than what prevailed over the last year or  so     On the auto market, I think only two key comments that relate to your question  One is,  we do assume increasing price competitiveness of domestic models relative to foreign models   One [factor] is the exchange rate impacts in price increases that have gone into our thinking; in  addition, we understand that the sales of foreign models have been sustained recently by a profit  squeeze on foreign car dealers--that they have been trying to keep down the price effects that  they have been absorbing--and over time, domestic models become more competitive  Secondly,  we, as you know, assume that the continued strong demand for autos overall can be related to the  fact that replacement demand during 1974-75 was very low  The average age of the auto stock is     7/19/77 - 23 -    higher than we think is the equilibrium, so this replacement demand that was postponed during  the earlier downturn will help sustain auto sales  And those are the two key features    I don’t know the answer to that question  Jerry, perhaps you are aware  of something we have done  I think it’s a good question  It certainly hasn’t been done recently,  and we can do that and provide you with the information without any difficulty  But I just can’t  answer it at this point    That’s right  That’s what the model is currently showing--    I’d like to pass that question to Ted Truman, who is more familiar with  this portion of the projection than I am    In general, that’s right  We are on the high side of the outside forecasts  we have looked at    It moves up to 53 percent by 1980, 1 percentage point a year  "
450,1977-08-16,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]    No, I did not  You’re talking about the recent past, or our forecast, or  both?    Profits in the latter half of 1976 were revised down significantly with  the recent revision in the GNP and national income accounts data  The first quarter is very  weak  The implicit profits currently contained in the GNP data, which we’ll receive next week  for the second quarter, indicate an increase of around 7 percent or so  We think it’s likely to be a  bit stronger than that       8/16/77 - 5 -           For our forecast, I must say that we were much more optimistic about profit performance  several months ago than we are today  [The difference] stems in part from a little bit weaker  performance on real output as we go through this period  But importantly, it stems from a look  at unit labor costs, which in our forecasts had been edging up over the past several months  And  in general, corporate profits now in the forecast are sufficient to retain their share of GNP or  gross corporate product but do little more than that  So, historically, they have not fully  recovered and are not up to levels that we had seen back in ’72, ’73  So I would say that it’s not  a terribly bearish performance, but it certainly isn’t good, particularly if you take a longer sweep  of history and look at the performance of profits at a much higher level in relative terms in the  ’50s and part of the ’60s    Well, as I indicated at the end, when we put this projection together, we  did not have the retail sales data  It’s not so much July which shows an increase, which we had  been anticipating, but it’s from a considerably lower level than had been indicated earlier  because of the downward revision in June  So taking that, I think we’ve looked at this quite  carefully, and we also had anticipated a bit stronger increase in industrial production in July than  turned out to be the case  So that’s been after this projection was prepared and went to press     For the current quarter, our thinking now would be somewhere in terms of 4/10 percent to  5/10 percent less real growth than we’ve indicated  So we get a little below 5 perhaps  And I  think our view of the longer run does indeed differ, in the sense that we think there is a prospect  of good performance for the fourth quarter  But you’re quite correct about this quarter, and  given the information we have, we would weaken the projection    Well, I think it’s quite possible  I think, really, the best bet now is not  to have a repeat of 1976  I’m not sure it’s in the cards  I’d be reluctant to go that far, and as I  read what President Morris said, it’s essentially what we’re talking about, but a much stronger  performance going into the early part of 1978     Some other data that we didn’t have at the time this Greenbook went to press dealt with  some early indications of capital appropriations from the Conference Board  And their survey is  not fully tabulated for the second quarter, but it has sort of a year’s lead time  And it does show  capital appropriations rising significantly, and I think that bodes well for ’78  I think the mix on  the investment side is sort of positive, but it’s at the same time very hard to stake out a sizable  increase  We do have good growth in business fixed investment  It’s just hard at this time to see  the evidence to justify substantially larger rates of increase in investment than we have in our  projections    From first [quarter] the first [quarter] in business fixed investment?    Excuse me; all right  The number they have is about 7 percent for  totals  In the first quarter, it was down 26 percent, and if you take out petroleum refiners in the  first quarter, capital appropriations rose about 1 percent  And in the second quarter, if you take  out petroleum, the increase is indicated to be about 17 percent  I would indicate, that’s the  Alaska pipeline and associated facilities  These numbers are supposedly confidential, I believe  September 1 or 2, and it’s an early reading, but it is up, and it’s after a very strong fourth quarter,  which was about a 31 percent increase, in the fourth quarter of ’76  So there seems to be a lot  going on in this area that perhaps could come on stream as we get into ’78  We’re counting on  that     8/16/77 - 9 -            That stems largely from the projection for imports, which, if you note in  this projection is bouncing around a good deal [and is] related to the staff’s expectation with  regard to oil imports particularly  In the fourth quarter, it is anticipated that there will be a  substantial stockpiling of imported oil, which drives up imports and gets carried into inventories,  which go up and [then] run off in the first quarter     And the rationale for that is that the imposition of the well-head tax on January 1 coincides  with the Administration’s plan to eliminate the so-called entitlements program, which provides  something like 75 cents a barrel to imported or foreign oil  And that will disappear January 1     8/16/77 - 10 -           according to plan  And hence it is assumed that there will be a substantial buildup in the fourth  quarter  Something similar was going on in the second quarter of this year in our interpretation  of the data, where oil inventories rose substantially [in] anticipation of the OPEC price increase  as well as [because of] the initial announcement effect of the Administration’s well-head tax and  the removal of the entitlement program  So it’s essentially a wash over this time period and has  no lasting influence    Well, the way we go about this is to tie it to the Bluebook path B, and  we have incorporated from quarter two [1977] to quarter two ’78, 5-1/4 percent [growth in] M1   So implicit in the forecast this time is, I think--Steve, is it something like 4 percent in the next  three quarters?    So what we have as the offset to that, of course, is higher interest rates   So we have higher interest rates this time than last time, and it comes out that way  So we tie it  really to the longer-run target and do not allow for a judgmental feel as to what may happen on  the high side of the range or the low side    Well, I just went to the local beach, so it’s not a good guide  And  you’re just back from vacation, so I presume it’s sort of hazardous for me to venture out with an  answer    We have [some] selected data on hotel occupancy and figures from the  airline industry, but unfortunately I am just not familiar with those currently, and Jerry, too, is  not up to date  So I’m afraid we can’t provide a reasonable answer to question at this time  But  we can prepare a memo for you on that    I have the impression that in a number of the major countries, capacity  utilization rates are somewhat below those of the US, and world supplies in many of the basic  commodities are in quite a strong position, but I’d like to defer to Ted Truman  "
477,1977-09-20,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]    I would prefer it if we could hear from Mr Truman, who is much more  familiar with the net exports  I think that is an important influence, but perhaps he has a  comment    Debt burdens as measured in a variety of ways relative to disposable  personal income have gone up a good deal  And they’re at reasonably high levels, cyclically   However, much of this has been attributable to mortgage debt, which is of a long-term character,  and I think when we’ve looked at the various relationships, we’ve been reasonably convinced  that--assuming real growth in the economy of something like 4 to 5 percent over the next year,  year and a half--sufficient disposable income would be generated so that the increase in debt  burdens on current levels would be only marginal     In the consumer installment area, there too, there’s been some lengthening of debt burdens,  particularly because of the longer contracts for autos  But since March, we’ve had increases in  consumer installment debt that have fallen short of what was a very high March level-- down in     9/20/77 - 4 -   April, down in May, down in June--and July was about the same as in June  So that, in the  context of our projection, once again, we think that consumers will be less aggressive to some  extent in acquiring durable goods, [and] given good growth in disposable incomes, we don’t  think there’d be much of an increase in the debt burden relationship on current levels  But I  think an important point to stress is that those debt burden levels could deteriorate quite rapidly  if income grew very slowly for any extended period of time    That’s not our expectation    That’s correct  In the third and fourth quarter of this year, we have a  pickup in the rate of spending, and the deficit this quarter was estimated at $12 billion on a full-  employment basis; [the deficit] rises to $16 billion in the fourth quarter, then declines in each  quarter of 1978, [and] reaches $2 billion in the final quarter of 1978  The most recent experience  is that the shortfall, depending on how one measures that, is [now] deepening  In August, federal  expenditures picked up a bit--part of this relates to the CCC [Commodity Credit Corporation]  purchases  But throughout the account structure, [there] appears to be some pickup in the pace  of spending, and we anticipate that will carry through into the fourth quarter    That’s right  Now, on an NIA [national income accounts] basis, we still  have some grants to state and local governments that will be fed out  I might note that the Carter  Administration budget outlays for fiscal 1978 were $463 billion; the concurrent resolution that  was approved is, I think, at 459  And our outlays are about 456  So we assume some continuing  shortfall in 1978, which perhaps may not materialize  But that’s built into our forecasts and into  the full-employment deficit numbers    Just checked; it’s 486    I’m familiar with it  The argument, I guess, is that full employment is  something around 6-1/2, 7 percent     9/20/77 - 5 -    Well, I would rather turn it around and hear very clearly what the  arguments are for supporting such a notion  I think that’s extreme  Absolutely extreme    Well, I’m not convinced  The arguments in part relate to the  demographic factors involved in the composition of the labor force, the change in welfare  programs, food stamps, and other things, the upward bias associated with the numbers--a whole  host of arguments  When we’ve looked at some of those in our own analysis, we would clearly  conclude that the unemployment rate, full-employment unemployment rate, is higher today than  it was several years ago  [But] in no way is it close to 7    That’s true, and I don’t think we have any difficulty with that at all    Well, I would use the full-employment concept cautiously  I think  what’s much more important than the absolute size of the surplus or deficit is the movement in  the deficit over time  And if you adopt a higher unemployment rate on a full-employment basis,  then you have lower receipts and hence a larger deficit  But over five quarters, you would not  change the movement from quarter to quarter; rather, we’d be talking about perhaps $30 billion  instead of 15--moving to a $15 billion deficit as opposed to [moving from] 15 down to 2    Right    That’s right--you’re talking about for fiscal ’78?    It’s about $10 billion in expenditures, and then we have interest  payments, which are about $2-1/2 billion or so higher than that of the Administration’s  Net,  we’re about, I think, $7-1/2 billion off     9/20/77 - 6 -    This is a difficult area [in which] to compare notes verbally, since there  are many concepts of what number you take and when and what you include  We have a  different impression  I only would like to note that, if we’re wrong in $455 [billion], I would  think that we’re probably better assuming something like 459  Which was the House, Senate  concurrent resolution number, which is $4 billion or so short of the Administration’s proposal   And the only other catch, of course, is that there are other federal programs that may be coming  along that we haven’t allowed for, some of which may come along sooner than later, such as in  the tax reform area; the energy program, which is uncertain; and many other things  So I’d  really hesitate to argue at this juncture on that point because my suspicion is that we’ve made  adequate allowance for a shortfall, but if we’re wrong, the odds are that it will be higher rather  than lower in terms of outlays for fiscal ’78    Well, we have, we think--importantly in the investment area, and that’s  where we’re particularly concerned  If we look at the fundamentals in a variety of ways and  dispense with expectations, we tend to [estimate] a more rapid rate of growth of business  investment outlays than we have in our projections  But we think expectations there are  somewhat adverse, and business confidence generally has not been reestablished sufficiently to  give you an investment boom     We [also] factored in expectations on the consumer side  But I must say we’re getting a bit  concerned with the performance of the stock market  In our own analysis [of consumer  spending], we believe that wealth plays an important role, and stock prices are not performing  well, and if [this] were to persist for some time, we think [it] would damp consumption spending  prospects  So we have it in mind, and implicitly in some areas it’s built in    Yes    That’s right  As you can well imagine, it’s difficult to have a great deal  of faith in the numbers that one cranks in on real property values, although they’re large  But in  any event, the stock market is highly visible, and real property is not generally thought of as very  highly liquid  There is some notion, too, that liquidity matters in this concept    Yes, we do    As far as I know, we include, yes, all of that, and debt instruments as  well, and equity values    I perhaps didn’t emphasize that enough  I did refer in my briefing to  cost of capital  And what I had in mind there was both the cost of physical capital and the cost  of capital implied by low equity values  I might note that there are a couple of ways in which we  think that enters into the calculation  One is, as you had mentioned, in terms of expectation   Another is in terms of providing an incentive to acquire existing firms rather than reach out for  new investment, and that activity has clearly been picking up this year    That comes out largely as a result of what’s happened to man-hours in  the past two months  Particularly in August, when man-hours declined roughly 1 percent  If you  discount those man-hour figures somewhat, as we have, the only way you can get something like  a 4-1/2 percent rate of real growth is if you get large gains in productivity, and also better profit  performance, than you would otherwise  But productivity numbers have been jumping around a  good deal, and they’re difficult to make sense of, so I am not surprised by having a fairly large  increase, as we do this quarter     I’m more concerned about what has initiated the problem--mainly the man-hour side  And  as I say, we discounted that  We did receive late yesterday a preliminary projection by the  Commerce Department of the increase in GNP for the third quarter--the first number they come  up with, and it’s never published, is subject to substantial revision, but they have 5 percent real  growth estimated--which seems to us clearly on the high side--and even larger implicit  productivity gains  So they have discounted even more than we have the man-hour numbers  I  suspect, though, that what our forecast hinges on importantly will be September performance,  man-hours and production, and perhaps some revision of these man-hour numbers so that they  are not so deeply negative    Not much  I think it has mixed effects  Actually, in our forecast, we  assume for 1978 that there will be less borrowing per start in given dollars than there is today,  that we will be [cutting back] some of this withdrawal of equity from the housing market  In  fact, that’s implicit in our forecast, in a way, in which a relatively high level of starts continues  to be financed even though deposit flows are shrinking, and we relied more heavily on the  Federal Home Loan Banks; in part, it’s a tighter posture on the part of lending institutions,  squeezing out some of the refinancing     Just one other comment, though, and that is that, if you think in terms of mortgage  borrowing as a source of funds for other than housing finance, which it clearly has been, it’s  quite costly  And one, I think, has to properly connect that idea to the turnover of houses rather  than thinking in terms of refinancing a mortgage regularly, or as a source of funds, because that  is a very high-cost operation  So, in connection with high sales of existing homes and purchases  of new homes, I think clearly, that’s where the bulk of the extra funding is coming from--rather  than thinking of housing as a liquid source of funds    I think perhaps we expressed our idea incorrectly  You are quite right   In fact, total credit demands in our forecast are rising in the second half of this year compared to  the first half  But that is largely associated with the substantial increase in government  borrowing  In our flow of funds forecast, for example--in the first half of this year we had total  private credit demands of about $244 billion; we are forecasting about $252 billion in the second  half of this year, which is an increase to date  So it’s not much, you are right  For the balance of  this year, we don’t anticipate substantial increases  That comes about largely because of a  reduced demand, in the forecast, by businesses for short-term funds, reflecting our downward  revision of inventory investment and a stronger profit performance this quarter than we had in  our forecast before     And secondly, in our forecast we have consumer installment credit rising at about a $3  billion or $4 billion dollar annual rate less in the second half of this year than in the first half  As  we go into 1978, however, our forecast calls for substantial increases in demands for credit by  the private sector and a maintenance of quite high borrowing by the federal government, so you  are ending this year on an upward path and going into 1978 with historically large demands for  funds, and it requires that the households pick up some securities for these markets to clear  And  associated with that process and in our forecast is some further increase in interest rates from  current levels    No--4-1/4 percent real increase over the next five quarters    Well, the longer-run trend is somewhere [between] 3-1/2 and 3-3/4  percent    Oh, yes    Annual rate    On the tax bill?    No, we have done nothing yet    We do look at them, not so much in terms of trying to form our own  judgments but rather after the fact as a check to see where the differences occurred and what’s  happening  And as the point has been mentioned earlier, in the last two months or so, most  private forecasters have been adjusting their forecasts downward  Our own forecast, I would  judge, is at the high end of the range on real growth and at about the middle for price prospects,  or perhaps a bit better than average on the price side  I have before me a selected group of the  forecasters, but Chase, for example, has been very bearish for some time, and I would tend to  discount that; they are talking about 1 percent real growth or so for next year  But it’s quite clear  that, for the end of next year, the Conference Board is around 3 percent, Argus 2 percent, DRI  32 percent, and so in this 2-3 percent real growth--    No, in the latter half of ’78  Most of the contour of the forecast in the  current quarter is much weaker than we have it; fourth quarter, roughly the same    Well, that’s--any help?    I would only say I think the major areas of difference are in personal  consumption, which has been mentioned earlier, [and] inventories, [which] are projected to have  accumulated at a much slower rate than we have  And I think there are policy differences which  are not always clearly specified  But consumption and inventories account for the bulk of the  difference    Well, we’ve been quite high for some time on auto sales and have been  pretty much close to the mark relative to other forecasters  So we did reasonably well in the  past  The argument that we felt was quite important was this notion of replacing the stock  because of the downturn in sales in ’74, ’75  That effect is wearing off, clearly, as we go on   We still think there’s some of that there  We also believe that we can’t quantify it  But we also  believe there will be some demand for fuel-efficient cars, and American producers, on average,  will probably have a reasonably attractive product  So we do have a high number  For 1978, it’s  doubtful that it would be exceeded, and the risks are probably on the downside    I don’t have the foggiest idea  I’m sorry    The major element accounting for those marginal changes is the  performance of fuel imports, and if you look at the net export line, you’ll find that that is  bobbling around quite a bit, too, and it’s the related side of the coin  Namely, in the third  quarter, we are assuming a rundown of stockpiling that occurred in the second  Built into this  projection in the fourth [quarter] is some enlargement of fuel imports to, if you will, beat the  imposition of the well-head tax in January of ’78  And then, as you get into ’78, those imports,  those stocks, are run down again  So it’s the mirror image of what’s happening on net exports  "
501,1977-10-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]    We’ve introduced some new techniques, but that’s not one of them    [Statement--see Appendix]    In the projection, Mr Chairman    Well, we have mortgage rates, for what they’re worth, sort of middle of  the next year in the 9-1/4 percent area, so up a quarter or half, depending on where you are in the  country  But more importantly than just the rate constraint, we have implicit in our forecast what     10/17-18/77 - 10 -         we believe to be some constraint on funds availability and that nonprice terms will probably be  tightening, and that will tend to squeeze some potential borrowers out of the market    Well, we think the near-term factors are quite positive on the financial  side as well as elsewhere, and hence we do have, what I think is--quite right, President Mayo--a  fairly optimistic housing forecast relative, certainly, to the ones I’m familiar with  But if you  look ahead,  as consistent with our bill rate forecast and our financial side, we think that S&L  and mutual savings bank deposit growth in the second half of next year would be something  around the 7-1/2 percent annual rate  That’s roughly half of what we’ve been experiencing now   In our flow of funds forecast, we have the thrift institutions actually liquidating liquid assets to  fund their outstanding commitments in the shorter run and relying quite a bit more heavily on  Home Loan Bank borrowing     But traditionally, that sort of process begins to take its toll [on] attitudes and terms on  mortgages, and what we have in our forecast is a peaking out, if you will, of construction early  next year and a slight trending down  It’s not by any means a collapse in the housing market  I  would view it as still a very strong market but one that has lost its steam, in large part from the  factors induced on the financial side, but as well [from] the demand for housing, [on] which, in  the single-family area, we are certainly not optimistic      Well, we’ve done that computation on GNP for the House-passed bill,  which includes all of the major features of the President’s program through 1985  And in total, I  think our best guess was a reduction in real GNP from the full program averaging about 4/10  percent per year  And the well-head tax alone--I know that was not viewed as the bulk of the  problem  It was the tax on commercial and industrial users which caused the decline in real  GNP  So I would suspect the well-head tax would be quite unimportant in the aggregate, maybe  2/10 at most, 1/10 or 2/10, which, given the errors associated with forecasting, I think would  pretty much drop out  On real GNP, it’s not a major factor    The existing situation    I am not personally familiar with the details of that  We have had it  analyzed within the staff in our international division  And the staff views on this entire energy  program, I must admit, are quite split  But one portion of the staff, in effect, suggests what the  Rand Corporation study came to, which was that, if you impose a tax, it would do nothing in  terms of the average level of retail prices; that, in effect, refiners are now paying the world price  for oil, on average, and if approved, the well-head tax would do nothing  I guess I can’t  comment more than that, except that I’d be delighted to send around for your information the  staff analysis of this particular argument  We can do that promptly    I’m not sure it’s going to do all of it, but we’re planning on a good deal   I think the major difference between the sales and the personal consumption expenditures chart  is indeed the component of services in personal consumption expenditures      We will get the Commerce Department figure on Wednesday, but we’re  running right now with our own estimate of the third quarter    That’s right in terms of our projection  These are quarterly numbers, as  you know, in the real personal consumption expenditures chart; the other numbers are plotted  monthly  But indeed, on average in the third quarter, we anticipate that they will be higher  But  I might note that the recent retail sales data for September, as Jerry mentioned, and the  downward revisions for August were not available when we made the forecast, so that if we were  to do it today with the information now available, we would have a lower third quarter    No, we have not  We would not know what to put in there  I think a  dose of uncertainty in terms of our thinking about business fixed investment has implicitly crept  into the forecast  Other than that, we don’t have an explicit assumption    Well, let me indicate what we have in our forecasts  We have an annual  rate of growth for S&Ls and mutual savings banks in the second half of 1978 that averages a  7-1/2 percent annual rate  At the same time, we have a bill rate there that’s 7-3/4 percent  Now  there, a couple of cautionary notes that I’d like to throw in  One is, probably at least 6 percent of  the 7-1/2 is interest crediting; it’s sort of internally generated--obviously available for use, but  it’s not as though you’re getting direct new inflows  Secondly, about a third of total deposits at  S&Ls now is lodged in four-year accounts, which obviously is quite important since they began     10/17-18/77 - 20 -         in July 1973; they were rather small during the 1973-74 episode, nonexistent for ’66, the ’69-’70  period  Now we’re just beginning to get the first maturities of those four-year accounts     So, institutions may feel a little comfortable now, [but] depending on what happens to  yield spreads in this four- and six-year area, next year is where the withdrawals at maturity  begin  And it’s very difficult to estimate, but our own thinking right now would be that the bill  rate probably has to get near the 8 percent before you’d be talking about a situation comparable  to ’73-’74, in terms of disintermediation, if you like that phrase    I think that’s fair; probably in most cases they are assuming lower  interest rates and getting somewhat lower housing starts    I think so    Very much so  "
530,1977-11-15,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]    Well, the recent low for the total was in the third quarter of 1976  You  may be looking at dollars  I was looking at the--    If I’m wrong, I stand corrected and I will fess up later  [Secretary's  note This statement was not found in Committee records]  "
593,1978-01-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     [Statement continued--see Appendix]     No, we did not discuss prices this morning     Mr Chairman, I talked about equity prices in my final comment  I think   very importantly about profits when talking about equity prices and I am sorry I didn’t pull it out  more explicitly  But clearly, when talking about a price earnings ratio one is talking about profits      Right     Yes, it is     It is also in Part 1 of the Greenbook  We are projecting an increase   averaging close to 6-1/2 percent over the next six quarters     That’s an important element in our thinking  It’s one of the reasons that   we believe the same mortgage rate this time around would have less impact on curtailing demand  for mortgages than in the past  From the past performance of prices in that sector, I think it is quite  clear that consumers are willing to take on additional mortgage debt  The proportion of mortgages  relative to other debt has been running higher for some time and we would expect it to continue  because of the inflation aspect  So it’s one of the reasons we would assume that over the forecast  period we will have perhaps higher starts than we would have thought if we were doing this back in  1973, for example      $34 billion   "

657,1978-03-21,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     Well, not in the direct fashion of simply looking at the rate of growth of   the aggregates and tracking it through  It does, in our view, show up in wages and costs with a lag   So, in our own judgmental approach, we pick it up in an indirect fashion  In our quarterly model,  which we also use in developing our price forecast, it does have an impact, although the lags are  fairly long  But it does feed through and right now the quarterly model is showing rates of price  increase that are just about the same as those in our judgmental forecast; there’s no major  difference  So, yes, we do look at that  But I think it has a long lag phenomenon that is implicit in  our own view      We have a drifting up of the participation rate, but at a slower rate than   we have experienced in the last several years  Our view is that we will begin to see a somewhat  slower rate of growth in the labor force compared to what we experienced the first three years into  this expansion      Well, that’s true  I think one of the big surprises relates to the recent   performance, more so than our projections  That’s particularly true for the third and fourth  quarters In the latter half of last year, real growth slowed substantially and the unemployment rate  came down by over 1/2 point, and that is quite unusual  One of the things we’re investigating  further is some of the rather strange movement on the unemployment side  There is a strong belief  on the part of some of our experts on the staff that the expiration of extended benefit programs may  indeed be a major contributing factor to the sluggish growth in the labor force we’ve seen recently  and also to some of the increase in employment  The turning on and off of these benefit programs  seems to be impacting importantly on the unemployment rate  So, over the future, we have a bit  more optimistic view on the unemployment rate than we had a couple of months ago, in part  reacting to what has happened      I’m not aware of any  Jerry, you may be     Well, I don’t feel good about them in the sense that I wish they would be   lower but you’re looking at our best point estimate  So, yes, we do feel pretty good about those  numbers as our best guess  But certainly in my view the risk is on the upside--that we’ll have  higher unit labor costs rather than lower      No, that became available to the staff yesterday afternoon  We had   suspected a small downward revision, and on a revised basis it went from 4 percent real growth at  an annual rate to 38 percent  But the data became available after we had prepared the projection       No, I don’t think so We anticipated a small change in business fixed   investment as one of the areas of downward revision and we cheated a little bit by trying to link our  forecast to our suspicions of the way that the revisions would take place  Similarly, net exports     3/21/78              36  were revised down and we had a bit of a lead on that so we really have incorporated, we think,  pretty much what they’ve done      44 percent       3/21/78              39   Our fourth-quarter unemployment rate is 59 percent     Right     Fourth quarter to fourth quarter, it’s 66 percent     We’ve done a good deal of work on that and it’s very expensive if   you’ve been a holder for more than one year    I think one of the catches this time around is that while a larger   proportion of the thrift accounts are locked into what we perceive to be very expensive penalties,  it’s also the fourth year since they began to take on these certificates  So we have a very high  volume of maturing certificates; I think it’s something like $28 billion that matures this quarter      One of the other elements in our thinking is that the past experience has  been that the institutions seemed to get good rates of gross inflows but it’s the withdrawal side  that’s very sensitive  So I think the maturing certificates are probably the most difficult area this  year    "
681,1978-04-18,"  That completes our presentation, Mr Chairman      Well, you are quite right in noting that the multifamily area is the one  source of strength  The weakening that we have in prospect is essentially in the private sector--  that is the single-family sector  You must note, however, that by the third or fourth quarter of this  year we have multifamily starts at around 500,000, which would be down a bit from our  expectation for the first half of the year  It is at about the same level as it appeared to be in the  fourth quarter of [1977], so we don’t have it as a growth sector  A major part of that multifamily  [strength], by the way, is government supported through the Section 8 program  We have allowed,  I think, something like 130,000 units in that program so we have not in the forecast assumed that  this environment will continue to be conducive to a further rise in multifamily starts      At midyear an increase of about 1/2 percentage point on longer-term time  deposits      No, I wouldn’t expect it to go below the levels of ’74 for two reasons  One  of the reasons is simply that interest crediting now adds about 6 percent to the rate of growth and  that is about 1/2 or 3/4 percent more than three or four years back  So you have some built-in  interest crediting in this  And, secondly, even though there are high maturities of longer-term  accounts now coming along [the depository institutions] still have a good portion of their money  locked in, so I wouldn’t expect, even in the absence of the Q ceiling change, that we would go back  to the 1974 rates [of growth]      Well, certainly what has influenced our recent upward adjustment in  inflation, current and expected, involves largely exogenous forces--namely food prices and,  secondly, partially exogenous forces of the effects on domestic prices of the depreciation of the  dollar  We have not seen an explosion in wage rates nor do we believe that is in prospect   Nevertheless, there are feedback effects of these higher prices into compensation       Our view currently is that for l978 there may be spot shortages in some markets  One of the  things we are aware of would be in building--particularly insulation and those sorts of things  But  we see no generalized problem  When we get into l979, given the staff forecast, manufacturing  capacity utilization gets up around 86 percent or so  It is not entirely clear what number in the  aggregate would exert pressure, but I think that is getting close to a range where one would need to  be concerned  On the labor side, our staff judgment I guess disagrees a bit with yours in that we do  think that there is more labor slack and that this is not a full employment level yet  It is not entirely  clear to us what such a number would be, but I think it’s something closer to 5-1/2 than 6 percent      Well, you are quite correct that some of these ratios in managed liabilities  by 1979 particularly are [projected to be] above that which we experienced in l974  At the same  time, with regard to the general question and the other types of problems, there are difficulties  interpreting the aggregate numbers and there may be disruption problems that we are not aware of   But in a variety of areas I would suspect that if this scenario indeed were to occur, it would be  quite a bit different than 1973-74  In the housing area, for example, one is that you don’t have  massive speculation and the REIT problem, if you will, added to [the problems of] the bank  holding companies  I think there is something to the notion that attitudes have changed and  perhaps the attitudes will remain rather conservative in some respects, even in the environment we  anticipate  With regard to banks, it’s very clear to us that increasingly they are relying more on  purchased money than they have in the past  A good deal of [what] is driving that, by the way, is  RPs--interest free money  And there is clearly an incentive to do that in the kind of environment  that we would be looking at  So, I think in general we have some characteristics that are the same  but many of the problems we would not envisage being there      Well, we would judge from a model result that we’d have a small impact  by now--that is, one year out   According to the Board’s econometric model, the System model, it  really is a matter of looking ahead two or three years  So I would think the results of having  overshoots in l977 probably would have a very small impact today but it may be growing over     4/18/78             19  time One of the difficulties here in assessing the staff’s forecast is that lots of things have changed  in terms of fiscal policy and in terms of monetary policy  And the international situation has  changed So I find it very difficult to settle on M1 growth, for example, as being the causal factor  I  think our recent changes in the forecast really have been driven by largely exogenous factors  But I  would not disagree with your underlying point, which I guess is that [money growth] does matter   If we had had higher interest rates in l977 and lower rates of growth in the aggregates, we would  probably be looking at somewhat lower rates of inflation and we would also have lower rates of  real activity So I think throughout you would be talking about a situation that is different today  than it would have been with a different set of aggregates and interest rates      I don’t know about the next few months but I think that is a serious  problem  In terms of looking at various sectors, I would rate the consumer area now as one that  would have the most potential difficulty as we look ahead a year if economic activity slows  If you  look at a repayment measure of debt burden, it is very high--at the high end of the range we have  experienced in the last several years  Debt outstanding has continued to soar, particularly in recent  months with the pickup in auto sales again  And looking ahead, we think that the current debt  level, as well as some further drifting up of debt repayment burdens, will have a dampening  influence on consumers’ willingness to spend    "
703,1978-05-05,"  Since the last meeting of the Committee, preliminary data on GNP for the  first quarter have become available  Real GNP is reported to have declined about 1/2 percent at an  annual rate, a weaker performance than we had anticipated at the time of the meeting  Although  there’s reason to suspect some upward revision of these data in coming months, it is nevertheless  clear that activity in the first quarter was poor  Much of the slowdown still appears attributable to  transitory factors, including the adverse effects of the winter weather and the coal strike, as well as  some special influences involved in the deterioration of the trade balance  Compensating for the  weaker than expected first-quarter performance, it appears likely that the rebound in the current  quarter will be very strong, with our tentative thinking pointing to real GNP growth of 8-1/2  percent or perhaps larger      Statistics on the business situation in the second quarter are limited but support a picture of  vigorous activity  Retail sales continued upward in April and [auto] sales especially have been  strong  The employment figures for April, available this morning, show another sizable gain in  employment, with nonfarm payroll employment rising over 465,000 strike-adjusted for the month  The labor force also rose considerably, but the unemployment rate declined by 02 to 60 percent  Industrial production data for April are not available  It appears, however, that the gains will be  substantial but less than the exceptional increase in March  On the price side, the recently available  consumer price index for March and the producer price index for April registered substantial  increases  We believe the data are roughly consistent with our earlier forecast of inflation at around  7 percent this year     In short, economic activity looks very strong this quarter  But when allowance is made for  the transitory factors affecting the pattern of the first and second quarters, real activity in the first  half is likely to be around 4 to 4-1/2 percent, annual rate, [about] the same as in the second half of  last year  The information available has not led us to change our view that the pace of activity will  slow appreciably from the pace in prospect for the current quarter    "
721,1978-05-16,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      We have a project under way assessing that and I must say that there is a  good deal of work yet to be done  It’s a very difficult problem to assess  Our judgment today I  think is something in the 5-1/2 percent area  There are many people in Washington I understand  who would now judge--and some work is going on in other agencies--that perhaps 6 percent is the  rate  And there are people who believe it’s much lower  I think we’re sort of in the middle of these  forecasts  We have looked at the distribution of unemployment among various groups and there is  in our view some [room for it to] move downward that could be associated with past periods of  relatively high employment and still not imply a situation of extreme tight labor markets  But there  is not very much room  So I think our forecast of somewhere around 5-3/4 would be getting close  to the so-called natural rate of unemployment  Perhaps Jerry would like to comment; he has been  directing this work that we’re doing       5/16/78              7    Well, there is always the possibility, of course, that investment plans will  be scaled up even more  It’s difficult to judge the dynamics involved in this whole process but if  firms now, for example, experience much higher ordering rates than they thought, that could surely  be an encouraging factor  And I would presume that that’s one of the things involved in the scaling  up of the funds that we’ve seen recently  That could go on  I think the construction area, as you  noted, is a segment that has caught on; it was one of the weaker areas earlier and we have noticed     5/16/78              8  an increase of size in commercial and industrial contract awards  They’re up something like 60  percent March over March  So it’s a huge increase but it’s from a fairly low level  I think the  orders and survey results available to date would be supportive of a fairly moderate picture  In fact,  we will have a reading early in June from the Commerce Department and that would need to be  scaled up significantly in order to achieve the staff forecast  So implicit in our own forecast is a  view that conditions were reasonably optimistic so that businesses would be prompted to scale up  their plans  So what we’ve seen to date, I think, is what we have hoped for and I don’t think it has  run beyond that  But, of course, there is that possibility      Oh, sure      Well, early on, I suggested that my guess was that it would be revised up  perhaps to at worst no change but [probably] to a small positive number  I’ve been changing my  view, however  That is, some of those March data that I was looking at have been revised down   In particular, retail sales have been revised down and some of the construction [data have] been  revised down a bit  The March net exports [figure] was somewhat worse than we had anticipated  and worse than Commerce had anticipated, so for now I would think zero is the highest [for Q1  GNP] and probably it’s in the range of minus 05 to minus 1 percent--a negative  We will get a  reading on that Thursday; that is the next revision      (A) It’s right  That is, the studies in the past--the Katona studies, which I  think are the most important in that area--have pointed to an irrational response, if you will  As  prices rose, consumers deferred purchasing  But interestingly, the Michigan surveys--and that’s the  source of the Katona studies--have been picking up increasingly now reports of “this is a good time  to buy to avoid further price increases” where they used to get “now is a terrible time to buy” when  prices began to rise  So we’re getting a different response in the Michigan surveys than used to be  the case  And I think in general it may well be that there is an increasing awareness on the part of  consumers as to what has happened in the last several years, and their behavior may well be  changing      Well, I think the high level of consumer debt is driven by essentially two  things  As you know, one is consumer installment debt--for autos particularly  But that’s not the  most important factor driving up the total; it’s housing  And for housing the debt is longer [term]  so perhaps the repayment burden in the view of consumers doesn’t necessarily track into a less  willing feeling on their part to acquire debt than would be the case if the debt had been taken on for  something other than housing  So a good deal of this debt burden problem is, in fact, associated  with mortgages  As I noted, it’s very high  A year ago it wasn’t and six months ago it didn’t look  that bad  But right now debt outstanding relative to disposable income is above the peak level that  we experienced in ’70, which was in the fourth quarter of 1970  It’s a couple of percentage points  above that  So it shot up dramatically  The repayment burden now is also up there  I think the  attitudes for durable goods purchases in the short run are really quite strong in part because of this  inflation phenomenon  As we go out further, one of the problems we have in looking at these  aggregate statistics is that we have nothing on individual consumers  And it may well be that what  we’re talking about is a universe of consumers in which there are many willing and able to take on  additional debt in this environment  The fact that we have talked a little bit about reducing  personal consumption expenditures for durables reflects our judgment that income growth will be  weaker in the first half of next year  And associated with that, we’ll have lower purchases of  durables--not as large an increase, if you will, in purchases of durables      Well, it’s in on the expenditure side but we don’t refer to it      Well, I think that’s one of the risks  I did not refer to it explicitly but to the  extent that concerns about rising prices prompt speculative behavior or hedging attempts, you  could get into that situation  We’re not aware of any significant problems right now and we have  been attempting to be alert to those sorts of things  [In] the steel area that you referred to, we have  done a bit of checking and are fairly convinced that in the short run it is rebuilding of depleted  stocks  As you know, in the first quarter steel inventories were run down substantially  So as of  now we’re not aware of significant problems, but the environment is one which I think would  perhaps be conducive to that sort of behavior cropping up      Well, I think you pointed to the key areas  I am not sure about airlines, but  steel and other transportation would certainly be pressing [capacity constraints]  There are many  other areas, of course, in manufacturing where that’s not the case  So I’m not sure that we’re not  talking about spot problems perhaps for now that would traditionally be associated with that sort of  thing going on  I was struck, however, by comments in the Redbook which this month referred to  more such areas than had been the case in the past  So we’re alert to that  It’s clear that as we go  on from here, there is less capacity available--less room--and these problems would naturally be  expected to crop up      All except passbook accounts      I’d like to give that question to Ed Ettin, who is the concocter of the  numbers      We haven’t done any work along those lines but I’d be very interested in  having the opportunity to see that [work by your staff]      No, I have not personally looked at it      You reflected it correctly, and I don’t know of any change--certainly not  on my part      We have run a couple of simulations  For what it’s worth, if you use the  new package, which is deferral for one quarter and 1/5 smaller in size, the bill rate as compared  with that in the forecast now would be about 1/4 percentage point lower than we had assumed in  both the first and the fourth quarter and no change in the second quarter  But it’s really a small  impact on bill rates    "
747,1978-06-20,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      Yes, we make a strenuous effort to have a relationship between the two  As I noted, the forecast of the GNP is based on the low interest rates that are in that range  [shown in alternatives A and B]   It=s a 9 percent funds rate and in the first quarter of 1979 we  have an 8-1/2 percent Treasury bill rate  So in terms of the mechanism for which we have  impacts on GNP in our forecasting process, we believe it works through interest rate channels  and that=s critically important  The problem that you=re focusing on is one of the policy Q1- to-Q1 in which you have a burst of money in Q2 and then in order to achieve 5-1/4 percent [for  the year] one has to look at significantly lower rates of growth over the three remaining quarters   Now, one of the problems here, among many, is the question of the extent to which velocity  would be growing without any interest rate pressure  And the staff forecast for some time has  assumed that there would be additional slippage in the money demand function, which we had  experienced from mid-1974 through the first quarter of 1977  More recently, however, that has  not occurred so that=s an open issue  If it didn=t occur, you=d have higher interest rates--at the  upper end of the range or perhaps even higher  That=s one problem  Another difficulty relates to  the fact that we do have in the second quarter a much higher level of money stock than would be  expressed in a 5-1/4 percent range and the extent to which that higher level of money stock  would be sufficient to finance transactions and economic activity, for example, into the third  quarter without much interest rate pressure, I think is an open question  But looking at the past  would suggest that there is room to experience some velocity growth in the shorter run without  having substantial further increases in interest rates      Professional judgment we like to call it!  We use two approaches  The  forecast that you=re looking at is the staff projection; it=s what we refer to as a consensus forecast  It is heavily reliant upon judgment of individual sector experts as well as combining that [with  other] inputs  One of the inputs is indeed a model run which we do each and every time and  from which we tend to modify our judgmental projections  So what you=re looking at is a  consensus  If you look at our model, what you would find if you specified, for example, the  interest rates that we have, is that you have to have a substantial further downward drift in the  money demand function in order to achieve the GNP forecast that we currently have  If it did  not continue to drift down, then you would experience higher interest rates or, more likely, lower  real growth and lower activity      We had a number of minus 04 percent rate of growth and it=s now 10   The implicit deflator went from 71 to 70 and the fixed weight from 65 to 62  There are a  number of small revisions throughout  This is normally a time in their revision process when  they get final data, or virtually final data, on the foreign sector  And the national income  accounts basis of net exports of goods and services was reduced by $1 billion; instead of $24-1/2  billion, it=s $23-1/2 billion  So, there are small changes throughout       6/20/78                7     I didn=t give up        Well, I think it=s a fairly risky forecast in lots of ways  On real growth,  my gut feeling would be that if this is an inappropriate forecast, given the conditions, the odds  would weigh very heavily on the downside rather than the upside  On inflation, I think it=s the  other way around with serious concern about going into 1979  I noted just this morning that the  postal workers were reported in the papers to have started out with a huge request [in terms of  wage increases]  It was worked down from that, but that=s sort of the nub of the problem  I think  on inflation this forecast right now is a good one  Of the forecasts I=ve seen, we rank on the high  side of most outside forecasters on inflation--I think for good reason  I think the odds are pretty  much favoring the current forecast we have; but again, if it=s wrong, I think inflation will tend to  be higher rather than lower      I would tend to raise the real growth, I think, perhaps back into the area  where we were months ago  I=d put the number surely over 4 in the short run  We=re talking  about a time horizon here that is just to the second quarter of 1979 but for the short run I=d say it  would have a more favorable impact on real growth      No, I=d say our forecast is really short run  If we begin to talk about the  impact on real [growth] and inflation, the problem here is the differential effect  On the fourth  quarter impact, I think you can look forward to something like one half of a percent or more on   real growth assuming what happens is that we get lower interest rates out of that  If the  relationship that we specified in the forecast is right--so that 7-1/4, for example, results in lower     6/20/78                9  interest rates than we have assumed in the forecast--on inflation, I think it might add another  quarter or something like that over the next year but you=d have much more adverse impacts as  you go out to three years  So, I think you change the rules of the game  But it hinges  importantly on whether we=ve specified correctly this money demand, interest rate, and GNP  relationship      Not much I don=t think  But you=re right, some further modification      No, you mixed up a couple of things there  One was a quote of the  average sales ratio in May over the first quarter  Part of the problem here in Q1, Q2, Q3 on GNP  is again arithmetic and not economics  You=re going to have a very high second-quarter average  level of activity  So to get a large increase in real GNP in the third quarter would require  substantial further growth      I would expect that production would edge down a bit further  But I  think I phrased it--I know on production I did--that developments still involved large or healthy  rates of increase but I said I would read into these numbers that we did indeed experience  something that was transitory and we are now on a path toward slower real growth      I think you=ve raised an issue that is very important and one that=s  difficult to sort out  Again, it hinges on consumer expectations and I think the evidence  available in the short run from survey reports and what=s going on in the auto market, is  suggestive of the substitution effect--the desire to acquire real or durable goods  I would expect  that to be short- lived, though, in the sense that the rate we=re looking at is well above anyone=s  expectations, including, I think, most of the major manufacturers  The reports there would  indicate some slowing from this pace  The question is to what pace and what would be the  underlying rate of growth thereafter  You would, I take it, raise the issue that perhaps it=s higher  than we thought before  That=s possible  In the housing market I think one can make a stronger  case because a house can be viewed as an investment and there is a secondary market that=s  well-developed  If you get into other kinds of durable goods--washing machines or whatever-- it=s difficult to develop a secondary market  I think cars you can talk about in terms of an  investment  If one were looking at consumers who anticipated a major outlay, the tendency  would be to accelerate that purchase  And that in the short run should tend to hold up outlays-- perhaps for the balance of the year, as you suggest  I am increasingly concerned, though, about  the debt side  Look at these numbers again  The issue was raised about a year and a half ago  and over the last year and a half the debt has grown tremendously  And I believe that will result  in some lessened capacity and willingness to take on major outlays  The issue here is what  happens to income growth to support that debt burden  If indeed income growth fails to keep  pace with inflation and increasing tax burdens, I think it will act as a dragging influence; that,  indeed, is what=s built into our forecast      Thank you      I think it may cause some potential problems in looking at the Bluebook  and trying to maintain and develop a consistent financial and real forecast  I think perhaps one  of the ways to go about this is to discuss in greater detail the implications of the assumption   And for major variables, if there are significant problems developing, perhaps [it would be  helpful] to provide the Committee with information using an alternative forecasting technique      The answer is, I don=t know  We have someone looking at this  This  was called to our attention in the Redbook, in which transportation is discussed; freight cars, for  example, are mentioned as in very short supply  So I don=t have an answer to that, but we will be  checking into it      If I may comment, it is quite correct that it is borrowing in some sense  and that can=t be done forever  The only other comment I would make is that the Board=s model  --I can=t remember the quarters [exactly but] I think for something like the last 5 or 6 quarters has  underestimated significantly the consumption spending that has taken place  So in terms of the  difference between actual and projected, the judgmental forecasts have been much closer  That  doesn=t mean it=s going to be that way in the future, which may be a totally different  environment But that has been an equation causing difficulties    "
772,1978-07-18,"  That’s correct  There’s uncertainty on the part of the staff, for example, on  the precise nature of the money demand function       7/18/78              4    And we believe that the channels through which monetary policy works  would be interest rates  So we’ve stuck with the interest rates at the low end of the ranges in  alternative B      No, it’s higher than that        Right  And we believe associated with that would likely be a rate of  growth in money of 6-1/4 percent  That assumes, as Steve I guess will be talking about in his  presentation, some further downward drift in the money demand function  If that were not to  occur, then money growth would be stronger, assuming the same interest rates  Or holding money  [demand constant], interest rates would rise and the economic activity that we would forecast  would be lower      We have not made any change  In effect, the 6-1/4 percent is premised  now on a scenario in which either the automatic transfers do not go into effect or, if they do, the  rate of growth of M1 would be adjusted downward sufficiently to offset that impact  So, again, in  terms of interest rates you have the 6-1/4 percent interest rate policy but it would require slower  rates of growth  We have not done anything here  Steve, perhaps you have something to add      We have done some exercises, and Jerry may remember some of the  details better than I do  But I do remember that for 1979 we believe that stripping out the tax cut is  worth about 1/2 percentage point, or maybe a shade more, in terms of real growth for the whole  year  You get a bigger bang early on but it fades fairly quickly  So using that, I would say roughly  1/2 to 3/4 [unintelligible] to move down a bit and offset it  I think maybe the low end of the range,  1/2 point, is roughly what we’d be talking about        Yes, we do  The Administration’s estimate on this crude oil equalization  tax (COET) in 1979 is about $4-1/2 billion  It soon will be distributed  Actually, the formulas that  have been worked out provide in 1979 a little bit more distribution and inflow, but it would even  out over time  The major impact there, I think, is on the price side  This COET is estimated by us  and others to be worth about 03 percentage point on the deflator in 1979, 1980, and 1981  So I  think the price impact is quite important      January 1      No, the difference there is between the funds rate and the bill rate in  forecasting  The bill rate tends, through much of the forecast period, to run roughly 1/2 percentage  point below the funds rate      But as interest rates rise, that differential widens      My chart and comments referred to the bill rate but it’s consistent in our  view with the low [unintelligible] end of the funds rate  With regard to your other question, I may  have misspoken--or perhaps you’re referring to my comments at the end of my briefing  When I  talked about “moderating,” it wasn’t in terms of the explicit forecast for 1979  In trying to sort out  what the problems are, you’re looking at in 1979 an explicit forecast--the judgmental or model  solution--of weakening real activity and continuing high rates of inflation  [Inflation is] virtually  unchanged  One of the problems in this whole scenario is that in ’79, ’80, and ’81 you would like  to have lower rates of inflation  But you find that in 1979 you’re hit January 1 with an increase in  the minimum wage and social security, the crude oil equalization tax, a dairy price support, and it  goes on and on and on  So you begin to take care of that and then in 1980 we’re scheduled to get it  again  So if we stripped out those exogenous price shocks, we would be led to forecast lower rates  of inflation  I think that was my statement  If you took away all of these government-mandated  programs and had weakening real growth for a period of six quarters or so, it would begin to have  effects on the [inflation rate]      Depending on one’s preconceptions, I guess the question, frankly, is  How  does monetary policy work?  The way we go about this, and certainly in terms of my own view,  money does matter  But it matters in that it affects markets and it affects interest rates  It alters  decisions, so the level of activity is either higher or lower  And if you were talking about higher  rates of M1 growth, you’d be talking about lower rates of interest and more rapid increases in  economic activity, and that process would lead to some tightening of markets and upward price  pressure  So in my own case, and I guess for the Board’s model, the lags are quite long; but I think  [inflation] is related to economic activity  That’s the channel  You go through the interest rates,  decisionmaking, and economic activity route  So in 1979, for example, we do have in our forecast  maintenance of relatively high inflation  But at the same time, real money supplies are declining,  inflation is running faster than money, and we’re getting upward pressure on interest rates  So  activity is slowing down and we would like to have, aside from the governmental programs, a  slowdown in the rates of increase of inflation  So I think it does matter  It’s a question of how     7/18/78              7  does it matter and how fast  If you had lower levels of activity, you’d expect lower rates of  inflation or vice versa      Truthfully, no      Well, one of the difficulties when you look ahead is that it is often hard to  perceive what sources of strength might emerge  It is a traditional problem we have  And perhaps  here it is also a case where it is difficult to see the swings that might develop  When you look back  in history, we have these wild swings and they don’t show up in most forecasts  I would say that     7/18/78              8  we have a reasonable forecast--one that we are comfortable with given the assumptions--but I  would weight the risks on the downside  I don’t think there is any danger of significance at this  point of a large overshoot, given the assumptions; I think the danger is clearly on the downside  I  am comfortable with what we have, but I just don’t see the sources of imbalances and problems  that will get you into this recession  It is very difficult to put that forth today as the most probable  forecast      Yes  I would like to share the wealth here, so maybe Jerry can answer  that  He has been looking at inventories particularly      I think in the National Income Accounting, though, you get it at an annual  rate  You get the full effect      That is right but it is annualized  So you get the full impact of that  immediately      Yes, and we have most of the impact occurring, frankly, in the first half;  there is still some there later on but it fades  In addition, we have assumed some impact [from] the  investment tax credit, which might be in the fourth quarter to the first quarter in terms of the     7/18/78              9  shipment and delivery of goods  It is retroactive, so we may get some of that bunched into that  [period]      With regard to the Phillips curve, that is a debated issue that has generated  much journal literature and I presume it will continue to do so in the years to come  In the model,  obviously, we have an implicit Phillips curve relationship  It is stable  The tradeoff in the model  relationship is much more favorable than that which you get, for example, from Arthur Okun or  from George Perry at Brookings  The latest work I have seen from Brookings on this is by George  Perry and his findings were that over a year’s time period if the unemployment rate averaged 1  percentage point higher, you can have roughly 1/3 percentage point less rate of increase in prices   [Our model’s tradeoff] is larger but in fact there are some difficulties in interpreting that tradeoff  because we have in addition these exogenous price shocks that come on here  Also, it depends on  the time horizon you are talking about  After the end of three years, in 1981, what we are catching  is a large part of the impact going into prices and out of the real [side]  If you look at a 1-year  horizon in which you have the unemployment rate 1 percentage point higher than it would have  been, the price differentials begin to narrow  But in the model, ultimately, money is neutral  That  is, you will get the impact on the price side eventually (in eight or ten years) and the real side  effects will all disappear      If you modify the interest rate, then we would share alternative GNP  scenarios  We do have an assumption of the low end of interest rates defined by alternative B  If,     7/18/78              10  for example, one wanted to opt for looking at interest rate levels that are a bit higher, such as at the  midpoint, we have enough sets of books around now, in terms of the alternatives, to give you other  combinations  It looks like a level of interest rates around the midpoint of “B” would be close to  the interest rates that we have for the low end of “C”  So on this table that I distributed, a rate of  GNP growth, for example, in [’79] averaging 26 percent is associated with 5-1/4 percent money   Those interest rates are pretty close to those in “B;” they are a little bit more stringent  I’d edge  that number up to a bit closer to 3--28 or 29 or whatever  So that is a combination  Do you want  to hear others?        Right--perhaps a little bit less impact if you choose mid-alternative B  interest rates and look at 5-1/4 percent money  Again, those are rough    "
823,1978-09-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     On the second one, I feel comfortable in talking about it but Steve has   developed some material on that and perhaps he might wish to comment on your second question   With regard to the first question--that is, the Greenbook forecast relative to various outside  forecasts--of the ones I've seen I think it's quite correct to say that the Greenbook is more       9/19/78            8  optimistic One of the questions to be asked is to what extent do the assumptions differ in monetary  or fiscal policy or other things and that's not always entirely clear, but I suspect that doesn’t  account for the major difference  As far as I remember for 1979, for example, both Wharton and  DRI are fairly close in terms of the Board's staff judgmental projection for the year in total, but the  pattern is dramatically different  Both of those forecasts, I believe, show a sharp decline or very  sluggish performance in the first half of the year and then [growth] picking up later on  The Board  staff forecast doesn't show that slowdown but shows real growth fading throughout the year      So, on average, you come out about the same place, but it's really a very different forecast    We, for one thing, are counting upon an impact of the tax cut; I think perhaps we have a little bit  bigger fiscal impact there and that certainly accounts for our first half relative strength compared to  others  Secondly, we have made judgmental adjustments for what we believe to be a change in  consumer spending attitudes  I think a major difference in these forecasts relates to consumer  spending patterns  The evidence over the last couple of years certainly isn't conclusive, and things  may change, but it does appear to us that consumers have preferred to acquire goods rather than  financial assets in this period of inflation  And that characteristic of trying to acquire goods would  carry through into the housing market where I think, adjusted for the interest rates we have  assumed in the forecast, we have a fairly optimistic housing forecast  So I think those are the major  differences  But it's quite clear to us when looking at the other forecasts that we do rank on the  optimistic side  Steve, did you want to comment?      We didn't do the arithmetic right?       9/19/78            9     There are really three elements I'd like to mention there  One is that our   assumption is you do get the equivalent in our case of a $19 billion tax cut at an annual rate  becoming effective right in the first quarter  Now, there are offsets  And I think the question really  arises with the offsets  With regard to one of those offsets--namely, fiscal drag or the effect of a  progressive tax system--that amounts to something like $8 billion or so over the year  But that  occurs gradually; it's about $2 billion a quarter  So that doesn't all take effect in the first quarter   The other is social security, and the social security payments are worth, in terms of net tax,  something like $9-1/2 billion or so  And the accounting mechanism does indeed make those all  effective in the first quarter [rather than] just spread smoothly  In practice, however, and as far as  consumers are concerned, that wouldn't occur, because much of the increase relates to an increase  in the base from $17,000 to $22,000  And that really would only begin to take effect later in the  year  So we've made an adjustment in our own thinking, believing that consumers will see a  sizable increase in their disposable income and some of that will filter into spending  We've used  our model also, and the model results are roughly consistent with what we have  But I think it's an  open question  And it’s clearly one which some of the other forecasters have as much weaker      On seasonal [adjustments], I'm not familiar with any particular problems   that have come up  We do look at the not seasonally adjusted data, but quite candidly I don't feel  comfortable discussing it in detail now  We can certainly provide a brief memo that would look at  those figures more carefully      I'm just not aware of anything  One of the major things you may be   aware of deals with transportation equipment  Commercial aircraft orders, for example, have been  bouncing all over and have been a major factor in the volatility of that particular series       9/19/78            10     Right     Seasonally adjusted     May I comment briefly?     I would agree with you on industrial production  My point there was   slowing from what we had seen earlier in the year  But I think I did use the phrase ""but still quite  good""   So I would concur with you that it was a matter of describing movements within the year      Well, I think, yes  There is a good deal of activity going on in the   construction business equipment area in terms of production  And we do expect an increase, for  example, in shipments, in the area of capital goods  If not, we're going to get an inventory backup  there  But there's a good deal of activity in this heavy equipment area that's showing up in the IP  Consumer goods are quite weak  Overall, I think the data coming in, if you adjust for the goods  portion of GNP, are roughly consistent  We don't perceive a big problem but I think that is one of  the stronger features of the recent data  It is one of the stronger parts      I think in large part it is talk  It depends on the institution  We've heard   some of those comments but I think the bulk of the qualitative comments that we have come across  have been quite positive  And the major reason for that is the spread, which is very favorable for  picking up mortgages  You pay 8 to 8-1/8 to 8-1/4 percent and put out a 9-1/2 percent mortgage   So the spread is very positive and the larger institutions are quite willing to undertake them      That's right  So I think it's a mixed picture  I might say that we did not   choose to put all of the additional funds that we have in the projection, given the performance of  that certificate, into mortgages  That’s because later on we do have a concern about the liquidity of  those institutions and just the balance sheet structure  So I think over time more of these       9/19/78            17  institutions will be concerned and they will begin to be less willing to add mortgages even though  the spread is very favorable    "
847,1978-10-17,"  Yes, they are      No, it is the peak rate in a month in 1973; and they were generally in late  summer or early fall      There has been a considerable amount  Between 1975 and 1976 we  estimate about 3-1/4 percent expansion in materials capacity and around 3 percent in 1977  And in  the first three quarters of this [year] we have an estimate of about 3-1/4 percent  So there has been  a fair gain in materials capacity since that time  There are still some key areas that pose problems   As you know, cement is one which is reportedly in question  But in general I think there has been  an expansion in materials capacity since the ’73 experience      Oh yes, that's quite important in our assessment of the reading of these  numbers  We are not in a period currently of substantial demand abroad; internationally traded  commodities are not in short supply  So, I think in reading the degree of ease or tightness here, the  international situation is a real plus      Yes, it’s the low end of the federal funds rate range in the Bluebook under  alternative B  We key off our interest rates from that, which is an 8-1/4 percent bill rate--not very  far from where we are today      Yes  So implicit in this forecast is very little change in interest rates from  current levels      I think that company may be, from the limited reports we have, tighter  than most insurance companies  But we are getting to the point of the year where they like to be  reasonably committed for next year  The insurance industry with regard to a liquidity measure is  actually running with a fairly high volume of cash and short-term liquid assets according to our  flow of funds accounts      It sounds too tight      Yes  We have work going on now to try to incorporate in the various  parts of the model a better expression of expectations than is now captured in the model  It's  clearly a weak point of the model now  I guess my own judgment would be that perhaps we  wouldn't get as strong a response as the results of your work in this area just looking at some of the  early things we've done  But I think it's a quite valid comment that our model does not have in it as  much of an “expectations” phenomenon throughout as [your model] apparently  You're quite  correct; I have no problem in saying that we have not progressed very far in putting that in the  model      It can      That's right    "
871,1978-11-21,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      I would only point out on cost of capital that I had in mind equity capital,  which has risen substantially in cost  PE ratios have declined  Stock prices are down, depending  on how you measure it--which exchange or over the counter--10 to 20 percent  So I was really  referring to equity  I think it's quite clear long bond rates have done very well      We've looked at some but not in great detail  I think the differences are  rather widespread, but the consumer sector is one where I think a general weakness shows up  We  have, relative to a number of outside forecasts, a stronger personal consumption picture than many  Housing tends to be a bit weaker in some, not all  Business fixed investment I think is a mixed bag,  but in general the information coming in has led most forecasters to reduce expenditures rather than  raise them  But I think personal consumption expenditures are really a key area here  If you  assume that attitudes turn bearish or that the consumer decides to increase his saving substantially,  you get the multiplier [effects and] a very weak economy      Yes, and the expected impacts over time      No, that's right      Well, we've assumed a funds rate of around 9-3/4 percent throughout  1979  So we are talking about 12 basis points or something      I think that is clearly the one area we would point to--relatively high or,  in fact, quite high inventories--as the major change across the country  As for the principal source  of that large stock of inventories, we have made some calls around  I would say that the one thing  that does stand out is that Sears has a particular problem  They have changed their marketing  strategy and are attempting to retrench from a very aggressive pricing program that they started and  the industry followed  Now Sears would like to get out and their sales have slipped substantially so  they are stuck with a very large amount of inventories  But other retailers report large inventories     11/21/78              10  as well  The Redbook, too, had selected comments on this; various Districts pointed to inventories  being perhaps on the high side in the retail area  So I think it is something to watch  We don't get a  great deal of concern from those we have talked to, but there’s clearly an awareness that if sales  should slip, inventories would look very excessive      Well, I don't think there's anything inevitable about the forecast in the  sense of economic activity weakening  I would look at the current situation and say that there are  elements of strength  There are also elements that cause one a little bit of concern  And I would  say that retail sales are one of those areas where the reported numbers are down, but they change  by huge amounts  I don't know what the revisions will do, but it's an area that I would view as a bit  on the weaker side  Industrial production, particularly business equipment production, is rising at  about a 4-1/2 to 5 percent annual rate  It had been going up at 14 percent annual rates for two  quarters  It’s a very different animal  So there are elements of weakness and items of concern      I think you are quite right, however, in noting that attitudes can change  And if indeed  short-run performance is much better than many anticipate, that could give us a much stronger  picture as we go on  So I don't disagree with that  I think it’s just a matter of our reading of the  available information and expected relationships, which suggests to us that things will be weaker   But they may well turn out to be stronger  My own view is that the odds are very low on that  I  really think, even with our downward revision of the forecast, that the odds are quite high that if we  are wrong, [economic activity] will be weaker rather than stronger      We think, given our scenario, that capacity constraints will not be  serious--that they are not a major factor in limiting the slowdown  The capacity constraints that we  have heard most about tend to be in skilled labor rather than capital, although there are selected     11/21/78              12  areas in the capital side  But given a weakening of economic activity such as this forecast now  portrays, capacity constraints would not be a serious problem      Well, I think there we're reasonably close and it’s hard to fine-tune these  sorts of things  So if you said a number of 3 percent real growth or 2-1/2 percent real growth and it  could be held there for some time, I wouldn't view that as a bad outcome, personally  If you pick a  number like 4 percent, I think that does push the economy very quickly into serious capacity  constraints  So there isn't a lot of room to maneuver in terms of getting the rate of real growth  considerably higher than 2-1/2 or 3  [Beyond that] I really think there is a problem    "
895,1978-12-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      That’s right  I might say there’s no way to understand the fact that we  have had a great deal of strength in that sector  We checked with a number of major builders and  there has been a suggestion that the weather has been quite good and that, combined with their  expectation of generally tighter mortgage market conditions, [has led them] to try to push their  starts through  To whatever extent that argument is correct, one would expect somewhat greater  weakness later on      I don’t believe the November seasonal is that big  The December and  January ones are quite big  I might note that the only area that increased in November was the     12/19/78          7    North Central area  And in October that’s where home sales just went through the roof; there was  something like a 120 percent increase      In the North Central region  Every other area in the country was down  on the starts figures this month         That’s right  You can get caught with the lags in this process, as you  know, and things could fall apart right quickly  I noted in reading the Redbook that sprinkled  throughout each District Bank’s report was essentially a tightening flavor in the mortgage market  and a slackening of housing activity  But it’s clearly not evident in the numbers that we have in  hand        No, we have had an expectation of about an 8 percent [increase in crude]  prices  We haven’t changed that much for 1979  It’s the energy side, where I think we just  underestimated the impact of natural gas prices--for example, what had been happening to gasoline  prices  That’s really the key  We did not change our [crude] price projection at all  In addition, I  might say, we have not been encouraged by the performance of unit labor costs  The third-quarter  numbers, for example, showed [initially] an increase of around 5 percent in unit labor costs   Revised figures of a week or two ago showed a 7 percent increase  Productivity is estimated to  have been lower and compensation a bit higher  So the underlying patterns seem to us to have  deteriorated some more      No, that’s right       No, it does not  We had 7-1/2 percent  We are at 7-1/2 percent      That’s right; it’s 7-1/2 versus 10  And we don’t have the extra 2-1/2  percent on average, but the latter half of the year looks poor      Well, the question on the full employment surplus or deficit, from the  fourth to the first quarter there is virtually no change, [even] with a tax cut  At the same time we  have the social security tax increase, which is a partial offset; and on the expenditure side we have  a fairly slow growth of expenditures related to the Commodity Credit Corporation expenditures,  which have boosted this quarter a bit and we anticipate will not in the first quarter  So it’s really  that there are offsetting items going on within the accounts, so we don’t have much change in fiscal  thrust right now With regard to the budget deficit numbers, I guess we feel fairly comfortable with  what we have now        That’s right, though we would like to think that we have done our own  work  We do have differences in various categories  We have some outlays a bit lower  We think  there will be a little bit in the way of shortfalls, not a great deal  But we have somewhat higher  interest payments so they are offsets  But in total we are quite close  I was under the impression  that most of those who have higher deficit numbers are operating with different economic  assumptions  That was my general impression      Well, in terms of 10 percent, that’s really only 12-1/2 basis points, and I  think the answer is really nothing  If we begin talking about going to 10-1/2, that’s really quite  different; we’d be talking about a weaker economy, particularly in the second half of 1979        Jack, do you remember?  I think you’re talking, I don’t know, about 1/4  or 1/2 percentage point  We are already taking a couple of tenths off because of the OPEC effect in  the second half  So you’re talking about an economy that in our view would be less than 1 percent  real growth       Well, we present both but generally in the presentations here we talk  about fourth-to-fourth       That’s right--or third-to-third, say  In terms of the policy period, for  example, it’s the third quarter over the third quarter        I think our intent is to use the econometric model more intensively to  sort out the impacts of alternative monetary policies  So there would be more extensive and in- depth analyses of the alternatives on the real side and price side of the economy, given rates of  growth of the aggregates that would be in the Bluebook  And in that process we’d be sure that we  have covered in one of the alternatives or one of the ranges explicitly the forecast of the  Administration, so that qualitatively we’d be able to talk about where that fits  We are talking  about aggregate ranges ultimately so I think in most cases we won’t have a great deal of difficulty   I would perceive much of the difficulty not to rest with rates of growth in nominal GNP but  probably in the real and price split; I view that as being a potential source of problems         So within the ranges we would anticipate that we will cover and provide the Committee  with information that would discuss explicitly the nature of the Administration’s forecast for the  next two years I guess it is  We have tended to go out, as you know, three years or so using the  econometric model We would want to give a somewhat longer flavor to that exercise using the  model     12/19/78          57        I might note that in this exercise that I reported today on probability  distributions we would hope to do some more experimenting  But in the future, obviously, we can  talk a little bit about confidence intervals associated with the model forecast  We do have the  standard errors  And we can indicate the uncertainty of a point forecast     "
920,1979-02-06," That's right   Another way of viewing it, in terms of what  you're suggesting, is that the observed 3-1/4 percent rate of growth  in money in pre-1974 days has the power of 5-1/4 percent money because  of the effect of [the shift]  "
944,1979-03-20," [Statement--see Appendix]   That's right   Yes It's quite widespread As you know, the  series is highly erratic; it sometimes shows 50 percent increases or  40 percent declines We had a 3 percent decline in December and a  further 3 percent decline in January And the fourth quarter in total  in current dollars was only up 4 percent So in real terms it--   --has been drifting down In general we have  no [firm] idea of whether or not this reflects temporary developments,  but it is something that we are paying attention to We are quite  cautious about the [outlook in the] general structures area which, as  you know, had been coming along   No, it's in industrial structures It's not  the shopping centers   CKAIRMAN MILLER Other questions?

964,1979-04-17," [Statement--see Appendix]   We think the developments in the state and  local area reflect largely a weather effect related to a slowdown in  construction expenditures and capital outlays Employment in the  state and local sector declined, or was very weak at least, in the  first two months and picked up in March So I think what is happening  here is a transitory factor that will shift activity out of the first  quarter and into the second On the federal side, I must say I think     4/17/19 -5-   we‘re talking about these miserable CCC payments, which tend to  accelerate federal purchases in one quarter and disappear in the next  and get revised away S o ,  we are not talking about anything that is a  major factor; it’s largely the sort of thing where we have higher  expenditures in the first quarter and then a sharp drop in the second  quarter, which is a paydown of CCC loans   State and local is weather-related and federal  reflects CCC payments   We did not treat it differently in terms of  the price impact On the real side, there are important differences  I believe I know what you are getting at I think the question is  what the percentage passthrough is and whether or not we are simply  talking about shifting profits from refiners to crude oil producers,  or how much do prices actually go up And that’s a major area of  conflict I might say we have treated it roughly the same; the  Administration has treated it somewhat differently and assumed that  only two-thirds of the costs get passed through   [They have used] 0  3     One of the issues involved, which is very  important, particularly as we get into the ' ~ O S ,  is that we have  assumed some lag in the supply-side effects We are talking about  partial decontrol in 1979--it's very limited--and it's bigger in 1980  But by the end of 1980, decontrol in domestic prices is only about 55  percent completed So I think the longer-run effects on the supply  side are quite important   Well, on the thrift institution side, for  mutual savings banks the numbers available through early April  indicate a substantial decline in rates of inflow For S&Ls, the  March data show inflows up a little   We have scattered reports for April and we  have been picking up the same sort of thing Our own forecast,  however, is not for a sharp deceleration of inflows but rather a  gradual slowing We don't have any massive change there I might  note, though, that in the mortgage market on the financing side we  have been picking up increasing reports of stringency in various parts  of the country So if one looks at the mortgage picture, it has been  much tighter both in price and nonprice lending terms On the  construction side, I don't have any reliable information that I could  point to regarding recent changes that may be under way   We don't forecast the CPI directly; we do  forecast [the deflator for1 personal consumption expenditures, which  is a close approximation for the CPI For 1979 we have them virtually  the same--about 9-1/4  percent for personal consumption expenditures  and the deflator   Yes, by the time we get into the summer, say  July or August, if we don't begin to see substantially slower rates of  increase in the CPI, then this inflation forecast is clearly at risk  of being too low   No  "
987,1979-04-27," Since the last Committee meeting the Commerce Department has  published its first preliminary estimate of GNP, which shows real GNP growth of about 3/4 percent  at an annual rate in the first quarter The rate of increase in the gross business product deflator was  estimated at about 9-3/4 percent at an annual rate Both numbers were about a half percentage point  less than the staff had estimated They still are subject to considerable revision, and various hints of  what may happen [to individual components] suggest some upward and some downward revisions  Overall at this point we don’t have additional new information that would suggest to us the direction  ultimately of a significant change   We have received a couple of pieces of new information that seem significant One  is the new orders figures for March, which showed that total durable goods orders in March  declined appreciably, although for the quarter as a whole they remained considerably above, on  average, the level that prevailed in the fourth quarter of 1978 Nondefense capital goods orders  declined 43 percent, which is a large decline; a good deal of it was attributable to the volatile  aircraft sector However, machinery orders, which seem to be a reasonable indicator of the  underlying trend in capital goods orders, were down in both March and in the preceding month  We believe these numbers are consistent with the staff‘s forecast, and at this point they would  suggest some slowing in the rate of increase in business investment later in the year   The consumer price index was released yesterday and showed a rate of increase of 1  percent for the month of March Once again food and energy prices were quite high, but the  increases were widespread throughout all sectors The one possible helpful hint there is that the  rate of increase of food prices was down from the very high pace in February Other information  also suggests that we may get some relief later this year from the sizable increases in food prices     4/21/19 2   One other final piece of information would be on new auto sales For the first 20  days of April they were running at 8-3/4 million units, which is about 112 million below the very  high level in March On average we would judge that the auto market remains quite strong That’s  all I have, Mr Chairman  "
1007,1979-05-22," I don't know what to do after that!   M R   MAYO I assume the staff put these figures together!   [Statement--see Appendix] That completes my  presentation, Mr Chairman   You're talking about in something like the  deflator?   Well, in the second quarter of this year, for  example, our estimate of the business product deflator in total is  103 percent If we exclude food prices, in the second quarter of  this year it goes down to 10 percent Excluding food and energy, it's  8-1/4 percent So the energy component [accounts for] about 1-3/4  percentage points in the second quarter alone on the aggregate  inflation rate Energy in these accounts are only worth something  like 7 percent by weight, but we're getting increases of 40 to 50  percent at an annual rate in many of the energy components   I think it has been distributed to all the  Governors I would interpret the data with some degree of confusion,  I guess, in the sense that there are a number of major differences  A s  I believe the memo pointed out, retail sales peaked in February of  1973--   --on a real basis, which was about 10 months  before the trough in economic activity The peak in real terms [in  the current cycle] would be December of 1978, so we've experienced  four months of declining sales But there are a number of major  differences One is the behavior of consumers In that earlier  period, the saving rate was considerably higher and consumers seemed  much less willing to take on goods and spend as freely as they have  this time around So I'm a little disturbed about trying to make that  comparison because of different consumer behavior Secondly, though  the energy situation was a bit similar as 1973 went on, that was a  period when we had the storage situation by early 1974 combined with  very rapid price increases And it strikes us that at this point the  situation is considerably different from what we experienced in 1973   One major area to point to is business fixed  investment The first quarter was quite depressed in the construction  area [but] the March numbers came roaring along with a bounceback I  would suspect that in the second quarter both shipments and,  importantly, nonresidential construction activity will average  substantially above the pace in the first quarter That’s one area  Housing may well turn out to be less of a negative in terms of  expenditures in the second quarter compared to the first It‘s not  that I expect it to be rising and contributing to growth, but it may  well be less of a drag on average for the quarter Consumer spending,  I think, is a very questionable area We do anticipate a bounceback,  but it is by no means a certainty [If we don’t begin to see that,] ’I  would say that over time one would have to get concerned about that   State and local construction activity is also an area that  was depressed in the first quarter due to weather effects The  evidence seemed to suggest a bit of an increase in March, but not a  great deal We are banking on the view that that sector will perform  similarly to business fixed investment, particularly the construction  part The bounceback that we have forecast is nothing like that in  the first quarter of 1978, when [GDP growth went from1 about zero to 9  percent We’re really talking about fairly small changes Also, I  think the infomation coming in has to be discounted to some extent  Industrial production is a clear case where we know the nature of some  of the problems But, as this [reported weakness] goes on, I’d say  one would have to be more concerned about the possibility of a weaker  picture than a stronger one   No We’ve tried--unsuccessfully--for the last  two months to get them and have not been able to   well, let me [defer to] Ted to answer the  first question  how to answer that Implicitly we have built in huge increases in  crude oil prices and we have also built in a change in Department of  Energy regulations on the pricing as well as pricing between various  grades of gasoline Putting all that together makes us come out with   With regard to your second one, I don’t know quite     5/22/79 -10-   a big number That's the sort of thing we've done It's very clear  that the gasoline that is being imported directly has gone up  substantially in price There are reports now of gasoline reaching  New York that has an Amsterdam spot price of 85 to 87 cents a gallon  So if you're talking about dealing in the spot market in that way, at  the margin it is very expensive crude and very expensive in terms of  refined products   Sure I'd make two comments One is that in  terms of a concern about the cyclical turn, I could perceive three  possible scenarios right now  continued very strong growth that presses against resource  availability and intensifies inflation I would say that the  information coming in tends to weaken that case, if not remove it  The second possibility is that we have a situation with serious  distortions and one would anticipate either a deep or a prolonged   One is that we will have a situation of     I   5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -11-   contraction in activity I don't think we have those sorts of  distortions So what I am left with then is the middle course, which  we believe is reasonable at this time; it involves small real growth  Now, whether or not that will turn out to be a technical recession in  the sense of two consecutive negative quarters, where those negatives  are very small, is not really a big issue as far as we're concerned  It's the general pattern of what happens that is important, and we  think the economy is in for that kind of period of small real growth  But it may well slip into a mild contraction in the technical sense   With regard to the monetary aggregates, one of the things we  have been getting that we did not anticipate is a further downward  shift in the money demand function So what we have in effect with  the slower growth of the aggregates is interest rates that have been  about on track with our forecast for some time In addition, we've  assumed that the rate of growth for M1 at 6 percent adjusted for ATS  was over a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter period so that if there  were shortfalls we would get back within the ranges and stay on track  Hence, to the extent there was a difficulty, we assumed it would be  very short-lived and we'd have a resurgence of growth   It comes and goes with social--   It's social security, which is worth about  $ 9  8  billion in July So there's a third-quarter blip upward--   Durable goods orders are down 8-314 percent in  total   Right, and this is the advance number As you  know, the numbers have been bouncing around   That's right, March is now up 2-314 percent  I don't have the earlier number with me, but that is not a big change  primary metals are down 8-1/2 percent; they were up 1-3/4 percent in     5/22/19 -21-   March Most importantly, nondefense capital goods orders are reported  in this advance number as down 13-1/2 percent for April and they were  up 6-1/4 percent for March Even if one strips out aircraft, the  numbers are very weak; so [the total1 is not bouncing around because  of aircraft orders It is a general picture of negatives across the  board  "
1048,1979-07-11," Well, I guess there are several comments to be  made One, the record is clear We have underestimated inflation  The record, I think, is also fairly clear that we have tended to run  high on inflation relative to many forecasts, which says that most  economic forecasters--not all, but most--have tended to underestimate  inflation, certainly in the current period Relative to the  Administration's forecast for inflation for 1980, we are considerably  higher; and with regard to other forecasts, I think the staff forecast  of inflation is also relatively high The assumptions in the  forecast, in my view at least, do imply restraint on the part of  monetary policy and certainly fiscal policy The full employment  budget surplus is moving into substantial surplus It involves  further tightening if you take that measure or other measures, simply  in that we have not assumed any fiscal initiative, which has clearly  accompanied this sort of pattern of activity in the past S o  we have  a tight policy here in our view     1/11/19 - 6 -    In addition, I would say that there are important exogenous  forces, as Jerry Zeisel pointed out, with regard to energy and food  At times I think forecasting energy and food prices is like a craps  game, but at this point in time what we have assumed for OPEC would  clearly suggest that 1979 is the bad year Also, our forecast for  1980 on inflation is much higher than we had shown to the Committee a  month and a half ago; we have tried to take account of developments  since then I personally would feel rather comfortable with this  forecast as a particular number in terms of not underestimating likely  developments   Well, I know some of those guys--   No, that's all right I think I know some of  the people from St Louis in a way that transcends what I might say  here All I can say to that is that my view is simply that monetary  policy has an important role to play The difficulty in this exercise  is looking at alternatives within what I would consider to be a  ""reasonable range,"" given past monetary policy responses If, for  example, one option were to reduce the stock of money 10 percent and  run that way for 3 or 4 years, I would say we'd get tremendous impacts  on the price front We'd also have a depression, in my view So,  what is missing in this linkage is what happens to the real side and  what happens to markets It's that sort of thing that makes it  difficult for me just to translate M1 numbers into rates of inflation  I certainly would not say that I believe money has no influence on     7/11/79 -7-   prices That's clearly not our view It's really a longer-term  effect in the way that we look at money affecting activity, which  works through markets And it's quite clear to us that if we had  lower rates of money growth over an extended period of time, we would  get lower rates of inflation We'd also have other things happening,  such as [effects on1 unemployment and real GNP, and I would presume  other policy responses outside the control of the Fed   There's always a possibility I've been  humbled over the years in performing these sorts of exercises   Oh yes, very much so   Yes I think the fundamental question though,  if you want to go back to '73, '74, '75, is what sort of forecast do  we have overall relative to that period It's very different Real  GNP declines by a very small amount relative to that which occurred in  ' 7 4 - ' 7 5 ;  I think it's about 113 the size And that I think is very  important S o  we don't have sluggish markets in any way comparable to  the '74-'75 period I think a second factor is that the performance  in '74 and early '75 was influenced importantly by large speculative  demands--the build-up of inventories, the worldwide boom, a run-up of  raw materials prices, and the big collapse as real final sales  declined Then we had a dumping of inventories and more price breaks  on the down side We don't perceive basic conditions in the economy  to be similar to that and hence we wouldn't expect to get the same  price response from very weak markets Also, one of the difficulties  is that in the current environment we have more indexation of wage  contracts than we had 5 or 6 years ago In my view, there has been  much more of an attempt to cope with inflation that would give us  stronger feedback effects of current rates of inflation on future wage  rates and that I think is an important adverse factor That certainly  has influenced our forecast because for 1980 we believe the price  performance hinges very importantly on developments this year   Could I share the wealth and let Jerry answer  that question? He presented that part of the forecast   Well, in that instance you'd be talking about  weaker money demand Many times in the past we've had no growth in  nominal GNP in the quarters in which real GNP was dropping or was in  fact negative when we had massive inventory liquidation And at those  times money demand fell dramatically But in this forecast we have  very different nominal rates of increase, given the price picture that  we foresee   There are downside risks In terms of the  odds we would place on our forecast, I think we would judge it to have  a 40 to 50 percent probability of coming true I can see a situation  where the odds are significant that it might turn out to be better  than that I think it is very difficult, for example, to sort out the  extent to which the second quarter was adversely influenced by  gasoline lines And if that fades, we may be talking about underlying  demands that are stronger than most people would anticipate at this  time On the other hand, whenever we get into this situation of weak  activity we tend to have cumulative effects and it's very difficult to  judge how far that may run It could set off adverse expectations,  which would drive the economy down much deeper   I think the 1973-74 [experience] is not closely comparable to  the current one Clearly, from that earlier OPEC situation we can  gain some lessons from looking at what happened at that time But  three very important factors [differ] One would be the collapse of  the worldwide boom We have not envisaged a collapse in economic  activity abroad That should assist the US economy The second is  this speculation and stockpiling--the hoarding of labor, raw  materials, whatever--that led to the big bubble in inventories and the  collapse Our reading of the current data available is that we may  have a moderate problem of involuntary inventory accumulation, but     7/11/79 -10-   it’s limited Businesses have behaved very differently this time  around than in that earlier time And the third factor that to me is  of a good deal of importance involves developments on the monetary  policy and the financial side We have not assumed conditions that  approximate those in 1914--a crunch We don’t have widespread  financial difficulties And that’s very different in terms of the  lagged impacts of monetary policy actions over the past year or so and  what that may portend for later this year and 1980   Let me just say that I agree that that‘s a  possible outcome I really don’t know that I can quantify it   DO YOU fund them?   The monetary policy assumption that we have  maintained in this forecast is the same as the one that has been  running for the last several months S o ,  with higher prices in effect  and the same nominal rate of growth of M1, you are implicitly running  a tighter policy and not permitting a complete validation of OPEC  price increases So it’s a maintenance of the same policy despite an  exogenous change in the price outlook   All I can say is that the assumption built in  for monetary policy is the midpoint of alternative B on average for  1979-1980 That is, you can run below or you can run over, but for  QIV ’78 to QIV ‘79 we have assumed 6 percent, allowing for the shift  between ATS accounts and demand deposits You‘re right that M1 was  strong in QII and it was weak in QI; it all hinges on what happens  between now and the next two quarters to determine whether or not the  assumption we have will turn out to be correct   We have run a variety of simulations Using  different monetary policies, fiscal policies, and other options that  have extended into 1982 And in most of those, except for policies  that have expansive monetary and fiscal policies for an extended  period of time, by the time we got to 1982 we were seeing substantial  price improvement I might note that one of the major difficulties--I  didn’t comment on it this time--is that in 1981 the models would be  showing much reduced rates of inflation, but there are two important  outside factors in 1981 In January we have the largest increase     7/11/19 -12-   scheduled for payroll taxes and social security of the whole package;  it’s double the effect of 1979 And in October 1981 is the largest  slug of domestic decontrol of crude oil to the then-current world  price If we [take] those out of 1981, we’re showing in the forecast  substantial price improvement  "
1144,1979-09-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   Those don't account for most of the revisions  We have anticipated them for some time The bulk of the difference  between Q3 and Q4--that is, getting a deeper negative in Q4--is the  inventory side Other than that, we have had most of the changes  built in for some time The biggest changes really were in Q3 and  represent past data As a matter of fact, in real terms we raised  final sales in the third quarter by about $6 billion and $4-1/4  billion of that is consumption A lot of that is autos So I would  say that for the third quarter final sales are stronger, and the  fourth quarter mainly involves adjusting downward the drag of  inventories   It's declining slightly in real terms; it's  down 1 percent in real terms and we had it down a half percent in real  terms last month   Well, it's [a swing of] $16 billion dollars  from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and that would translate  into roughly 2-112 to 3 percentage points at an annual rate   I think we had the courage of forecasting a  minus 01 a couple of months ago, but it was very small   No, but the size of it has become different;  that is, the second- and third-quarter accumulation has been larger  than we had anticipated earlier and we now have a larger correction in  the fourth quarter   Well, we don't have detailed information We  checked late last night and found that the Council on Wage and Price  Stability didn't have the contract yet, so I didn't get so discouraged  about not knowing the details We do know that the wage increase was  pretty much in line with past contracts; on our estimate we would  assume that it might amount to about a 28 percent wage increase over 3     9/18/79 -1-   years Pension benefits for current retirees were also raised but we  don't know how that would be valued and we don't have the details  Our general expectation right now is that it probably is in the 33 to  35 percent range for a 3-year period I don't know how that will be  priced out by the Council on Wage and Price Stability It may well  fit within the guidelines But in any event--   That's right, it's not really out of line with  what we had expected earlier but it is a sizable increase S o  the  publicity associated with that I think would have a negative effect in  terms of holding wages down   The federal government pay raise   Well, that's a large part of it The pay  raise will be a I percent increase, and I don't think the seasonals  take proper account of that It's a shift in mix The fixed weight  [measure] is actually declining 02  percent from the third to the  fourth quarter There may be other factors at work, I'm not sure  But the fourth quarter usually is one to look at for a pay raise at  the federal level   I don't know, something else may be at work  I just can't answer your question other than that the federal pay  raise is one influence and I would think it would be the major factor   It does not   Well, it's part of what would be a fairly  smooth and rapid adjustment, which is built into our forecast on the  inventory side My view would be that I have been surprised that we  haven't had more in the way of reduction of labor input to date And  in light of new information on inventories and final sales, it becomes  clear But I don't think it's unusual The August reading was one  that seems to me to point in that direction and once that has begun,     9/18/79 -10-   if you look back at prior recessions, it has gone on quite quickly for  several months in a row So I would think we're on reasonably safe  ground in expecting labor input to drop off in the fourth quarter   Averaging about 69  percent for the fourth  quarter, so it would be close to a 7 percent or 7  2  percent rate [in  December]   That's right I'd say the price side is a  very tricky part of this We have in the third quarter an inventory  valuation adjustment of slightly over $40 billion, and once it gets  into those huge ranges, it becomes very difficult In the fourth  quarter, we expect something smaller but still large to prevail On  the crop side, I would only say that exports have been coming along  very well; it may not show up in nonfarm or farm inventories here In  addition we have built into the forecast some taking up of those crops  by the Federal government in terms of the Commodity Credit  Corporation, so it may not appear in private sector inventories   I might note that in the third quarter the  evidence we now have--or at least it is our current projection on the  consumer side--suggests that household funds borrowed will drop $14  billion at an annual rate from the second-quarter level And going  into the fourth quarter, that's down another $1 billion So in the  household sector, we think [a slowdown in borrowing] is under way in  the third quarter With regard to nonfinancial businesses, we  currently project total funds raised to be down about $8 billion in  the current quarter and down an additional $18 billion in the fourth  quarter   We have business loans projected to be  increasing slightly less than the terrifically high second-quarter  pace So in the current quarter it is down $6 or $1 billion at an  annual rate   And it drops $14 to $15 billion in the fourth  quarter   Well, that's in part the definition of money  market mutual funds, the problem in the switch from--   No, but money market funds grew very rapidly  [and] the structure was changed Between the second and third  quarters money market funds are expected to have grown very rapidly at  an annual rate   And they're in deposits, not in credit market  instruments So if you look at past history, it's quite a distorted  picture   M S   TEETERS Didn't you correct the history?   Well, we didn't have any money market mutual  funds pre-1974, so if you look at--   Excuse me, relative to 1966, 1969, and 1970,  given our treatment of these securities today, we're finding a money  market type instrument being classified as a deposit It's really the  same [phenomenon] as in 1966, 1969, and 1970 when funds moved out of  banks into other higher yielding instruments  "
1179,1979-10-06," All right I’ll try to be brief Economic  activity in the third quarter appears to have expanded a little faster  than we had anticipated earlier We now believe that real GNP  probably grew at an annual rate of around 1-1/2 percent, maybe a shade  higher Employment, production, and sales all seem to have been  somewhat higher The most recent news, of course, was on the  employment situation in September Total employment grew  substantially and the unemployment rate dropped 02 percentage point  to 58 percent Industrial production now appears to have grown about  1/2 percent in September on the basis of the most recent labor market  report and some physical product data on auto sales and steel  production As you know, housing starts were unchanged in August at  18 million We have some additional information that suggests  capital goods shipments in August were rather stronger than we had  anticipated as well On the inventory side, inventory still seemed to  have been accumulated at a substantial pace in August, at least at the  manufacturing level And this is an area of growing concern given  what we perceive to be substantial imbalances developing unless we get  sustained growth in final sales or further downward adjustments in  production   While the recent data clearly suggest more strength than the  staff had anticipated at the last meeting of the Committee, the  fundamentals still seem to be running against sustained growth in  coming quarters Namely, I would point to declining real income,  which we have now had since December of last year At the present  time we think that real growth in the fourth quarter is likely to  decline at about a 3-1/2 percent annual rate, which is a bit bigger  decline than we had estimated earlier But over the whole projection  period through 1980 we don’t anticipate any significant change in the  forecast we presented to the Committee in September On the price  side, the most recent information relates to production The producer  price index, as you how, increased at a 14 percent annual rate It  was particularly discouraging There were widespread increases, with  food and energy prices continuing to rise very rapidly  "
1222,1979-11-20," Well, in that case, we’d be talking about  adding another quarter or half point to the deflator and I would think  taking at least something comparable, if not more, out of the real  side And in the short run 1 think there is quite a rapid passthrough  now of these costs We’d get some lag effects obviously into 1980 and  1981, but we do get fairly immediately a rapid increase in prices   M R   COLDWELL So if there were to be something like a 40  percent increase in the [oil] price level coming out of the December  OPEC [meeting], you’d expect this to be hitting the first half of  1980?   M R   KICHLINE We‘d expect a good chunk of it to hit in the  first half, but [the effect] carries on In the current forecast,  which has an increase of roughly half that size, we have--   M R   COLDWELL That’s why I doubled it   We think our forecast is likely to entail  something like a 3/4 percentage point increase in personal consumption  prices That is in addition to the other things going on in the  energy area, of which there are many If we were to assume roughly  symmetrical effects, we’d double that, so it gets into the 1-1/2  percent area So we would see fairly promptly--namely, in the first  half--a substantial increase That is a very bearish outlook and  hopefully one that won’t come to pass Even if we have some supply  side effects in terms of constraining consumption, it seems to me that  you’re talking about a poor outcome   In 1980, right   M R   COLDWELL Over and above what he already has   M R   KICHLINE No, that’s the total effect   What I was quoting was energy prices We  forecast the energy price deflator, which aside from imported oil  includes domestic oil, coal, and natural gas prices When you put  that all together, you find that domestic prices would tend to be  rising more rapidly as time goes on because of the decontrol But  next year, unless a change is made, it seems that the Alaskan oil will  bump against the ceiling So Alaskan oil will be constrained in its  upward price movement Natural gas supplies are abundant right now  Pricing there is permitted to go higher with increasing inflation, but  in fact the market for natural gas is fairly weak and natural gas is  readily available, so we have held down the price increases in that  area And the coal market is very weak S o ,  I don’t know right off  the top of my head how to translate imported oil into the PCE deflator  context Do you Jerry? We can provide a memo to the Committee, if  you like, on the energy sector and its price implications That might  help   That’s right The 3/4 point effect, for  example, this year did not carry through fully to our price forecast  It’s roughly 1/2 percent So we have weaker activity as a result of  higher world oil prices and in fact we assume that‘s going to have an  impact in other areas in the domestic economy   M R   WILLES Now I’m confused--not that I wasn‘t before I  thought that when you calculated the US deflator the price of  imported goods [always] came in with a negative sign   It does   M R   WILLES That means that if the price of imported oil is  going up relatively fast, that can have a strong impact on the CPI but  it‘s not at all clear that it will have a direct impact on the  deflator   M R   KICHLINE I was referring to the personal consumption  expenditure deflator It gets measured there directly and subtracted  out when we look at the difference in export and import prices So  the deflator will always understate the effect--the price impact--on  consumers of rapid increases in foreign prices When we look at the  personal consumption area or the CPI, as you mentioned, we‘re going to  get the full effect   M R   WINN My own feelings are perhaps more pessimistic for  ‘80 than yours, for different reasons I wonder in terms of our  current analysis how much allowance we should make for the shock  effect aspect [of developments in the energy areal For example, when  we had our [earlier] energy shock, it wasn’t really the price but the  [concern about] availability that caused people to back off It then  picked up substantially [I wonder] how much shock effect we’ll be  getting in behavior for the moment and to what extent that may [erode]  because availability is really not affected though price certainly has  been in the real sense of the term So perhaps some of the momentum  we‘ve seen will pick up again   we have the seasonal [issue] of Christmas and then [the  question o f ]  how much change in attitudes might be expected out of  that kind of [energy price] development On the other side, we know  that the shock effect [from] October 6 caused construction--in terms     11/20/79 -12-   of new starts--to turn off completely That doesn’t show up for three  months in terms of the set up In contrast to that, of course, is the  fact that leasing is just going crazy now because of projected  shortages I wonder how much of that will be reversed if availability  is not [a problem] So availability versus price and its impact may  give us a different path than we would get from a normal cyclical type  of analysis   We’ve tried to account for that as best we  can As you well know, a number of years ago we had a fine idea to  use for part of the IP index electric power usage as a proxy for  output That was pre-1973 And we’ve felt very nervous about that  ever since 1973, quite frankly Some of the past data that have come  in--this was several years ago now--on output measures from the Census  Bureau have given us some hints that perhaps we weren’t off that far  in the past We’ve done some informal checking and we’ve made  downward adjustments, but it‘s clearly a very hazardous area We  could well be understating output from that side rather than  overstating it   M R   BAUGHMAN But you’re not continuing to use whatever  factors were developed?   No, we have made adjustments since about ‘ 1 2    I guess, when--   M R   PARTEE YOU still use electric power But you have a  trend factor that’s more--   M R   KICHLINE Yes, it’s about--   They do not look out of line   Well, I think they're both important On the  investment side, the big mover in the short run for some time has been  residential construction investment; business fixed investment is  important as well For 1980 as I remember we have a decline in  business investment measured from the fourth quarter of about 3  percent And durable personal consumption expenditures are down  around 4-1/2 percent So we have placed a major emphasis on the  behavior of personal consumption expenditures, principally the  durables component I think it's a fair judgment, but I would weight  both of them quite high in terms of influencing the [economy's]  performance in this forecast   In dollar terms, certainly the goods portion  of consumption is about twice the size of the investment sector   I would not be willing to risk any of my own  money on consumer behavior I think it's possible Our view has been  that the arguments against that strengthen as each month goes by and  as consumers have been using financial assets or debt or reducing  savings to finance their purchases But who knows? It's quite  conceivable that [consumer spending] will be strong   M R   COLDWELL My recollection is that the consumer surveys  have been showing a little more strength lately   That's true   That's right     1 1 / 2 0 / 7 9  -14-   Oh, yes It's the advance; it's not even the  preliminary report   No, I don't We have been getting scattered  reports suggesting that some utilities have been switching back  Those that converted under pressure or for price reasons have been  switching back and trying to return to the use of natural gas But  there are constraints in these areas I guess our view is that we  don't know enough about the nature of that market to make a reasonable  assessment It's very clear, given price and availability, that the  incentives today are there to switch But we don't have a good  feeling for the technical problems involved in this area  "
1249,1980-01-08," She controls the staff that puts it together  Right  Yes They will have information later this week on the employment situation, and they need inventory numbers Inventory is important and data are due [to come out] on January 18  [Statement--see Appendix]  That's correct That refers to crude oil prices--the wellhead prices--not the total energy component  Well, substantially less I think for the year it was about 45 percent  Well, it varies In 1981 it's a little over a percentage point, about 1-1/2 percent, and in 1980 it's about 2 percentage points Let me just say, as it turns out, that domestic wellhead prices in 1979 are estimated to have been up 55 percent The price of domestic crude oil is estimated to have been at $14-1/2 a  -48-    1/8-9/80  barrel in the fourth quarter of last year Given the decontrol schedule and our OPEC price assumption, by the fourth quarter of 1980 the price of oil is expected to go to $23-1/4  Domestic wellhead prices for crude oil But the current decontrol schedule, which is obviously subject to change-- the President does have that authority--would by October of 1981 place domestic crude oil prices at the world price level So, we're going in two years from $14-1/2 to $33-1/2 on the price of half our oil supply  We've got all these numbers Let me just say that lots of things intervene in getting to the retail price of gasoline including importantly margins, which we have assumed will shrink a bit Gasoline prices are estimated to have increased 50 percent in 1979; [the estimate for] 1980 is 29 percent and for 1981, 15 percent So the rate of increase is slowing  For the CPI  Well, as you know, there are two important influences on that housing component One is the price and one is mortgage interest costs Mortgage interest costs tend to lag commitment rates by about a quarter So, what happened in the fourth quarter in mortgage rates would appear in the CPI measure this quarter Given our expectations that mortgage rates have peaked and will be drifting down, we think that by this spring the mortgage interest component should not have an important influence in driving [the CPI] up In fact, late in the spring, in June or so, it could begin to operate the other way On house prices, some of the measures of house prices recently have declined Unfortunately, that's not the information that is directly used in computing the CPI Our best guess is that house prices in the CPI will be shown to be rising somewhat less rapidly through the next several months, but probably at a rate that's still near 10 percent So, we don't expect measured inflation in the CPI due to the house price component to be a helpful factor in the short run  I get into so much trouble when I use that term that I decided to avoid it today  Well, as I understand it, the index used to measure house prices is an FHA series It's based in effect on FHA loans, which as you know are a small part of the market It's designed to measure ""a representative house"" The series that come out monthly are Census series, which are based upon the turnover of new and existing homes And in those I believe the average price of homes declined a little in November The question is Was that attributable to a change in the mix or in fact did ""the representative house"" decline in price? It is assumed at this juncture that people opted for lower priced homes and thus the turnover was concentrated in such homes rather than that house prices were declining  Well, that was pretty much in line with our expectations We have assumed in the forecast for some time now that the wage/price restraint program would reduce compensation by perhaps 1/4 percent or so, or a couple of tenths, but not a great deal In effect, part of this is the notion of Do you experience settlements that are well above your guideline or do you move the guideline so that few fall outside the program? And, that's a bit what is going on here It is a flexible guideline, as I understand it, with a 2-point spread We expect that the program in practice has been eased from the restraints of a year ago and that at best it will have a small damping influence, but not [much]  Yes, we have compensation in total running in the 9-1/2 percent area, so it's at the top end of that program I might also note, though, that this is a fairly heavy bargaining year We face [labor negotiations by] the steel workers, communication workers, some longshoremen, and the aluminum can industry; so 1980 is not an easy year in terms of major collective bargaining settlements  I'm not aware of that  Well, as you know, [those chances] are clearly there If you look back, we had assumed in the staff forecast that a recession or a downturn in economic activity would take place in the third quarter of 1979 We were a bit late in coming to the recession view and, as it turned out, obviously not late enough It is possible that we will be surprised The outlook hinges importantly on consumer behavior; that by no stretch of the imagination is the big surprise in the fourth quarter, if the numbers hold up I do believe that the ability of consumers to rely on reducing their saving rate for a couple of quarters to below, let's say, the 3-1/2 percent level begins to be a possibility, but it's very unlikely I also think that we have in place now a clear downturn in the housing sector and weakness in business fixed investment, and those factors will tend to drive up the unemployment rate and provide somewhat less income growth So, I think the probability is now higher that economic activity is declining, but I would not rule out the possibility that we will be surprised  No What we have had often in the past is a sharper slowdown, particularly in goods, but nothing that has stretched out for six quarters What is unusual about this is not so much the size, but the duration--that is, six consecutive quarters of declining real personal consumption expenditures I would associate a good deal of that with the fact that this expansion and projected recession have very different characteristics than past history For the extended period ahead one of the key differences relates to policy assumptions, both monetary policy and, very importantly, fiscal policy There are no discretionary fiscal actions in our forecast--in fact there are tax increases--during the downturn So we would [attribute] a good deal of it to that  Sure In my own view, I think a posture of monetary restraint indexed by a rate of growth of the Ms that is no higher, and perhaps somewhat less, than we had in the last year would be appropriate I also believe, however, that action should be taken on the fiscal side [I'd note] two important aspects there One would be to roll back the social security tax increases scheduled in 1981 It seems to me, in some way or other, that is not consistent with trying to gain control over inflation However, something like $18 billion in federal revenues are generated out of that, so that by itself would mean about an $18 billion tax cut I also think some tax    1/8-9/80  reduction that would affect the corporate sector by trying to provide business investment incentives would be appropriate Realistically, it seems to me that such a package would be in the $30 billion area But when one thinks of having tax cuts in an election year period that do nothing for the consumer sector, that seems to me rather unlikely So, probably when we are talking about a tax cut, we would be talking about a bigger number rather than a smaller one  That's quite conceivable That would mean we could avoid part of the increase that would be coming along this year because as of January 1 we did have about a $4,000 increase in the social security tax base and effectively for consumers that will come into play largely in the second half of this year So, that's right If you are talking about this, you do not think in terms of doing something eighteen months ahead but rather around mid-1980 That is when one would want to have this [lower tax become] effective  Well, I didn't recommend that I said I think that's one of the facts of life The number may go higher  $30 billion The Administration, we understand, is trying to hold the number in its budget message to around $15 billion But we have a different economic situation I think that's right that [the deficit] is an upward constraint because  -52-    1/8-9/80  if we have a tax cut [this year], it seems to me that in fiscal year 1981 the deficit could easily be in the $60 to $70 billion range  It's about 2-1/2 percent under a direct measure  No, if inflation were rising at 10 percent before, it would rise at 12-1/2 percent for a year  Right The percentage change goes up by 2-1/2 points  Well, one of the important points here is that industrial production is only a part of this; what has been driving the changes in industrial production recently has been autos And we expect that to spread When you talk about the unemployment rate and IP, you are talking about the bulk of employment outside the manufacturing sector The strong growth recently has been in trade and services We expect that employment in manufacturing will drop but we also are going to get much slower employment growth in the trade and services area Combined, that is likely to drive up the unemployment rate relative to changes in industrial production I don't think they're inconsistent What we are talking about here is our view that we will have employment adjustments in the short run once businesses become convinced that their sales picture has changed And labor markets today are still quite tight in many areas, particularly for skilled labor Businesses are unwilling to give up skilled labor resources unless they are convinced that, in fact, the picture has changed for them  I think that would be convincing evidence, assuming that our forecast is right  Well, I have a view that in fact the economy has not been generating much real disposable personal income [Its growth] peaked out in December of 1978 In terms of the monthly figures, it bounced around but in the second half of last year, for example, real disposable personal income is estimated to have gone up less than 1/2 of one percent And yet we are getting expenditures, which we estimate, for example, in the final quarter of the year to have been at 3 percent Clearly, in our view, it's a strong attempt by consumers to maintain their spending patterns despite adverse factors in growth of real disposable personal income So, it is that sort of issue It's true that the issue is wrapped up with whether or not we are getting durable goods purchases [from] savings, and that would tend to drive the [saving] rate down in a given quarter  Well, some appliance sales had been strong, but consumers were generating installment debt increases of around 10 percent  I think your description of those forecasts is quite correct; most major models do have a somewhat deeper or perhaps the same decline, though shorter in duration, and a much stronger recovery DRI is one example and that's clearly their forecast On the inflation side, curiously enough, the Board staff's forecast would be in the upper range of inflation rates of outside forecasts that I've seen for 1981 In part that's attributable to the fact that many of the outside forecasts with a stronger recovery generate more productivity and they've incorporated a tax cut that removes the social security [tax] aspects But I think the conditional assumptions here are very different from those being used by most outside forecasters  Well, we think it will be close to 1 percent without a constraint on the time horizon We think it's probably closer to 2/3 of a percentage point or something like that in 1981 Compensation goes up by 3/4 of a percent because of that effect and we assume it will be fairly quickly passed through in the form of higher prices  We have a moderate decline in rates beginning in the spring and going on; the 3-month Treasury bill rate we assume will [drop to] around 10 percent in the spring [and will drop a bit more through] the third quarter and rise slightly thereafter to 11 percent in the second half of 1981  -55-    1/8-9/80  Oh, yes  Right  It's M-1A, but I'm not sure we would want to forecast a great deal of difference in interest rates on the basis of M-1A and M-1B  We don't have any additional information; in fact, I'm not sure that the Commerce Department has anything in the way of hard evidence right now All of the data for December are essentially missing, including retail sales The obvious assumption would have to be that consumer expenditures are even stronger than we have now in our forecast [We have] a bit higher federal expenditures than Commerce had, a little higher exports, and our inventories were a little higher, I believe So the major source of the difference is consumer spending Our information, for what it's worth, would suggest to us that real consumer purchases in December were not that strong We had built into our forecast an increase of about one percent in nominal retail sales increases in December, excluding autos, so it's virtually no increase And if [Christmas] turned out to be a strong season, that 2 or 2-1/2 percent kind of number could well come out I would be very surprised if it were 3 percent or higher But a 2 percent number seems to me to be perfectly plausible at this point  Real GNP in the fourth quarter  Yes, we've looked at that There are a number of uncertainties at this point We don't think it will have much of an impact on real GNP It will change the internal mechanics of accounting for it, namely about $2-1/2 billion less in agricultural exports And that would show up in farm inventories or government  -56-    1/8-9/80  purchases But, in fact, for real GNP we don't think it will have much of an effect The issue really is what price effect it might have and whether over the longer run that does change domestic and foreign exports as well as domestic production And that's unclear It had seemed to us that it might well in the short run lead to higher prices; but I notice prices seem to be falling, so we had that one wrong It seems to us that the price effect is more important and we don't have a good fix on that right now  That's right  Well, in terms of price behavior, we have performed some exercises with our quarterly econometric model to get some notion of the impact of something like a mid-1980 tax cut in a range of about $30 to $35 billion We think that by 1981 that probably would result in a reduction in the rate of increase in the deflator by about 3/4 of a percentage point from what it otherwise would have been, and [a larger decline] over a longer time horizon At the same time, it would have small impacts on real GNP; we think real GNP might be up by 1/2 percentage point or so  That's because it's oriented toward social security and business fixed investment and not toward generating additional direct consumer expenditures So, I gave you an answer that was different than you thought  No, we did not The exercises that we did, using the model, are presented in broad form in the Bluebook We did not for this meeting go into any other alternatives, of which there are an infinite number of possibilities  Well, we took 4-1/2 percent and 7-1/2 percent And the results for the year are shown in the Bluebook We did not  -59-    1/8-9/80  use alternative paths that would have something like slow money growth and then fast money growth within the years  We have built into the forecast government subsidized [housing] units of 300,000, which is pretty much in line with what the Administration talked about That's 50,000 more than in the last fiscal year  I'd like to correct the response I gave Governor Coldwell We did not assume a flat 6 percent quarterly money path It's 6 percent QIV 1979 to QIV 1980; but in fact we have built into our current forecast about 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent growth in Ml in the first half of '80 and about 6-1/2 percent or so in the second half  No  Yes The staff forecast is based upon the money path of alternative 1 on page 15 in the Bluebook, which is 6 percent for the year It's slower in the first half--I think it's around 5-1/2 percent and then 6-1/2 percent in the second half--but the short-run path consistent with that is alternative B  Do you mean for the long-run target or the short-run target? In the short run, if you stuck to the 6 percent target mentioned and simply altered the money path for one quarter and then picked it up the next quarter, it really wouldn't have a significant impact on inflation or real GNP "
1276,1980-02-04," Probably about 20 minutes  Well, this is the GNP implicit deflator; on a fixed weight basis it goes down As you know, the GNP implicit deflator subtracts out the energy prices coming from abroad and, in fact, gives us a lower number than is being experienced domestically So the implicit deflator at this time would be an understatement of the impact of inflation in this early 1980 period The fixed weight deflator is around 10 percent  -22-    2/4-5/80  We use the errors from the quarterly model in the equations, which are determined from past history We run a large number of simulations; in fact this is based upon 400 experiments with the model And when looking at that, we determine it with a 70 percent confidence interval  How many of those were above and how many below? In effect, using this very large number of simulations, the model would say that 70 percent from the past fall within that bound  Thank you  That's fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  That's right  Well, you'd want to add a line on that table for the staff forecast for 1980, QIV to QIV The staff has a forecast of 114 percent for the increase in the CPI And for 1981 the staff forecast for the CPI is 86 percent Just for comparison--  No, for the percentage change from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 we have 114 percent  92 percent  Well, we have a forecast of around 15-1/2 percent in the first quarter of this year with a combination of energy [prices] and high mortgage rates driving it up It drops to 11-3/4 percent [in the second quarter] and then to 9-1/4 percent in the second half of this year, which measured fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter gives you around 11-1/2 percent  130 percent  That's right  SPEAKER(?) Give or take a percentage point  You take the level of the index in the fourth quarter of 1979 and calculate the percentage change in the level to the fourth quarter 1980 Early in 1980 we have very rapid increases in the CPI and they slow later on  Well, if you want to look at some of these numbers The fourth quarter of 1979 is 130 percent; the first quarter of 1980 is 156; the second quarter is 117; the third quarter is 92; and the fourth quarter is 92 Measured fourth quarter-to- fourth quarter, that is an increase of 114 percent  I think we have that on a different table If not, someone may have a calculator and we can-- It's 128 percent  I have a December-to-December calculation for the Administration They didn't calculate it quarterly; I have the details, [so I can] calculate it It's roughly comparable For fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter it's 104 percent in 1980, which compares to our 114 percent And for 1981 we're both at the same level, 86 percent from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter  The consensus of price forecasts or what?  Well, I don't have a consensus I can give you some numbers based on a couple of the econometric model forecasts I might just say that a great deal of difficulty is associated with this sort of exercise in that both the monetary and fiscal assumptions differ And in many cases one doesn't know what the energy price assumptions are Most outside forecasters that I am aware of now include in their control projections some sort of tax cut as well as a considerably more expansive monetary policy if specified, or if not specified, implicitly so Most of them have a recession, I would say, that is two or three quarters in length beginning now They have maintenance of very high prices and a much sharper recovery in activity late this year or in 1981 The Wharton model is something like that, for example, and they do have a tax cut And they assume M1 growth of 6-1/2 percent compared to our 5 percent In comparison, the bill rates in that sort of forecast by the fourth quarter of this year are below 10 percent, compared to 11 percent in the Board staff's forecast So, a good deal of the difference probably relates to alternative policy assumptions DRI is the most confusing of all It has an increase in nominal GNP from the fourth quarter of 1979 to mid- 1981 that averages 10 percent at an annual rate and has the bill rate going down 3-1/2 percentage points All of that is achieved with a 4-1/2 percent M1 growth, which is magic compared to anything in the postwar period  Yes, I do Do you want a fourth-quarter level or--?  The level in the fourth quarter of 1980 is 96 percent on the 3-month bill rate; in the fourth quarter of 1981, it's 88 percent The staff forecast has a bill rate of 11 percent in Q4 1980 and 11-1/2 percent in Q4 1981 There is no explicit money assumption that goes with the Administration's forecast  We do buy it; I don't look at it Well, I can't say I don't look at it It's a rundown of 30 or 35 forecasts Unfortunately, they come out with different time periods and no listing of the policy assumptions, so it's very difficult to compare one to another It's helpful if one just wants to scan what private forecasters are thinking, but we've had difficulty trying to relate our forecast to others unless we have the detail of the monetary policy [assumptions], for example But we do receive that and do look at it  No, that plays a very important role But we have inflation coming down in 1981; it's not going up  Well, as I say, in part the deflator is a statistical artifact when import prices are rising very rapidly I do believe that there's little that can be done to change the course of price developments within the next three or four months In fact, already just about half of the first quarter is over, so in our view we're locked into a very adverse price performance in the first half of this year  As I say, part of that is attributable to the performance of import prices in influencing this calculation It is our view that prices do improve If you take a look at an alternative measure of prices, in the section that Jerry Zeisel was referring to-- go back one section [in the handout] right before the yellow sheet-- there is a chart that plots the gross domestic business product, which is a fixed weight price index There some of the problems from shifting weights are at least taken out, and you can see that we do have a decline beginning in the second half of this year, stretching into and throughout 1981  What falls into line? I only wanted to tell you that while we give you point forecasts, we're quite aware that there's a wide range of error associated with any forecast We tried to look at past history to suggest how big that range is, and it's sizable We have no difficulty with your point that monetary policy over time does have an influence on the economy and on prices In fact, the answer is Yes, we agree  It drifts up and for the year 1980 averages 4-1/2 percent  They're our calculations but we use the same procedure, which has been revised  Correct  No, it's included in the projections The windfall profits tax--technically I think the words associated with it are ""energy trust fund,"" but that's a misnomer if one believes that the revenues are segregated--is included in the budget figures For 1980 we have something like a net addition of nearly $5 billion to revenues It's something like $7-1/4 to $7-1/2 billion in revenues and $2-1/2 billion in expenditures, so it's around $5 billion net receipts And for 1981 it's around $10 billion net receipts So, that is included in these figures  No, we have not  -38-    2/4-5/80 "

1341,1980-04-22, [Statement--see Appendix] 
1404,1980-05-20," [Statement--see Appendix]  Yes, we have housing starts rising to a little over 1 million units by the end of this year and continuing on up to about 1-1/2 million units next year Our forecast for the remaining months of the current quarter is for a bit further decline on average But starts would average 900,000 for the current quarter and then begin drifting up next quarter so that they are at an annual rate of over a million by the time we hit the end of the year That's essentially what we have built into our forecast currently I might note that for mortgage rates to get to that level they would have to decline further in conventional markets They are not there yet  Yes In fact that was largely based upon the labor market developments in April, which we had available Wages and salaries declined at about a $7-1/2 billion annual rate And that's one of the principal ingredients giving us for the second quarter a virtually unchanged saving rate even though consumption spending is declining very rapidly So, we think we've roughly captured that  That's quite correct in terms of the forecast that we have, in which the saving rate really never gets to 5 percent and then drifts lower That is at least a percentage point below what one might have expected on the basis of experience prior to the last two or three years There are a number of factors involved Essentially, one is that we believe individuals will attempt to retain their standard of living And when one looks at the composition of price changes, relative price changes have been extremely large for necessities such as food, energy, and housing So, our view is that one of the elements driving the saving rate down recently has been the surge in the relative prices of necessities; and individuals have been willing to let the savings side slip as an attempt to maintain their standard of living We expect that to persist We also tend to believe that the saving rate may have been adjusted lower as a result of the inflationary experience [and will remain low] through this forecast horizon, even though the rate of inflation is declining It's still very high by historical standards, and there clearly has been a change toward spending as opposed to saving And I think it will be hard to get consumers around to the view that they want to save substantially larger portions of their income once they have adjusted in this fashion Admittedly, it is a very difficult part of the forecast It often comes out as a residual To go about this, we use the saving rate as a check and then begin asking questions about it and whether we believe it's appropriate If consumers' attitudes change quite differently and in the aggregate they feel squeezed in terms of their financial positions, as they ought to, then the saving rate might tend to be higher And if it were, of course, other things unchanged, activity would be weaker  That's one of the major risks in a forecast like this because [the downturn] is deep enough and it also started    5/20/80  with many sectors being in what we would perceive at least to be a vulnerable position [So], even though one is looking for that kind of evidence, those developments tend to be unpredictable and could pose serious downside risks for the forecast We have been looking very carefully, for example, at the corporate sector, and the aggregate numbers there do not provide any comfort at all There has been a great increase in downgradings of corporations and cutbacks in capital expenditure plans, some of which seem to be stemming from the financial side You mentioned also the government sector, and we are clearly getting a squeeze there with real expenditures declining; but with the Administration's effort to curtail the rate of growth in federal expenditures, a good chunk of that [spending] falls on the state and local sector So there are sufficient concerns in the nonfinancial sectors as well as the financial sectors to be aware that something may go wrong, and that could very easily set off expectations in an adverse [direction] That is one of the risks that would argue for the possibility of seeing even lower numbers They may not materialize, but we are at the point where there are [enough] warning signs to be cautious  Yes, that includes $10 billion, roughly, in receipts So if nothing else changed, the deficit would be in the neighborhood of $30 billion  Well, some of the developments in Congress have lowered that, though, so the numbers coming out of the Senate side were a small surplus But the numbers are all on the plus side I might note that we have not assumed passage of the withholding on interest and dividends and that's worth something like $3-1/2 billion We've assumed that some of the expenditure cuts won't materialize, given the much weaker economic forecast that we have That's worth $4 or $5 billion more in direct expenditures than we have assumed And the remainder is accounted for principally by weaker receipts, higher unemployment insurance compensation, higher interest rates, and that sort of thing So, we've [made some assumptions] on the expenditure and tax sides, but the bulk of it is the different view of the economic outlook  The revisions came out this morning The Commerce Department had previously indicated that real GNP rose 11 percent in the first quarter; they now indicate the rise was 06 percent Final purchases are roughly the same at a 1-1/2 percent rate of increase And now there is indicated to have been a small liquidation of inventories in contrast to a small accumulation I would only note that the composition has changed a fair amount, but in general final purchases are where we thought and inventories are a bit lower "
1425,1980-06-05," Inventories seem to be rising, on the basis of the manufacturing data we have for April I would only say that it's very difficult to track [inventory] developments in one month with business borrowing at banks in a given month We do know that business borrowing in the first quarter substantially exceeded    6/5/80  external financing demands, so presumably some of the financing of the corporate sector is being done internally with [the proceeds from] the heavy borrowing they had undertaken in the first quarter  It's a bit faster [than earlier] in book value terms The latest data we have is just for manufacturing in the month of April And manufacturers' book value inventories rose at about a $49 billion annual rate compared to a $40 to $41 billion average in the first quarter I might note that production dropped substantially in the month of April And the limited but significant information we now have available for the month of May suggests at least as large a decline, if not larger, in industrial output in that month  That's correct We have a faster pace of accumulation in our forecast but not a substantial pace and we would not expect--given all the other borrowing, the first quarter performance, etcetera--to see from the inventory side a substantial increase in demand for business loans at banks "
1451,1980-07-09," Actually, if you flip the page and go back to [the chart labeled] ""Prices I,"" the numbers on the top panel of that chart show the peak was in the fourth quarter of 1974 when unit labor costs were up 149 percent [from a year earlier] The fourth quarter of 1975, one year later, was the low point [when the year-to-year increase was about] 4 percent So we had [nearly an 11] percentage point swing in unit labor costs in that particular period  It was 2-1/2 percent to 3 percent [unintelligible]  Well, we are pessimistic relative to past cyclical performance And I think the productivity assumption is a very tenuous one There are alternative explanations of why productivity declined, and one could very easily suggest that we may get a bigger rebound At the same time, on the compensation side we have a situation where real wages have declined for a substantial period of time In fact, I would view it the other way around on the compensation side We think we have a good forecast given the assumptions But one could very easily think that there will be more intense upward pressure on wages and that compensation might not slow as much as we have built into our forecast  Well, in a sense that puts pressure on the bargaining units and on workers who wish to command higher nominal wages to offset that  Well, that's one factor It tends to cut several ways One of the arguments is that, given the rising cost of capital, firms will tend to substitute more labor for capital It depends on the industry In fact, President Morris had a conference at the Boston Fed about this whole role of energy and productivity and capital investment, and it's a cloudy area But the balance of thinking is probably that energy prices for many firms are a relatively small part of total costs So it's hard to sort out where that will fall; one has to do an awful lot of disaggregated work We think that it probably on net adds something to capital investment demand, but relatively little if you abstract from what's happening in the energy sector directly And that's obviously a different animal  Well, unemployment adjusts with a lag And these are rates of growth We have a higher level of real GNP but these are rates of growth of real GNP  That's right, but it's reversing The difference in the unemployment rate in 1982 is 08 percentage point and in 1983 it's a half percentage point So the gains on the unemployment side are disappearing, but with a lag  In the last several months there was a generalized governmental review of the calculation of this high employment budget and an agreement on the calculations involved So we're using that  -16-    7/9/80  We have done that in the past We have not done that this time The way we use this high employment budget in our own approach is to look at the change in the budget from one year to another Differences in the unemployment level used mainly affect the level of the budget rather than the swings from one year to the next And I might note that for 1980 and 1981 this projection has a fairly dramatic increase On a calendar year basis we are going from a surplus of roughly $18-1/2 billion in 1980 to [a surplus of] $39 billion in 1981 Now, the levels would be different if we calculated the budget on a higher unemployment figure; but the swing, we think, is indicative of the thrust of policy  Well, we have not done that calculation, and I don't have in mind any rules of thumb that would allow me to give you an answer right now  We can certainly do [the calculation] and circulate it  No, it does not It includes the Treasury issues and a small amount of agency issues It does not include FNMA or the Home Loan Banks, for example We have numbers that start at $75 billion for 1980; there's a narrower definition of the budget and it does not include the off-budget items  Right  That's right It captures the [funds raised by] the Federal Financing Bank, for example, as a Treasury issue  Yes One of the problems here, by the way, is that this chart covers ""nonfinancial"" [as defined] in our flow of funds accounts We consider the sponsored agencies to be the financial sector, so we are dealing with a different concept here But in 1980 we have sponsored credit agencies raising about $11-1/2 billion of funds and in 1981, $20 billion So [compared] to these numbers, you get [borrowings of] something like $87 billion under that broader definition in 1980 and $120 billion in 1981  Oh, yes  No, it is not  We understand that the economic assumptions are firm as a basis for the midyear review What are not yet firm are the precise outlays and receipts--the budget side associated with the economic forecast But it has not yet been presented officially; my understanding is that it will not be delivered until July 21  That's right In effect, the way to view the 4-1/2 percent [M-1A growth] is that it has the power of old-time 7-1/2 percent money, old-time being pre-1974 money  Well, the early number the Administration was working with on outlays was something like $578 billion, $3 billion higher than the staff's estimate Now, that may come down a little We looked back at the last eight fiscal years, from 1972 through 1979, and the mid-session review has overestimated actual expenditures by about $2 billion That's about 1/2 percentage point So we feel reasonably comfortable that we're close, given past experience On the receipts side, the Administration had $519 billion as an early number as opposed to [our] $523 billion That relates, as I understand it, to some tax multipliers, the response of tax receipts to income over the last three or four months And it's a messy business So I would view [the two projections for] 1980 as really quite close The real issue is 1981  For 1980?  Yes We have $4 billion more in receipts than their preliminary number And as I say, it's really a technical matter Their forecast is not materially different from ours for the second and third quarters--the last two quarters of the fiscal year  Yes, it includes that; it excludes certain other things It excludes, for example, the withholding of interest and dividends We made some adjustments where we felt it was quite unlikely that the Congress would be willing to go along with the Administration's proposals  As you know, we do recognize that forecasting point estimates is not the way to go in terms of associating some degree of [certainty with the forecast] We believe there is a standard error associated with any forecast, and that's why we've attempted to work with the model in generating ranges of uncertainty or confidence intervals In that memorandum we used the model to try to calculate the probabilities of hitting the Humphrey-Hawkins targets as defined by the Administration's forecast  Well, in the short term, yes The first two years are defined as the short term; they represent projections but in fact are short-term Humphrey-Hawkins targets  That's right  In general, I would say that with the monetary policy we have assumed--looking at the model results in both years, particularly 1981--there is a fairly small probability of [an outcome] within a narrow range of those targets I didn't go into this in the presentation, but a good deal of the difficulty revolves around the Administration's [forecast of] 13-3/4 percent growth in nominal GNP with interest rates not much higher than they are currently That tells you something Really, their implicit monetary [growth] assumption has to be high So the exercise we've gone through suggests that there's a fairly wide range [of uncertainty] associated with the point estimates we've presented for the broad aggregates, for 1981 in particular And looking at the Humphrey-Hawkins targets, there's a fairly low probability of [an outcome] within a narrow range of those targets--particularly of hitting the unemployment and price projections simultaneously  Well, given the policy assumptions, I feel fairly comfortable with the real side forecast that we have I know there's been a tendency for economists to underestimate the strength in the economy at turning points But in general we have built in very restrictive monetary and fiscal policy assumptions relative to past cyclical experience At the same time, on the price side I feel reasonably comfortable I find it very difficult to expect much greater price improvement next year, particularly in light of what is happening on energy; and food prices aren't going to help Both of those were positive forces in 1975 So I feel reasonably comfortable with [our forecast of] both prices and real GNP If we're wrong, it may well be that some of the assumptions are wrong And I would prefer to stop there  SPEAKER(?) In other words, two plus two still equals four but maybe it's--  Very little, if you mean over the course of 1979  I don't know that I'd say ""before"" and refer to 1974 and 1975 We had very special factors then, involving particularly the REITs I do think, however, that the combination of high inflation, which is really the problem behind this whole chart, as well as sluggish income growth in general portends difficulties for individual units in the business sector, in the household sector, and probably in the state and local government sector as well I don't know that I would want to [compare the current situation with] what I would view as a very special period complicated by the recession in  -25-    7/9/80  1974-75, but there is clearly a potential for delinquencies and business failures that should not be ruled out  No, it's both single-family and multifamily  No, they're down at that end of the table  Certainly "
1499,1980-08-12," [Statement--see Appendix]  That has constituted a large debate in the preparation of our forecast I would say that in the very short run we would expect the argument to hold that people will jump in That is, if we are talking about a rise of just a few basis points, those folks who were out of the market in the second quarter but were on the verge of buying may in fact be prompted to move off the fence In general, however, we believe the impact of tighter financial conditions--in the sense of rising mortgage rates throughout the forecast period, which is implicit in our forecast--would have a significant damping effect There are two other factors and one is [particularly relevant] Our forecast implies slower rates of increase in deposits at thrift institutions than in previous cyclical periods when interest rates declined and stayed low I might mention another factor, which is that the growth of real disposable income in our forecast is really very small--certainly much smaller than in past cycles And we expect that to act as a drag on generating effective demands for housing  Oh, I think that's right That whole area of alternative mortgage instruments is a positive feature, particularly for younger families But past experience generally indicates that these [practices] grow fairly slowly, particularly in an environment in which the institutions are rather risk averse, which they seem to be If one starts talking about going out 40 years instead of 30 years, in a fixed-rate environment with today's inflation I think a number of institutions will be fairly reluctant to move in that direction  For the third quarter we have the quarterly average rate on conventional mortgages at around 12-1/4 percent, which is where it is now, and it goes to the 13-1/4 to 13-1/2 percent area by the latter part of 1981 So in effect, it's drifting up throughout this period  That's a principal reason Unit labor costs in our view are going to be coming down, but precious little We also have the social security [increase], I might add That adds directly to business costs beginning in January, and we assume that will be passed through quite quickly We have the food and energy situation added on, and it's hard to be optimistic there So overall, our view is that our [inflation] forecast, given our GNP, is perhaps on the low side of what many people might come out with  I'll give you the answer you're looking for first, and that is that we forecast interest rates with great difficulty It comes from a combination of the model exercise as well as judgmental forecasting And we take the monetary policy assumption as given, which is 4-1/4 percent [M-1A growth] for 1981 Implicit in that [assumption] is a substantial further downward shift in the money demand function So in effective terms money is growing more rapidly But simply to hold money growth to 4-1/4 percent, even with a downward shift, implies to us a substantial further increase in interest rates  We have short-term rates rising above long- term rates by the end of this forecast period So we're once again back to an inverted yield curve That seems to me rather an unusual situation for a very sluggish recovery with inflation coming down, if people believe that But it's very hard to envisage a significant decline in long rates unless one believes that price expectations are changing dramatically and that, in fact, our inflation forecast is wrong Otherwise, yes, we come out with rising real rates And that's one of the reasons why we have a sluggish recovery  As you know, the ratio of debt outstanding to disposable personal income peaked [last] summer, in the third quarter of '79 It came down a little in the fourth quarter and a bit more in the first quarter We don't have a final second-quarter figure but, obviously, given what has been happening with the run-off in consumer debt and the slow growth in mortgage debt, there was a significant further improvement in the second quarter I would think the change in debt outstanding we've seen in the second quarter is just a huge change in terms of historical [patterns of] debt reduction So while it hasn't gone very far, my guess would be that it ranks with some of the largest declines in consumer debt outstanding that we've seen in a six-month period  -19-    8/12/80  Yes, that's just for consumer debt We've combined consumer and mortgage debt, and the mortgage debt helps that story because it grew at a much reduced rate in the second quarter I don't have the figures at hand  Certainly, but the model is not the problem "
1517,1980-08-22," Yes The consumer price index this morning, as you know, showed no change It was a bit lower than we had    8/22/80  anticipated Food prices, although rising, rose a little less than we expected; and the mortgage rate contributed a major influence and declined substantially We expect the mortgage rate to go down further in the CPI index for next month We've also received new orders figures, which were up appreciably for total durable goods and they rose for nondefense capital goods also We do not believe, however, that the current [GNP] forecast for the third quarter, showing a decline of 4 percent or so, would be changed on the basis of the information that has become available since the meeting  Yes  That's right If you take out the mortgage component, it was up 06 percent, which is unchanged from the rate of increase in the preceding month "
1536,1980-09-16," [Statement--see Appendix]  It was 73 million units using our seasonals, and in both July and August it was 64 million at an annual rate  I don't know  We have a significant decline in productivity in our forecast for the third quarter The decline in the second quarter was revised since the last Committee meeting The early numbers showed a decline of 4 percent; it's now roughly 3 percent and we have forecast a further decline That is, the increase in output is not sufficient to offset the substantial change in hours worked, and our productivity number in the current quarter is down about another 2 percent at an annual rate So the productivity performance that is associated with this forecast is a distinctly poor one  Well, people refer to different things A standard approach is to use a cyclically adjusted productivity number, and those estimates range all over the lot Our own is something like 3/4 of a percentage point And it's assumed that businesses tend to respond to changes in productivity over a longer period of time and are not influenced by the quarterly changes So, taking those kinds of productivity numbers on average, they would dispense with [the quarterly fluctuations] and say that the underlying trend is something like [a rise of] 1/2 to 1 percentage point Using that kind of number gives us unit labor costs running about 9 percent Compensation is 10 percent, and with 1 percent or so productivity you get unit labor costs of 9 percent  Just a small amount--3 percent relative to [a decline of] 8-3/4 percent in the second quarter So they are still down  Well, I am referring to the nonfarm business sector Nonfarm business sector output in this forecast is down 49 percent Nonfarm productivity is down 19 percent and hours worked are down 3 percent  Yes, we would take some of the gain in personal consumption expenditures out of inventory, so it wouldn't all show up But I think we'd have at least a percentage point less decline; instead of a 3 percent decline in real GNP we would now have a decline of perhaps 2 percent or a shade under  With regard to the first question, the major change in this improved outlook is that we have assumed the increase in social security taxes in January The employer portion will be cranked directly into unit labor costs obviously, and we assume that businesses will try to pass those increased costs through fairly quickly So, the first half of the year is importantly influenced by  -13-    9/16/80  the social security tax increases, and that effect tends to wear off In addition, running with slack labor markets and unutilized capacity for an extended period of time we think will begin to make larger inroads on the level of inflation But it's mainly social security affecting the first half and pretty much absent in the second half  The big factor is the rapid acceleration of food prices that we have projected On the second question you asked, on why use this one, all of the price indexes now present a [distorted] picture and we are frustrated as to which one to choose We obviously shifted away from the implicit deflator because of the shifting weights, which give a distorted picture at times You are quite correct that the Congress and others often refer to the implicit deflator My own preference, frankly, is for something like the PCE deflator But in a world in which we have rapid increases in energy prices, both the implicit deflator and the business fixed product deflator tend to understate what is happening because of the subtraction that is cranked into these numbers So, you can put your money down and take your choice There are many indexes available  On average hourly earnings, I don't know of any quirky information in terms of the monthly numbers We have assumed, in fact, on a quarterly average basis that the hourly earnings index will be running around 9 to 9-1/4 percent, down a little from the second quarter These numbers are very volatile on a monthly basis but we have not altered our view that there is a developing trend that's very different from what we have seen in the first half of the year  With respect to your question, I would link the second and third quarters together If you look back at the misses in terms of actual performance relative to expectations, the second quarter was a big miss not only to the staff here but I think as a general matter It was much weaker than before So, I would think that the rather extraordinary measures taken in late winter or early spring had a significant impact, and in retrospect a greater impact than we would have judged at the time It would not seem unusual, therefore, to find some snapback in the third quarter in some of those sectors that were sharply depressed Now, [I don't know] whether that has occurred because interest rates are lower, consumer attitudes are different, monetary policy is different, the automatic stabilizer response is working, or fiscal policy [is easier] I think in general one can say that we got off track in the second quarter and it's not unusual to see some snap-back The critical question is whether in fact this is the beginning of a sustained sizable expansion in real activity And assuming the monetary policy that's in the forecast, which we perceive to be restraining--consistent with some further rise in interest rates--even with the tax cut we do not believe that we are on the verge of seeing sustained strong expansion It's quite possible that we could have a couple of months of fairly strong business news followed by some weakness But I don't see that The key issue is whether we are set up for continued strong expansion I don't see that as a likely outcome at the present time  Oh, I think so That's the double dip or the W or the extended L or any of the other exotic terms in fashion I think that's quite possible In the staff forecast, for example, we are talking about a small negative, and it doesn't take a great deal at an annual rate to find something that would flip that to positive or [more] negative  We do not have anything in house and I am not aware that anything is available within the government Our own assumption is that the program is being funded essentially with windfall profits and [will involve] synthetic fuel and that sort of thing We have much longer lead times It would not have an appreciable impact within the year 1981 but would be building over time The energy sector itself in our forecast is fairly strong We implicitly are using the energy sector as one that is holding up business fixed investment That is, we'd have a sharper decline if it weren't for substantial energy sector investments I can't answer your question directly, but I'm not aware of any such numbers around  Yes, over the long run But I really do think we are talking about a medium-term horizon, in the mid-1980s or so, given that these programs have long lead times So, later on in this decade, if the programs continue, the dollars expended [will be significant] In current dollar terms, expenditures of $200 billion plus over a period of time are being talked about That, in fact, will be a principal feature of the business investment sector later in the decade  No, we have a $28 billion tax cut in our forecast; [that is an assumption] we adopted two months ago or so We have not changed it; we haven't matched it up with the Administration's proposal So we do have roughly a $28 billion tax cut  That's right Well, retroactive to January 1  Well, roughly We'd have a somewhat weaker economy, we would assume, so receipts would be lower So it wouldn't all be taken out The Administration has a $36 billion deficit in fiscal '81 with their tax proposal, which is assumed to come along late in the fiscal year and that affects receipts principally in the following fiscal year  I think I've heard this question somewhere before! As you know, we have assumed a further downward drift in the money demand function For 1980, from the fourth quarter of '79 to the fourth quarter of '80, given what has happened and assuming no further downward drift, the drop amounts to about 3-1/2 percent For 1981 our forecast assumes [a drop of] about 4 percent That is the difference between the assumed actual money growth and that which would be predicted by the econometric model, which was estimated through mid-1974 It implies that there are financial innovations or other changes We have assumed 4 percent [based on] what has occurred in several years in the past But it's really a matter of faith, one might say, at this juncture There is some basis for assuming it  That's M-1A, right Now if you take that  -18-    9/16/80  No, we don't It's M-1A adjusted for ATS accounts It gets very messy and complicated and is best left untouched here But in any event if we take that away, we have in effect a tighter monetary policy than is assumed in our forecast We did a model run which essentially limited measured money growth to 4-1/4 percent and had no drift [in money demand], and we get no recovery in economic activity at all It's flat throughout 1981 and the deflator is 3 to 4 lower So we're talking about nominal GNP down 2 to 2-1/2 percent from what we have in the forecast now, but we don't get a recovery in economic activity And the model says that we get astronomical interest rates that are hard to believe--a bill rate of 18 percent or something like that  Yes, if we extend this to the second quarter of 1982, we can see the collapse Bill rates are, say, 18 percent and the deflator is 8 percent It's hard to believe that that would persist for any extended period of time  Right I have no problem with that I'm just saying it's not a sustainable pattern At some point you have to get back into balance, which can occur from any of a number of sides  Let me just read [the numbers] 5-1/2 percent in 1975; 4 percent in 1976; 1-1/4 percent in 1977; 1/2 percent 1978 and 1979, and we're estimating 3-1/2 percent in 1980  Oh, it's by no means steady  That's the problem with this This is an error in an equation in which [unintelligible]  The period [since 1974] is one in which we have had lots of financial innovation going on; it [leads to] very unstable [relationships] You can fit anything you want We have an almost unlimited capacity to supply new equations or numbers But you are quite correct in suggesting that one ought to be cautious in using this Nevertheless, I think it is instructive in the sense that it's a money demand function that makes some economic sense  No, I don't think so  Well, [if you throw out] '75, '76, and '80, you're right on track, but--  If we have no change in taxes?  The social security [increase] is worth $18 billion for the year; part of it is the [higher] rate and part of it is the [higher] base The windfall profits tax next year I believe is worth $16 billion and bracket creep is worth about $10 billion So the first digit is a 4; it's about $44 or $45 billion We have a $28 billion tax cut in our proposal here, so we still have the tax burden rising in 1981  The impact is a decline in real GNP of about 1-1/4 percent fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter and that would mean in that period maybe a tenth or two off the deflator  Yes It may be 1/2 or 3/4 percent--but small, very small  -28-    9/16/80 "
1586,1980-11-18," [Statement--see Appendix]  We have it for the first half of the month, which was down 14 percent from the level in September "
1609,1980-11-26," The new orders figures in total were up a little, following an exceptionally large rise in September For nondefense capital goods, they were down a little, but that was dragged [down] by aircraft; if we strip that out, they were unchanged The October level of nondefense capital goods orders is little different in nominal terms from the average in the third quarter, so we don't perceive that a great deal is happening that differs from our earlier expectations on new orders I might say that the shipments of durable goods were very large and were higher than we had assumed in our GNP projection So, on average, we don't believe there's much different in the figures, except that there is some near-term strength measured by the information available for shipments in October  No, we have not We have received additional information on housing starts, which were higher than we had assumed We have the second 10 days of auto sales for November, and they were at a 71 million unit annual rate On average, that's about what we had assumed So we think growth in the area of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in real terms is still a reasonable forecast for the current quarter "
1647,1980-12-12, Yes it is  We have an estimate for real GNP growth of 4-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter  Well--  About 18 percent    12/12/80  Right 
1665,1980-12-18," [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, I assume that when I answer, you're going to say ""Why not use M-1B?"" So, why don't I wrap the two together In our view, they're both better than the other aggregates in the sense that we want something closely related to transactions demands I think one could make a very strong case that over time the preferable aggregate to look at is M-1B In our forecast, even though we have assumed M-1A, the Bluebook specifies the M-1B numbers that go with it So, in effect, we have a consistent forecast If you prefer looking at M-1B, it's the equivalent growth rate for M-1B that's in the Bluebook  No, it's of no significance in terms of influencing the forecast because the equivalent M-1B is specified in the Bluebook "
1692,1981-02-02," We did not [have uniform assumptions] You're asking in terms of this exercise?  We specified the midpoint of the ranges On this one we asked that the forecast be accompanied by a statement as to what the assumptions were So, the assumptions did vary  I would note that the forecasts in the Humphrey-Hawkins report would naturally be related to a range on the monetary aggregates So there is room within a range concept to accommodate, I would think, a large number of the members of the Committee  They were down 24 percent in January; this is based on the first two weeks of data and it's a sample There is a good deal of disparity between single-family and multifamily As you may know, the multifamily starts have been exceptionally strong recently but in January permits for multifamilies declined 39 percent and for singles 14 percent So it's quite weak  940,000 compares to 12 million in December  Well, we've done a number of simulations and experimented with the impact of alternative fiscal policy assumptions, assuming the same rate of growth of M1 In general, [much hinges on] whether you take an approach that incorporates the three stages of the Kemp/Roth bill, which we have not assumed--we've only taken the first one If you assume that expenditure control [presents] a bit more difficultly to the Administration and they don't meet the targets that we have assumed in the forecast, the result is somewhat more real growth, but not a great deal more, in part because of this intractable inflation problem If you hold the same money growth path, interest rates get kicked higher and some other expenditures get squeezed out Of all the experiments--and I think one can argue about the interest rate pattern--we get somewhat more real growth, but what we're talking about is a plus or minus 1 percent at an annual rate, so it's not a big difference I would say that one of the areas in this forecast that is clearly very uncertain is the fiscal side; one can very much argue about the expenditure cuts that we have in the forecast or about what will happen to defense spending, the size of the tax cut, etc And it does matter But given where the economy is and with the level of interest rates that we have, our own analysis suggests that potential demands in the private sector are very strong but are being restrained If you dump in a more expansive fiscal policy and you get higher interest rates, that squeezes out some private funds That does not kick up the economy to significantly higher real rates of growth  That includes Treasury borrowing, which would include financing the unified budget as well as the off-budget items It does not include federally sponsored borrowing; it's just the  -91-    2/2-3/81  unified and off-budget items It's consistent with what we have built into the forecast In 1982 we would be running with a deficit of about $80 billion on the unified budget; you'd have to add about $20 to $23 or $24 billion for off-budget items For Treasury borrowing that's in the area of financing more than $100 billion in 1982 But that does imply significant expenditure restraint  You're talking about right now?  Well, the one difficulty in this area is that there are obviously many ways to calculate federal borrowing requirements and what the impact will be on markets One can throw in the federally sponsored agencies--for example the Home Loan Banks, the Federal Land Banks, and Banks for Cooperatives In our flow-of-funds accounting here we view those as financial intermediaries We can go through this and give you alternative calculations We can get the size of the borrowing lower or much higher If you throw in the financial intermediaries for the credit side of the budget, you get very large numbers  Oh, yes  We have taken a look at that We don't have calculated medians for all of those services I do have the numbers for four of them Let me just pick DRI, which I think exemplifies the  -97-    2/2-3/81  problem It's especially true for 1982 DRI has 137 percent nominal GNP growth for 1982 They have real GNP of nearly 4 percent--it's 39 percent--and the staff has a little under 1 percent They believe that to be consistent with bill rates that are lower in 1982 than they are today I think 13-3/4 percent nominal GNP growth doesn't very easily go with 3-3/4 percent money growth and declining bill rates So, I think the nub of the problem in many of these outside forecasts is that at least implicitly, if not explicitly, different monetary assumptions lie behind them  Well, I have that one That's a very interesting one because it has a 1982 forecast of 13 percent for nominal GNP growth and the interest rates in that Merrill Lynch forecast go down from 14 percent in the current quarter to 6-1/2 percent  Yes, to 6-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982  Nominal GNP is 13 percent, real GNP I believe is 61 percent, and the GNP deflator is 6-1/2 percent  Well, this was done this week I don't know what their forecast is  We would perceive it to be tighter; we view either M-1A or M-1B to be more closely related to developments in the economy than M2 So, as I understand it, [Mr Black's recommendation] would be a 1 point reduction on ranges for the narrower aggregates, which is 1/2 point tighter than we had assumed  It's 8-1/2 percent on M2  Well, it would be down a little I must say that I would treat all of this with a great deal of caution  No, it doesn't There just are no significant differences in the first quarter that really matter Our forecast is built on the four-quarter path for the year  It's a quarterly-average forecast  In response to Governor Teeters's question, the explicit path built into the forecast is 3 percent for the first quarter, which is very close to ""A"" or ""B"" But in terms of economic effects, since we are constraining the forecast to 4-1/4 percent over the whole year, if it's lower in the first quarter we assume that will be made up later on so that we don't get substantial economic effects for the year in total "
1718,1981-02-24," Well, employment, production, and sales were all well maintained in January Housing starts in January continued surprisingly strong, and the incoming data generally point to even leaner inventories than we had anticipated earlier So, briefly, as of now we would expect that real growth in the current quarter will be only a little less than the downward revised 4 percent shown for last quarter On inflation, it's clear that we continue to experience very rapid price increases And we continue to anticipate that the incoming data on the CPI and PPI will show some degree of acceleration in the remaining months of the quarter As of now it's our expectation that nominal GNP this quarter will probably grow at close to the rate experienced last quarter, which was just a little above 15 percent at an annual rate "
1742,1981-03-31, [Statement--see Appendix]  [Coffee break]  [MR AXILROD Statement--see Appendix] 
1765,1981-04-28," No, we have not at this point I would not think that the difference between zero and 2 or zero and 1-1/2 percent would be that large I think if we were to take all the incoming information available and redo the forecast, we'd be close to very little growth, which I define as within that kind of range "
1787,1981-05-06," Well, with regard to auto sales for the month of April, sales on our seasonals were at a 5-3/4 million unit annual rate, which is about 2 million units below the rate in March The only other information we've picked up relates to some very early information on worker hours in manufacturing for the month of April, and that seems to have risen a bit We would infer from that and from information we know on auto production and some other physical product data that industrial production probably will be rising 1/4 to 1/2 percent or something like that for the month of April "
1807,1981-05-18," [Statement--see Appendix]  Inventories for one The implied estimate was very low for March and the numbers have come in significantly higher Business fixed investment we think could be revised up at least $5 billion, as shipments were much stronger than their assumptions And in construction outlays, spending put in place was running higher than their assumptions Personal consumption expenditures may be a little higher, given the upward revision in March [retail] sales, as may net exports, which is a major contributor here in terms of a low guess prior to the availability of the March data So, it's pretty much across the board but, surprisingly, both inventories as well as fixed investment are very strong  We think the first digit should be 8 It's a question of how much higher We'd say 8 to 8-1/2 percent or something like that "
1825,1981-06-17," Well, it feels as though there's relatively little growth in the current quarter, following the exceptionally rapid pace of expansion in the first quarter The principal monthly indicators of activity rather consistently suggest a sluggish pace of activity Retail sales were revised downward in April and are now on a preliminary basis indicated to have been about flat in nominal terms in May Auto sales were very weak in April and May, although they've shown a slight uptick in early June Nonfarm employment adjusted for strikes has been unchanged for about the past three months And housing starts for May are reported to have declined On balance, we believe that we would not be making much of a change in our projection of real GNP for the current quarter On the price side, the numbers coming in continue to point to a rather favorable performance, judging from the PPI and the CPI A good deal of the more favorable outlook in the recent past has been attributable to developments in energy and food and, in the CPI, the homeownership component Other prices have not shown much movement, although on average they seem to be doing rather well under the circumstances For the deflator, we would probably be making somewhat of a small downward revision in our forecast for the current quarter    6/17/81 "
1843,1981-07-06," Prepared for what?  For M-1B?  They are changes fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, adjusted, beginning in 1975 to date We tried to incorporate some ad hoc adjustments for ATS and NOW accounts I think they are the familiar numbers  In 1980 it's 6-3/4 percent  Well, I don't know  Yes How much is that worth in fiscal terms?  It's $17 billion additional expenditures using the staff forecast because of higher interest payments compared to their March numbers The actual level of interest payments in the budget for fiscal '81 in our forecast--and I presume ours is reasonably close to the Administration's--is nearly $71 billion, and it would rise to $88 billion next year  $71 billion  Yes, they are  As you know, forecasting interest rates is a real problem, and I tried to say in my [briefing] that there are a lot of pitfalls involved in this process We've tried to look at this in a variety of ways The charts aren't plotted incorrectly, and you've described what is there and what the implications are Our general view is that we do have very strong latent demands for goods and services in the economy in a variety of sectors; [those demands] are being held down by interest rates We're stuck with an assumption of 4-1/4 percent [growth in] M-1B and a good deal of uncertainty about how to interpret that measure of money Is it really the sort of thing that one would have perceived in the past, linking it closely to transactions demands? Or is it changing? In our forecast, looking at 4-1/4 percent money [growth], we have what we've termed some further downward drift in the money demand function That is, money is acting in a more powerful way than the 4-1/4 percent [growth] we observe But even so, using any of the standard models, to get the economy to limit growth of money demand to 4-1/4 percent takes incredibly high short-term rates The Board's model has much higher rates than we have here At the same time, we get very high long-term rates, which is one of the factors damping investment growth in our forecast And, in response to a question earlier this morning, my [comment] was that with the kinds of rates we have built in one could easily argue a case for a lower investment demand than the staff has forecast That is, the implied real rates are very high  -17-    7/6-7/81  So, we're really fighting this issue of what kind of [interest] rates would be associated with the 4-1/4 percent growth in money, whether [that] is sustainable, or whether in fact we might just find the economy collapsing in that environment and [money growth] then snapping back But it's a key issue with regard to the staff forecast Projecting nominal interest rate levels out a year or a year and a half is something I wouldn't like to stake a lot of confidence on So, you pointed to a real problem It seems to me that we could not expect that situation [of high real rates] to persist for an extended period of time It would have to be resolved in one way or another, either by the economy collapsing and dragging rates down or by rates falling with changing price expectations We do have in this forecast a rather favorable price performance, and one would think there would be an unwillingness to pay those long rates So, it would need to be resolved  Yes Another way of saying that is that we would have more money growth than the measured M-1B picks up  Right, other things unchanged  About the same as in 1981 I would say that in February we had a high interest rate scenario We had assumed some downward shift of the money demand function, as Steve mentioned We didn't, however, have it all occurring essentially in the first quarter We're stuck with the question of what to do at this point, and we made the assumption that, in fact, a demand shift of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the year was reasonable So, we wouldn't anticipate any shift over the balance of this year, but we have once again put in a similar shift for 1982 Even with that, however, we get very high interest rates in order to hold the M1 growth down  In June the producer price index for total finished goods rose 06 percent; that compares with 04 percent in May and 08 percent in April For the second quarter as a whole, it was up 71 percent at a compound annual rate compared with 12 percent in the first quarter Food prices rose 05 percent compared with no change in the preceding two months Finished energy goods rose 02 percent compared with a decline in the preceding month But excluding food and energy, the total was up 06 percent, with a bit slower or pretty much unchanged rates of increase across the board For example, capital equipment prices were up 07 percent compared with 09 percent in the preceding two months On average there does not appear to be much of surprise in this particular index compared to our earlier expectations  That's correct It was up 28 percent compared with a 2 percent decline in the preceding month I might say on food that it's principally the meat prices that are up, particularly beef but pork as well, and we had in our forecast a continued further rise in those prices So it appears as if the rise in meat prices has begun  Yes Some of the spot prices, though, have been moving up I think the crude materials prices reflect that rise in the food area, in beef and cattle particularly; it's just there that we've seen increases in spot prices The rise has been erratic but [generally] up You're quite correct, though, that there is [that] expectation I don't know about the last couple of days, but the futures prices did not show anything that unusual "
1909,1981-10-05," [Statement--see Appendix]  Right, it was failures--Dunn and Bradstreet's failure index, which tries to adjust for the size of business population That was up substantially; I don't have in mind the percent It's still below the peak in that series, which occurred in 1960-61  There are other indicators, such as adverse dividend actions or ratings changes They are looking more adverse now compared with a year ago, but they're all well below what happened in 1974-75, which obviously was extraordinary Nevertheless, they have been creeping up in recent months, and one gets a sense that the corporate sector is experiencing some deterioration But it's not dramatic at this point  You mean nonresidential?  Yes, the orders in the last couple of months have bounced up On average they had been about flat from last winter through much of the summer But in the last couple of months we've had two really big increases; it's a very volatile series I'd say the longer-term trend is rather flat in real terms  -10-    10/5-6/81 "
1935,1981-11-17," [Statement--see Appendix]  About 2 percent if one were to go from Q1 1981 to Q1 1982, and that compares with a mean of postwar contractions of about 2-1/2 percent  It was a couple of special factors One relates to the inventory deflator and a technical problem that we think will be reversed Another was actually a positive feature that turns out to be negative in the short run We had a much steeper decline of import prices and in that quarter, since they're subtracted, it tended to boost the inflation rate But we think on average the changes that we've made to the third and fourth quarters don't represent a fundamental change in the inflation outlook, although I would say some things, such as service prices, have been coming in higher than in our previous forecast But it's not a big problem at the moment  No, not necessarily We have 918,000 or something like that in October So, it's below 900,000 on average for the next--  Well, I think it's a mixed picture A couple of years ago we had what were really fairly strong forecasts, given the interest rate assumptions Our thinking there was largely conditioned by the inflationary experience and a rough calculation of real interest rates We didn't think real rates were that high and we had relative to the model forecast--at least our own model--a fairly strong GNP projection Looking at it now, the argument is a bit different Our inflation forecast, looking ahead, is coming down In the mortgage market there is a good deal of underlying demand that's related to demographic factors, and the interest rate is a constraint But I'm not sure I'd frame it in terms of the interest elasticity having changed; we've just choked off a lot of potential demand in the last two or three years In the auto area, our view is that interest rates are probably a small factor in the depressed state of the market It is prices and incomes but not interest rates so much So, I don't perceive the notion that rates coming down a bit--say the    11/17/81  mortgage rate goes from 18 to 16 percent--as a dramatic factor Now, if you talk about the mortgage rate coming down into the 12 percent area, for example, then I think big things will happen So, rather than focus solely on the interest rate effects, we believe there are many things going on in various markets It's not just that the interest rate elasticity is so high that we're going to get a big bounceback, given where we're starting "
1962,1981-12-21," I was prepared, though [Statement--see Appendix] I might note that the CPI should be available tomorrow morning And, unfortunately, new orders figures will be available tomorrow afternoon  That's been corrected in the errata I think we reversed the lines for that and the state and local sector State and local spending was shown to be rising each and every quarter and that should be negative Those lines, unfortunately, were reversed  Yes, they are  Yes they are, but much less than they had been earlier  Right  Well, they are supposed to take into account actual transactions prices, but there is a question as to how well they can do that The report tomorrow is going to be for November, so in any event we wouldn't be picking up what is happening now until later in January  Immediately after, as I remember--in 1975 and 1976--there was a sharp break in wages, and prices also came down substantially  We have some numbers Unfortunately, they are annual numbers On an annual basis 1975 still showed an increase and 1976 is the big year where there is a break I would agree with Governor Gramley that the whole period is confused; I think part of the controls were off in 1973, and in 1974 we began to see the acceleration of wages when we were in that recession  It was continued on large firms as I remember  In 1973 the average hourly earnings index had a 61 percent increase; in 1974, 80 percent; in 1975, 83 percent; and in 1976, 72 percent  Right  It began edging up  No, it is not very--  No, it is very small On January 1st of 1982 the tax rate increase is only one-tenth of 1 percent compared with the 1 percent that went into effect in January of 1981 And the wage base continues to rise; it goes up something like $3,000, I believe  No In total the expected increase from payroll taxes next year is something like $5-1/2 billion The second stage of the tax cut for individuals, when it goes into effect, is in the range of $33 to $35 billion  Right  Well, I haven't thought about that question, so I don't have the answer I think it is a factor but not--  The effect is reduced by bracket creep, but there is a net stimulative effect, a substantial one We also have low income growth next year and that will hold down the effect of bracket creep    12/21-22/81  It is up 05 [for November] compared to the 04 in October Food prices rose 02, the same as in October And housing performed very well; it was only up 04, and that reflects the sizable increase in the mortgage rate and a 3/4 percent decline in home prices On average, it is a good report "
1990,1982-02-01," Well, I'm not sure We have not examined outside forecasts in detail We have a running tally of four commercial forecasters and, in looking at those, I would judge that monetary policy differences have a great deal to do with that A mean of four commercial services has M1 growth of something like 6-1/2 percent in 1982 and 5-3/4 to 6 percent in 1983 That's two years of really quite a bit more money growth as compared to the Board's numbers In addition, they have alternative fiscal policies The net result is that they have a much stronger recovery in activity; they have something like a 4 percent rate of increase in real GNP in 1983 compared to our forecast of 2-1/4 percent So, all of those things do have an impact on the price side And you're quite correct Relative to outside forecasts, we have a fairly optimistic price projection  Yes It depends in part on whether you're employed or not!  Not yet! In any event, you're quite correct that, looking at the assumptions we have, we do foresee some real growth It's small relative to past cycles, but it's an extraordinary period, given our monetary assumptions We have what I believe to be a realistic price forecast, given the assumptions, and I view that as quite optimistic I think something very important is happening on the price side, and 1982 is a key year I'm fairly optimistic on the price outlook There very clearly are downside risks in the forecast Mike pointed to some on the financial side; things can go wrong Jerry pointed to business fixed investment, which is a sector where there are clear downside risks I would only say that we are sure to be surprised by some bobbles in the numbers over the two-year time horizon that we're forecasting But on average, this is our best view, given the assumptions, and I think it's realistic  Given the assumptions, I think there are more downside risks, particularly in the shorter term  Oh, I think it clearly could I don't think that's the most likely forecast one would want to run with at this time I very much agree with your assessment early on that the failure of Chrysler or of International Harvester probably wouldn't provide the kind of shockwaves that a large corporate bankruptcy might if it were totally unanticipated I wouldn't rule that out Things that are unanticipated are precisely that; we can't predict them What we do know from looking at some of the individual cases as well as the aggregate numbers is that a large number of corporations appear to be [financially] strained And part of the outcome, in fact, hinges on what happens to the economy If cash flows were to erode or stay depressed for a longer period of time than we have in our forecast, then those pressures would tend to build  In the numbers you cited on corporate bankruptcies are a lot of smaller enterprises that have gone out of business Some of that is related to the federal bankruptcy laws and it can be a misleading guide as to the pressures on the system But our perception is that there are many corporations, and probably individuals, that over the next year or two could find themselves under severe financial strain given the nature of this forecast  I'm not aware of that Mike or--  In the short run I would say you can argue about the lag because if we had 1985 on the chart, you'd find interest rates under that strategy rising sharply And maybe it wouldn't take until 1985 But that very strategy would provide higher interest rates in the long run than any of the other strategies  All I can say is that the way this model works, as I think many others do, is that if you raise the money stock, it just takes a matter of time--and one can quibble about the time--but over the longer run, it's reflected in prices and not output  Well, we did, and we had so many alternatives that it was a question of which one to present or what to talk about It was a real problem We did try something that was a much tighter fiscal policy by getting rid of the 1983 personal tax cut, for example, and the 1985 indexing We stripped that out and assumed more expenditure cuts, and in that process we found that in 1983 when the stimulus of the budget was taken away, output dropped and the unemployment rate rose That was the short-run effect; but the long- run effect gives you a much better posture with much lower interest rates and a better inflation performance There is this output cost in the short run but that fiscal alternative of a tighter posture does in fact provide a good deal of relief on the interest rate front, according to the model, and does provide opportunities over the longer run for improved inflation performance  With this fiscal alternative and the judgmental money assumptions, the model reduced the bill rate in 1983 by some 2-1/2 percentage points; the bill rate was a little under 10 percent versus 12-1/2 percent So, it's 250-300 basis points But I must say that was a package of about $50 billion on the tax and expenditure sides It's a big fiscal change from what we have here  That's correct    2/1-2/82  Yes, we did Fiscal alternative [unintelligible] higher money In 1983, we'd get a 6-1/2 percent bill rate instead of 12-1/2 percent One can get all sorts of things, but that was an outcome that at least in the first 3 years produces a much better performance on most of the variables you might be interested in Then it begins to get worse as you go out further in time  Yes  I presume so Those numbers were still being changed, I am told, even as of this last weekend I really lost track several weeks ago I think we are higher because of the economy as well as--  Well, in fiscal '83, they have an unemployment rate of around 8 percent or so and we have a little over 9 percent; that alone probably is worth roughly $30 billion on the deficit Also, I'm told that for fiscal '83 they have something like $15 to $20 billion of tax raising measures and $30 billion of expenditure reductions, and we've taken about half on those sorts of things  Correct  Well, I think that's possible When talking about long-run forecasts I'd be very cautious simply because for most of the very important variables we're out of the range of historical experience So, I wouldn't disagree with that    2/1-2/82  I think that's right Our forecast would be one of continued high or, in fact, rising real rates given that we have inflation coming down So you'd have to be thinking in terms of disbelievers in the market; that's certainly a possible way of reconciling these differences  Well, as Governor Wallich would say, before taxes--  The borrowing that we have with that tighter alternative would drop about $45 billion, which is about 10 percent of total funds raised So it would make a substantial difference in terms of the federal borrowing as a share of total funds available  That's right And I wanted to mention that I think it's both the federal side as well as the private sector On these tight money alternatives, essentially the economy very much wants to grow more rapidly in nominal terms than monetary policy is permitting it And it's that kind of squeeze in the short end that is driving these rates up So, I'd say it's both the federal government sector as well as the private sector; even though we have a fairly sluggish private sector, in our view there are still demands that would be satisfied at these rate levels And you need those sorts of rates to restrain the economy over this time horizon  We have assumed about 2-1/4 percent  Well, 1981 is bordering on 6 percent, I guess  Yes  For total private business it was 57 percent; for total private business for the full year 1981 it was 93 percent, and that was down a percentage point from the year earlier "
2017,1982-03-29," The second quarter is virtually zero It's a small negative in contrast to the usual surplus  And from a zero in the second quarter it goes to a $39 or $40 billion deficit in the final quarter of the fiscal year, which is when the tax cut comes along So it's a huge swing going from the spring into the summer months I would note also that there's a bit of confusion among many analysts on why the deficit early this year was not as large as anticipated It is thought that part of it may be associated with the change in the tax law--namely the increase in the [penalty] interest rate, inducing people to pony up the money in January--because receipts in fact were running a good deal higher So, apparently, it's in part associated with the change in the penalty rate for late [payments]  SPEAKER(?) It's 20 percent  Right  [Statement--see Appendix]  Oh, I think it's possible You're quite correct that those indicators--and we have really nothing else--point to further weakness in the second quarter The staff's forecast has about flat final sales, which is risky All of the positive numbers we see result from a slower runoff of inventories, and forecasting inventories is currently messier than M1 So, I think there's a good deal of risk in the forecast and I would say it's primarily on the down side The one encouraging thing is that when you add up the various sectors, we're clearly not getting the major declines in spending that we saw earlier But at this point it seems to me it's very risky and we could have further to go before the economy, in fact, turns up  Well, the one formal approach to this is using the econometric model, and for 1983 that model provides high levels of  -14-    3/29-30/82  nominal and implied real rates as well Actually, for 1983 the model would provide a bit more real growth than we have in the forecast I think one of the real issues is the whole time pattern of this and the maintenance of what by 1983 would be implied real rates of interest in the area of 10 percent or so, given our interest rate expectations That situation is unlikely to persist; it will change at some point The question is when We don't have it changing in 1983, but I do think you're quite correct in asking How does [economic growth] continue on this particular course? It seems that in a short-run sense what we have is a classic crowding-out situation with a good deal of stimulus provided by the federal government in terms of generating additional incomes in the private sector through the tax cuts as well as the federal purchases in the defense area But we have very sick housing markets and durable goods markets, which are squeezed out in this process So, it's a real structural problem And, obviously, it's also true that forecasting interest rates is very difficult And one can see the change there  Well, it has to do with changing weights on these things and in part it reflects developments in energy prices In part it's also the auto sector, where we had more auto sales in the first quarter when rebates were on and we have assumed, rightly or wrongly, that the rebates go off in the second quarter, so there's a bit of a price kick from that It's mainly the changing weights and the break in world oil prices and gasoline prices and how that feeds in I guess I'd try and cut through all of that and say that we now very clearly seem to be on a lower inflation path, too low in terms of the underlying rate Nevertheless, a lot of things have come along in a very positive way recently, rather than these negative shocks that we had been getting before  Well, these things, as you well know, are very difficult to try to take into account I think the inherent structural problems in the economy grow over time as we live in a world in which markets on average have been weak now since 1979 It's really a three-year sort of problem And by the third year of high interest rates, many firms obviously have been weakened in that process Should a surprise come along in the sense of the failure of a firm--especially a firm not on the list generally talked about but truly a surprise and a major firm--it could have severe consequences And we have not allowed for that, obviously There's also a question of what it means in terms of fiscal policy I think that's rather important There are lots of programs being talked about in terms of housing subsidies, which could alter this But they also feed into the budget problem, and I would think the more severe the implied recession in various parts of the country, the more difficult it would be to follow through on spending cuts and tax increases So, the fiscal side it seems to me is one that's at risk in terms of trying to get a larger deficit reduction program in place  Today, this afternoon  No, I wouldn't [disagree]  For 1983?  Well, it's an environment in which we have tremendous government borrowing, and the amount of funds raised in the first half of this year is fairly low That picks up in the second half and, given this forecast, would be substantially higher in '83 Much of that is government-related The private sector borrowing, in terms of the consumer sector and mortgage borrowing, is very low; it continues to be constrained Durable goods expenditures are not doing very well either and that's a reflection of the high interest rate environment So, we get all of this financing but in a fairly tense situation Steve didn't put the interest rates in the Bluebook but we actually have a sheet with the numbers written down that I look at on occasion, and we have short-term rates drifting up in 1983 So they do rise in this forecast  No, in 1983  Right But this forecast we think would be consistent with some further rise--an upward drift in short-term    3/29-30/82  rates--throughout the year 1983 In long rates, who knows what would happen? We do think that persistence of lower rates of inflation such as in this forecast over an extended period of time ought to bring long rates down somewhat So, we have a small downward tilt in long rates, but higher short rates I wouldn't want to be questioned on a specific number for rates, but it seems to me that this is a mix that produces very high nominal short-term rates of interest And we would have that in there, with rates rising from the levels in the Bluebook  Fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter is about 7-1/4 percent The first quarter is zero  6-1/4 percent "
2042,1982-05-18," [Statement--see Appendix]  No, in February we had taken roughly half of the proposed deficit-reducing measures in the Administration's budget at that time We have retained that [assumption]; those numbers on a unified deficit basis are around $25 billion in deficit reducing measures both on the tax side and in expenditure cuts The numbers being talked about in the Congress--adjusting away some of the things such as interest rate declines, which we have not put into these measures--are in the $50-$60 billion range So, we're at roughly half of what is being talked about in the Congress now  No, that's for fiscal '83  Well, we have not, as you know, explicitly forecasted '84 and '85 I think it's perfectly consistent, however, that whatever is done in the Congress would imply larger [deficit] numbers in subsequent fiscal years In this forecast, however, we have the persistence of very high long-term rates One of the difficulties, frankly, is that what is being talked about in the Congress is probably not sufficient to induce market participants to believe that things are going to get done in a sizable way Those numbers are most discouraging To look at specified cuts The Congress has raised once again [its estimate of the] sales of outer- continental shelf leases Frankly, it's running the other way The Administration has reduced the numbers, but the Congress wants to get the deficit down so they say that the United States is going to sell $8-1/2 billion of those in fiscal '83 Even the Administration doesn't buy that number I can only say that no matter what the numbers are, if one goes through this line-by-line, it seems to me that the program has to be credible in order to have the kind of impact that you're talking about And I really don't see that on the horizon Dramatic things are going to have to happen over the next few months to change this around "
2067,1982-06-30," [Statement--see Appendix]  In the Congressional budget [resolution], they have 4-1/2 percent real and 7 percent prices  No, that's fourth quarter to fourth quarter They have nominal GNP in '83 of 11-1/2 percent, real GNP of 4-1/2 percent, a deflator of 7 percent, and a fourth-quarter unemployment    6/30-7/1/82  rate of 8 percent  Right [Statement continued--see Appendix]  Well, I would agree with you Certainly our perception is that the risks are on the down side for real growth Looking at the various sectors, the business sector is the one that probably worries us the most While we have over the last several forecasts reduced the expected performance of investment outlays--as Jerry mentioned, it's about normal now--what we didn't mention is that the normal range in the postwar period is -2 to 17 percent and we're at 8 percent So, there's a lot of room at one end or the other Looking at the data and trying to make some allowance for that, in our judgment that 8 percent is about right But surely the Redbook and the qualitative comments that we pick up are worrisome I don't see any major risk of this being an explosive recovery and I perceive the risk to be on the down side And I think the financial structure of the various sectors and the level of interest rates are real problems as we look ahead  Well, we had one of our people look at some of the letters coming out of brokerage firms in New York, and among the folks who watch this I think the general perception is that a deficit in the area of $140 to $150 billion is a likely outcome In fact, market developments after this was enacted are probably consistent with the view that the market didn't believe $104 billion  In fact, [the market] had already discounted those actions So, I think $140 to $150 billion is the kind of number that is being talked about  Well, truthfully, I don't know how to forecast long-term rates; I'm not sure I know how to forecast short-term rates either But in any event, in our flow-of-funds accounts we do think that the picture that is emerging, given the monetary assumptions, is that this budget outlook really is consistent with crowding out It didn't occur in 1975 in a classic sense, but we're talking about a period when we're expecting real growth in the economy associated with what would normally be some rising demand And the Treasury pounding away and essentially taking half of the total funds raised is a situation that from a credit market point of view has to apply upward pressure on rates "
2110,1982-08-24," [Statement--see Appendix]  Not directly Indirectly, yes, in the sense that we think it has been a factor in the interest rate outlook Obviously, rates of growth of money, interest rate levels, and GNP are all related I think in the short run, though, in terms of looking at what we had forecast for the last meeting of the Committee on June 30th-July 1st and the information available in the six or seven weeks since then, the forecast for the third quarter really reflects two major things One is a different look at the inventory side; inventories just have not been declining as rapidly as we had expected And, frankly, the key element is that final sales have been weaker We reduced expected personal consumption expenditures in the third quarter by more than a percentage point, and that's a key element So, in the very short run, I wouldn't associate [the change in our forecast] with M1 behavior I would do that over a longer-run context But in the very short run it's really that consumer spending has turned out weaker than we had anticipated  -15-    8/24/82  The only comment I would make is that I would agree implicitly with the view you've expressed in that the underlying determinants of economic activity in the short run, and rate behavior in particular, suggest that the economy is on the edge of a weaker performance than implied in the staff forecast I would not bicker at all with a forecast that puts down a zero for the third quarter or minus 1 or plus 1 percent The important point is that the way things are shaping up now, it is a small number around zero or a slight positive It isn't a 4 or 5 percent rate of real growth; it's a weaker situation  Well, we tried to and we have put down our assumptions The interest rate assumptions appear in the Bluebook and, as you know, they are trending up later this year and into 1983 One of the questions one has to ask is To what extent does part of the rate behavior reflect concerns that wouldn't track into spending in the economy but rather a flight-to-quality, looking at bill yields, for example That seems to me almost a sign of weakness, not something that says those low rates are going to translate into significant gains in spending later on The one area where it is rather important--and it's an open question--is in the mortgage area That FHA rate, as of today, is down to the 14 percent level I think that's encouraging But in our forecast we don't have private mortgage rates coming down that low; in fact we have them stuck in the 14-1/2 to 15 percent area, which we think is still an area that would not generate substantial levels of housing activity So, the outcome in the staff forecast is one in which we don't believe the current levels of rates would likely be sustained, given our assumptions on monetary policy and our outlook for the economy "
2148,1982-10-05," [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, I think that's right I would say to begin with that heaters and blankets count as consumer spending as does natural gas use, so that may be a plus in terms of the forecast Secondly, I would say that for some time the views that have come out in the Redbook and elsewhere from retailers are fairly gloomy; in fact, one might be led to the view that personal consumption expenditures were declining dramatically, just looking at that That is really not the case In the first half of the year, personal consumption expenditures were up at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent Our estimate for the third quarter is a rise at a rate of 1-3/4 percent and we have 3-1/2 percent for the fourth quarter So consumption will be up, in our view But I would say that one would have to be cautious interpreting what retailers anticipate and what their results were They have been disappointed, very clearly [Your comment about] the consumption-led forecast is quite correct in that if two-thirds of the GNP doesn't respond in the way we have forecast, we're in a great deal of difficulty in part because of the rather poor prospects in the investment sector and the export sector So, overall, [the consumer sector] is a source of concern I would only remark that in our forecast we have what is a very mild cyclical upturn It's a bit weaker than many of the other forecasts and the attitude issue, I think, is important It's probably very important in the short run where the economic news is likely to be very negative  Well, I certainly wouldn't make it the most probable outcome Our forecast represents our highest probability [outcome] But for the near term, and let's view that as over the next quarter or two, there are clear downside risks in that there is quite likely to be a negative [GNP] number in the third quarter or a negative number in the fourth quarter, and one might classify that as a triple-dip I wouldn't say the same if I were to take a bit longer horizon, particularly over 1983 I'd just like to say that in the first year of recovery in the postwar period we've had rates of increase of real GNP on the order of 7 to 8 percent The staff forecast is for 3 percent It is 3 percent for good reason But lowering that number, I think, begins to get a bit risky on the down side It's very difficult when the economy, hopefully, is near the bottom of a recession to spot the potential sources of strength, but for now it seems to me that there are clear risks on the consumer side On the business investment side, while we have had a major downturn in this cycle, it could very easily go weaker So, I think the short-run risks are on the down side  Well, in our own forecast, one of the major things that we have done is to write down business fixed investment; there has been a greater deterioration there And in the third quarter, while we had the tax cut, it came along a bit smaller than we had anticipated earlier; nevertheless, it was there In fact, other income didn't come along, so that we didn't have as large a growth in disposable income in the third quarter principally because of the sharp cutbacks in business fixed investment and the lingering inventory problems So it's in these other sectors that we underestimated the weakness or overestimated the performance I don't know of any other major area I guess net exports is another area, as Jerry is telling me; that indeed is one of the reasons why we're much weaker than the Commerce Department in the third quarter The expected performance of net exports is much below Commerce's estimate and the August data that have come in are even weaker than that So, exports and business fixed investment have been quite weak relative to our expectations and actual experience  I have a lot of trouble with real rates--well, a lot of difficulty in terms of knowing what inflation expectations are It seems to me that real rates are high; if inflation rates are going down and expectations of inflation allow for that, then we indeed do have higher real rates That's one of the elements, I would say, in that some of the major commercial forecasters have assumed higher rates of growth of M1 for next year--a percent or a percent and a half faster--so they indeed have lower nominal interest rates than the staff So, interest rates are one of the drags here, and they have been for some time, in terms of monetary constraint standing in the way of recovery  Well, that differs with individual consumers I think you are quite right in pointing out that short-term borrowing has been rather moderate; in fact, repayments relative to income have come off from their peak in late 1978 But at the same time one of the major sources of wealth in the household sector, namely housing, has clearly become less liquid for many  And the price may well have gone down Those are offsetting factors and I don't know how one would come out, but it certainly--  One simply has to put those two things together One can't look at the improvement in short-term liquidity alone  Well, we don't have that in our forecast  Not in the very short run We have indeed built in a bit of an increase in auto sales In that market, all of the news I've run across has to be viewed as rather negative I wouldn't perceive any of these areas as bursting out on the up side in the very near term, but I wouldn't extend that forecast through 1983, as I said We have in our forecast some pluses in these areas It's a matter of how much I don't know of anything at the moment that would suggest to me that we are likely to see major growth in the very short term But these issues are debatable and I certainly wouldn't want to argue the consumer case very strongly [even] in the short term "
2174,1982-11-16," [Statement--see Appendix]  That's right--total finished goods  I think there are a number of factors It's not really comforting to know that we have had a lot of company, but you are quite correct that the general expectation for the second half  -10-    11/16/82  of the year has not been met In part, from our side, I think we perhaps underestimated the interest rate impact on a variety of sectors, and in business fixed investment it was not just the interest rate impact but more broadly an erosion of confidence in that sector That's the one area that we have written down substantially and it accounts for the major drop in activity late in this year The export side is one that has been weakening as well in recent months, given the deterioration in international conditions So, both of those sectors are now heading down with a vengeance I would say there are obvious impacts on income and consumer spending flows from that If you look around at what went wrong, it is a bit weaker virtually every place I don't know any place in our forecast where we tended to revise [our estimates] up Some revisions have been large on the down side and others small; but they all have tended to run in a negative direction I think it's a whole host of factors I would say also that the tax cut was a little weaker than we anticipated earlier, but it was so small that it pales by comparison with the other things going on and it just doesn't matter in the aggregate  That's right The monthly savings rate numbers are a little hazardous to look at, but September now is down to the 6-1/2 percent range The temporary blip has been all but erased and a lot of income has been destroyed in effect or lost from the fact that these other sectors were deteriorating  I think that's right I would say that we had high interest rates in our forecast and we still had a recovery So, looking back, I'd say either we misestimated the impact of those rates or attitudes changed But it's very clear to me that one can't ignore the rate impact in terms of what is happening in the economy  Steve is going to be discussing that, I  -11-    11/16/82  The way it looks now, yes We have some information on raw steel output, and auto assemblies are down It looks as if it's going to be a negative number "
2200,1982-12-20," [Statement--see Appendix] I might note that tomorrow morning we expect to receive the CPI figures for November as well as some revised GNP data for the third quarter  Yes    12/20-21/82  Under the current legislation, by 1985 I believe only something like 60 percent will have been completed--that is, freed to the market So there is another 40 percent under the Natural Gas Pricing Policy Act of 1978 that would still be under [price] control It is our view that if we have oil prices at about the level they are now and no additional congressional action, we will be facing very large double-digit increases for the next 3, 4, or 5 years at least  That's right Those are the contracts, though, that were adopted in a mood of panic by a number of gas transmission lines who could not service their customers But the prices of much of the gas under control, the old gas, are substantially below the BTU equivalents of residual fuel oil And if we continue this discussion too much longer, I will have exhausted all of my knowledge of that market!  Yes, tomorrow afternoon  I can't    12/20-21/82  We focused on M2 for 1983 Abstracting from the shifts, we used a number of about 8 percent And compared to our nominal GNP, which I think is around 7-1/2 percent, that gives us very little change in velocity, which we thought was about right as a consistency check We've gone around on that The quarterly model, when you feed all the information into it, does dump out an M1 of around 6 percent, which we adjust to abstract from those shifts but allow for other demand shifts that come into the model; but it could be 2 percent or 10 percent; I don't know But we are stuck in our forecast with an explicit assumption of 8 percent M2 growth Q4-to-Q4  Abstracting from the shifts  That's correct  Those are consistent with that assumption on the GNP forecast  In the first quarter, it's 2 percent real and 4-1/2 percent inflation "
2252,1983-02-08," We're holding that in reserve  That's right I think there are a couple of other points That is one of them I would suspect that the things we hear relate mainly to manufacturing That's where the cost cutting is taking place and that's where we get the big productivity benefit But this is for the nonfarm economy in total and I would suspect that there's not as much going on in the services sector, for example, as in manufacturing The second point is that our view essentially is that, yes, the trend rate in productivity growth is improving We expect it to improve further We have a cautious approach I would also say that some interesting things happened in 1982 One is that productivity started rising very early--well, throughout the whole year but very early in the recession So, we had some adjustment for the faster trend rate of [productivity] growth that had been taking place with the massive [cost] cutting last year The bottom line is that there are factors that cut in different ways I think this is a conservative estimate If it's wrong, it's probably too low We might see much better performance than we have here    2/8-9/83  Well, that's right  Parts of it did I don't think that one would have seen these discrete changes across the board There is a so- called vintage effect, which implicitly or explicitly obsolesced a large part of American industry by the change in the relative price of oil Part of that shows up There are several things; we also look at the McGraw-Hill survey and the Bureau of Economic Analysis data that are direct industry reports In addition, we have the cyclical problem--and the steel industry is a classic case--where the issue is how much tonnage they are writing off We've been in contact with steel companies as well as the American Iron and Steel Institute and we have some feeling, we think, about what they are writing off in a permanent sense Now, the issue about a hundred versus some other number, I think, is a very important one We have perceived something like 85-87 percent as peak rates of utilization--the point at which we've really had a problem in the past So, in terms of the current number or some elevated number--adjusted one percent or two or three percent or whatever it may be--we'd relate that to something like a mid-80's range as full capacity utilization rather than a hundred All of this, of course, is related to prices One of the issues is What is the price of that final product that will bring back these mills that are now viewed as outmoded? There is a price at which these facilities are not destroyed or mothballed forever It's a messy area The kilowatt hours also are a problem; that was affected by the 1973 oil price increase We have sent people around to every Reserve Bank in the last 2 years and we have a survey that the Reserve Banks collect for us and it's a mess That is the final word on that  Well, that could be As you know, our housing starts forecast for 1984 is an average of a little under 17 million That isn't the days of 2 million plus numbers that we had So, that's one element in our thinking Another is that we think housing will still be rather expensive in terms of mortgage rates being high and capital appreciation prospects perhaps not being as great as in the past So, both from the production side and the cost and financing side, it seems to us that there are reasons to believe that housing won't really take off as in ""the good old days"" But I wouldn't view a 17 million number 2 years out as being terribly strong given the pent up demands that presumably are there and the demographic factors It's pretty much a forecast that I can be comfortable with at this point in time  Well, that's part of it too The argument is that people are building smaller houses and that sort of thing  Yes    2/8-9/83  Beginning in the second quarter of--?  I think that's a question that I don't have the answer to here I'm not sure I want to remember!  You're talking about our projections of the spring of last year?  That's right; we had forecast a modest recovery So, we did not put in the second-half downturn If that's the question, you're right  In April and May, I think that's right  Fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter in '81 it was 9-1/2 percent  Year-over-year in '81 it was 11-1/2 percent I don't have the number for '80  So large "
2350,1983-07-12," [Statement--see Appendix]  No, we have not done that We did some of those exercises in February, but we have not done anything later than that As you remember, those exercises did provide for a decline in the actual budget deficit as the economy recovered but a rise in the structural deficit to levels well over $100 billion We have not updated those figures; I presume they would roughly be the same  1985  There are lots of things I remember, but that I don't remember I'm sorry It obviously hinges on one's inflation projection If we were to run with very mild inflation projections-- that is, in the 4 to 5 percent range--it would not be large early on As you recognize, that cumulates over time in terms of substantial losses But I would presume that with small rates of inflation, as we could conceivably have for 1985, it would not be huge This is the last year That is, the July tax cut [unintelligible] but the full effect of it will be felt in the 1984 fiscal year I'm sorry, but I don't have a dollar estimate  All of the quarters in 1982 on that basis were deficit quarters, but the current figures show they were in surplus in the first quarter [of 1983] and the second quarter as well  Correct  Well, as you can appreciate, things have been happening since we put this forecast together When I looked at this chart on interest rates, as a matter of fact, I had in mind that interest rates would be moving up about a percentage point But as of yesterday it was about forty-five basis points for the bill rate because that rate already had taken a 50 basis point increase along the way So, part of the answer is that just in the last few weeks market rates, indeed, have been moving up The numbers that we have in the forecast are the ones shown in Appendix I Some of those rates in long markets and the mortgage market in particular clearly have    7/12-13/83  been moving up They are almost to the levels we had envisaged as an average rate for the third quarter So, implicitly, what we are thinking is that the rate moves that would be encompassed in this forecast would allow room for some further rise in rates but not a great deal  I must say, though, that if you look back over the performance of the last six months, we clearly have raised our [forecast of] real GNP and we have raised our view on the Ms as well as the interest rates that go with the forecast We did not have a clear interpretation of what rate levels or changes in rates would be consistent with activity in the first half It turned out that they were consistent with much stronger activity So, we believe that that will be at work in the future But one of the arguments for a moderation in growth of economic activity late this year, and especially in 1984, comes from the financial side The explanation is that those rates, in our view, should be high enough to damp activity a bit  I think Jerry mentioned it, so we'll let him comment  Well, that one is easy to answer That tracks right into the budget numbers that one is going to display In developing the Administration forecast, a number of the participants argued for lower rates in their belief that there will be a better inflation [outcome], but that of course drives up the budget deficit I think the answer is that a number things are important in influencing expectations One is the dollar and one is the notion of [the economy] growing rapidly; there will be speed limit effects and we will have lessened slack by 1984 It's very difficult to use past experience and come up with a substantial acceleration in wage rates in the future If you want to argue the case, you could say that a lot of the good performance we've had recently represents concessions and that as soon as profits pick up that's going to disappear That may be the case But we've just seen in the second quarter more companies added to the list of those still [getting] concessions and three-year contracts with no wage increases We have a view that, yes, there are cyclical effects here but that we will have enough slack, judged in terms of the level of underutilized resources, to keep putting downward pressure on wage rates We view that as a fundamental  Yes He's causing us difficulty, obviously Without Ted Truman we would have lower rates of inflation! We do believe that to be a very important argument for 1985 That is one thing I should note The partial dollar impact that we have on domestic prices in 1984 would build in 1985 and would have a larger effect  Yes, but they were running the other way and there is a hint that we have reached the bottom and there is a turn where new orders--  Yes, given interest rates now In answer to your question, there are some things going on behind this that we try to take into account One is that we have petroleum drilling, which gets wrapped up in these numbers, rising but not a lot because we think that market is going to be rather depressed given the oil price situation We do think that in many areas of the country a major collapse is underway in certain commercial and office building construction, and that is likely to be negative going into 1984 for some time In the past what has happened, however, is that equipment purchases have been the first to pick up and we have seen a good deal of that Now, early on, the [sales of] autos collapsed and they were [selling] at a discount And they get wrapped up in these numbers But office equipment, computer-related products, have been very strong So, that is the sustaining force early on But [our forecast] is conservative, I think, in the sense that most of the models say--and certainly the cyclical experience says--that we're running a little below what has happened in past cycles  Well, for one, it has something to do with monetary policy assumptions That's a place one might start It also has something to do, obviously, with our view that at the present time we have strong underlying demands for spending and credit and that the combination of those things, given our monetary policy assumption, will likely result in some upward drift [in rates] I noted before that these charts may give one the feeling that there is more movement here than is in fact in store, because some of it already has occurred The 1984 projection on interest rates comes out of a considered judgment and a great deal of thought and hope on our part But I'm not so sure I can say more than that What has influenced us, particularly on long rates, is the feeling that we are most likely to see a much better inflation performance than markets generally anticipate and that, as each month goes by and we see low rates of inflation, double digit long rates indeed will look pretty attractive so that there is room [for some decline] in 1984 In addition, we think the higher rate levels that have occurred now will lead to some maturing of the expansion and to some slowing and thus take a little of the pressure off of the credit markets But I would not wish to stake all of what we said this morning on the basis of these interest rate forecasts for that year That's a central area  Well, I could say something, but maybe Steve or Paul would want to comment on their interpretation of the markets in terms of what has happened in the very short run  Yes, we got it last evening I've had a lot to read in the last few days I'm not sure it quite says that I think what it says is that pure theory can't give you an answer--that one can construct alternative views of the world in which government deficits have no impact on interest rates or inflation It also says that under certain assumptions those are quite reasonable, but it does not come to any definitive conclusion and to some extent depends on rather extreme assumptions One critical one, for example--a hypothesis that has been floating around for some time--says interest rates are invariant no matter what level of deficit you have That proposition is simply that individuals see through this veil of government debt financing and know that in their lifetime or their children's lifetimes somebody will have to repay it, so they will simply increase their saving to exactly offset it--deficit saving  No, it's not  Well, I don't believe I have the individual cycle data with me No, I don't But as I remember, the rebate came early in the spring of 1975, so we would have had an actual budget deficit decline at that time but then economic activity continued to rise As I remember, the 1975 cycle does indeed approximate this upper line; it's below the black line for the median of previous cycles, but the first quarter into the cycle there is this plunge when we had the $50 rebate or whatever, and then it goes back on track-- that is, it's going toward a surplus  It's going down; you're correct  I think that's a relevant concern In addressing that, I think we have to ask ourselves the question ""Why did we miss over the last couple of quarters?"" Is it because we underestimated the effect of a change in interest rates and that the level is still biting? Is it just that we had some pent up demands and that a change in rates permitted some things to be accomplished, particularly in the housing market and consumer durables, but the level is still binding so that the effect of an interest rate decline wears out and we're going to find that the recovery slows rather sharply? That's the way we had thought about it We tried to put one foot on each side We think that probably we underestimated the restraining effect of the level and underestimated as well the effects of the rate of change So, for 1984 we have a smaller rate of increase in real GNP now than we did previously, but we have a higher level of activity because we have allowed 1983 to show through in terms of this higher level I would say that there is a serious question on that rate effect, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors, which is where I might tend to put the downside risks; housing is one of those On the other hand, there are a lot of things one can point to that could be potential offsets But if you begin to think in terms of changing attitudes, we now are entering a period after four very lean years in consumer spending and lots of other things It seems to me that there is the potential for substantial spending in a variety of sectors, particularly those that are less interest-sensitive  The staff has 8-1/4 percent [fourth quarter- to-fourth quarter]  No, we had an M2 that was about in the middle of that range to begin with  For M2 we have 8-1/2 percent, or in the 8 to 8-1/2 percent area for 1984  Well, I think the alternative ranges for M2 have [nearly] the same numbers, don't they? It's a matter of where you might place it in the range Perhaps I am not--  I'm sorry, yes  I'm sorry, Mr Chairman  I don't know about [CBO]; the Administration's nominal GNP is 97 percent for 1984  If you're looking at annual averages, I think he abstained  Everyone last year "
2377,1983-08-23," It was done taking the quarterly econometric model and keyed off what was the equivalent of the staff's forecast-- the one that we had prepared in July--and then taking a $50 billion expenditure cut We also did it with a $50 billion tax increase Essentially the starting point, the initial conditions, would be the July staff forecast  I think, unfortunately, that's right  One of the problems with these exercises is that they are all dependent on the structure of the model one is using Use a different model and get a different answer It also depends on initial conditions In our model it's a non-linear relationship so that we get a bigger bang for the buck as we get closer to potential or full capacity utilization    8/23/83  It has to do with the non-linear demand for money function, essentially The elasticity of money varies over time, and in that model as we get closer to capacity utilization, short-term rates would be rising substantially And if you take the heat off in absolute terms--and this is done absolutely, the number of basis points involved--short-term rates would drop more than they would otherwise  [Statement--see Appendix]    8/23/83  That's right The rates in the forecast are in Appendix I of the Bluebook We do have in there, for example, in the mortgage area about a percentage point reduction in rates from the fourth quarter of this year to the end of 1984 We have had this kind of pattern for a while We also have corporate bond rates drifting down It comes out of our forecast; it's sort of an iterative procedure But our major view is that inflation will still be quite mild and that indeed, with the slowing of nominal GNP growth that we foresee, we could have a little drifting down of short rates and still meet the Committee's targets and that the good inflation performance over time ought to show through in some reduction in long rates  That's right  Well, we have a decline in real rates implied because inflation this year and next year is about the same  Well, in large part  Maybe even when it's econometrically derived, it's an act of faith  Housing we have at 155 million units at an annual rate; that would be down from our guess of 165 million units for the current quarter, which entails some decline for August and September So, we have a further drop of 100,000 units in the fourth quarter For auto sales in the fourth quarter we're assuming 9-3/4 million units in total, of which domestic sales would be 74 million, and that's about where they've been running in the first half of this quarter to date We have domestic auto sales at this higher level but not rising further  I can't answer explicitly in terms of a number I don't know what the model has on that; I don't remember I do think that part of what we saw in the second quarter was a wealth effect, and that was important in the kind of forecast that we have It's hard to see stock prices zooming on up in the near term; that market has cooled a bit So, I would use that wealth effect argument as helping to explain the second quarter And that [effect] is weakening now, given what is happening in the market "
2405,1983-10-04," [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, we don't have a good answer to your question I would say that, from our point of view, interest rates are significantly higher now than they would be in the absence of a $200 billion average deficit on the part of the government So, in that sense, clearly there is some degree of crowding out You're quite correct in noting that what holds this forecast together in not seeing really bad things materializing early on in 1984 is a very    10/4/83  strong business picture That is, internal funds generation in the forecast is very strong; profits growth is very high And investment, while growing, simply doesn't match what we're seeing on the business side So, the combination really of the foreign sector--foreign inflows--plus business savings has been able to offset what would be more apparent crowding-out effects You're right that in the forecast we don't see at this point a collapse in housing [Housing demand] clearly is not growing much and it's lower than one might have expected otherwise Consumer borrowing, I might note, is very strong in this forecast Looking at this now, one of the problems, it seems to me, is that while we have reduced business borrowing--the negative financing gap--we have very strong consumer spending and consumer borrowing in this forecast  They've been coming down  Whatever you like  We thought we were going to cover some of these issues in depth in the spirit of trying to look at alternative views of the determination of wages and prices, as well as some of the issues that are debated among folks here as well as outside the Committee For example, does the speed of activity matter in determining inflation and a few other issues "
2432,1983-11-14," Well, it's also the case that where we have '85 and '86 based on a little over 1 percent real growth, the economy is really rather delicately balanced between small and no growth or declining output If you shorten the time horizon, the model is quite willing to cycle into recession It's not difficult to get the model to fall into the negative side for real output  But it is a very small effect  We didn't focus on that, but it's certainly mentioned  I think we've been very cautious in presenting the issues with respect to inflation expectations, and that's where one presumably has the channel of influence in terms of deficit actions feeding back on inflation expectations The model simply doesn't capture that I think Dave has stated that So, it's in the area of expectations that this model and most models are very weak and that offers something very positive in terms of potential outcome  One issue is the growth of productivity We have extrapolated--  Yes, we are  No That was not the intent The intent was to do this exercise and to look at what comes out and then recognize that, indeed, we're using a model that has some deficiencies All models do Outcomes can differ; they can be better or worse And we've tried to focus on those things that we felt could be important in reducing the costs or raising the costs from a baseline case So, it was really designed to be illustrative And then one can think about those things that over the longer run might cause the outcome to be better or worse  I might say it was at someone's request!  5-1/2 percent  No, that's right If we have low real growth, we would not have a very bullish outlook for corporate profits  I've never fully understood that approach I think that assumes, President Corrigan, that debt equals money  It assumes that Treasury bonds equal Ml, and it's just hard for me to relate those as one to one One can spend Treasury bonds as readily as currency, perhaps--  False courage!  I thought you were referring to expectations There's no feedback effect on price expectations from altering money growth  Well, it's a model that in effect--  You're talking about chart 15--the staff projection chart--not the experiment over 5 years And there we have assumed, I think, a 4-1/4 percent rate of growth in 1984  Yes, this says you can hold the inflation rate constant with essentially a little over 3 percent real growth in 1984 and a little under 3 percent in 1985  4-1/4 percent  Yes, [unintelligible] in the same ballpark because you are talking about roughly 1 percentage point That's the real growth, and we would have a higher price forecast for that  Well, in 1984 real growth would be in the area of 3 to 3-1/2 percent and in 1985 2-1/2 to 3 percent  That's right They're about offsetting If you get that 1 percent higher trend growth of productivity, then you could get the same inflation outcome that we have without cutting back on real growth  Well, there's no problem there  Which chart?  -26-    11/14-15/83  That's right  If you told me that the unemployment rate was going to be over 10 percent, I think we would have come out fairly optimistic I wouldn't say that our staff view on inflation has been much more optimistic generally than outside forecasts; outsiders beginning in 1982 have moved their forecasts down substantially relative to the staff forecast Now as we look ahead to '84 and what is happening in light of a lower unemployment rate, our staff forecast has been edging up So, I'm not so sure We wouldn't have had 4-1/2 percent inflation, but I'd say we would have had in the context of 10 percent plus unemployment rates, very strong improvement on price performance But we missed on that, as you well know  Yes, right  [Unintelligible] based on recent performance  I think that's right That shaded area is the area where there are some questions about the performance of the money stock relative to nominal spending and that was part of Steve's presentation last time And that's where the--  [Statement--see Appendix]  I don't think they're showing much In terms of industrial materials, prices have perked up a little recently There is still a good deal of weakness in a couple of markets such as copper and I guess silver and lead What has been changing is that the very rapid run-up in prices in futures markets that we had seen for grains has backed off a bit In fact, our projection of food prices next year would seem to be high now if you were to take what is going on in the futures markets as a likelihood So, I don't see a big problem there We are getting hints in some of the markets of a tightening in supplies, but it's not really dramatic at this moment  Yes, I think Mr Truman is doing that to us We tried to offset him; I must say I worked very hard but failed It has to do with oil imports and oil prices and the screwy way in which they enter the deflator  Apparently it is the mix of commodities that affects this, particularly on the imports side--the oil imports That may not be clear  They are subtracted out and it works the other way in the initial quarter  Well, it is in the process of change It's very clear In fact, we have raised our projected external needs for funds in the corporate sector especially in 1984 because we've raised our forecast of business fixed investment Unfortunately, I have a flow-of-funds table here that has about 50 pages and a million numbers and I can't find the line I'm looking for  The negative that we have in this forecast in the financing gap, as noted, ran through the first three quarters of the year, and we have a financing gap of around $17 billion in the fourth quarter So, our expectation is that this quarter will be the first one where the financing gap has swung from a negative to a positive and it rises further throughout 1984  Yes, as long as you recognize the volatility and the substantial revisions in those numbers that half-year patterns--  If you want the full display, we can certainly do that  Well, we'll put Mr Truman on the spot I think one of the areas of potential weakness is on the foreign side Obviously, as the dollar continues to be very high, it raises questions about performance on the foreign side That's one area of [potential] weakness Another may well be in residential construction activity We've seen fluky numbers there--shooting up in August and dropping back in September Our view is that that's about the bottom, but that's not necessarily clear It could easily go a bit weaker Another is this dramatic increase in business fixed investment, which has shown up in terms of orders and shipments in the durable equipment area And we've had a lot of gyration on the building side in nonresidential construction There were deep declines in commercial construction in the spring and then big increases in the summer, and it's hard to read those numbers It may well be that there's not as much happening on the structure side of business fixed investment, and that would turn our forecast weaker I would note particularly that we continue to get very bearish reports in office construction; the numbers are still quite weak We have built in here a flattening out of that--very little growth next year But it may well be, given the dramatic increase in vacancy rates in many areas across the country, that office building construction is winding down and will go more deeply negative So, in the investment area and in residential structures and the foreign sector I think there are potential negatives  No, that's right It's in the 5 percent area which, as you know, is very low And we have perceived that to be a constraint on consumer spending next year  Yes  Well, they're a few basis points higher; they are a little higher than the forecast we had used last time, but it's a quarter of a point or so--nothing dramatic  You mean in the fourth and first quarters--in my answer to the Chairman?  No, I didn't sprinkle that in If you were to talk about a significant rise in rates, which we have not built into this forecast, again, it seems to me that certainly the residential structures area could be hit early on But it would have to be much more than we have built into the forecast to alter the picture in the very near term I think it would have a longer-run implication  In the index, I might note, I'm told there was a dramatic increase in October The numbers were just released; it's up about 50 percent or something like that The index level goes from 13 to 19 or something like that It was 100 in 1967, so it's operating at 87 percent below where it was in 1967  Well, that's a very murky area, as you know Our concern at the moment runs in the direction that capacity utilization appears to be rising more rapidly, given growth in the economy, than it did in previous cycles But there are some factors that clearly could affect that One is that we apparently do have substantial additions [being made] to business equipment at the moment, which would presumably add something to capacity growth We're uncertain about how to measure recent capacity growth and, indeed, some of the facilities that were removed from the capital stock or allegedly closed down may come back on stream depending on what happens to the economy So, it may be that the numbers [projected for] a year from now or two years from now are not as tight as they look But for now I would very much agree that it appears that the risk is on the side of capital shortages rather than labor shortages  No, I should have mentioned that That clearly is very important in our thinking about all of this and about the price pressures that might stem from rising capacity utilization I would say that it's particularly important in the context of a very sluggish current and prospective recovery abroad So, there appears to be in many key areas ample world-wide capacity  -41-    11/14-15/83  Well, I think in the shorter run we will probably be talking about higher unemployment rates It's conceivable that in the short run it means that businesses would not be adding as much to payrolls as we have projected in this current forecast So, we would expect that to give us perhaps a bit higher unemployment rate in the shorter-run context--that is, the demands for labor would be weaker  Yes  I think overall it's a small decline in output, but there really is a bad mix problem in terms of some components rising and others declining substantially "
2463,1983-12-19," [Statement--see Appendix]  In 1972 dollars the inventory/sales ratio was around 303 or 304 and it stays flat throughout 1984 So, in real terms it is unchanged  You're looking at book [values]  -27-    12/19-20/83  On Mr Corrigan's point, we don't have a chart here We have all sorts of numbers but he has the chart We do have very clearly, though, a situation where we assume that unit labor costs in 1983 are rising about 1 percent and our deflator forecast is something like a 4-1/4 percent increase So, it's a very wide spread It shows up in corporate profits, and corporate profits in this cycle --for the first four quarters of the recovery, assuming our fourth- quarter forecast is correct--have risen more than in any other postwar cycle They are close to the increase in 1975, but are substantially above the cyclical performance for the first year of a recovery Two comments with regard to that spread--  Correct  Well, it's up because the profit share and notional margins have been rising We think it will be at the highest level at the end of this year since 1977-78--a six-year high So, it has done very well as a share or absolutely Two particular comments First, going back to the staff's inflation presentation, we believe that corporations essentially price off some notion of unit labor cost and a markup over that In effect, what they're doing is looking at some notion of trend growth in productivity; and trend growth in  -30-    12/19-20/83  productivity, we think, is better than they may be using So, it is showing up here in terms of attempts to price fairly aggressively and they're getting more profits than they might otherwise think My second point is a technical comment In measuring the GNP deflator, as you know, import prices are subtracted out in the short run In the first half of this year import prices actually declined and were about unchanged in the third quarter, so that for much of this year we think that substraction process has artificially raised the GNP deflator because the benefits of those import prices measured in consumption, investment, or whatever, come along with a lag So, our story is that this has been an unusual year  Well, it's higher than the deflator but there are different weights and other things going on Obviously, service prices, for example, are very important We suspect that 1984 will be a year that returns much more to normal in the sense that our forecast has unit labor costs and the deflator rising about the same amount, so that the gap we're seeing now we think will evaporate  Well, if we go back to the notion that some sense of normalcy is restored, which I think is happening here-- profits have been very weak for the last 3 or 4 years--and if indeed productivity is improving, I think it all depends ultimately on the context of the market situation that we have In our forecast, markets generally will not be so tight as to allow corporations to pass aggressively through whatever price increases they might want There is restraint both domestically and from the import side So, I think on profits you're right Ultimately, how it works out will depend in part on how this economy evolves in 1984  Okay, in detail  Yes In November, housing starts rose 100,000 to 1-3/4 quarter million units, annual rate, from an upward revised level in October Both single-family and multifamily starts rose in all regions in the country, mostly in the West Permits also rose a little and the permits for October were revised up a little as well  We should get the CPI tomorrow as well [as the GNP flash]  We do get the employment surveys on January 6, which is the first Friday "
2488,1984-01-30," We're talking about the CPI, not the deflator, in our forecast  Yes The CPI in our forecast runs a good deal above the deflator So, in part, what we're looking at is the difference between the measures of GNP prices versus the measures of consumer prices I think that's the bulk of it Our CPI forecast for 1984, for example, is around 5-1/4 percent, which is 6 to 7 more than the deflator But you're right A good deal of the impact of the dollar does show through; it's not a minor feature We are of the mind that, indeed, 1984 unemployment rates are still high enough to be exerting some degree of downward pressure on wages and compensation domestically Aside from the dollar problem, we think there is downward pressure, but it erodes over time And by the end of 1985 the downward pressure on the wage side is virtually nonexistent in the sense that we think an unemployment rate of 7 percent is near the top end of what is ""full employment""  We have some small changes but nothing of major size  No We think it's there now in a variety of ways, one of which is that interest rates tend to be higher than one might otherwise--  Well, as we go on we do not have in this forecast any growth in housing; it begins to taper off in 1985 Second, we have a slowing in the rate of increase of durable consumer purchases, which we think are credit sensitive So, that is slowing and business fixed investment itself is slowing over time, and a related factor is the massive current account deficit that we have So in a variety of ways it's sprinkled throughout the projection  That's right  We think that all of this is integrated; we try to focus on what interest rates are consistent with a given monetary policy But I must say that I've been humbled over the years in forecasting interest rates--other things as well, but interest rates in particular So, we think it is consistent but I would not be prepared to live or die by this mortgage rate forecast One of the issues, of course, is whether the pressures build up sufficiently so that we get far away from the kind of picture we have forecast, which is one of moderating growth, inflation picking up, and interest rates tending to rise, but we don't hit a point where things really take off or the economy collapses because of pressures That is one of the issues, it seems to me It's not so much a near-term issue, but as one looks ahead in this forecast there are things that are out of whack--one is the deficit and another is the international side And one could easily think of an alternative view in which those pressures build much more substantially and are reflected in events, perhaps not in 1984 but in 1985  5 percent in the first quarter and 4-1/2 percent in the second quarter  5-1/2 percent in the third and 8 percent in the fourth  10-1/2 percent  We have 10 percent on GNP  The housing starts?  That I don't know "
2515,1984-03-26," I believe it goes out on Thursday morning  Thursday morning  We didn't try to leave any doubts in that document  I think there is some concern When you go through these with a little time lag, it's pretty difficult to spot a whole series of things that are a potential problem They come up in Ted's area particularly On the domestic side, in the past there have been occasions when the monetary data we had were not for the full month and we put in rates of growth for the full month Or we have put in our corporate bond and stock markets forecasts of various things going out several months With time, I think the sensitivity declines I do remember for many years I was assigned the unpleasant chore of writing the Quarterly Report for Mr Proxmire's Joint Economic Committee and that report was very different from the Greenbook It supposedly said the same thing--it was on current financial conditions--but it was quite a different animal When you write something you have in mind the nature of the audience and it makes you more sensitive  Well, I'm not adverse to that And if I have to do this, I would like to get some double mileage out of it For example, we can get some bulletin articles out of doing that and save some staff time to do something else If we put a public document out but beef up Part I in a selected way to cover other things, it's conceivable that the Committee might be better off with a different Part I and a Part II that we use [as a public document]  [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, maybe you should leave out '85 and let the time horizon be a bit fuzzier I think it's very hard in an environment where rates are not regulated to pinpoint the time at which it all will explode But I think our forecast really has in it those sorts of pressures building In part, the impact of the deficit is showing up even now in our view, and it has been for some time, in terms of the current level of interest rates And it shows up in the export sector where in a sense exports are being crowded out via the foreign exchange value of the dollar You are right that this forecast still has growth sustained in '85 In part, you're really looking at continuing fiscal stimulus pushing up incomes We do have housing as rather the weak sector As you mentioned, it doesn't collapse but it doesn't grow Autos we have growing Business fixed investment, which we have growing quite a lot in '84, slows a bit in '85; but it certainly doesn't go downhill I guess my concern with the deficit is not so much the crowding out argument in a given period of time but that we are looking at a structure that over time is not desirable As a part of this process, business fixed investment is going to be a smaller part of GNP over the longer run than it otherwise would have been and interest rates are going to be higher and the interest sensitive sectors are going to get squeezed Pinpointing it, I think, is a problem I might note too that in '85 we do have built into this forecast a very small cut in the deficit; it's about a $20 billion dollar package But if you envision that as part of something that would be going on in '86 and '87, presumably you would have beneficial effects in '85  Well, I have difficulty answering that question I really have difficulty answering the housing question because I think there are some very funny things going on Dallas may be one part of it but the funny things are more widespread, with adjustable rate mortgages and institutions quite willing today to offer discounts I have a concern that as interest rates rise we may indeed find that housing will change more than we have forecast In part, as we get into '85 all these neat things such as discounted mortgages for the first year will be at an end That first year will have ended and, depending on rate levels, we may find lots of pressures in '85 that we have not been able to readily define But I suspect the housing number, if anything, is on the high side rather than the low side  -42-    3/26-27/84  For the first quarter it is 10 percent  It excludes government but it includes inventory investment and it allows for an adjustment of this PIK distortion  Right  -55-    3/26-27/84  I saw the 2 percent number but--  We have 6 percent for Q2 Are you talking about the second quarter?  -61-    3/26-27/84  Well, I don't view that as inconceivable at all We struggled with this whole issue There are some technical reasons that the number could readily come out below 6 percent and there are some rather substantive reasons that it could come out below 6 percent My personal view is that 6 percent is a good number If it's wrong--and I'm assuming that interest rates don't decline in this environment but perhaps are where they are now or rise a bit--I think the odds favor a smaller number than 6 percent One example is in the auto area where we have production levels that we think are sensible But GM is closing several plants At the moment the way the Commerce Department is going to measure the numbers, they are not inclined to change the seasonals; and if they don't do that, we're going to find auto production declining substantially That's a technical reason but it shows up in the numbers There are a number of cases where some of the retail sales may well have come early in the year due to weather effects and we may be facing a situation where the economy is not that strong So, I feel very comfortable with the 6 percent number; but if I were to bet that it's not 6 percent for the second quarter alone, I would bet on a little lower number  Well, I think housing is the other area Those housing numbers may well be in the process of change as well We have seen a half point increase in the VA rate with the general, even mild, rise in interest rates It seems to me that some of the attitudes in the housing industry may change and take a little of the edge off what was really an extraordinary increase in residential expenditures in the first quarter I do feel comfortable looking for a very strong number for the full year, but your question was really on Q2 and my assessment of what the odds would be  Perhaps some, but we do have inventory increases in this forecast "
2543,1984-05-21," [Statement--see Appendix]  Yes The CPIW went up 02 percent in April and, as I mentioned, the all urban went up 05 percent Virtually all of that difference is indeed attributable to the different treatment of housing  Yes  Actually, in the last 3 months the compounded annual rate on the old basis is 13 percent and on the new basis it's 43 percent "
2568,1984-07-16," Are you looking at the first chart in Mike's presentation?  Not beyond the Deficit Reduction Act, which is on the President's desk and is estimated to be about $15 billion of actions for 1985 It is expected that he will sign that and we assume that an additional $10 billion will come out of further actions in the Congress, particularly in the area of the accommodation between the Administration and the Congress on defense expenditures But our projection doesn't go beyond this $25 billion area that most folks currently are talking about If we had something major occurring in 1985, that is not captured  The personal income tax rates? That was not touched by this Deficit Reduction Act and is scheduled to take effect January 1, 1985 We estimate that to be worth about $5 billion Assuming that our price forecast of about a 4 percent rise is right, that would translate into a revenue loss for 1985 of about $5 billion  That's correct They grow over time  Yes Let me talk a little about this I have been asking similar questions and probably have been living with these ""models"" more than Jerry Essentially what we're talking about is, starting in 1980 and going forward, trying to explain or decompose actual productivity growth into a cyclical component and its long-term trend component In the preceding period of the '70s, about 06 percent is the estimated trend growth of productivity Now, a 11 percent--or with the revised data I think it's 1-1/4 percent-- increase in trend productivity growth is very close [to the experience] quarter by quarter from 1980 through the second quarter of 1984 So, in a sense, that explains it; it does very well with that trend and a few other variables in decomposing the two components So what we have to be looking for is [something] saying that this can't explain the total productivity growth, and we haven't really found that yet I might say that the last four quarters changed a tenth from 11 to 12 percent, so it may well be that future observations will suggest that we're far off But we're somewhat hesitant at the    7/16-17/84  moment because in fact we've done very well for the last three years If a change is coming, it's really in the future It's not in our reading of the past There are other folks--productivity experts on the outside--who in looking at the past would argue the same But there are many issues that suggest productivity trends may be in the process of change; that has not yet shown through and we would be the first to admit that  Well, you'd get the same sort of analysis, which comes up with trend productivity growth at 2-1/2 to 3 percent, depending upon the time period you pick You mentioned the 3 percent number in the future That really was [true], for example, for the period of the '50s and the first half of the '60s Later on, and after the oil shock in particular, is when we found the dismal productivity growth So, if we return to that--  Well, that's important We do that exercise I don't have the disaggregation in our [material here] But it's very clear that the feedback effects from low rates of inflation and low COLAS do track into lower rates of wage increase We do have that number, and maybe while I mumble here Jerry can find it  Well, that's correct--in our forecast  That's right  We don't have the COLA separately I apologize But that is important and, in any event, it does reverse  Bureau of National Affairs  -27-    7/16-17/84  12 percent  In the forecast we have assumed M1 at around 7-1/2 percent and for 1985 we have 5-1/2 to 6 percent for M1 We're  -48-    7/16-17/84  talking about something close to the midpoints of these ranges, in any event So, I don't see anything significantly different than in the staff forecast  Yes, we had that in the forecast That's right  Correct  Correct "
2596,1984-08-21," [Statement--see Appendix]  We now have unit labor costs rising in 1984 at about 2-1/2 percent and for 1985 we have them up in the neighborhood of 4-3/4 percent It's a substantial rise, in part because compensation is rising and in part because we have smaller gains in our forecast for productivity So, we get a substantial rise in unit labor costs, but from a level in 1984 that is quite moderate With respect to the dollar, you are quite correct that we have the adverse effects there but they really show up very late in the year As time has gone on, in fact, two things have happened One is that Ted keeps    8/21/84  saying the dollar in our forecast should come down 15 percent The thing we don't talk about is from what level; and the level always is higher in the short run So, in part what we're dealing with is more favorable prices from the dollar occurring early on in 1985; it's really in late 1985 that the adverse [dollar] effect occurs  First of all, I would say that given the margin of error I view our real side forecast as not significantly different from what we had before But you're quite correct that to the extent we made changes over the 6-quarter period they are up-- especially for 1985, where it's a quarter point or so higher On the inflation side, I'd mention several things One is very important food prices Indeed, we now have a food price increase of about 5 percent projected for this year and next That had been in the range of 6-1/2 percent and earlier it was up to 7-1/2 percent That's a big number in terms of the overall price picture There we think we just missed; it may show up later but frankly we've held onto that forecast in making downward revisions along the way But, again, it's very important The dollar we have talked about In the very near term there is energy; we had gasoline prices dropping at something like a seasonally adjusted 12 percent annual rate in the third quarter That has lagged in the PPI; we haven't really seen much of that in the PPI and it should be showing up When we get the CPI it ought to be showing up soon; so, in the very near term, we think energy markets are quite weak We have noted that also spilling over into coal and natural gas prices The only thing that seems to be happening is that    8/21/84  electricity rates are going up But that's important for us in the shorter run More so, I'd say, is our assumption on oil prices which is that in fact they will be drifting down a little in real terms So, we have taken a more optimistic view on some of those things I would also note that on the wage side, the numbers that came in on the GNP revision over the last 3 years tended, especially in 1983, to revise down rates of increase in compensation Part of it is on the benefit side but as more information became available, compensation increases in the past now look different--that is, lower and more favorable On the wage data, we had been expecting fairly good numbers and they were better than we thought The employment cost index now is running at 4 percent over the first half of the year It's down more than a percentage point from 1983 The contracts that have been settled to date so far this year are averaging a 38 percent increase for the first year Basically, we sat down and looked at a broad range of information from many different sources and concluded that it would be prudent to knock some tenths off of various things, which we did And it added up to a more favorable picture  Here comes the bad news It was revised up to 41 percent; the preliminary number had been 33 percent I would say that that is of virtually no concern because nearly all of it occurred in the residential structures component The Commerce Department now says that prices associated with the residential construction area rose at an 11-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter At this point, much of that is really fiction as much as fact They don't have very much information  Well, keep in mind that there was something like a 2 percent increase, I believe, in the first quarter They reported a 5-1/2 percent increase initially in the second quarter and now they have 11-1/2 percent If history rings true, they could have zero or minus 3 percent for the third quarter That number really just flips about So, it's not in an area that we think is a real problem, but it was revised up  I don't know At this point they really do have limited information and they have a great deal of trouble with mix problems We have been getting a lot of increase in multifamily construction and they may well end up revising that away later on  Because we think that we've overshot trend The way these things are done, in looking back at history one would assume that over time we would get down to a trend rate of growth Our view is that in 1984 we're dealing with trend growth of productivity of around 1-1/4 percent That's subject to debate, but that's the number we used We're getting more than that and we expect we will slowly be approaching trend, so that in 1985 we fall below 1-1/4 percent  That's right We're at 825 percent now and that is our view It moves up a little but we are assuming that capacity growth is increasing perhaps at a 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate now and we have growth of output slowing, so that our number at an endpoint is around 84-1/2 percent So, our view would be consistent  [It depends on] what you are talking about If you talk about the auto sector in total, it's a little more than 2 percentage points difference from Q1 to Q2 If you go through the exercise of saying ""If GM had behaved as the rest of the industry,"" then it's around a percentage point or a little more that it reduced [GNP] in the second quarter and it adds about a little more than a percentage point in the third quarter So, there are [different] questions and different numbers But we have a little more than a percentage point on that basis    8/21/84  I don't know the answer It is the case that when you're talking about these numbers of 6 percent or so that those are associated with the COLA I know that the COLA requirements that they get are less generous than what they used to get They used to get something close to 90-95 percent, but I don't know what the number is [currently]  -20-    8/21/84  He came up with a little over 3 percent in the first year on the collective agreements "
2621,1984-10-02," [Statement--see Appendix]  I think I said ""appears"" or ""the staff believes""  Yes I would say two things were going on, though One is that the information that we had at the time of the August meeting generally is weaker today with data revisions When we had the August meeting, retail sales in July were reported to be down 09 percent With the revised data, they are now reported to be down 2 percent So, it is true that new information available for August has been weaker, but I'd say the past also looks weaker for consumption, residential construction, business-fixed investment, as well as for the merchandise trade area It has been very broadly based I think my briefing did not avoid the issue  I just received it The house sales data were revised down for July, and August looks quite a bit weaker  It's dated as of yesterday They are tabulating the October survey The first reading for 1985 will be available late in October They have a little under half of the respondents in and the total is running around an 8 percent increase in nominal terms, which is substantially weaker than the staff forecast The survey is [still] fragmentary; we don't know how to make a lot of sense out of it, but it is indeed a weak number  There are many A classic case is 1976 where we had a slowdown, particularly in consumer spending, and it looked at the time as if the economy were perhaps falling apart But it was really just one of these pauses that subsequently led to very sharp growth I have an answer to your question from the model We have all sorts of things in the model, and the probability of negative GNP growth occurring in the fourth quarter of 1984 according to the Board's econometric model is 25 percent  It is 25 percent That probability has been rising because of the factors you've been citing  Zero or negative "
2645,1984-11-07," [Statement--see Appendix]    11/7/84  We said more rapidly in October than in September  That's true The gains in employment in October were rather spectacular; it's the highest increase in over a year I think that's unsustainable It looks a little odd  To start out I mentioned conflicting signs, and that indeed is one of them Initial claims for unemployment insurance have been edging higher, including those for the week after the labor market reports were taken We are estimating, as I noted, that industrial production was up about a quarter of a percent in October and that's better than a 06 percent decline But the October level of production is still below what we saw in the summer There are many what I would view as conflicting indicators of what is happening  The bulk of it I think industrial production is related [more] to the manufacturing employment But for some reason, people are going out and hiring lots of new employees in services and trades  There is a probability of negative growth in the fourth quarter of 19 percent  This comes out of the econometric model exercises we performed The model said 19 percent for the fourth quarter and 15 percent for the first quarter; then it drifts in the range of 25 or 30 percent, let's say, in the latter part of 1985  No  Two consecutive quarters is very low--1 to 2 percent  Correct  It was, but the near term--  24-    11/7/84  Next Wednesday we will get the retail sales  No We have personal income on November 19th; housing starts on the 20th; revised GNP figures on the 20th; and durable goods orders on the 21st, which will be the following week "
2671,1984-12-17," Well, with my usual confidence I will plunge ahead [Statement--see Appendix]  I think the risks on inflation have been changing to the more favorable side as time has gone on In fact, there are many people--at least on the Research Division staff here-- who would like to argue the case for lower rates of inflation in 1985 than in 1984 In particular, the profit margin is extraordinarily high and rather difficult to explain Virtually all the models and past behavior would suggest a lower profit margin than has been in place for some time If that profit margin were to begin to erode a bit, one could very readily take a posture of lower rates of inflation In the shorter run the risks on the energy side--and Ted and I talked a little about this on the oil side--seem to be down rather than up as well So, I would tilt the inflation side down a  -24-    12/17-18/84  bit leaving real activity alone On real activity I think the risks are fairly well balanced We have quite a moderate picture, really In thinking about real investment, in particular, this year we're expecting close to a 15 percent annual rate of increase in business fixed investment We have 6 percent for next year That's consistent with the Merrill-Lynch and McGraw-Hill surveys and it's consistent with the orders [figures] Who knows what the tax proposals will do? They can cut either way But essentially it's quite a moderate picture at the moment, and I think the risks there are reasonably well balanced up and down I would take the same view on the consumer sector, although in the very short run it is confusing to us So, I think the real side risks are fairly well balanced  Well, they came back very strongly And, as you know, profits as a percent of GNP are at very high levels in an historical perspective and they've stayed there It's quite clear that there are many industries suffering substantially, but I think there is a severe distribution problem; it depends upon the nature of the industry and the degree to which it's subject to the import competition I would only say that when you look at the aggregate numbers relative to GNP and other more narrow measures of profit margins they are really quite strong  Yes What we don't see, however, in our own forecast is very much growth from here on out So, I think what may have been happening is that there was this surge in profits in '83 and that has tapered off in '84 We think especially in the latter half we may be seeing some sick profit numbers And next year in the staff's forecast, given the rate of growth of the real economy and prices, we have virtually no growth in profits So, I think, one of the problems here is what businessmen are thinking about--continued very strong growth or maintenance of a high level  Correct  No, we're agnostic in the forecast We haven't taken a position If you believed something were going to happen along the lines of the Administration's proposal, I think there would be an incentive to accelerate equipment purchases to get the favorable depreciation and the tax credit It's a bit risky on the structures side If you were into a standard tax shelter partnership trying to turn over commercial buildings, I don't know that you'd want to touch that at all Basically, it can cut either way I would say the overriding feature is a healthy dose of uncertainty And that is rather unhealthy in this environment There is a lot of uncertainty  That's what the Administration has said that there would be liberal transition rules Their own numbers, at least [based on] talking to them, [suggest] that in the aggregate their proposals would raise the cost of capital about 10 to 12 percent over the life of an investment So, it's a substantial potential change  I don't know that we have a good feel for that There are some scattered [signs] but it's very hard to break out of current starts figures  Well, it is very confusing For example, I believe the Administration's proposal is that [a taxpayer] couldn't deduct more than $5,000 above investment income for interest charges on something other than a primary residence What that really does is to induce people to take out big loans on their primary residence And there are other incentives in terms of tax-adjusted returns, but the proposal doesn't adjust the interest paid on a primary residence In effect, that gives a primary residence preferential treatment and will build in incentives to leverage highly that part of the market  Which way is the dollar going? If it goes up, it would be applying more restraint on the domestic economy And that's one of the features of our forecast; we've knocked a few tenths off our forecast because we have been assuming in our recent forecast a higher value of the dollar [than we had earlier] So, in effect, it is draining off income abroad It's a depressing influence on the domestic economy I think, Ted, that the assumption in this forecast is about an 8 percent decline in the value of the dollar over the course of 1985 from current levels Now, if it were to go down much more than that, we'd be talking about lessened restraint on real activity and a better export picture than we're now talking about  With a smile, housing starts are virtually unchanged, staying at the depressed October level of 153 million units Permits rose about 11 percent, however Personal income is reported to have been up 07 percent in November following a downward revised 04 percent increase in October At the same time, personal consumption expenditures on this release, which will go into the flash numbers of the Commerce Department, on their calculation rose 09 percent in November following a 02 percent decline in October  Right They were 1570, I believe "
2711,1985-02-12," That is correct--for 1985  I think the relationship is quite closely connected I would say also, in response to Governor Wallich, that our general view in looking at the price situation is that one would take some standard measure of productivity and, in a sense, assume a markup by corporations over some standard unit labor cost measure--so that the cyclical gains that you get early on are rather quickly translated into additional profits But this rise that we see in unit labor costs we would not translate immediately into an attempt by corporations to add on to that; rather, they would be taking a longer- term view  That's right  Lower than if they priced higher We had more inflation with the same unit labor cost We also had more profit, but we have to stick that income somewhere  We have alleged for years that we have a modal forecast I would say that it's very difficult, but basically, if we use the model and try to come out with confidence intervals, the model comes out with substantially lower rates of inflation In fact, if you put a 70 percent confidence interval around our deflator estimate, a couple of times we drift out of that range on the high side So with the same policy assumptions for 1985, the model forecast, for whatever it's worth, is a rate of increase in the deflator one percentage point less than in the staff forecast I view that information as saying that the risks tend to be skewed on the down side We think 3-1/2 percent is the most likely outcome; but if we're wrong, I'd say we're probably too high rather than too low  Ted, I don't know if we can run one with the exchange rate unchanged You have some numbers on that there We do run one that has a fiscal assumption of no fiscal action at all, so that would add $50 billion dollars, essentially, to outlays $40 billion in outlays and $10 billion of less taxes In 1986, which is the relevant year because we assume these fiscal actions take effect in 1986 and beyond, we get something like 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent higher real GNP--in the neighborhood of 4 percent or a little higher The deflator in 1986 is only up a tenth or two but the momentum builds as you get into 1987 and beyond Short-term interest rates in that scenario are about a percentage point higher in 1986 than those in the staff forecast  830 am tomorrow  And that's 2 percentage points less than a year ago  It was 136 percent in 1984  Let me make one comment on the Federal side I was looking at the numbers back in the 1975 through 1978 period; in 1978 Federal debt was growing at under 10 percent--more like 9 percent This time, in 1985, we are still facing 15 percent rates of increase We have come down from 19 percent to 17-1/2 percent to 15 percent Those are very large numbers to deal with and see the total decline  We have the advance retail sales number for January, which is that total sales are up 3/4 of a percent But there were downward revisions for both November and December The group, the so-called retail control--excluding autos and gasoline stations and nonconsumer sorts of things--was down 04 percent in January More importantly, December was revised down to minus 02 percent; it had been plus 06 percent And there was also a downward revision in November Basically, the staff had assumed monthly increases of around 05 percent in the first quarter That would have put the January level of this so-called retail control about 15 percent above the fourth-quarter average Taking these numbers as they now stand, January is 01 of a percent below the fourth-quarter average So, these numbers are appreciably weaker Who knows what they will be 3 or 4 months from now when they're revised? But this is certainly not a bullish report  Yes For total sales they had been showing a 20 percent increase; it's now 15 percent  For this retail control, it was up 16 percent and it's now up 13 percent  Correct  I think we have 4-3/4 to 5 percent for food prices in the first quarter Our CPI projection, let's see--  We are expecting a CPI of 3-1/2 to 4 percent in the first quarter Offsetting the food price rise is an expected price decline in energy of 4 percent  How much of a rise in food? Food prices rose 2-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter and we have them up to 4-3/4 percent, so that's a 2 percentage point increase Energy prices were  -63-    2/12-13/85  about flat--up a percent--and we have them down 4 percent, so they ought to be offsetting factors in the first quarter  Conceptually, yes They expanded the models some years ago and I used to know that and I don't remember But yes, conceptually  I have somebody on the staff who could give you the [specifics] in all sorts of ways, but I'm not the person "
2737,1985-03-26," [Statement--see Appendix]  I'll get around to that In terms of the price side, for the fixed-weight measure we have 31 percent and they have 33 percent, so we're off by two-tenths All of this is attributable to shifting weights--and Mr Truman's area is part of the problem because it's a quirky thing having to do with oil imports being subtracted out on the import side We imported less oil and there is no offset showing up in inventories So, whether or not it is entirely statistical like that-- It may indeed be revised away  -14-    3/26/85  If not, we would anticipate that the following quarter we could be surprised with a more favorable outcome  No You mean in terms of the current quarter, right? I think basically what is happening is that they have taken something out in one place and they don't see it appearing in another place When all is said and done, it may well be that we will get lower nominal and somewhat lower prices  Correct Well, we have a real number that's higher than their 21 percent, so that's open to question--whether it will get revised up or whether we are wrong "
2783,1985-07-09," Do you want two opposing answers? If Mike answers, you'll hear something very different from what you will hear from me I would be concerned about it Mike and a number of other people are less concerned about it It has been a topic of great debate among the staff looking at this At least two things are a bit different now, allegedly One is that a portion of the increase is associated with a supposedly growing use of credit cards for convenience purposes; those balances get built into the numbers but, indeed, are paid off monthly and are presumed not to be a problem-- just a shift in means of payment The second argument is that the outstandings were so depressed in 1980, 1981, and 1982 that,    7/9-10/85  basically, repayments have been lagging And if that view is correct, with the strong debt taken on in 1983-84 and so far this year, repayments ought to be rising and, therefore, we ought to be seeing very limited further growth If you go back historically, I think it's hard to isolate that factor as one element, but it did peak in late 1978 or early 1979 and things got worse from there on But lots of things were going on in that period of time I would say that there are really differing views on this whole issue--certainly among the staff  It is 3 percent in 1985 and 9 percent in 1986  In this forecast, if you were to exclude energy prices, for example--there are some lags in this--in 1986 you would get a fixed-weight price index that would rise three-tenths faster So what we have built in amounts to about a quarter of a percent or more impact on prices in the GNP accounting sense  Right  Well, we have not made an explicit assumption in terms of passage of a tax reform proposal We tried to capture as best we could in a variety of sectors the expectational effects that might be there Our sense is that in the business fixed investment area--and this certainly is supported by the results of the Reserve Banks' poll of corporate executives--they are probably offsetting There is some incentive for firms perhaps to speed up their plans in the hopes of being grandfathered, given existing depreciation rules On the other side, the general issue of uncertainty about a change in depreciation laws might well hold some back So, net, we don't think much is going on there In housing we have a sense that the Administration's proposal is on balance a negative feature and that it is probably not a large issue in the short term I would think on average uncertainty about changing taxes is probably a small negative  It is very clear that there has been a downward trend in capacity utilization and that would continue in this forecast Basically, it reflects the strains that are being placed upon manufacturing and mining; there firms have been working aggressively to cut costs and we have been seeing declines in employment Employment is down almost one-quarter million over the last six months in the manufacturing sector As you know, we have continued to see further growth in service employment Put together, we have an unemployment rate that has been stuck for virtually the last year at 7-1/4 percent Now, we think that 7-1/4 percent is high enough to continue to exert some downward influence on price increases and we think that would persist over the projection horizon I think it is the case that industrial prices are being constrained in part by import competition in many areas where firms are experiencing pressure If they had the opportunity and felt they could get away with it and not lose market share, they would try to push some price increases through But they can't And I don't think in this projection horizon that that will change very much So, both capacity utilization and the aggregate unemployment rate seem to me to be at levels that would be exerting some downward pressures on price increases  Governor Partee, the scale is on the left It's the red line and the red scale, so it's about 15 percent  In February, yes  We are assuming interest rates are about flat at current levels That's the current assumption  Well, the whole national income accounts structure will be revised in a major way in December The last major one of this significance was in 1975  And they will be rebasing the deflators to 1982 instead of 1972 dollars That will make major changes One area where they are struggling, of course, is in the computer area where for the last decade they held the price at $100 and the assumption is that the right price is something like one-fifth of that But when they rebase, a lot of these things will disappear There is a hint that they'll probably find more output along the way There have been some upward revisions to income The IRS has had a program trying to track down income growth and it appears that the numbers that IRS has come up with are much higher than incorporated in the national income accounts So it appears at the moment that there will be some upward revisions to income in this set of revisions coming out But it's going to be so major, any of the numbers you now remember will disappear as a result of the base changes and other things  The first preliminary? It comes out July 18th, a week from tomorrow  Allen Young  Mr Chairman, the Board is scheduled to review drafts of this Humphrey-Hawkins report on Friday morning, so if there are revisions to projections we really would need them by tomorrow evening  SPEAKER(?) Here's one  Thank you  END OF MEETING  -78-     "
2808,1985-08-20," [Statement--see Appendix]  That is right Was that a question to me or to Ted?  Well, there are two parts that really are important We have very clearly much slower growth in final sales; instead of numbers in the 5 percent area, we are talking about numbers much less than that--something in the 2-1/2 percent area So we are talking about a substantial slowing What is going to happen in this environment for us to get 3 percent growth is essentially that inventories are not negative--that they are basically a small contributor--and that the deterioration in the trade balance comes to a halt pretty quickly Ted, maybe you want to talk a little about some of those numbers Maybe not!  As you know, in the office building area, we have been anticipating for a long time that it would slow down That was the domestic [equivalent of the] exchange value of the dollar; it kept rising and we said it was supposed to go down It has been going down now If you look at construction put in place as well as contracts, as you noted, and permits, the whole ball of wax suggests that that indeed is slowing Now, it slows rather slowly because of the fact that there is a long construction lead time So it is not something that we think will collapse The problem in that area is    8/20/85  that other indicators of activity--even in industrial buildings, public utilities and so forth--give us a sense that basically it has been weakening So, in this forecast we have small declines; they could be larger depending on the assumptions one wants to make But throughout the forecast period we have some small declines Now, I would note that some of these data are very volatile; we have been caught before where the numbers go down for two or three months and they snap back But I think that the fundamentals in vacancy rates and other things would argue now that perhaps we are in a period where we should expect small declines in real terms And that is what we have built in throughout the period  Well, I don't feel quite as nervous about personal consumption expenditures at the moment as you suggest, if our income is right--if we are generating enough income in other sectors-- because I think we have basically fairly mild expectations for personal consumption expenditures We have to get some monthly increases, however, to get the 3 percent I think I pointed that out; it is not in the bag What we are expecting is literally 1-1/2 to 2 percent annual rates of increase in personal consumption expenditures from now on over the balance of the forecast period In the first half of the year we have seen 5-1/4 percent increases--just a surge At that time the saving rate dropped and debt was being taken on in substantial volume What we have here is essentially a fairly low saving rate, income growth just tracking along, and not really a bullish environment But you can point to the negatives, and the debt side is certainly one Income growth, I think, is a little risky; there is not a lot of income growth being generated and you don't have to have too much happening in other sectors to lead to slower growth So, I don't view it as a big risk in that we really do have a much slower pace of consumer spending in store  The housing area is one where we may have the lags wrong In thinking back, we said some time ago that we had seen a drop of a couple of percentage points in mortgage interest rates and, given the lags, we ought to be seeing some pickup And we just haven't I think I would abandon that story about the time the August numbers come in Basically, our notion was that this should have happened this summer and it just has not happened yet; if the August numbers come in [and don't show a pickup], I think I will conclude that we    8/20/85  really have miscalculated what may be driving that We have gone through fairly carefully our sense of what ought to be happening There is an awful lot of anecdotal evidence floating around mortgage loan applications are up; appraisers are very busy; and existing home sales have picked up But new home sales haven't done anything Single-family starts haven't done anything We have gone through and identified some of the positives With lower interest rates, mortgages are more affordable; the demographics are strong, and household formation is good On the other side is an environment in which expectations of major capital appreciation are not there, probably; tightened mortgage underwriting standards may be doing something at the margin; and there is uncertainty over the tax treatment of interest and property tax deductions How you slice that is very important If we had put this forecast together today, we would have a lower housing start number and a little lower residential expenditures Those data came in after we put the forecast together and were weaker than we had built in  They also had one in June; it was sort of going off the charts in terms of single-family home builders' expectations That fits with other evidence; I'm just saying that we don't see it yet in terms of starts having picked up  The differences from our earlier assumptions were really quite small We had assumed a package of about $50 billion on our basis and we interpret what actually was accomplished    8/20/85  and our reading of what likely will be done in the following steps to amount to $45 billion It is really quite close; we have only adjusted a little for that The way we come out, though, is much less optimistic than some In part, we have a weaker forecast so that there is some [difference in the] economic assumptions and less revenue But we also have felt that many of the actions require single-year appropriations bills and that they will be addressing this year-in and year-out There clearly are pressures now in the farm area to overrun those targets There are some phony things, but it is stripping away the phony things It really does take persistent action So, in the near term we are fairly close; where I think I would be much less optimistic is in year two and year three There we have not gone through an explicit process, but of course the CBO recently came forth with some numbers and they were considerably higher by the time you get to the third year The Congress used very optimistic assumptions and also assumed actions that appear to us rather difficult to undertake So I think it is a story that may have to be revisited Our [estimate] on their basis of the total deficit is about $191 billion for fiscal year 1986 in contrast to their assumed $175 billion or so We are in the range of $15 to $18 billion higher than Congress would be  No Mortgage pools are not in the domestic nonfinancial debt aggregate The mortgages themselves--that is, the mortgage originations--are  It was a little over 4 percent "
2834,1985-10-01," [Statement--see Appendix]  The Q2-1985 average  Correct  Well, I guess it's somewhat fortunate that we don't have to forecast into 1987 at the moment It's rather cloudy, I think, in terms of trying to look into late '86 and '87 There are questions about lots of things What do you assume about policy and the dollar? One of the things that is happening--and I can lay this    10/1/85  on Ted in the sense the dollar forecast is giving us some help--is that as we go on into '86, if the dollar follows the path that we've assumed, we ought to be getting some benefits from that domestically in terms of increased production So, at this moment I wouldn't necessarily come up with a bearish forecast and assume that the economy comes to a grinding halt in late '86 and early '87 Certainly, our forecast as we have it now would not give one the sense that we begin Q1 1987 and fall off a cliff; we have a sense of the economy growing in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent area pretty much throughout the period, but being helped by the foreign trade sector later on in 1986  Previously, the assumption had been a very gradual decline throughout the period; this assumption is essentially front-loaded in September so that we would anticipate a bigger impact on the economy in terms of exports, imports, and prices than we had earlier because it doesn't occur very gradually throughout the whole period "
2858,1985-11-04," Sure  [Statement--see Appendix]  We think really quite good Obviously, part of what is going on in the aggregate numbers is this auto story stocks were run off substantially in the third quarter and are being rebuilt now As we go through the various sectors, in putting together what we know, we think that inventories are about in line in the aggregate, and in the forecast we just have them rising with sales So they don't really run off any more and they don't contribute to growth; they're a neutral factor There are a couple of areas that I think are important I have seen some figures for Sears, for example, which presumably is pretty close to the industry in planning They still feel that inventories are a little on the high side, are banking on decent Christmas spending, and expect that will take care of it But if indeed consumer spending turned out to be a little weak, I would think retailers might not be very happy as they enter the new year Still, in that general merchandise area, particularly with respect to apparel and some soft goods, it depends on decent sales prospects coming along  Well, it is two things one is the surge in car sales; the other is that income growth was weakening and consumer spending outside of autos was still pretty good--not that weak If you want to take a percentage point or so off for auto sales, you might do that But even so, what we have been looking at is fairly good consumer spending and weakening real disposable income growth, so that consumers really have been in a position of reducing their saving rate, borrowing a lot and so forth, to fund expenditures So, I think it is more than autos  I think what we have built in here is a fairly normal historical response I'll let Ted answer I might say that question catches me a little by surprise because the usual question we get is Why do you have net exports rising? So, I haven't thought about this one recently  I might say that the net export sector contributes about a half percent to growth next year So, we would have essentially 2 percent real growth fourth-to-fourth quarter if you held net exports constant That's the impact of these numbers Ted is talking about  Well, you get a kick early on from service receipts in the reevaluation in the current quarter But looking ahead, where we think this begins to kick in is at the very end of 1986; presumably 1987 is the important year and it's beyond the forecast horizon But it's late '86 at best where we see some particular strength and then we see it carrying on  Yes Let me comment on the employment figures first The problem occurs particularly in manufacturing and construction In manufacturing, employment dropped 110,000 in September, which we really didn't believe; and it rose 60,000 in October, which we don't believe either And neither does the BLS There are a couple of things going on One is that the survey week in October was the earliest possible that could have occurred The seasonals are thinking in terms of declining employment in October, and it is thought that the survey week was so early it didn't pick up all of the decline; hence, seasonally adjusted, you get a larger increase Now, that's one part, particularly in manufacturing We have some other evidence in terms of physical product and other information that leads us to think there are some distortions But I would still say it's a good number in that it is very clear that those two months together look better than earlier in the year  With regard to the Sierra, we have seen [shipments] numbers that range from an impact of $3 to $10 billion annual rate in the fourth quarter We have talked to IBM and we have talked to others  So they are trying to build up what was a dismal year for IBM's earnings expectations and make it all up in the fourth quarter, or do the best they can  Other manufacturers, being one, are just not doing very well at all So we  think some offsets are occurring there In addition, in the fourth quarter we expect a very sharp decline in business purchases of autos since some of those autos sold in the third quarter were business purchases at cut-rate terms So the Sierra effect is a little  -10-    11/4-5/85  uncertain In our own thinking we picked a low-end number and used a positive $4 billion annual rate attributable to that, largely offset by autos and to some extent truck sales, which we think will be down But it is a big impact If we're wrong-- As I say, the numbers outside [forecasters are using] range from $3 billion to $10 billion annual rate and it depends in part on what you assume is happening elsewhere in the computer industry  That's right, yes  Yes  No, it comes out this afternoon  No, I don't I'm sorry  We have a $45 billion deficit reduction package for next year That's about $8 billion less than the Congressional estimates They expected $53 billion or so for fiscal 1986  Well, what I am trying to tell you is that we didn't accept the $53 billion figure We think there will be overruns in a number of areas The farm area is a prime one; we don't have the specific number on the farm bill, but we think that it is going to come in higher than the Congress had expected  Why did we lower them? They are not reduced by much, a couple of tenths  All right That's 4 down  A couple of reasons One is that the incoming information in a couple of areas was a little better than we had thought in the third quarter That's the case for the gross business product deflator On compensation and wages, we went through that again and that continues to look really quite good to us, or indeed maybe a little better And with weakness in economic activity, we now have a little more slack in labor and product markets than we had before In addition, taking another look at what we were doing on import prices, we felt that perhaps there was a reason to say it will come along a little slower--that is, rising prices from the dollar would occur later on in the year--so we pushed that back a bit And all of those things together add up to 4 on the index "
2882,1985-12-16," [Statement--see Appendix]  They have risen in the last couple of months, but for all of 1986 we are forecasting essentially flat energy prices  Well, I was referring to energy prices more broadly We have a decline of about $2 in the imported value of oil But there are also service fuels, natural gas, electricity, gasoline, home heating fuel, etc For the whole ball of wax, we essentially have flat or a couple of tenths higher in 1986  Why don't I let Ted answer that question  We haven't taken anything explicit into account The way it stands now is that if it were passed, it clearly would raise the cost of capital with respect to the business sector-- especially for equipment, given that all the proposals get rid of the investment tax credit and change depreciation schedules as well as  -27-    12/16-17/85  corporate income taxes It's less clear that it would have as large an effect on nonresidential structures But for the equipment side we think it would be a negative One of the problems we have is that, given the uncertainty over what's going on in tax reform, a case can be made that in some areas businesses are just holding off and waiting So it may be having somewhat of a depressing effect now in business planning And it's unclear whether we're going to get another slug when something really comes along In financial markets, clearly, one of the areas where tax reform is having a role is in the municipal market where we're having this surge of offerings that may be cut off if tax reform is passed But we think the major effect as it now stands would be in the business sector  Well, I think it's possible The smaller firms of the type you are talking of, especially in some of the service sectors, often are not that capital intensive, and such firms really are not affected in a major way Perhaps the corporate income tax rates play a more significant role I don't know how to sort that out I think that is probably a longer-term kind of argument and the issues on tax reform as they would affect major capital expenditures probably are shorter-term kinds of arguments  Okay With respect to inventories, we have inventories as essentially a neutral force in 1986--basically running close to final sales Our perception was that inventories currently probably are about in line and that businesses would tend to add to their stocks only as sales rose So, the change in inventories is basically not very much Certainly, it wouldn't be affecting 1986 as a whole As I noted in my briefing, there are some questions currently--that is, in the fourth quarter--as to what's going on; we may be seeing somewhat larger accumulation than we have forecast, which would tend to give us somewhat stronger growth  -28-    12/16-17/85  With respect to the federal purchases, you're quite correct There is a lot of spending in the pipeline That's one of the reasons why--in putting this together and looking at Gramm-Rudman and saying that something happens March 1 to the tune of about $12 billion--we see lots of offsets and lots of slippage in various programs, both defense and nondefense, so that our net cut is about $5 billion In addition, some of these financial transactions don't really show up in the GNP accounts as cuts They wouldn't be cutbacks in federal purchases as such, so some of the cuts will not appear in the GNP accounts It's very hard for us to parse out in our minds precisely what happens between cuts and how much is a reaction in some other sectors to interest rates changing But on balance, we took something out as a result of the Gramm-Rudman package [and put in] a little more consumption in housing and a shade more in business investment as a result of lower interest rates But the net effect boils down to, roughly, a couple billion dollars out of 1986 because of that, and that amounts to roughly 3 or 4 tenths [on GNP] It's not a big net effect But the issues, it seems to me, are very important-- especially as you look forward to the summer of 1986 when this major problem surfaces for fiscal year 1987 And we have not assumed that come October 1, things just come to a halt Rather, we have continued sort of along the path of having mild further cuts late in 1986  I think it would have been about where it was Since the meeting in November I don't think that things have changed in a way that would have induced us to have made major changes Interest rates have come down, especially in the long markets, more than we had thought But, sorting through some of the other sectors, I would read them as about the same or maybe a shade weaker So, I would say we took something out of the forecast for Gramm-Rudman I would have had a higher number if we didn't have Gramm-Rudman  Right  The quarterly model now would say that, given the increase in asset values in 1985, there is a lag in the impact on spending, which appears over 4 to 6 quarters We have had something like equity prices raising market values by $350 billion or so in 1985 But that would add about a quarter of a percentage point to personal consumption spending in 1986 So it's a limited effect  Well, keep in mind that a lot of those values show up in pensions  -29-    12/16-17/85  On the risk side, I didn't mention that, but I think it is important There are some arguments that this market may well collapse by next spring Some of the work we've done suggests that if you took, say, $5 off the price of oil and got closer to $20 a barrel, that's worth about 1/2 percent on the GNP deflator and adds almost the same amount to real growth So it is a major factor  Friday morning  Well, this is going to be a massive revision As you know, in many of these numbers significant changes will be made  -30-    12/16-17/85  from 1959 to date There are some definitional changes and they've discovered an error they've been making for the last 5 years that influences something These numbers will come out Friday I think one of the areas that is important is the fact that on the oil price side, when you rebase to 1982 oil gets a much lower weight It has much lower prices and a much lower weight If you want to say these numbers would give you a deflationary impact, as of Friday they will give you a smaller deflationary impact when you rebase So, there will be lots of things happening  It will have a lower weight based on 1982 dollars  Right  I don't know  Yes, it is the rebasing There are two things going on here In the computer case it's not just that they are trying to get an appropriate price index where they have arbitrarily held the price since 1982 to date at 100, but that they are going to rebase from 1972 to 1982 and that effect will run in the other direction So it's not clear to us at this moment how large an impact it will be But you're quite correct; if you didn't rebase you'd have a substantial increase There are other things going on, on the income side in particular, where they have tried to account for some underreporting of income It's questionable at this point as to what  -31-    12/16-17/85  impact that might have on the saving rate and other things But certainly from what they have already published, in 1977 the saving rate is up about a percentage point from the now-reported numbers In any event, the world will be remade on the 23rd and will bear little relationship to what we're [seeing] now  SPEAKER(?) The 20th  I think that's the latest  For the current quarter?  Yes  Well, it's 2/10ths or something  It's 1/10th in our forecast  No, the nonfarm business sector "
2908,1986-02-11," Right, I think that's an important feature And that's very different from the last four or five years, as you know, with current services estimates shown to grow substantially into the $300 billion plus range five years out We do not have all of the details available on the CBO estimates I must say that one might assume that there is some agreement on what current services estimates mean but that turns out to be very wrong This year is a classic case For example, the Administration's current services number assumes that the defense baseline is 3 percent real growth Well, after the Gramm-Rudman March 1 cuts, they jump up spending but assume that the spend out rate is very slow CBO assumes that no Congressional action is zero real growth, but recent experience has defense spending much faster than the Administration [assumption] The net result is that in 1991 there is a mere $35 billion [difference] between the two on defense alone, but there are offsetting changes Interest rates are different; they are worth $20 to $25 billion Inflation rates are substantially different, with the    2/11-12/86  Administration having inflation drifting down to 2 percent in 1991 and hence indexed programs grow at the much slower rate; under the current services estimates, that's worth something on the order of $25 billion or so by 1991 So, if you want to mix and match all of these things in your own way, instead of 1991 numbers that drift down essentially to $100 to $110 billion without further action you probably could have anything from $50 to $200 billion and be perfectly consistent with all of these numbers The problem, I think, is that there is a great deal of emphasis on the notion that it's very different even without further action--that the budget will be improving--and I think that's probably faulty Hidden behind this, there's a lot more going on  Well, that's rather broad We can start with Ted's comments, because I think part of the problem that we are facing --and it certainly influences our thinking--is reflected in what has been happening in the Third World countries and the debtor nations And that, in part, is a reflection of what has happened to the dollar, which we think basically relates back to some structural developments over the course of the recovery with respect to the deficit and the way our economy has grown and our relatively high interest rates compared to the rest of the world Mike referred to some debt problems in the consumer sector We have taken what I think is a moderate picture there and have assumed that there are going to be some problems but that they will be manageable At the same time, we know we are generating a great deal in the way of additional financial assets and wealth; and we assume that consumers as a group will be willing to run with relatively low interest rates But I think hidden there in the consumer sector is a substantial problem that could be magnified as this [expansion] goes on For example, in the Southwest we see the oil pressures evolving We know that there already are some debt problems in the Texas and Louisiana areas Both consumer debt and mortgage debt in the nonresidential structures area [could present problems] So I think that the problems are there But, in our view, continued economic growth in the aggregate will help us go through that process without a great deal of strain The corporate sector is a bit more difficult because there are tremendous problems    2/11-12/86  in that sector, if you look at individual balance sheets Again, some of them on the energy side I think are quite risky And some who a few years ago paid a heavy price and went into debt essentially to diversify their interests by moving into energy have a big problem But again, we have assumed that those problems are essentially manageable I think it is important to consider that we have a growth environment and relatively unchanged--certainly not substantial increases in--interest rates And in that context, we don't think the micro problems will escalate into big macro problems over time But throughout all of the major sectors, it would be very hard to think that there are not problems for certain groups and individuals or individual firms or countries I don't know if I have answered the question  I think that's right We have rounded these numbers and you caught the right direction in which things were rounded; actually, on the lower oil price side the effect is about 35 or so and I rounded it up to a half and for 1987 I rounded it down But the sense really is that the real impacts will take a while to feed through That's true on the prices too, except that there is a bigger question on prices The Board's quarterly model that we used here has a much larger impact on prices in 1987 and very little in 1986; we judgmentally adjusted some of these because we think there will be substantial pressure and the direct effects will come along in a major way So, in effect, we fiddled with the numbers there Our best sense is that we will get some of the direct effects [in 1986] but that the important feedback effects will filter through on into 1987  This is our general sense Basically, it boils down to a rough rule of thumb that for a dollar change in the price of oil the response is a tenth on real GNP and a tenth on the deflator, in opposite directions If one is talking about prices, it is very clear that the impact on the consumer price index is much larger--roughly double Our thought is that a $5 change in the price of oil would translate into a percentage point after four quarters in the rate of change in the CPI But I think this is fairly standard I have seen a DRI forecast--  That's 1/2 percentage point off the rate of change in each year from what it otherwise would have been If prices had been running at 3 percent, when you change the oil price, prices are then running at 2-1/2 percent in each year--minus 1/2 percentage point So that is the marginal impact of that change  Yes  Yes, that's right  Prices would be down one percentage point in the first year Essentially, our view on the CPI is double that effect in the first year I don't know how to answer the question Basically, there are lots of alternative views on this, but I think this is one that is fairly standard  I had some questions about whether I should include it!  What happens in the model here--and I guess I wouldn't blame this on the model because [our forecast reflects] a mixture of some staff judgmental adjustments to a model result--but basically in answer to your question, if I had extended this over a longer time period we would get back on track It's simply that the price impact would be smaller in later years so that you are going to retreat to path You will note that the unemployment rate under that policy is down about 1-1/4 percentage points from its starting level, so it would be in the mid five percent range In the model and in our thinking, the natural rate is believed to be around 6 percent or a shade under So what is happening here is that in the second year the unemployment rate starts to plunge below the natural rate and stays there; and that generates intense upward pressures on prices and wages Now, if you continue this year after year, the model would turn right back to a nice sensible path and everything would work out    2/11-12/86  No, you have to cumulate  Right  Before the January unemployment numbers were available  Well, the first quarter, anyhow Our best guess at the moment is that we would be more inclined to have a 4 percent number for the first quarter  The civilian rate is what I think we have been getting in the numbers given to us The difference is a tenth and when push comes to shove, to be consistent with the Administration, at the end of the report we will just add a tenth to whatever anybody gives us  The total  That's about right Our thought was that the bill rate will get into the area of 7 percent, with the funds rate    2/11-12/86  drifting down to about 7 percent But heaven knows what will really happen on the funds rate  We think there will be some effect in the CPI in January because spot gasoline prices have been dropping in retail markets So we'll get a little, but very little  February 25, which is Tuesday "
2934,1986-04-01," [Statement--see Appendix]  Do you mind if I let my colleague answer?  Well, it's the arithmetic of the first shot of oil [price declines] As you remember in the old days, if you had a commodity with a very high price deflator such as oil and it's an import, it's a negative and depresses the deflator Now that we have rebased on 1982 and oil prices are falling, we have a low deflator and they're subtracted out So in the first round effect you will get a higher deflator from the arithmetic  Well, yes In the GNP fixed-weight deflator what you're fixing is quantity, and the price is declining so you are still subtracting both You're still subtracting imports in the first round effects Later on you get benefits as those prices show up, for example, in gasoline and you get an effect in the personal consumption expenditures So, over time, you get something positive  You get a lower deflator  We have numbers of 2-1/2 percent instead of 3-3/4 percent for the first quarter and 1-1/2 percent in the second quarter as opposed to 2-1/2 to 3 percent It's a big effect  The second quarter or--  Yes In the first quarter we had final sales flat and 3 percent growth; half of that was imports and the other half was a switch out of CCC, a reduced runoff of farm inventories So there isn't much there  Final sales are 01 in our estimates Half is reduced imports and the other half is inventories; and about three- fourths of those inventories are a smaller runoff of farm commodities In fact, CCC purchases are declining In the second quarter we have final sales and GNP pretty much even; so we don't have much in the way of inventories at all in the second quarter That's a quarter where we anticipate auto inventories will be running off and we will get some accumulation elsewhere But essentially, if you look--  It declines  Well, there's no contribution to GNP growth  Well, you said the deficit? Excuse me, in the second quarter we have an estimate of net exports of minus $130 billion and minus $115 billion for the year So it's the second half where we have appreciable improvement in prospect  Well, I think we have We actually have, in an historical sense, fairly low ratios of inventories to business sales What has entered into our thinking, essentially, is that there is absolutely no shortage in most areas--prices are falling Interest rates have been rather high and are still high; there are all sorts of incentives to economize on inventories So I think in an historical sense we really have a very mild accumulation over the forecast    4/1/86  period There are two areas that are problems In the short run it has been oil and coal, that whole complex of energy [products], and the desire to reduce inventories; the other area that we know about is autos And there's a major problem there  I think there are inflation consequences from this additional 15 percent, but they would be in 1987  That's right  Well, in the sense that it's already-- "
2959,1986-05-20," [Statement--see Appendix]  Not much We had available all of the data except for retail trade inventories when we put the forecast together, and they came in significantly higher than we thought The Commerce Department will release tomorrow the detail on how it fits together, so we have much of this We really were [not] surprised, frankly We thought, given the degrees of freedom that they have in that area, that they might not have taken all of the implied revision into account; but our reading of the inventory side was that inventories generally were lean, with the exception perhaps of some major retail trade [firms] So, we would not want to change very much as a result of this  Final sales had been minus 04 percent They are now minus 07 percent But I should give you another number final sales excluding CCC purchases, because they are the big mover If you exclude the Commodity Credit Corporation operations they had been rising 26 percent and now they are indicated to have risen 22 percent The changes in these final sales are really quite small Personal consumption expenditures, net exports, and residential structures were revised down, each by a small amount  Yes, it's just much less positive than before The offset shows up in federal purchases, of course, if the accounts are kept straight Federal purchases were up 23 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter and are now indicated to have declined 30 percent in the first quarter  Imports were less negative and exports were revised down a bit So the contribution of net exports is a little less than had been projected before  I think we were asked that question yesterday [at the Board meeting] and I suggested after a long answer that I don't know Do you want the short answer or the long answer?  It depends, obviously, on what they do with their incentives and whether they are going to gin up some more sales by doing something on the price side In the GNP sense, in billions of dollars, the second-quarter change in the automobile sector is worth about $15 billion in real terms We have [projected] another $3 or $4 billion in the third quarter which indicates that, yes, they are going to have to take more out Now, that assumes that they have already [unintelligible] the working off of current-quarter production schedules; we think that they will have to do more One of the difficulties that I might note here is that the Commerce Department uses seasonal factors that some might doubt But using our information, they have their seasonal auto production going from 9 million units in the first quarter to 73 million in the second quarter So it's a big dip And we assume that a small further cut will occur in the third quarter  Well, I think Don has the econometric results that we used There is a lot of uncertainty, but we have various models You are looking at the numbers, Don "
2984,1986-07-08," To be explicit, we assumed something like $14 or $15, and it gets to about $16 by the fourth quarter of this year and just stays there It creeps back up by the end of this year and sits there  It's one quarter of a percent on our estimate of real GNP growth But I should say that that comes about--and is a lower figure, I think, than in some outside forecasts--because we don't assume that the Senate is going to end up with $23 billion net additional [cuts] in 1987 and that we still get all of the Gramm- Rudman cuts In fact, we think there is going to be some interaction and slippage in that process, so that by the time it comes out it won't be that much of a cut So we have a limited effect But don't let me interrupt I think your point is that concern in the business community seems to be growing over time Earlier on, there was a sense of uncertainty in some sectors; but now I believe there is a greater realization that the tax reform is going to affect the business sector at large--assuming that it comes out something like this Senate plan  Are you talking about ERTA, going back to about 1982 or 1983?  Yes, but I think the fiscal effects were larger What we have done, rightly or wrongly, is come up with a fiscal package effect that is about $7 or $8 billion more than we had previously, as a result of some additional outlays and somewhat fewer cuts elsewhere And it has a depressing effect on the business sector, particularly, with an assumed given rate of growth of M2 We assumed with the cutback in demand from the business sector, in multifamily structures particularly, that there would be some interest rate effect; rates come down a little from what we had in the last forecast So, you get a little more spending elsewhere, and net what we have is something that is sprinkled through the projection I don't think it is an overwhelming feature, given the basic character [of the tax reform] But if you assumed something like what happened in 1982, when depreciation schedules were changed as were other things that produced a much larger fiscal impact, then it probably would have a greater damping influence  I didn't this time We have done a good deal of that in the past The general sense is that the models have a great deal of difficulty handling this, as you know And that's where I see a little uncertainty, partly because what is built into the current interest rate structure is expectations that something is going to happen If you remove that and you get a backup in interest rates, you get all sorts of effects that are not easy to capture--at least in the models that we deal with Basically, in a standard sense, we would assume that you would have a fiscal multiplier that is somewhat larger; how much larger is always open to question But if you had federal spending that was lower by something like $20 billion, at an annual rate, that would give you something larger than that in terms of its impact on the economy And $20 billion is about 1/2 percent in real GNP So, I think there is a lot of uncertainty here What is basically essential to our forecast is to assume that there will be some fiscal restraint However that comes about may be a very interesting question between now and October  In 1986? Are you referring to the last chart?    7/8-9/86  I simply stated that nominal GNP now for 1986 falls below the lower range of the central tendency I was trying to suggest that there has been a sizable downward revision both with respect to the deflator and real GNP  [You are right] This is a result of trying to be cost conscious and using an old chart  We have done some simulations; we didn't do the fiscal one, but we have done some monetary ones, basically using M2 And in this particular simulation, if M2 were running at the top of the range--if M2 grew at 9 percent through 1988 beginning now--the model result is that that would be consistent roughly with a federal funds rate 3/4 percentage below what it is now, with that sort of    7/8-9/86  level maintained into 1988 You would get just a few tenths more real growth this year because of the lags but about a percentage point more real growth next year and a bit more in 1988 On the price side with that sort of scenario, prices don't change this year; they are up a quarter to one-half of a percentage point more in 1987 and, according to the model, up 1-1/4 percentage points over what they otherwise would have been in 1988 "
3010,1986-08-19," [Statement--see Appendix]  In dollars?  The change in business inventories of minus $283 billion had been minus $203 billion So it's a large downward revision of $8 billion in real terms Half of it is in farm inventories; half of it is in nonfarm Net exports now show a change of minus $246 billion compared to minus $204, so that's a decline of $42 billion  I have gross domestic purchases here  They had been 32 percent and are still 32 percent Final sales were actually revised up, obviously, in this situation They had been reported at a 34 percent increase and they are now at a 38 percent increase  Well, there are a couple of things about this number First of all, under the new procedures [the Commerce Department] releases details tomorrow So, we don't have the details  Part of the farm [story], I think, may be the CCC because government purchases were revised up So the question is really on the nonfarm side From the little information that we have around, it appears that it's a revision in part in the deflator--a higher deflator and thus lower real expenditures The question is Is it in oil or is it something else--perhaps merchandise trade? We don't know In our view, we have a further runoff in the third quarter, which is mainly in autos Outside of autos our forecast    8/19/86  entails something flat In fact, supporting your supposition, we have very strong consumer spending in our forecast, as I mentioned, and we don't have much in the way of production The question is Is it going to come out of inventories or are we going to have more imports or are we going to have rising production? It's a question Essentially, given these data along with what was happening, one can argue more strongly that expansion in demand is going to lead directly into production because inventories in most sectors, outside of autos, are very lean  Well, the forecast--  The forecast, I think, is reasonably balanced There are risks on both sides of this and I wouldn't say they are skewed in any significant way Obviously, we have a forecast that shows improvement over time Some of the risks have been talked about, certainly [at the FOMC meeting] in July On the down side, for example, one of the risks relates to what's going to happen to the trade sector; it's clearly a key in this forecast And that raises questions about foreign growth and demands for our own exports One of the downside risks is in business fixed investment Frankly, in the office and commercial area it now seems that both commitments and structures are going down at a tremendous rate That sector could be one for which we perhaps have underestimated the severity of the decline On the other side, I'd say we do have a slackening in growth of consumer spending that we think is consistent with what's happening to disposable income There's just no question, if you look at the data, that consumers have been quite willing to spend and [unintelligible] generated enough income in this forecast, it seems to me, that consumer spending at the rate we have could look very moderate So, there are risks on both sides, and I think it's rather reasonably balanced at the moment  Our current fiscal year 1986 budget deficit is $225 billion and we have it going down to a little under $170 billion, to $167 billion Included in those numbers is essentially $45 billion of explicit deficit-reducing actions, $9 billion of which already have been enacted in a reconciliation bill so that $36 billion remains to be done at this point That was our reading of a combination of what would be done in the budget process in reaction to Gramm-Rudman as well as revenues from tax reform We had assumed about $15 billion on tax reform; now the estimate, if it goes through as currently planned, is that there would be a revenue increase of about $11 billion So we're a little too high on those revenue increases The rest would represent economic growth Basically, the answer to your question is [deficit reduction] in the $35 to $40 billion area, with explicit actions that would need to be taken to be consistent with the forecast  Well, for what it's worth, what we have in the forecast is a negative impact, principally in the business fixed investment area and in multi-family housing We have felt that the uncertainty of the current environment may be depressing spending and that passage and clarification of the rules might lead, at the margin, to some increase But, on balance, we view it as a net negative feature of the forecast  I think the path that we've assumed is something like $11 this quarter, $14 in the fourth quarter, and then $16 in [early 1987] The $16 thereafter is, in part, ignorance; we've just assumed stability at around $16 What that does on the price side for petroleum products is that in the fourth quarter we'll begin seeing some price increases and under that scenario in the first quarter and in the spring they should be fairly large Then it sort of flattens out Outside of oil prices, in other service fuels, electricity and natural gas, that sort of thing, we think prices will continue to drift down; they've been laggards in this process On activity, we ended up essentially suggesting that by the fourth quarter the halt in the decline in petroleum drilling will stop And by the second half of next year we've added several billion dollars in increased activity We may have it wrong, but the main story is that the decline stops sometime around now and we're just going to see small increases in 1986, but probably more later on  This is the fourth quarter of 1986?  No, this isn't a model forecast  -30-    8/19/86  I think what happens is the initial perverse effects of higher oil prices; oil imports coming in at a higher price are subtracted out, which affects the fourth quarter  In effect, it's the arithmetic of GNP accounting in the deflator in that quarter when oil prices are rising  It would show higher prices, right "
3036,1986-09-23," [Statement--see Appendix]  What we have in terms of nonfarm inventories in the third quarter is a runoff of nearly $12 billion, annual rate, in constant dollar terms We have nonfarm inventories excluding autos rising about $9 billion So the story is really very much an auto story, with a decline in auto stocks of about $21 billion in real terms in the third quarter The numbers in the report in July were a little curious in the auto sector They run counter to this and, as far as we know, the folks at BEA have other information they use in putting the numbers together As you know, inventories are a wild card in all of this and I don't have any particular faith in a given number But we do know what's happening to measures of auto stocks And I would say that we have this forecast of a $21 billion runoff and an increase of $12 billion in the next quarter within a few billion    9/23/86  I think it's safe to say autos are largely driving that Outside of autos we have small increases  I have a colleague who has answered many of these questions  Yes, to some extent our view is that some of the inflation coming from the dollar is a matter of timing We've been seeing those price increases and it's a question of how they feed through Obviously, we have weaker domestic markets Out of the  -13-    9/23/86  forecast of 3 percent real growth next year, a little over a third of that comes from net exports So if you took away those exports the direct effect is rather large; and you can clearly have indirect effects, feedback effects, in domestic income So, if you were to assume no improvement whatsoever, I think you're talking about a pretty sick domestic economy unless we have other things wrong  It's up 3/10ths  Well, I don't think I'd make big changes We have a number for August of 68 percent and an average of 69 percent in the third quarter If anything, I might change it a tenth, clearly on the downside I think that's what you're asking  The question as we go into the fourth quarter is whether we're going to continue to see that sort of improvement in a major way We have assumed that we'll continue to have employment growth but at a somewhat lesser rate than we've been seeing recently So, we have the unemployment rate drifting down only a tenth on a quarterly average If that's wrong, and given what we know now, I'd bend in the direction of knocking another tenth or two off I don't feel particularly uncomfortable [with our forecast] but I think the weighting of the evidence would be in the direction of a lower rather than a higher rate  No, we do it by sector And where that shows up explicitly is in private domestic final purchases So you look at  -15-    9/23/86  consumption, you look at investment For example, we have that total, excluding food and energy, rising next year at a rate close to 4 percent So that's sort of an explicit recognition that these imports prices are feeding through into final goods prices  I think we have something like 3/4 of a percent or 08 percent  I have a hard time reading some of those They have bounced around They're still at a high level but clearly they are not as high as they were a number of years back Some of these reports--depending on whether you look at the Michigan or the Conference Board surveys--tend to be sort of ""things are good now but they're going to get worse"" In the Michigan case what often happens, and what I think was happening in August, is that it reflects an increase in inflationary expectations that's very highly correlated with food prices Given the past behavior [of the index], whenever food prices go up Michigan seems to pick up the view that things aren't quite as good as they once were So, at the moment I wouldn't read a lot into the declines, given that the levels are still high and given what we see going on in terms of actual expenditure patterns-- that consumers have been quite happy to spend  Yes  The total was little changed It was up 34 percent in July and down 26 percent in August There was a big drop in defense orders  No, the revisions, I think, are very small On nondefense capital goods alone it's virtually unchanged That was up 37 percent in July and down 28 percent in August  No Part of what's going on, though, is that the aircraft area has been extremely volatile It was up very sharply in July and went down in August Nondefense capital goods orders excluding that aircraft component are still down in August but the level is 3-1/2 percent above the second-quarter average So I would    9/23/86  read that as something very helpful The other development that is encouraging is that office and computing machinery orders rose again They are now, as you know, at a low level; but they are 25 percent above where they were in the second quarter So there seems to be a little life coming back in that high-tech area  It was $32 billion last year and we have $26 or $27 billion in fiscal 1987; the Administration has something like $18 billion "
3085,1986-12-15," Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]  Around 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent So in terms of what we have for 1987, we are essentially growing a half point faster than that; given our translation, it is really worth 1/2 point or so What, indeed, is the trend growth of productivity? The more recent numbers have been rather disappointing, closer to 1 percent rather than what we had thought--1-1/4 percent or even higher So I think it is an open case at the moment I don't view this as terribly out of line with our sense of potential growth in the economy I suspect there are folks who have numbers all over the lot Some outside forecasts [show unemployment] down to 6-1/2 percent; others have 3 percent growth and unemployment rates rising So there is a good deal of variability  Well, we don't really have good data, as you know, for well over a year The evidence that we have suggests that manufacturing productivity is probably rising 3-1/2 to 4 percent Service sector productivity is just really quite poor So, we are getting strong productivity gains; that is important in this forecast In terms of potential growth, we are trying to look at trend productivity for the economy in total, but there is a great deal of variation among sectors  No, I think there is a little more information than that Let's say it is open to question but there is a little more information than an assumption of zero  $282 billion is the dollar amount [for net exports] Ted's one-third is roughly focused on the growth rate of real GNP fourth quarter over fourth quarter We have a growth rate of 28 percent, and if you take out net exports it is something like 18 percent  [Our forecast has] $60 billion in personal consumption; $7-1/2 billion in business fixed investment; virtually nothing in residential construction; nothing, or perhaps a billion or two, in business inventories; $28 billion in net exports; and $5 billion in government purchases  You would like those sort of numbers in the green sheets?  The number floating around that is still preliminary, I think, is $163 billion for the current fiscal year That's still subject to change but it's in the $160-$165 billion area Keep in mind that is the same number that just a matter of a few months ago was $143 billion; so they have added $20 billion It's a case of how much you want to up the ante We have added another $20 billion I think there is a danger of going too far in that direction, because there were legislative changes enacted that will begin to bite One of the issues relates to defense We had a lot of defense spending in the second and third quarters of last year It is our sense that the level of that spending is now quite high We have had major weapons systems deliveries that are now coming in; they are producing these things at a very rapid rate But we don't expect defense spending to continue to grow in real terms at a fast clip Rather we expect, as we get into the first part of next year, that we will probably have constraints on defense spending--in part because appropriations were cut back at the Administration's request I would say that if we are wrong, I would probably add more; that is the safe way to go now A big question mark is the agricultural area; we have substantially more dollars in there than does the Administration My experience over the years is that even when we do that we are always low It looks sort of outrageous but basically it turns out to be a really important issue I think it is too pessimistic to say that things weren't done I think they were done And I think they will begin to show up as time goes on  We had a lot of employment growth  Over the last two months or so, they have been averaging about 20,000 to 23,000 per week under what they had been running during the summer In October-November we did have increases in manufacturing employment; and that is the circumstance where you often see the [effect on] initial claims showing up very promptly The employment growth for those two months is very strong It has been a reliable leading indicator and I would say it is supportive of a strengthening labor market That is what I would make of it  I don't know the answer to that question  We do the income side of the accounts, as well, so we have corporate profits In economic terms they are barely higher in 1987 than in 1986; and if you take profits after tax, they indeed would go down because of the $15 to $20 billion tax increase that we have built in for the new tax law So essentially, corporate profits in an economic sense are little changed next year  The hourly earnings index that we focus on adjusts for inter-industry shifts in employment So it is not average hourly earnings as such; the index adjusts for that As you know, it popped up in November by about four-tenths; it is volatile from month to month Contract construction was up very strongly and there were wage increases as well in finance, insurance, and real estate That has been a hot area--particularly the real estate, where there has been a lot of employment and maybe there has been some bidding up of wages But I don't know that we have noticed anything in particular about rapid growth in the minimum wage area I would note that other information that we are looking at for contract construction does not tend to support this sense of a very rapid sustained increase in construction wages Did I answer your question?  Some of it is lower settlements We do have information there the average of settlements in the Bureau of National Affairs series, which includes all settlements of 50 or more workers, continues to drift lower One other feature that is influencing the labor market data on the wage side, in a major way, is that many of the agreements provide for bonuses and lump sum payments that do not get cranked into the hourly earnings That's sort of straight time salary But this bonus feature pops up a great deal and that may be one thing that--  Yes, the index is straight time hourly pay; it takes away overtime and all these other things That particular feature is captured in compensation measures but not in the hourly earnings index And that seems to be spreading  I think there are other things that happen You may well have different price behavior, for example, or different interest rates that come out of the forecast, or different consumption spending Basically, the inclination is not simply to adjust the domestic forecast down by the full amount because these other things could be happening to help shore up--    12/15-16/86  Well, Mr Chairman, [unintelligible] says that we are going to get [unintelligible]  It depends on what you assume about the oil price and, as Ted mentioned, we have that drifting up to $16 So that is clearly different from 1986 but it is not a major problem Another big issue is what you assume about import prices and how they will be reflected in domestic prices We think we have something reasonable there I don't know how some of these other forecasts track that through In addition, our sense is that we have at the moment fairly moderate wage growth, in terms of measured expectations of inflation You say we are at the low end, but I guess when we talk about numbers that are four or five percent I would want to be at the low end I wouldn't want to be there all the time, but I am perfectly happy sitting there in December 1986  Right  Housing starts were at a 16 million unit annual rate in November That's just about 2 percent below October All of the decline is in the multifamily area and, regionally, all of the decline is in the South It's a shade weaker than we had built into the forecast, but not much  They are up and very close to starts They are up about 2 percent, surprisingly all in the multifamily area  We have 14 percent this year and 37 percent next year  Well, let's see--  Mr Chairman, the answer to this question about energy is essentially that in 1986 energy prices are declining at 18 percent In our estimate they have a weight of about 10 or 11 percent, so the energy sector depresses the consumer price index by about 1-3/4 percentage points this year Next year our guesstimate is that energy prices will be up 6 percent, so they would add 06 of a percentage point So a major part of the swing is the energy sector  That's correct  We have one other element that's important here food And it has a big weight, something like 18 to 20 percent This year we're estimating food price increases of about 4 percent and next year 2 percent So that is a major swing the other way The other prices that we have in there don't change a great deal from one year to the next; it's not much of an acceleration  Yes We have something like 5-1/2 percent in 1986 and our number [for 1987] is a little under 5 percent  Well, let me answer that in a less direct way than you might like In looking at 1987, I think the risks are that in the first half the economy will turn out to be weaker rather than stronger We can't identify how much spending is being accelerated but I think we probably underestimated it I wouldn't be surprised to see a number in the fourth quarter that's greater than what we have    12/15-16/86  built in; and if that happens I might also look for a weaker first quarter and first half Beyond that, I tend to think that we may run with stronger GNP rather than weaker as we get into the latter half of the year On the price side I think there's a good bet that very little will happen in the near term But if we're wrong at this point--again looking out--consistent with my view on real GNP I might be adding a few tenths to the inflation side rather than taking away  And food prices slightly lower "
3109,1987-02-10," [Statement--see Appendix] We have had a lot of focus on the international side, so we are going to do something different than we have done over the last decade; we are going to invite Mr Truman to speak next  [Statement--see Appendix] That concludes our presentation, Mr Chairman  The saving rate in the fourth quarter of last year was 2-3/4 percent If you are visually looking at this chart, it depends on the point you look at One other thing that conditions our thinking is that, historically, the income side tends to get revised up in the national income accounts in July They tend to find income with these revisions We have looked at these data, and history would tell us that the 2-3/4 percent number for the fourth quarter is likely to be over three percent, and perhaps appreciably over three percent; but we will know that a couple years from now So, conditioning our thinking is the fact that these numbers tend to understate the saving rate  We had in mind when we put the forecast together that the fourth quarter would be revised up somewhat The question would arise if the revision were much larger than we had anticipated The major source of the change is our expectation that net exports will look a lot better, perhaps $8 to $10 billion better, than in the accounts now But some more recent information coming out on business fixed investment and some other areas suggests that maybe by the time they put all of the numbers together the upward revision will be something smaller than that So, our sense is that we might get a 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent number instead of 1-3/4 percent Implicitly, we had that expectation in mind when putting together this forecast  No, we had that information in hand The only major piece that came out that we did not include in our thinking was the employment report We have 2-1/4 percent now, and I think if we had had that report, we would probably have a number in the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range for the first quarter  For 1987, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, we have forecast a CPI increase of 38 percent; it was 13 percent on a  -16-    2/10-11/87  fourth-quarter basis in 1986 So that's 09 percentage points above the deflator in 1987 "
3133,1987-03-31," [Statement--see Appendix]  Part of what is going on there is our assumption that more crops are going to be placed in CCC programs I am not an expert in the agricultural area but, given the change in some of the farm programs, apparently farmers have been induced to transfer more of their ownership to the government--essentially to CCC stocks, which are rising--and it's coming out of the farm inventories  SPEAKER(?) So that should show up in terms of more [unintelligible] purchases and federal nondefense  Correct  SPEAKER(?) A little weak  Well, that's weak in part because of other things happening in the federal sector Given the deficit-reducing actions taken last year, we think that real nondefense outlays will be negative this year and next year  SPEAKER(?) In spite of that CCC development  Well, you are looking at an auto story We decided to put in what has happened over the last two years [unintelligible] In the third quarter we have personal consumption rising only 1-1/2 percentage points at an annual rate Part of that, we think, is because of the increase in purchases of autos, with manufacturers once again trying to clean up their stocks in the third  -11-    3/31/87  quarter The offset is a weaker consumption growth picture in the fourth quarter I just might note that, on average in this forecast, we are drifting into a range of very low personal consumption figures A one percent [growth rate over the two quarters] is historically very low  We haven't done much there explicitly Our assumption has been that a good deal of that is substituting for consumer credit and other second mortgage loans rather than leading to a substantial increase in consumer spending That's an open issue  I think some of the commodity prices recently have calmed down; the big run-up was from August through early this year when there was a substantial increase Since then, there has been some bouncing about, particularly in terms of industrial materials prices, but they have been relatively flat  I was hinting in our personal consumption story, President Guffey, that basically I think a one percent growth, when we have 3 percent growth in real GNP, is a very [unintelligible] number In putting this together, we have really looked at the income side as well In forecasting, as you well know, one can view the saving rate as somewhat of a constraint I didn't want to see saving rates without the first digit being at least 3 percent; and if that is the case, we really get [unintelligible] We don't have much in the way of real disposable income growth We think wealth is explaining the lower saving rate, in part We are getting some increased spending [unintelligible] wealth positions But basically, what comes out--if we view the saving rate as having some implicit strength--is that we are going to be forced into slow rates of increase in real PCE But it is, as you point out, quite unusual "
3167,1987-05-19," [Statement--see Appendix]  As you know, the auto case is one you can point to Beyond that we don't have anything explicit If you look at the producer price index for April, in fact, very little was happening there taking away energy and food and cars Basically, we're talking about prices that seem to be moving up at about the same rate It's something we've been looking for We run across these comments about producers looking for every opportunity to increase their margins but, at this point, we don't really have any hard evidence in hand  If you look at the GNP deflator or the GNP fixed-weighted index you have the persistent effect of net exports being subtracted, which tends to depress those GNP measures If you look at private domestic final purchases prices, the PCE fixed-weight measure or deflator picks up very directly all of these import prices that we're talking about rising at double-digit rates So you're right we have prices for personal consumption expenditures rising even in excess of 4 percent--4-1/4 to nearly 5 percent in 1988 And that has the effect in this forecast of depressing real income growth So you have it right in the sense of why we believe we will be facing a fairly weak picture on domestic consumption I view it as part of the adjustment process and rising import prices depressing [consumption]    5/19/87  Well, given everything, I'd say these consumption numbers outside of durables are at really very low growth rates One might expect to find those rates happening in a recession environment So in that sense consumption might be higher On the other hand, we're starting with inflation picking up and the depressing effects of real income growth and other characteristics that I think would act to damp demand You're quite correct; these are low rates of consumption  Explicitly, we've assumed that in order to reduce the stocks on hand, which are running at something like 75 days' supply, they will have to maintain incentives of one fashion or another As we get into the third quarter, we have assumed a further cutback in domestic auto production and probably somewhat limited sales incentive programs to continue to sell those cars So, I think it's a combination of incentives as well as some further cuts in production  Autos are the only area where we sense that there's a problem lurking The data lag, and at times they're hard to interpret In the manufacturing sector, certainly, for a long period of time manufacturers have been running with very low inventories In fact, in this forecast the inventory/sales ratios are flat or drifting down So we haven't spotted any sectors where unusual things are going on outside of autos  This is, in part, the arithmetic January just plunged and plunged partly because included in business investment would be auto and light truck purchases So part of the arithmetic is that as February and March came back, orders sort of flattened out We know auto sales were rising a bit, and so for the second quarter, instead of the 13 percent drop recorded in the first quarter, we have a pickup in real terms to something like 6-1/4 percent In part that's arithmetic; in part that's a pickup in auto sales But I think one ought to read through that; and when we read through it we have essentially unchanged business spending for the year in real terms I think that's a more accurate picture  There are a number of things going on To begin with, in January 1988 there is a sizable increase in Social Security taxes and, along with that, an assumed further rise in the wage base We've assumed that compensation will kick up by 4/10ths of 1 percent beginning QI '88 because of the large Social Security tax increase--the employer share Other features are that we assume that we're going to begin to have a more forceful effect of higher prices feeding back into wage behavior in 1988 In this forecast, as you may have noticed, we have a lower path for the unemployment rate We were caught by surprise by the numbers that have come out We think there might be a little problem there Essentially, in the forecast, we're going to be looking at an unemployment rate of 6-1/4 percent later on in 1988 Who knows what the natural rate is, but we think that we're probably in a range somewhere pretty close to that So we're not going to have a damping effect on wage growth that we had previously  I don't think you're going to get one now either! It is curious that we are seeing what is really a fairly sluggish industrial sector, particularly for the last couple of months We can explain the autos and trucks, and that's the bulk of the decline But in the detail in the industrial production index, as I noted yesterday, in many of the sectors where we thought we'd see some rise because of export orders growing nothing is happening There have been really widespread weaknesses for two months We have some difficulty reconciling that, obviously, with total payroll employment, which gives the picture of a lot of spending Virtually all of that is in the trade and services areas; it's not really spilling over into manufacturing One of the concerns in the forecast is that we have built in, frankly even for the current quarter, increases of 03 to 04 percent in industrial production in May and June, which we think needs to occur to rationalize what has been happening We have a month or two divergence between these various signals We also have, as you know, the problem--  We have about 04 percent per month in May and June We think that would be consistent; it sort of reconciles the problem that Governor Johnson was raising that the industrial sector looks very sluggish Whether or not that materializes is, for now, an open question I can't really do a lot more than to say we do--  Let me note that the 04 and 03 percent--pick whichever month you want that in--but we're stuck with minus 04 percent in April On a quarterly average basis, that pickup will give zero growth in industrial output in the second quarter We have 2-1/2 percent growth at an annual rate in the first quarter, but we need a pickup even to get zero, given that we are starting out at a low number  Autos and trucks, for example, were worth almost 3/10ths of the 4/10ths decline, so 2/3 to 3/4 of the depressing factor came out of the motor vehicles sector President Morris, you asked about the workweek You're quite correct the numbers in the workweek were depressed because there were religious holidays during that week For manufacturing production hours, they're down something like 1 percent Looking at the path over the last 20 years, in the few years in which this has occurred virtually 3/5ths to 2/3rds of that is alleged by our folks who do this to have been accounted for by the effect of the holidays So, a lot of that has been discounted in putting together the industrial production data  Well, there are lots of special factors It depends on which market On the CRB futures, Don was reporting on Friday that before it rained it was the dry Midwest; and then the rains came in the Midwest and prices plummeted So part of it, I think, is just heightened expectations in looking for anything [as a reason] Some of the livestock prices, we think, reflect the late  -10-    5/19/87  winter weather and the snowstorms in the Midwest In lead and zinc markets, we've looked at Canadian strikes When you go through all of it, you can look at special factors The fact is simply that the markets have been very sensitized to inflationary expectations and sort of look for an opportunity to drive prices up But there are lots of special factors, and perhaps some reactions have been very much overdone It's clear to me that it's just heightened sensitivity to inflation at work  If you wish  Well, I don't have the monthly numbers, which may give a different pattern, but on a quarterly average basis for the first quarter all items less food and energy were up 44 percent at an annual rate; they were up 38 percent in the fourth quarter of 1986 When I mentioned non-petroleum import prices feeding through more visibly, in part our reading is in the CPI excluding food and energy, which we say is up 1/2 point or so in the recent numbers  Correct "
