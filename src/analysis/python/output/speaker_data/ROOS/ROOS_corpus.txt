  Mr Chairman, I would hope, after listening to this discussion, that whatever  action may be taken today, it is on the basis of weighing off the Memorandum of Discussion  against the Record of Policy Actions as to which of those would best serve the public and the  nation  I would hope that we wouldn’t make that kind of a decision based upon the lawsuit that  is now pending     The reason I say that is, I understand your statement as to time, but this lawsuit is one in  which there will either be an appeal taken very soon by this Committee, I should hope, and a  final decision as to what we have to release; or, in the alternative, I don’t see that we’ll be  plagued with having to go through the same process that you have had to go through with the  Secretary and General Counsel week after week  Therefore, I’d like to separate the decision  If  the Memorandum of Discussion should be done away with and there would be better service by  preparing a record, as has been suggested, I’d like the vote be taken on that principle alone     4/20/76 - 69 -            Just to express my own view on the issue, as I hope I framed it, I would opt  to do away with the Memorandum of Discussion, because it means nothing to me as a new  member, I guess  And it would be appropriate to have an expanded Record of Policy Actions,  which I think would serve very well  Of course, whether it is released within 30 days or 45 days  is another issue     Mr Chairman, in announcing this change and its [unintelligible] publicly,  will the rationale behind the change be explained or what will that rationale be--I mean in other  words, why does the public think we are doing this?    Mr Chairman, we in St Louis are conducting a regularly scheduled series of  meetings, not only with industrial economists from various industries but chief executive officers  of the largest industrial firms in the area, and their economists attend these meetings  We find  that they are most enthusiastic about participating  And as a result of their participation, not only  do we receive valuable information, but I think from the point of view of the image of the  System--these people are very flattered to be invited, and we found this to be very productive  both in terms of gathering information and in terms of further identifying the importance and  seriousness of our activities    Mr Chairman, couldn’t these contacts with industry not only [cover] the  subject of industrial capacity but inventory accumulation and capital spending plans, things like  that  I mean we get a lot of valuable information covering a broad spectrum from these regular  meetings that we have  I don’t think we have to limit it     Mr Chairman, briefly I think that if we have to take a step, then no time is  better than the present, and I would shudder to think if the appendix table 4 projections are valid   If we procrastinate and have to, in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next  year, face up to the sort of projection which is shown under alternative A and under alternative  B, table 4, I think that could have disastrous effects--it would be a clamping down that would be  really very painful to the economy  So I would agree with Mr Balles  If I were a voting  member, I would be a 4 to 7 man on M1, 5 to 9 on M2, and 5 to 6 on the federal funds range     Mr Chairman, may I just ask a question?  Is the significance of the lowering  of the upper end of the fed funds rate from 6 to 5-3/4 the psychological effect that the publication  of 6 versus 5-3/4 would have?  In other words, why do we tend to artificially restrict ourselves  from moving 1/4 of a point higher if circumstances in the aggregates dictated our doing that   Does that have a detrimental or a depressing psychological effect when it’s published?  Is that it?      Yes, that was my question    Briefly, if we are going to agree with the wisdom of a policy of temporary  pause, and if we do look ahead to the projections of rates in the 7-1/2 to 8 percent range, fourth  quarter [of 1976], first quarter of ‘77, I think we should be alert to the possible need to gradually  get toward those rate levels If I had my druthers as a voting member, I would prefer to see us go  to the 6 percent upper limit [on the federal funds rate] even though the Desk did not reach that  level  But we would certainly accept the wisdom for thirty days of sticking to 5-1/4 to 5-3/4   We would prefer narrower M1 and M2 ranges, reducing the upper limits of each of those  aggregates      I wonder if we should not be very aware of the public relations aspect of this  whole issue at a time when everybody from presidential candidates on down are harping on  openness and sunshine, etc, etc  From the point of view of our image with the public, it seems  to me that it is an awfully difficult thing to defend in the public arena that [we are] having this  record [made public only] after five years  I don’t suggest that we should flip flop, because I  don’t think we want to be frogs, but if I were a Reuss or a Proxmire, I could have a field day  exaggerating how secretive we are and how fearful we are and how we are dragged screaming to  the summons of sunshine     I think that, in the public arena and in the political arena, we’re vulnerable in these  positions we’re taking, but maybe the other concerns are far more compelling than just the public  relations or public image of it    Mr Chairman, please sir, may I ask that you read the first two or three  sentences of your report, just as a lead-in because--    I have the feeling in listening to this that the lead-in has a rather negative ring  to it and that everything that you referred to [later] in your report and Mr Gramley’s remarks are  much more positive    Excuse me, Mr Chairman, did you mean based on the quarterly adjustment  of the base or on the original--    Perhaps I should understand--if we were to take a position of maintaining the  same ranges and apply those to the first quarter base instead of moving it up, would that signal to  the public and to the markets a greater degree of restraint?  In other words, that wouldn’t give the  same impression that we’re holding the line?     Mr Chairman, I don’t share the pessimism that has been expressed by some,  and I base my impressions on some very extensive and real contacts that we’ve made in recent  weeks throughout our District  While some of you have traveled the distant lands, we’ve gone to  such exotic places as Evansville, Indiana; Columbia, Missouri; Quincy, Illinois  In these tours,  which we refer to as our Autumn Grand Tour in the Eighth District, we meet with bankers and     10/19/76 - 27 -   with businessmen, usually substantial businessmen  I’d say that we have touched base with  maybe 150 to 175 such people in the last five or six weeks, and we get a relatively optimistic  reaction from these people     Retailers in this area, oh, they are not setting records, but they look forward to expanding  sales later in the year  Our chemical firms, which are substantial, large, multinational firms, are  optimistic as they look into 1977 for maybe a 10 percent increase in their business in the 12  months ahead  A large manufacturer of motors is operating at full capacity  They’ve got a full  backlog, and generally, the input that we get from these sources is not one to result in  discouragement  And I wonder whether our problem might be that we are tending to be  somewhat shocked by comparing what has happened recently with what happened with the rate  of growth and the rate of the recovery after the trough of the recent recession     If you take, for example, GNP, and if our economists are correct, I’m told that over the  past five years, real GNP has grown an average of maybe 27 percent and that, over the past 40 to  50 years, the average has been, and I can’t substantiate these figures, about 3-1/2 percent annual  growth  So if we’re growing at 4 or a little over 4 percent, I’m not sure that this is the time to  pull the panic button     I might close by just pointing out one matter--maybe it should be reserved until our next  item on the agenda--but at the end of each of these meetings, we poll these people in a similar  way  We give them three mythical, or general, or simplistic alternatives  stimulating the  economy, or greater restraint, or holding the line  There was not one individual who indicated a  desire for economic--for monetary stimulus  The majority of them said, don’t rock the boat   And if there was any deviation from that, it was a little bit on the side of greater monetary  restraint  And for whatever it’s worth, those are real people and this is a recent--I did not mean  that, sir, in a--     I would prefer the 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for Ml, 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 on M2, and 4-1/2 to  5-1/4 on the federal funds rate      Mr Chairman, I prefer staying where we are       Mr Chairman, is there a vulnerability to us if there’s great variance [across  Reserve Banks], which I would assume there will be, in the style and depth in which minutes  [are written]--we’re stars, at present, in having taken minutes over the years that are absolutely  meaningless  Now, would he ridicule this and say that Presidents of the Reserve Banks do  nothing?    Mr Chairman, I would respond in this way, that I don’t think that this should  be interpreted to our boards in any way other than a ridiculous request coming--I refer not to our  Chairman--in other words, I think that the reaction of our directors will be one of great  indignation and that I would do little to disabuse them of that feeling  I would also think that if  this involves a lot of work, which it will, needless work, that someone on Mr Reuss’s  committee, a friendly individual, should know what we’re being called upon to do  Because I  think this can be used against Mr Reuss if we react intelligently  And, as I see it in the St Louis  case, it’s appalling how skimpy or meaningless our minutes are  I’m sure we did this with great  wisdom knowing that a man named Reuss would ask for them  The minutes are really terribly  shallow  Tell nothing    How do we protect ourselves from the reverse of giving meaningful  information to him?  If he has too little information, he comes back and says one of two things,  either we’re highly [unintelligible] in the case we do nothing, or we are so secretive in our  activities that we don’t dare put down our nefarious activities  I mean, it seems to me he’s got us  either way if he wants to play that game, and I don’t know--    I would very briefly like to report, Mr Chairman, that the head of one of the  largest retail food market chains in our part of the country reported that, for the first time in  several years, their industry is seeing a reemergence in artificial increases in prices, which he  attributed totally to an anticipation of the possible reimposition of price controls, with all types of  discount deals being offered as a means of keeping prices at their proper level but hedging  against the possibility of controls  And this was echoed in one or two of the other industrial  reports at our recent board meeting  I think it’s just interesting to put on the record    Second from last    Mr Chairman, if one of our purposes is to throw out signals and to affect  sentiment, I think it’s terribly important that we do not adopt a posture of very recognizable ease   Regardless of what we do, I think the primary attention of the economic community will be on  what the incoming Administration is going to do  I think the confidence of the business     11/16/76 - 43 -           community basically will depend on the determination--should the incoming Administration  move toward ease--[of] the willingness or a demonstration of the fact that the Federal Reserve is  going to stick by its guns  For us to feel that there would be a constructive reaction to a  recognizable easing by this [Committee], I think, is misjudging the ball game  I think that if we  were to signal something that amounts to significant ease, it would destroy confidence and would  be a deterrent to positive activity on the part of the business community     Structurally, I think that alternative A is less than acceptable if we believe in our long- range targets, because if we do accelerate the growth of M1 over the next two quarters, and if  we’re going to stick within our target range, it’s going to mean a substantial deceleration of M1  growth in the second and third quarters of next year  And a corresponding rise in the fed funds  rate--if we take this action today, if we do go the [alternative A] route, I think we could at least  say to ourselves that we will be prepared to bite the bullet in the middle of next year to correct  this course  I wonder whether we’re really prepared to do that     I support alternative B for the reasons that have been cited     12/20-21/76 - 70 -           Mr Chairman, may I just follow up on John Balles’s complications  Our  people feel very strongly that the projections of growth in the Greenbook are impossible to  achieve at the rate of money growth which is assumed in those projections  We feel that our  model, although it probably has been frozen in recent weeks--I’m glad that John comes from a  warmer climate than we--projects about 1 percentage point less in the rate of real growth in the  year ahead than the staff here projects, and I think maybe it’s just important to reiterate the  possibility of differences of opinion on this subject    Fuel injection has been changed recently     Mr Chairman, does the emphasis that we’re placing on this argument on  whether or not members of the FOMC are appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate,  does that strengthen Mr Reuss’s position on the appointment of Reserve Bank Presidents, and  will that stimulate further efforts on his part, based on this Government in the Sunshine issue, to  try to force through Congress the bill that he was unable to get out of the Committee last year?   Is that--    Well, I become a voting member possibly next month, so I’ll keep my  powder dry, Mr Chairman  B is fine, though      May I borrow Mr Zeisel?  Do you feel comfortable you’ve projected a  growth through the four quarters for this year in GNP of about 6-1/4 percent?  And I assume  that’s predicated on M1 and M2 growth roughly in the middle of the ranges that are presently set   Our evidence indicates that it would be difficult to reach that goal  We show projections of  maybe 4-1/2 percent GNP growth using our present midranges, or conversely, having to maybe  increase growth in M1 and M2 to maybe 7 and 11-1/2 percent to achieve that target--which is, of  course, the stated target of the Administration--unless there is exceptionally high growth in  velocity  Do you feel comfortable with that 6-1/4 percent projection?    It assumes the rate of growth in velocity, which is sort of historically high,  isn’t it?    In connection with this, just last week the head of one of our very large  industries with significant activity in the western part of the nation said that, as important as the  continued drought in that part of the country might be as an effect on food prices, they feel that  there’s a terribly serious possibility of a drought affecting the generation of electrical energy,  with the very real possibility of plants having to actually curtail operations due to an inadequate  supply of energy as a result of the low water in the dams  Now this is just an aside, but he was  very strong in this    Well, I have nothing of value to add other than to say that I’m fully agreeable  with 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1; 7 to 11 on M2; and perhaps the upper limit of the fed funds rate  placed at 5-1/4     Early in the meeting, the Chairman referred to the energy package and to the  possible effects of it  And as we discussed your projections, obviously automobiles sales and  similar factors were cited as reasons for positive interpretation of what may happen  Are we  going to get into any significant discussions on the effect that the energy package, at least as  anticipated or reported, might have on all of these factors?  Or has it been taken into  consideration in--    No sir, I don’t mean to go on--    I would disagree with my good friend, Bob Mayo  It seems to me that the  time couldn’t be better for a more meaningful reduction in these aggregates figures  The  President has enunciated a desire to get to 4 percent in a couple of years in terms of rate of  inflation [and] dropped the stimulus package  It is almost unanimous that what the economy  needs, or at least what business needs to move it ahead, is an indication that everyone is serious  about dealing with the problem of inflation  It seems to me that if we were to follow in this  direction, that if Congress took unwise action which would have a detrimental economic result in  the sort of energy legislation that it passed, it seems to me that by our doing this, there would be  less of a reason for Congress to do anything that would artificially stand in the way of stable  economic growth     And I just feel that this would reinforce confidence in the economy, it would reinforce  what the President and the Administration said they want to do, and would reinforce the  confidence that the public might have in the fact that we’re really serious about what we want to  do  It is a matter of degree, but I don’t really see the reason, or at least I can’t reconcile myself  to anything but a compelling reason to take the step that you felt a few days ago before the     4/19/77 - 27 -           energy problem arose, or before the program was brought to your attention  I’d like to see us go  more strongly    Mr Chairman, may I just inquire the impact that the Chairman sees--the  possible impact of the energy proposal would be inflationary--could you just reiterate that?  I’m  a little lost as to why--     I’d just like to say ditto to that      Mr Chairman, I think a similar phenomenon is occurring, as Bob Mayo has  said, in bank loans to farmers  These loans are frequently predicated on the value of the land,  which has been speculatively bid up terribly and unrealistically high in Illinois and Missouri and  places like that  And the farmer’s ability to repay in many instances is limited by the income that  he can earn off of working that land   There is an imbalance developing due to the extent of credit the bank is willing to make  and extend and the inability of the farmer to work his land in a manner to service that loan,  which is really a larger loan than he normally would be entitled to because of the speculative  increase in value of the land  If this bubble bursts, it could be terribly serious to the agricultural  economy, as I understand      But this is also happening in farm land, a very similar occurrence  It isn’t  just residential property, that type of speculation  I think the land that Mr Mayo speaks of has  been bid up unrealistically, and it has [been] in Missouri and some of these other areas  [unintelligible]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  We feel a greater concern of danger at the upside  than we do at the downside  I personally don’t share the concern that has been expressed this  morning that there could be a slight slackening in the rate of in the recovery  I think if the  recovery continues to move ahead at its present rate over a prolonged period of time, we’d have a  greater problem than if there were a moderate slackening of that     Specifically, I would subscribe to the Chairman’s ranges for M1 and M2  Philosophically  and for other reasons, I resist a narrowing of the funds range, and I would prefer to see 5-1/4 to 6  percent  We don’t have to use the 6 percent, but it’s there  We have a--probably isn’t too  relevant--but we have a large cemetery in St Louis, Mr Chairman, which I passed on the way to  the airport, which advertises its plots by saying it is better to have and not need than to need and  not have, and if there is a need to go to 6 percent, maybe it’s better [that it] be there     Roos agrees     We have continuing meetings with major heads and treasurers of our major  corporations in the area  They are optimistic, but I think we are overlooking, at least from my  point of view, one issue there--they are certainly disturbed about regulation, they are certainly  disturbed about uncertainties--but the one underlying concern that they have expressed to us is  their concern about prices and about inflation  We have not met one of these individuals--and  this is not an exaggeration, we have been with scores of them--who has not said, “For heaven     6/21/77 - 11 -         sakes, do everything you can to protect us from further inflation”  Now, I don’t think that factor  has been given sufficient--maybe credence is the wrong word--but attention this morning  I  think that worries them as much as energy  That worries them as much as regulation  And they  don’t see a real pattern, they don’t have real optimism over the long pull as to the probability that  our inflation rate is really being reduced      Mr Chairman, I would like to speak in behalf of the alternative C pattern, for  a couple of reasons  It is obvious that our aggregates are at the upper portion, the upper limits,  even beyond the upper limits, [of the] long-term ranges  If we are going to get these down, we  are going to have to, somewhere along the line, make a correction, unless we determine in July     6/21/77 - 31 -         to again raise the base from which we project these ranges  And if we do that, if the ball game is  similar to where it is today, I think we will find ourselves at a dangerously high range for the  aggregates     If we are going to have to make a correction, it seems to me that, if we do it at a time when  businesses are relatively strong, we create less of a reaction in the business community and less  of a potential reaction psychologically  If, for example, in the latter half of the year, due to  capacity constraints, there is a turndown in the economy--if we move at that time to make such  an adjustment downward in our aggregate targets, I think it will be a much more difficult time to  bite the bullet than if we do it now  And even though we see a great deal of confidence today,  we do see the possibility of a significant turndown in the last half of the year  We think it would  be awfully difficult to make this adjustment later on, and I’d just like to, for whatever my  opinion is worth, express a preference for C    You want a showing of hands, Mr Chairman?     Mr Chairman, may I talk  In focusing on your capacity level, have you  taken cognizance of the full pack of energy regulations and anything like that, which could  reduce that capacity level below the 88?    But your projection is basically exclusive of those problems, but it may have  reduced them?    Mr Chairman, I find myself puzzled somewhat by our process  Having  participated in these meetings for about a year and a half, I have been unable to really define, or     7/19/77 - 29 -    have defined for me, the objectives in terms of how we actually quantify what we think to be a  satisfactory rate of growth in output  At each of these meetings, to the extent of my recollection,  there has always been a great sense of uncertainty even when the recovery was proceeding at a  faster level than maybe it is or will be in the immediate future  There [were] expressions of  concern, or there were at that time, that the recovery was proceeding too quickly  Then I hear  expressions of concern that it’s not going to continue at the pace that it was during the earlier  phases of the recovery     And what frustrates me, and I may have totally misunderstood, is that we are trying to  carry out our responsibilities of setting monetary policy without having any agreed-upon specific  targets that we are trying to achieve in terms of the growth targets  I mean, would we be happy  if we saw a rate of growth of output persist forever and a day at 6 percent even if it meant  increased inflation?  It seems to me we are trying to steer the ship--and I say this not in a critical  matter, but I am confused by it--without actually having agreed what we think the rate of growth  of output should be  Or at least what we are seeking in that regard as an acceptable rate of  increase in prices and these other fundamental factors  I think we peck away at it, we express  uncertainties each month, but do we have some real guidepost that we’re shooting toward?  Or  am I terribly off base in not understanding exactly where we are going?    Mr Chairman, I would echo what has been said by the past two or three  speakers  I feel strongly that the upper range of M1 should be reduced, and I would subscribe to  the 4 to 6 percent range in M1; 7 to 9 in M2  I personally do not feel that it would avoid some  reduction in the rate of [economic] growth, even if we expanded these aggregates ranges,  because on the basis of [unintelligible] capacity constraints, we see a reduction in the rate of  growth occurring anyway     But those would be my sentiments regarding the two Ms  And if some reduction in the  rate of growth were to occur, I don’t think that we should ever accept the responsibility for that  having occurred because of this move, if we make it  I think it would occur anyway    Mr Chairman, just for clarification  I’m just speaking of M1  I am led to  believe that if we maintain the upper the limit where it has been--6-1/2 percent--and if we     7/19/77 - 45 -    operate from a new base as a result of this base drift, then, even with a reduction of 1/2 percent  in the lower limit, this would accelerate M1 growth by approximately 1 percent  Which would  have the effect, a couple of years down the road--if there is any relationship between the growth  of the M1 aggregate and the price level--of probably increasing the price level predicated on that  relationship by just slightly less than 1 percent     Does the reduction of the lower limit of this range from 4-1/2 to 4 obviate this acceleration  of M1 growth and probable acceleration of the rate of inflation at a time when we’re trying to  inch these things down?  I mean, isn’t that essentially the scenario that we would be buying if we  agree to raise the base and stick with the 6-1/2 percent upper limit?    Is it possible, Mr Chairman, to really convince the world--which I think  looks to you, sir, as perhaps the only effective obstacle to continued acceleration of inflation--is  it possible to convince them that, [while] we really aren’t doing anything with our long-range  targets to materially affect this situation--having left the upper part of the longer-range target  where it is--that we really are going to achieve this miracle by doing it with our short-range  targets?  Is anybody going to believe that?  Is that going to affect anything?    I’m really not  I’m taking a five-quarter period, first quarter of ’76 to the  second quarter of ’77, where M1 has grown at 6-1/2 percent--the last three quarters at 66  percent, and the last quarter at 88  If that doesn’t reflect a trend of acceleration, an upward  trend, I can’t--I’m misreading the figures    Mr Chairman, I would support the M1 and M2 ranges under C  I’d like to  express support for a federal funds rate of 5-1/4 to 6     Mr Chairman, I find myself, as a non-economist, somewhat confused  In  looking back over the year and a half that I’ve had the privilege of attending these meetings, and  listening to inputs such as we’re presently providing, that year and a half in terms of business  conditions has been a strong period  We’ve had basically good business, we’ve had strong  output nationally     And yet, I think with the exception, perhaps, of one or two meetings, as we go around the  table, so many of us have attempted to express concerns and doubts and rather pessimistic  attitudes toward what is in our minds; we imagine [things] of a negative nature to be lurking just  around the corner  And one of the things that confuses me is what seems to be somewhat of an     8/16/77 - 12 -           absence of a real definition of what we would consider to be a healthy economy  I mean, we  speak in relative terms so often  And if we feel that a slowdown in output from a 7 percent rate  of growth to 5-1/2 is something that is really bad, that [it] should be a cause for alarm, then  perhaps we have a right to feel some concern about where we’re going    Well, sir, am I correct to assume that if our economy does better than what it  has over the average of 10 or 15 years, that we’re really apparently in a fairly comfortable  condition?  I mean, what I’m getting to, and then I’ll hush up, sir, is that I think that the public  generally, that the business community, tends to be overly pessimistic about what is occurring  and what has occurred  I think that perhaps this is due partially to what Phil Jackson referred to,  which is an almost unanimous attitude in our part of the country, that regardless of what  happens, this inflationary potential is of great concern to everybody     But I wonder whether there isn’t an absence, both within our own group here as well as  within the leadership in the nation, of people with credibility who are expressing or stressing the  positive instead of the negative  I feel that what is happening is not a subject of justifiable  concern economically, in the interpretation of the economy  I can be terribly wrong in this, I’m  not a professional  But I think everybody tends to look negatively on what may be happening  instead of considering that, in historical perspective, the performance is and has been pretty  good    Mr Chairman, we have a director who is a high executive in Holiday Inn,  and this came up at our meeting last week, and I regret that I don’t recall the precise statistic, but  the hotel and motel and travel industry has had--last year was up considerably in terms of  volume from previous years--this man’s a walking encyclopedia, and he can give us enough--but  they have had a strong year in the industry basically    Mr Chairman, may I ask a question?  Don’t we have the ability to control the  growth of M1, especially if we are willing to let fed funds rates and interest rates rise?  Do we  predict these things, or do we control them?    Mr Chairman, I would subscribe almost verbatim to the rationale expressed  by John Balles, and specifically I would prefer an M1 range of 0 to 4 percent growth; M2, 4 to 8;  and fed funds range, broaden to 5-3/4 to 6-3/4     I think that anyone who views the inflationary trend as just a temporary monetary shock or  something that’s been very short lived--on page 5 of the Bluebook, it shows us that, for several  years, there has been a continuing trend toward an acceleration of growth of the monetary  aggregates  past 12 months, M1, 71; past 6 months, 83; past month, 183  That is certainly a     8/16/77 - 49 -           disturbing trend, and I am very fearful that it isn’t going to be long until people who watch these  things will feel that they have reason to expect a return of severe inflationary tendencies as a  result of the growth of the aggregates  So I lean toward the greatest degree of restraint possible,  even if it means an increase in interest rates     In terms of the discount rate, I would subscribe to a 1/2 point increase just as quickly as it  could be done    Why don’t we do what Tom suggested, Mr Chairman, and give Joe another  shot at feeling them out, in effect  Seeing whether he can get any clear indication of whether or  not they intend to take it to court before we make a decision in a vacuum     In our efforts to hold short rates down, the present tendency of the aggregates  to increase persists  Isn’t it logical to expect that long-term rates will move upward in  anticipation of inflation?    Don’t you think that it’s partially due to the fact that the market believes that  we are determined to avoid inflation?    Mr Chairman, but isn’t the monetary base expanding in an alarming fashion,  66, 79, 88, 96 [unintelligible]?    Mr Chairman, may I ask a question of you?  I find myself confused again  hearing some of the explanations as to exogenous factors that may have caused the aggregates to  perform as they did  We frequently explain after the fact certain things that have happened that  have caused these things to fluctuate beyond our targets and our goals  Aren’t we, in conducting  monetary policy--and I ask this sincerely, I’m new and I really am mixed up on this--aren’t we  supposed to really exert some control on these events, or do we in effect react after the fact to  things that have happened that we’re sorry happened?  In other words, is it not possible, by the  adroit conduct of monetary policy, for this Committee to have a very real effect on the trend of  M1 and M2 instead of explaining afterwards why they did expand beyond what we  wanted--what were our targets  I don’t know if I’m making my question clear, but I find myself  frustrated sometimes in this regard    Mr Chairman, I’m not--if our stated and, I assume, understood objective is to  gradually inch down the rate of inflation, and this has been often repeated, don’t we have some  commitment to that goal even if it means some temporary dislocations of interest rate levels and  things like that?  I mean, in other words, isn’t that part of our mission, too?    And inflation    Mr Chairman, is it not possible that, with our preoccupation in keeping  interest rates down, we’re pumping an awful lot of money into this--    Well, can we have it, sir, can one have it both ways?  In other words, can we  have low interest rates and low rates of aggregates growth, or are these things inconsistent and  doesn’t one have to make a choice sometimes of not trying to have the best of both worlds?    They are?    Mr Chairman, I would like to make several observations about what I’ve  heard  First of all, it seems to me that there has not been any significant deterioration of  economic conditions since a month ago, when we met here and adopted an M1 range of 0 to 5  percent  I’m at a loss [as] to [how to] accept the logic of that and then see us view conditions as  a reason for adjusting the range significantly up from what it was [as a result of] the action we  took a month ago  I think we ought to just look for a moment and at least be aware of the  consequences--if we are going to be responsible in what we are doing--of anything like a 7  percent rate of growth of M1 for the next 30 days, for the next month  And I am using the staff  projections     John Balles touched upon the fact that the staff projects that for the first six months of ’78,  we’d have to pull M1 [growth] down to something less than 3 percent  I assume that we would  be willing to do that to move this thing in the right direction  If we take the 5-1/2 percent  [fourth] quarter projection of the staff, [and] if we adopt 7 percent M1 growth for the month of  October, that means that in November and December we must be prepared to move down to  something like 2-1/2 percent for both of those months to average out at [the staff’s fourth-quarter  projection of] 5-1/2 percent, which is a spectacularly remedial effort to readjust these bulges that  we have been experiencing     If we are concerned that taking strong action now would precipitate an economic trauma, I  think we should be aware that, somewhere along the line, unless we are going to throw in the     9/20/77 - 51 -   towel in what we are trying to do and on what has been our stated objective--to inch this  inflationary problem down--we are going to have to do this sooner or later  And it seems to me  that history is replete with cases of what happens when you let this thing continue to drift on an  upward basis and then have to pull it down a year or two hence  We will have at that time the  same type of traumatic consequence to the economy that we are so fearful of today  I think that  there is no question in my judgment--I’m not an economist--that if we permit a continuation of  the sort of growth of the aggregates that we have experienced the last two quarters, that just as  sure as we are sitting here today, two years down the road we are going to have an increase in  prices, we are going to have a resumption of an upward trend in the rate of inflation     I think this matter of credibility is important  I think people are watching us  I think it is  only due to the great respect, Mr Chairman, that they have for you that the markets still believe  that this Committee is serious in its attempt to do what is necessary to deal with this inflationary  problem  If we let the upward drift of M1, and M2 to a lesser degree, continue, I think it’s a  matter of months, maybe, until they say [that] we are not really serious in what we say, we are  really not as concerned about ultimate inflation as we say we are  And if we lose that credibility,  I think we are going to have higher interest rates  Long-term rates are going to go up just as  soon as people lose their confidence or disbelieve [in our] sincerity or our ability to do what we  say we are trying to do  I think this is a very critical time     I’m sorry, I apologize for making a speech  I didn’t mean to do that, but I cannot buy a top  range of anything like 7 percent [for M1]  I would recommend a repetition of the 0 to 5 percent  M1 range that we had last meeting  I’m not terribly concerned--I would certainly agree with  your M2 targets  And I think that if I had my druthers, I would like to see a fed funds range of  maybe 6 to 7 percent, at least 6 to 6-3/4 percent     I think this is a critical time, and I think we are going to have to bite the bullet ultimately,  and I would like to bite it today    Yes sir    Mr Chairman, the trend during this patience operation has gone the opposite  direction  My concern--and I would like to explain, to clear the air, that St Louis is not falling  into a maverick position  I have a very honest and sincere belief that we are doing the wrong  thing  It’s not a matter of a few numbers  I mean, in the case of my vote, the only way, sir, I  could in good conscience vote yes on this would be if there were some lowering of the upper  range of the aggregates, especially in the M1 category    I don’t know that this has been the history in the last few months  The action  hasn’t kept this thing from being at the very top of the range     Mr Chairman, on last Thursday, we were in Louisville with the individual  that heads up the appliance division of General Electric  And their projections are very much in  terms of what they anticipate for the housing industry, and they were almost indescribably  positive in their attitudes for the next year to 18 months  They were programming on very, very  strong housing and setting their production schedules of major appliances accordingly    Whether I feel more optimistic or equally optimistic, we have met with  businessmen in our District, some of whom have national and international operations, in the last  couple of weeks  And literally none of them cite any weaknesses or any significant weaknesses   By and large, most of them are optimistic, most of them report having inventories well under  control  Loan demand in our area is strong, and basically, I would share in readings we get,  which are both Midwest--Eighth District--as well as national reflections  Nothing that would  make me other than reasonably optimistic    May I inquire, Mr Chairman?    Are we relating our projections, our opinions as to future economic activity  on the premise that was used in the staff projections of 5-1/4 percent M1 growth from the third  quarter of 1977?  My question is, it would seem to me that monetary policy decisions should  have some effect on any economic projection, and are we assuming in this exercise that we’re  buying, for purposes of our opinion, the staff [forecast] based upon 5-1/4 percent M1 growth,  which is considerably below what we’ve had?  Is that the rules of the game, Mr Chairman?    Mr Chairman?    Following that same line, and maybe this is too hypothetical for you to  answer  What degree of increase in the aggregates would cause you to cease the--     I said what--how far would the aggregates have to go before Peter pressed  the panic button--     Mr Chairman I would prefer ranges roughly similar to alternative C, with a 4  to 6 percent for the M1 target and M2 and M3 reduced to either the alternative C proportions or  others that have been mentioned  I would support a reduction of M2 and M3, and a maintenance  of our current M1 range  I could not support a widening of the M1 ranges or an increase in the  upper level of the current M1 range     My rationale is as follows  First of all, I see emerging in this discussion today two  issues--the attention we should pay to the real economy on one hand and the issue of credibility  on the other  I really find difficulty in separating those issues because it seems to me that the  credibility of the Federal Reserve, or the interpretation by the public of the extent to which we  are determined to control inflation, will probably have as big an impact as anything possibly can  on the course of the real economy  We have met with many industrialists in our District, and at  the very top of their priority concerns, which they say have a very real impact on their economic  planning, their investment decisions, is the question of where is inflation going to go, and this is  what they inevitably say  “Are you really going to do what you say you’re going to do?  Are you  going to come to grips with this, or are you going to equivocate?”     I believe, and I’m not nearly as experienced as the rest of you, that monetary policy, the  decisions we make around this table, can in a real way affect the growth of the aggregates  I  cannot accept what I’ve heard frequently today, that we’re not able to manage the aggregates  I  would support what I think was Chuck’s allusion and Willis Winn’s suggestion; I really think, if  we find that we can’t control the aggregates, or that we can’t control the aggregates and at the  same time control the fed funds range as we’d like to control it, then I think--not today--but I  think we should give serious consideration to withdrawing from targeting aggregates  Because I  think one of the most destructive aspects of our activities as far as credibility is concerned--and I  repeat that our credibility is the only hope the real economy has of seeing business commit itself  to future economic growth--I think that we harm our credibility terribly by setting these targets  and either not doing everything we could do to achieve them--I’m talking about the aggregates  targets--or in a very purposeful way setting these targets and really not doing everything we can  to achieve those targets     So with that pontification, which is probably not terribly impressive, I would say that  alternative C would be the best in my judgment  That the maintenance of the current M1 rate,     10/17-18/77 - 53 -         reduction of M2 and M3 would be acceptable  I would think that we’d be laughed out of the ball  park if we do anything to raise the upper rate of M1 under these circumstances    I would suggest alternative B or C for M1 and M2, fed funds rate 6-1/2 to 7,  and an aggregates directive    If strong credit demands push that fed funds rate up quite abruptly, then it  can always be reconsidered  Is that the thought?     Mr Chairman, I just throw this out for a thought  Concurrently with taking  the legal steps that Mr O’Connell suggests, concurrently with feeling out members of the  Congress for statutory relief, what would happen if just in this one instance we did what the  appellate court suggests--for example, at the end of today’s meeting, made this public and tested  the market reaction  If the market reaction were as we anticipated it to be and [strengthened] our  concern about not having the 30-day delay, wouldn’t that strengthen and--in other words, if     11/15/77 - 6 -         something of an undesirable nature occurred, if we made this announcement immediately, then  wouldn’t that strengthen our case with the Congress and possibly with the courts?  Is that a  totally unrealistic--I’m just throwing it out?  What if we let it all occur on a one- shot basis?    Mr Chairman, I agree totally with the position that you’ve stated, appealing  it, and doing everything we can with Congress  But in considering contingencies, is it not  possible for us to review, in line with what Mark Willes says, whether our strategy should be  based automatically on an assumption that we’re doing the best for ourselves and for the world  by attempting to resist what the court has mandated to the extent that we can?  Or couldn’t there  be some effort quickly to at least test those who are in the market--traders and others--to see  whether our basic strategy of playing the game as you have all of these years is sound?  In other  words, is it possible in developing contingency plans to at least take just a short look at the basic  strategy of conducting ourselves with the uncertainty that Mark Willes refers to  I’m not trying  to just belabor the point that he made, but I’m not sure that the sky will fall in if we change our  policies, and that’s--    Mr Chairman, would the Chairman request Mr Holmes that he communicate  with the [Sub]committee on the Directive any possible conclusions that he might reach in terms  of the basic advantages and/or disadvantages of changing our whole basic strategy?  So that the  [Sub]committee on the Directive does not do its work totally on the assumption that we want to  change the directive to accommodate our present strategy, should Mr Holmes come up with a  different solution    We basically find no substantial disagreement with the staff projections  The  economy is strong in our District  We find in conversation with businessmen that their main  concern is uncertainty--not only uncertainty with government actions; it also includes  uncertainty about inflationary expectations  We would find a 41 or 42 [percent] rate of output  growth in the latter part of 1978 to be quite satisfactory in relation to historical progression       11/15/77 - 28 -         We do have one local situation that might be of passing interest to you, and that is, in the  state of Tennessee a couple of months ago, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that the top  permissible interest rate in that state should be 10 percent  As a result of this, consumer finance  companies have fled the state almost totally, and bank installment credit has dried up, and  automobile sales--just to give you an example of how these things work--are off more than 20  percent in Tennessee  Any consumer financed items have shown a severe decline in volume   And that really has very little to do with national policy, but it is of interest in terms of what  happens when something goes haywire in court rulings, not only as they pertain to the Federal  Reserve    Steve, is not a possible factor that the money was pumped in to keep short- term interest rates from rising more than they have?  We don’t mention that; isn’t that a factor  that conceivably could have caused this bulge in M1?    Mr Chairman, I would support the Chairman’s alternative B with a 1 to 6  [percent] M1 range  I would just remind the Committee that in spite of last night’s football  game, Mr Chairman, we don’t have the St Louis football team in the Super Bowl  And  [likewise] I’m not sure--recognizing that we had an 86 percent average growth in M1 over the  last three quarters, even using the projected figures of the staff, accepting those--that we should  feel too comfortable as a result of the last week or two that we’re out of the wilderness  So I  would support alternative B [with] 1 to 6, but I don’t think I would want to go home and boast to  my wife that I’d got the job done as yet     Mr Chairman, I have a question, and then I’d like to briefly comment  I’d  like to direct this to Governor Partee  Just who would be harmed or what are the damaging  consequences, damaging to whom, if the market were to move rather abruptly 1/2 point up, and     12/19-20/77 - 17 -         what is the advantage of our not--if I understood Frank Morris correctly--are we really in the  business of trying to fool the market or to control the market?  In other words, what is our fear of  having a more free movement of the market?  Who will be hurt?     As I read these responses of some of the traders, I have the feeling that some of our more  sophisticated traders might not be as comfortable as they presently are, but I’m not sure we are in  the business of protecting them  What is the dangerous consequence of having a more free  movement of interest rates?    You know, Mr Chairman, I see one salutary effect of this Merrill decision,  and that is that it is forcing us--at least for the first time since I’ve been on this group or at least  [since I have] been able to understand a little of what we’re doing--I think it’s forcing us to  actually consider some fundamental policy questions, such as the relative weight that we place  on targeting on interest rates vis à vis the weight that we give to achieving the ranges of  aggregates growth     I think that it may be obvious to some of us that there is some inconsistency between our  efforts to set interest rate targets and [our efforts to set] ranges for the growth of the aggregates,  and I get the feeling that your [sub]committee’s recommendation essentially targets in on the  interest rates and says, maybe by holding up, doing this in two steps, we’ll be able at least to  accommodate what the reaction is in terms of aggregates movements so that we won’t look as  though we’ve missed the boat on either one of these two objectives  Are we, within our family,  are we essentially choosing the interest rate route and hoping the other will fall in line?      If the aggregates, sir, were to overshoot in a manner that concerned us, would  we be prepared to adjust the interest rate?    What if we did exactly what we’re doing now, except announce immediately,  and if there were a temporary disruption [then see] if that disruption would not give us grounds  to seek remedial action in the Congress  In other words, we are being driven to this by people  beyond our control; in [our] complying with the law, Mr Merrill has pushed us into this  This  isn’t our doing, and if for 30 days there was some disarray or disruption in the markets, wouldn’t  this give the Chairman the best possible reason to go to the Congress and say, look, we are doing  what we are forced to do--look what’s happened  If it doesn’t happen, then all of our discussion  today is for naught  If we did have disruption because of this Merrill action, why don’t we let it  show?  It is not our doing    Why, you are a gentleman, Mr Chairman    Scott, is it the relative rate of inflation or the trend rate of inflation that  affects the value of the dollar?  In other words, isn’t the effort expended by the various nations to  control inflation and the success of that effort more of a factor than the rate of inflation in the  various countries?    I had a question, Mr Chairman  When Mr Zeisel reported, he alluded to two  factors that confused me somewhat  One was the anticipated drop in real GNP from maybe a 47  percent rate to something in the lower 4 percent position, and you stated that this probably won’t  do much about unemployment  And the question that comes to me--as I understand, two of our  objectives in establishing goals for monetary policy are maintaining economic growth and doing  whatever realistically can be done to keep unemployment at a reasonably low level     What do we see, Mr Chairman, as realistic goals, I mean for these two aspects of our  economy?  It seems to me that when we say we are not going to be able to do much about  unemployment, you cited the record amount of people that are employed  Is it conceivable that  we have accomplished miracles in dealing with unemployment, that we really have gotten it  nearly as low, with the expanding labor force, as could be expected?  And, if average annual real  GNP growth in the last 30 years has been, maybe, 3-1/2 percent, is it true that real GNP growth  [at] maybe something over 4, 4-1/2 percent is a pretty good batting average?     The question I raise is, in making our monetary policy decisions, are we realistic in what  we’re trying to accomplish, or do we feel that we always are doing poorly vis à vis  unemployment and that any reduction in real GNP, even though it’s considerably above what has  been the average economic growth factor for our nation, that these things are unsatisfactory  Do  we have any feeling in that regard?    Mr Chairman, but aren’t those sort of structural problems?  In other words,  if I understand the purpose of this exercise that we are involved in, [it] is to try to develop some  facts from which we will make our later decision with regard to monetary policy  I doubt  whether--and I don’t say this in a quarrelsome way--but it’s questionable whether monetary  policy, per se, can solve the particularly high unemployment problems amongst blacks or--    And so I wonder whether we don’t have to be realistic in what we think  we’ve accomplished in reducing unemployment, or cannot be accomplished; and whether we  don’t have to be realistic in where we are pinpointing and attempting to get real GNP growth, if  we are going to relate that to a later monetary decision  What I’m saying is, should we be  depressed about the present, or should we be expansionarily inclined in our monetary policy?   Because real GNP [growth] is somewhere between 4 and 4-1/2 [percent] and unemployment is  where it is, and I get the feeling that whenever there is any movement downward in real GNP,  even though it may be at, historically, relatively satisfactory levels, we tend to feel that this is a  reason why, an hour from now, we might take a more expansionary monetary policy posture    Those are long term and short term?    Mr Chairman, I’m troubled by the upper limit of the M1 range  As I  calculate it, in the Bluebook projection, they project first-quarter money growth at about a 5-1/2,  56 percent annual rate  If we permit M1 to grow at anything like 8, 8-1/2 to 9 percent, and if it  should get to the top of the range, which certainly has happened frequently during the past year,  it would mean, in order to achieve anything like a 56 percent rate of growth for the first quarter  of 1978, we would have to force M1 to grow at 0, or to remain at 0 growth in both February and  March of next year     And so I think one of the problems--I could buy the 2-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range if I firmly  understood that the Desk would permit fed funds to increase if it felt that M1 growth was  exceeding 6-1/2 percent  If I understood Peter correctly before, he said that under a money  market directive, the trigger point, or whatever we might want to call it, of the Desk taking  action on fed funds is the upper part of the top limit of the range, normally  And that under an  aggregates directive, they really don’t respond or react until it gets within about 1 point, if I  understood what you said, of the top of the M1 range     I believe firmly that we would be making a mistake to permit M1 to grow at a faster rate  than 6-1/2 percent over the next 30 days  I would be able to buy 2-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent if I were  assured that we were really serious about a midpoint between the upper and lower part of those  ranges  But if my interpretation of what Mr Sternlight said is true, and if we could quite  probably get to a 7-1/2 or 8-1/2 percent rate of growth before we moved on fed funds, I would  have a very difficult time going along with that upper end of the range     I’d like to see the upper end of the M1 range 6-1/2 percent, or as an alternative, make  certain that we agree, and that the Desk be directed, in whatever way it can be, to act before M1  could reach the upper part of this 2-1/2 to 8-1/2 or 2-1/2 to 9 percent range    Yes, certainly    Could the response--coming to the extent that we can anticipate what might  happen--does that response have to be delayed until it’s within 1 percentage point?  I don’t--     12/19-20/77 - 72 -          Well, Mr Chairman, if I may, if we do view potential inflation late next year  or early in ’79 as a serious problem, if business is concerned about inflation--which certainly  everything we hear in our District implies that it is--if we feel that the economy is fairly strong,  and with the growth of money that has occurred over the past three or four quarters, if we do not  take advantage of this opportunity in some way to at least put a top limit on money growth,  which would preclude a continuation of the same rate of money growth, [that rate] could be  inflationary a year hence  So I think we are missing a golden opportunity to take remedial  action, and whichever way it can be accomplished, I just think to let M1 grow more than 6-1/2  percent in the next 30 days would be a terrible mistake      Well, Mr Chairman, if there is this fuzziness and this uncertainty, then why  don’t we retreat from spending the time and effort that we do on the aggregates, and why don’t  we just tell the world--I don’t mean this in a disrespectful way--but why don’t we go the fed  funds route instead of trying to imply--I think the world believes that M1 and M2 are important,  that they are fairly accurate, and that we really give a great deal of attention to attempting to  control M1 and M2 to some extent  If M1 and M2 are fuzzy, and if they are relatively less  meaningful than the interest rate targets that we set, why don’t we just tell people that that’s the  case and therefore--    Is there not a problem--and I would agree on the short run--is there not a  problem of the accumulative effect of a lot of short run--    A question, Mr Chairman    Am I correct in assuming that if we adopt a money market directive, that  there is a greater delay in action by the Desk?  In other words, that we have a greater possibility  [with a money market directive] of reaching the upper level of whatever ranges we adopt  [unintelligible] than if we have an aggregates directive?    Is it possible, Mr Chairman, is it procedurally correct, that we take the vote  on the directive prior to the range?     Larry Roos, St Louis       Can I ask two questions?  Perhaps they are naive and reflect my lack of  knowledge in this field  First of all, if there were a further substantial decline in the exchange value  of the dollar under circumstances such as you described, what are the practical problems associated  with that?  And the second question, if I may, [relates to] signaling to the world our determination  to take actions that will in the long run reduce the inflationary trend of our economy as related to  other economies involved in dollar exchange transactions  If we from a monetary policy point of  view signaled in a meaningful way, in a dramatic way, corrective action in terms of reducing  money growth or something like that, is that a major factor that could affect the value of the dollar?   Or is that just one of many factors that are equally important in terms of establishing the dollar’s  value?      If intervention in support of the dollar were to discontinue and there was a   further substantial drop in the value of the dollar, does that have all kinds of frightening--     Mr Chairman, is there any problem in terms of communication to the world   and the press as to why we are postponing [the decision on the long-run ranges] for a month?  [I  wouldn’t want] our friends throughout the world to say that it’s our inability or our confusion [that  led to the postponement]  In other words, is there a problem in terms of the market?      In terms of the attitudes of the businessmen in our District, they have been   concerned for the past year about our ability and the economy’s ability to come to grips with  inflation   That is unquestionably their number one concern  Whereas their sentiment has not  changed, those who have followed carefully developments in monetary policy, at least in our area,  are losing some confidence in our willingness or our determination to do what they feel is  necessary to come to grips with inflation in the 12, 24, or 36 months ahead  That’s where some     1/17/78             31  pessimism is occurring because they see the growth rate in money having persisted above our  ranges for nearly 12 months or more now  And that is recognized, at least in our neck of the  woods, if I can use that expression, as a harbinger of inflation  If there has been an increase in the  negative attitude on the part of leaders of our larger businesses it has been [because of] concern  about this inflation problem      Mr Chairman, in my judgment the prospect of inflation remains as serious as it   has ever been  M1, as we know, has grown more than 7 percent for the last 12 months  Since  March of last year it has grown at an 84 percent rate  The problem remains that we have  repeatedly said publicly that [our M1 target is lower than that]  If we intend to do something to  alleviate this problem, I can’t see any more favorable time to at least take initial corrective action  Unemployment has dropped somewhat and as you said earlier, Mr Chairman, there is no real   evidence other than possibly gut feelings on the part of some of any real softening of the economy   The international situation cries out for doing something about the inflationary problem and I’m  just totally convinced--I could be wrong--that if we don’t take some action now under these  circumstances, we’re going to have to take action 6 months or 12 months from now and the  problem will have gotten worse  I liken what we have done in the last year sort of to the alcoholic  who should do something but he takes a little drink this time and another little one and he’s always  going to do something down the road  Well, I don’t think we have done what we might have done  over the past year in terms of gradually reducing the rate of growth of money  If we put off  [resolving] this inevitable problem, we’re going to have to take the step in the future and I think  quite conceivably we would be forced to act under less propitious circumstances, perhaps at a time  when applying the brakes would really entail a much greater risk to the economy than a gradual  reduction would at present      To me the problem is one of either assuring, if we took a 2-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range for M1,   that by golly we would stick to the midpoint in terms of the growth in M1--the midpoint between  those two being 5-1/2 percent--or I think more realistically, we should reduce the upper [limit of  the] range  We’ve set ranges until we’re blue in the face  We’ve exceeded those ranges for such a  long time that we’re just deluding ourselves if we think that we are really doing anything to correct  the excessive growth in the money supply  So, with that, I would urge at the most an upper limit on     1/17/78             48  the M1 range of 7 percent, with perhaps 2 or 2-1/2 being the lower limit of the range  I could  certainly go with the M2 range under alternative B  I would prefer a 6-3/4 to 7-1/4 percent range  for the fed funds rate and I would prefer an aggregates directive to a money market directive      Mr Chairman, in my deepest affection for one of the most effective Federal   Reserve Chairmen, I won’t ask for a recount, but, sir, is there any possibility of shaving that upper  limit down a little bit below 8 percent on M1?   It would be a shame--you know, I don’t want to be  a troublemaker at this meeting--       Would you include in your bridging actions or your fundamental actions a clear   signal that we are determined to decelerate monetary growth relative to the rate of monetary growth  of other nations involved?  Would a clear signal by either this group or by the government that we  are determined to come to grips with that not have an immediate beneficial effect in regard to this?   Isn=t our rate of acceleration of monetary growth relative to these others a very real and very  specific factor in the [difficult situation] we find ourselves in?       Excuse me, sir, but from the graphs I=ve seen the trend in the direction of our   monetary growth relative to the direction of monetary growth in many of these other nations I think  is a negative factor  Certainly, inflation in Germany is higher than it is here, but the trend--      SPEAKER(?)  It was lower      The rate of growth of inflation is lower?        The direction of the trend--     Mr Chairman, I=ll be brief  We have just concluded an extensive series of   meetings with businessmen throughout our District and there is nothing we heard that would lead  us to question or to be more pessimistic than the staff [forecast]  There is moderate optimism,  depending on the elimination of many of these uncertainties that disturb business people  I would  subscribe, and I won=t elaborate on it, to John Balles=s concept of what realistic goals for a  reduction of unemployment should be; we don=t think they=re as low as others seems to think they  are  I would subscribe wholeheartedly to Governor Wallich=s concept of a realistic target for a soft  landing and I think that we should not be panicked by a gradual reduction in real growth to what  we=re talking about--4 to 4-1/2 percent      I am perplexed about two things that I=ve heard, and it’s not only what I=ve heard this   morning  One is the chronic tendency to be pessimistic about what might happen just over the  horizon  I think if we had verbatim transcripts of every meeting we=ve had in the last two years-- and I can=t speak  with experience prior to that--[they would show] the same sort of expressions of  concern, namely that out yonder later this year or later [next] year, problems are going to arise  Some day I assume those problems will occur, but we always seem to be somewhat pessimistic   Maybe that=s a way those of you who are much more skilled in the science of economics than I       2/28/78           30  hedge your bets  But what really perplexes me, Mr Chairman--and I don=t say this to be critical--is  the fact that so many sitting here today can recognize, apparently all of a sudden, that one of the big  problems we face is inflation and one of the big inhibiting factors that is stopping businessmen  from engaging in capital formation projects is their concern about and their uncertainty with regard  to inflation and that somehow, maybe somewhere along the line, monetary policy ought to concern  itself with inflation  If that is literally something that is only occurring to us currently, Mr  Chairman, I don=t understand the rules of this game because we=ve all been talking about it for  some time  I apologize for those remarks, but those are my observations      Mr Chairman, may I throw out a suggestion that I don=t think represents any   significant departure from the philosophy you have just enunciated?  It might enable us, however,  to signal that we=re trying to do something about the problem of inflation and we=re also concerned  about anything that might have a negative effect on real growth  [My suggestion is] that we might  consider reducing the upper end of the M1 range from 6-1/2 to 6 percent and raising the lower end  of the range from 4 to 4-1/2 percent  The rationale would be that at 6 percent we would not really  be doing anything to reduce the rate of inflation--assuming there=s a relationship between this  aggregate and inflation--below what it currently is, although we would be signaling to the world  that we=re at least adjusting the upper limit slightly downward, and I think this might have a  beneficial effect on the dollar situation   At the same time those people who would feel that we=re  not concerned about any possible softening in the economy would be reassured by the fact that we       2/28/78           33  have raised the lower limit from 4 to 4-1/2 percent  That does narrow the range somewhat, but I  think psychologically it could have a salutary effect from both points of view      Mr Chairman, do we have to consider the aggregate versus the [money market]   directive, or is that--     Mr Chairman, I am impressed with the logic of Governor Wallich=s point of   view and would like to be recorded as subscribing to his proposal  But I certainly am also  impressed with the short time frame and would support and vote for alternative B  I would, Mr  Chairman, if I might, take the opportunity to address one remark to my good friend, Chuck Partee   For so long a time now, I=ve had to adjust to finding my aggregates objectives bloodied and  buffeted, and now the threat of having my aggregates totally amputated is a bit of a shock       On that point, Mr Chairman, this morning we’ve been primarily on the   German mark problem  Speculators, I’ve observed, are quick to move in other directions  Are we  prepared to use the same techniques in other areas if--       Mr Chairman, may I ask a question?  Jim, in your analysis, you make   frequent reference to the price changes and wage trends and things like that  Unless I  misunderstood it, there was practically no reference in your report to past rates of monetary  expansion  When you do this [analysis] relating to prices, do you give any consideration to  monetary expansion in the past year or two?      Mr Chairman, if I understood you correctly, I understood you to say that   there are very limited things that we can do  If we were to gradually slow down money growth, as  we have publicly said in the past we wanted to do, wouldn’t this be a signal to the world and to this  country and to everybody that the Federal Reserve is really serious about doing something [about  inflation]?   Don’t you think that would possibly have some effect on correcting inflation?      Mr Chairman, I would recommend an M1 range of 4-1/2 to 8 percent, an M2   range up to 8-1/2, a federal funds range of 6-1/2 to 7-1/4, and an aggregates directive  I might just  say that this is the sweetest music I’ve heard as far as the aggregates are concerned in some time,  Mr Chairman  I think that it’s vital that we are willing to be flexible in letting interest rates rise if  need be in order to accomplish what we all seem to be aiming for in the aggregates  We happened  to review the Bluebook of March 1977, which was just a year ago  At that time we set quite  delightful aggregates targets  The Bluebook projected a growth of 5-1/2 percent in M1 for the year  and, as you know, the figure has come in instead of 5-1/2 percent at 78 percent--and I think it’s  essentially because of our emphasis on keeping the lid on interest rates  What I’m pleading for, sir,  is that after we set these targets for the aggregates on a sensible basis we really do what is  necessary to achieve those targets in the months and years ahead       Mr Chairman, I would like briefly to support Ernie’s point of view just as  strongly as I can  I am terribly distressed at the thought that if something is worth considering we  summarily reject it because we don’t have confidence in our own credibility  If our credibility is  that bad, it is of our own doing, I believe  Perhaps our credibility is lacking, but if our credibility is  lacking it is because of the charge--if I may put it in those terms--of trying to set federal funds rate  targets and aggregates targets that we know are totally incompatible and totally inconsistent with  each other  It seems to me that the purpose of monetary policy is to shape economic events and not  to try to put together something that we think will conform with economic shocks and events that  may occur in the future  And I think [the latter] is what we have been trying to do  I don’t think  that this necessarily has to be cast in stone for three years  There is no reason in the world why  these targets could not be adjusted whenever events [militated] such an adjustment  On the other  hand, Mr Chairman, as part of your apparent policy of being open and candid to the world about  what we are doing, I think here is an excellent opportunity to announce with proper care what our  monetary aggregate policy is and to attempt to stick with it  If we don’t do this now, sir, I think we  should take the other step and that is just omit from our deliberations the setting of any aggregates  targets and admit to the world that we are targeting solely on interest rates  But if we don’t have  credibility, we have lost credibility because of something that I think has been somewhat of a  phony charade      Mr Chairman, would you be receptive to a report stressing the other side of  this?      An argument in writing?      Yes, sir  I can’t add a great deal  We agree basically with the staff’s position  We feel that average inflation for l978 will not be as high as the staff projects; however, we foresee  a serious escalation in inflation as prices rise next year and the year after  I disagree, at the risk of  making myself the most unpopular boy in the class, with some of the observations that were made   I do not believe that the responsibility for the predicament that we are in is necessarily attributable  to the unions or to management, to the trade deficit or the depreciation of the dollar, or even to the  Arabs  It doesn’t accomplish anything to look at past procedures but I do think that monetary     4/18/78             25  policy has to be filtered in as one of the elements of responsibility--or one of the elements of blame,  if you want to put it that way--for where we are today  And I hope when we get to the next item on  the agenda we will consider monetary policy and not--two years from now, as a result of an action  we took today--blame [the consequences] on management or labor or the Arabs      Mr Chairman, if we’re going to make a strenuous effort to stay within the range  and toward the midpoint of the range, there really isn’t much difference between alternative B and  alternative C   I would prefer alternative C just for one reason  I am not trying to be mechanistic  and I know that a half point doesn’t make that much difference  I do know that the long-term trend  rate of money over a 5-year period is about 6 percent and I think that all of us would agree that  there is a relationship between prices after a lag and a long 5-year or 20-quarter trend rate in the  growth of money  And if we really want to gradually crank this thing down, I don’t really see the  logic in having an upper range above 6-1/2 percent, above the trend rate of money, because  mechanically--and I am probably being overly mechanistic--if we moved it up that high we would  be doing exactly what we don’t want to do  But I would [agree with] Mark Willes’s point of view  that the real key to this is the strenuous effort to stay as close to the midpoint of either “B” or “C”  as possible and I would opt for “C” just to be cantankerous      Point of order, Mr Chairman!       4/18/78             41    I’ll surprise everybody by agreeing totally with Frank  I think you exceed  [what is necessary] if you go the whole way right at the beginning  There is no retracing your  steps  I don’t see any danger or any harm in ultimately being forced into having diverse points of  view expressed, but I would let them drag you to that situation instead of doing it immediately      Yes, sir  [I favor] for M1, 4 to 8; for M2, 5 to 9; for the fed funds rate, 6-1/2 to  7-1/2; and an aggregates directive  I interpret that as not being bold but being momentarily  responsible       Mr Chairman, as you know, where I work we feel that there is a direct  relationship between the decisions made by  monetary policymakers on the rate of growth of  money and these various elements we are taking about  So, assuming a 6 percent annual rate of  money growth this year--though we have no way of knowing whether that will be the case--we  would project an average real GNP figure of 3-1/2 percent, prices at 6-1/2 percent, and  unemployment at 5-3/4 to 6 percent     I would like, Mr Chairman, if I’m not out of order, just to comment on one other aspect of  what has been discussed this morning by John Balles  Some of us at the Reserve Bank level do  significant research and devote significant research resources to subjects such as capacity  As John  knows, just as his people have, our economists have done a lot of work over the last year, year and  a half  I just wondered--I’m sure this can’t be settled today--whether there couldn’t be some  method devised whereby on some of these fundamental questions there could be greater interaction  between the staff at Washington and some of the Reserve Bank staffs  So if they are doing research  in some specific underlying subjects we would know of that  [Now we’re] operating totally  independently of the others, only knowing what the others do if we read their publications  I just  think we have great resources and that we could pool them in some way on selected subjects on  selected occasions  I think there would be value      If I may inquire of Steve  If we have these continuing problems of jumping  back and forth in the emphasis we give M1 and M2--perhaps the answer to this question is obvious  because it dates back prior to my involvement in this process--why don’t we target on the monetary  base, for example?  Isn’t that much more controllable?      But we don’t have any fewer problems than the way we’re going now, right?       If this is the month for confessing, I must confess that I’m neither a monetarist  nor an economist but I am a realist, I think  And there are certain things about this posture we find  ourselves in today which I think realistically ought to be observed  First of all, we’re between a  rock and a hard place; we’re in an awfully difficult position  We are here because of our own--and  this was before you came aboard, Mr Chairman--doings  Since the third quarter of 1976, for seven  quarters M1 has grown at an average rate of 7-1/2 percent and there’s no way in the world after  we’ve permitted that to happen that we can do anything in the near term to rectify this situation or  to materially fend off inflation in the period ahead  However, I think we can make one terrible  mistake  I think the best thing that the economy has going for it, both as far as the domestic  economy is concerned and the international economy, is the fact that an awful lot of people, Mr  Chairman, believe that we are at long last concerned about inflation and that we’re determined to  do something about it  I’m not sure whether this has permeated the Washington climate, but this is  the one thing that businessmen and everyone in our part of the world feel good about--that we’re  doing something about it     Whatever policy decisions are made today have got to be made in a manner that would not  reflect any easing of our determination to continue to try to reduce the rate of inflation  I would  subscribe to Mark Willes’s basic proposals with one additional word of caution--that under  conditions of strong credit demand as presently exist if we are not willing to permit the fed funds  range to [move] upward to at least the 8 percent upper limit, we may as well right now in the cold  light of day admit that we’re going to refuel and we’re setting the fires of further inflation  I think  we ought to face up to these things realistically  I don’t think they make us monetarists or non- monetarists but we’re in an awful tough situation and I think it’s our own doing      What was that early language again, sir?      Mr Chairman      Would it be in order to make one other suggestion?      No sir, I think the idea is excellent  I wonder whether you would consider one  other minor change, and that is in that same paragraph--the second  paragraph on page 1, line 5--  putting in before the words “during the period” these words “In view of the recent growth of  monetary aggregates with respect to the proposed longer-run ranges during the period” et cetera  The purpose of that would be to clarify in the public’s mind that we are targeting on the longer-run  ranges and to dramatize, if you will, or at least to point out, that what we are doing in adjusting our  fed funds target is being done with the view of trying to accomplish in the long pull the targeted  growth of monetary aggregates  It would read “in view of the recent growth of monetary  aggregates with respect to the proposed longer-run ranges…”  It identifies longer-run ranges and  what has happened recently [as what] we’re taking [into account with regard to] the fed funds  action      With respect to or in relation to--      The significance of the sentence--      The significance of it is to clarify in the public’s mind how the short-term fed  funds targets relate to our attempt to achieve the longer-term monetary aggregate targets      I don’t feel strongly about it; I think what you are doing here is excellent        May I ask a question?  I=m confused about the interrelationship of some of  the figures in the Bluebook and some of your Greenbook projections  It=s my understanding that  your nominal GNP projections in the Greenbook, for example, are based on money and interest  rate projections in the Bluebook  Just to use an example, you project for the first quarter of 1979  nominal GNP growth of 11 to 12 percent and in the Bluebook, if I read it correctly, under  alternatives A and B M1 growth is projected at maybe 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the last quarter of  1978 and interest rates are up in the area of 9 to10 percent for the last quarter of 1978 and the  first quarter of 1979  How could you conceivably, unless you have almost an unrealistic   projection of velocity growth, anticipate the sort of GNP growth that we=re talking about early  next year with M1 growth of 2 to 2-1/2 percent and these other Bluebook projections?  Is there a  relationship between those?       6/20/78                6    Jim, do you look at the output of your model or do you do a certain amount of  subjective wishful thinking?      If you have to hold down money growth, though, to 2 to 2-1/2 percent in the  last quarter of this year in order to give that reassurance that we=re doing something about  inflation, doesn=t that have an effect on GNP growth early next year?  In other words, there are  two factors--interest rates and money growth  And if we crunch down the money growth to 2 to  23 percent, which are the projections in the Bluebook--I have many doubts about whether we=ll  do that--to give reassurance to the world of our determination to deal with inflation, I question  whether that wouldn=t have an effect of reducing GNP      For the second quarter of ’78 to the second quarter of ’79, assuming growth in  M1 is 6 percent, we would estimate inflation at 6-1/2 percent, which is somewhat less than others   This does not mean that we think [inflation in] late 1979 and 1980 is going to increase significantly,  but to the second quarter of ’79 we have it at 6-1/2 percent, unemployment at 6 percent, and real  GNP about 3-1/2 percent  I would just reiterate that I believe we have it within our ability, if we  have it within our desire, to keep money growth to a 6 percent rate without disrupting the economy  Regardless of what Alcoa does and regardless of what the postal workers do, I think it is important  that we recognize what we might be able to do      That=s like walking out on your wife every time you have an argument!      For M1, 4 to 8 and for M2, 6-1/2 to 9  And the most important thing that we  should do is to attempt not to inhibit the rise of the federal funds rate  Being a moderate like my  friend Mark Willes, I’d say 7-1/2 to 8-1/4  I=d rather go above that and I do recommend to  everybody who is sitting at that side of the table, as well as this side, the chart on what has happened  in the past  We really haven=t tightened our federal funds rate significantly  We have a long, long  way to go, in my judgment, before it would have a detrimental effect on the economy  That=s what I  see      Is there any significance to the fact that we would have our M1 and M2 ranges  alike?  It normally isn=t that way; they=d both be 5 to 10, if I understand you  Would that signal  anything unusual?  We=ve never done that      Mr Chairman, following what Frank says, you might consider this on lines 23 to  26 in an effort to downplay the importance of the short-term ranges  Instead of saying in the  June-July period M1 and M2 in the following ranges of tolerance, can we say in the June-July period  M1 and M2 in the annual ranges established in April?  That is, we’re [tying] the relationship of what  we=re doing to our longer-range targets instead of to the short-term targets, where there really is--      Bill, relating to this subject of security--I was involved in the service and  probably some of the rest of you [were also]--and it seems to me that this might be a good time to  review our whole security system in terms of the documents we receive  When we receive  [communications designated] “eyes only” or “restricted confidential,” quite candidly, nobody in our  place puts much weight on what the different security designations really mean in practicality   Maybe there is a manual but--  I don=t know whether the rest of you share that view       Jim, I’m confused about two remarks that I think you made  One is that  assuming a 6-1/4 percent M1 growth rate you anticipated a moderating trend in inflation  It looks  to me as though the figures show at least a continuation of 72 percent, which is not really  moderating  Secondly, in your response to Chuck’s question, you referred to 8-1/4 percent interest  rates and a 6-1/4 percent M1 growth rate  [In] the projections of the price levels you show in  Appendix 1 of the Bluebook under alternative B, which is that general scenario, you show interest  rates of 8-3/4 to 9-3/4 percent for the fourth quarter of ’78 and the first and second quarters of ’79   What I’m getting at is that I don’t think you can have an 8-1/4 percent federal funds rate--       7/18/78              6    That explains it      I got it      I don’t ask this question in an impertinent manner, but do you totally discount  the relationship of aggregates growth to prices?  Forgetting those exogenous factors, isn’t there a  relationship between our monetary policy actions--M1 [growth of] 6-1/4 or 7-1/4 and this price  level into the future?  Isn’t that relevant?      I would project--and again I predicate what I am saying on the assumption that  we will keep M1 growth at 6-1/4 percent--real GNP at 3 percent, the deflator at about the same 73  percent that the staff had, and unemployment at 6 percent  I would echo and support  wholeheartedly the remarks of Mark Willes  I think the biggest factor, far overriding all of these  exogenous factors that we read about and talk about so frequently, is monetary policy  And  regardless of the interest rate consequences of stating a goal for money growth and sticking with it,  I think that would be the most stimulative action that we could take  If the Chairman of this group  made clear that we are determined to hold money growth at 6-1/4 percent and he said that for  everyone to hear, I think that would encourage capital spending  It would clear the air  I think very  few people in the real world have confidence that we are really going to conduct monetary policy  in a manner that will hold money growth at that targeted rate      Mr Chairman, I will be very brief  I have several observations  One, I would  invite the attention of the Committee to the last page of the staff presentation which says  unequivocally that 7-1/4 percent for M1 growth will result in 82 percent inflation in the year 1980  Without being specific, I would observe that the year 1980 is going to be a unique and important  year and that perhaps the economy would be an issue very much on people’s minds in l980  I  believe that inflation is the number one issue impeding capital investment  It is the number one  issue in the minds of the people of this country today  It is going to be the number one issue, if it is  not brought under control, in l980  I believe that there is a direct relationship, and we can  demonstrate it, between the growth of M1 and, after a lag period, the rate of inflation  I take total  exception, though, to the point of view that the control of M1 or any other aggregate is not doable   We can control it  Peter Sternlight can sell or buy securities  It can be done  And what we do  today on setting the targets for the next year will either come back to haunt us or come back as  good cheer to us in the year l980 when I assume there will be a certain amount of attention paid to  what the rate of inflation is  So, I would recommend that we go with “B” and try to stick to the  midpoint--and not try to tell ourselves that this is not doable--because I believe it is doable, Mr  Chairman  And if we say it is not, we are just excusing our ineptitude      Mr Chairman?      I don’t think we should lose sight of the fact that anything that enhances  inflationary expectations will lead to an increase in interest rates, too  If people think that we have  lost control of our ability to deal with inflation, inevitably that will cause interest rates to rise   Long-term rates are rising now  We are going to end up in the same pickle either way, and I would  rather have us end up with lower inflation and temporarily higher interest rates than have inflation  drive these rates up      Mr Chairman, if it were feasible, could we possibly let an economist from each  of these points of view get in the discussion?      I would go with [the views of] either John Balles or Mark Willes      Paul, have your people indicated how often--this can be rough--any of us  Presidents ever adds anything to that call?  I ask because I sure as hell don’t  Maybe it is my own  weakness or ineptitude--I’m using that word again  Our people think it is a laughable process        Scott, assuming that this gas bill passes--and there's been a lot of difference of   opinion as to whether or not the energy package is really important--what would be your thinking  as to the effect on the dollar?  And how long-lasting will that effect be if next week this package  passes?      Mr Chairman, I still have not lost my belief that what happens in the near   future in terms of output growth and what happens in the long pull in terms of price level  movements depends to some extent on what our monetary policy is  We agree with the projections  of the staff, although for different reasons, that we should have about 7-1/2 percent price growth  next year edging up to 8 percent in 1980  But we believe this is because we've had two years of 8       9/19/78            16  percent money growth  We don't question the facts [but] we have arrived at the conclusion through  a different route     We do feel that real GNP can vary from around the 3 percent mark next year to 4 percent,   depending on the decisions we make as to money growth  We feel that if M1 is kept at a 6 percent  growth during the forthcoming quarters, we will have a real GNP figure of about 3 percent but it  would be about 4 percent if we continue at an 8 percent rate of money growth     Finally, with regard to the Conference Board consensus, we had a luncheon last week with   fifteen treasurers of our large corporations, most of whom are treasurers of Fortune 500 companies  There was unanimity--and this literally was unanimous—-in their optimistic and positive point of  view  Not one of these fellows indicated less than confidence about their company’s future  Their  outlook was basically positive for the 12 or 24 months ahead, so I guess there's room for a  difference of opinion  Our feeling is positive and we feel strongly that what happens will depend  on what we do      I have a question, Mr Chairman, and it's not asked in a cantankerous vein    But I'm concerned  As we went around the table, we all seemed to recognize that we do face a  7-1/2 to 8 percent rate of inflation now  Do we as a group feel that this is preordained because of  circumstances that we can't control?  I'm concerned that we seem to feel well, it may be 8 percent,  and if it's 8 percent we've done our job well  I'm really not trying to be critical, but is our monetary  policy responsibility such that we should maybe discuss whether we're satisfied to see the economy  drift into an 8 percent inflation rate?  And if not, are there things that we can do to affect this?  I  really ask that in a genuine, innocent, and physically recovering vein  Are we in any way the  masters of what happens, or are we merely observers on the sidelines?  I'm lost      Mr Chairman, there is an advantage to being at the end of the batting order  because you can sense a certain consensus of the points of view that emerge from the opinions that  were stated  First of all, as far as this short-term scenario is concerned, I think the die is pretty well  cast  I would be for alternative B or better--by better I mean lower aggregates growth [ranges]   But I would like to make a suggestion and try it on for size, if I may, Mr Chairman  It seems to me  that there is at least a majority consensus within this group that inflation is a problem and that it  would be desirable, if possible, to attempt to slow growth in the aggregates without causing a  recession  I think even the most maverick of us would be resistant to anything that would lead to  recession  I might point out that on page 7 of the staff's projections for M1 growth, either  alternative A or B would indicate nearly a 2 percentage point drop between the fourth quarter of  ’78 and the first quarter of ’79 in aggregates growth, which I submit would lead to recession  I  certainly would oppose that      However, I think our next big decision point is at our meeting next month when we set the   yearly targets  Assuming that most of us think that it is important to try to slow aggregates growth  without recession, I wonder what would be accomplished or not accomplished, Mr Chairman, if  you were to ask each of us to address ourselves in writing--and not more than two pages of   writing--to how we feel aggregates growth might be slowed without causing a recession   Certainly, some of us might say it can't be done  Then at least we would state in writing that we  don't think growth in the aggregates can be reduced without causing these other severe  consequences  There are some of us who think that there is a simple and feasible way to do it  So I  just wonder if we couldn't spend a few minutes strategizing rather than getting right into the  numbers game at our next meeting  I think this might be accomplished by attempting, with our  research people, to put down in two pages or less [our thoughts on this issue]  This would at least  cause us to address ourselves to what I think are the fundamental concerns of all of us  I think we  tend to miss that target when we get into discussing 8-1/2 versus 9, or 3-1/2 versus 4  I'd like to see  next month, unless this is a totally irresponsible suggestion, each of us come forth in summary  fashion with how we might address the long-term future--at least the aspect of whether we can  reduce aggregates growth without causing recession      Alternative B is fine  I'd like to see aggregates growth tightened even more   and the fed funds rate as stated in alternative B     I didn't mean, Mr Chairman, to eliminate the numbers but to build up--      Yes sir  I'd just like to pursue one aspect of what you said  Initially, as I heard  your statement, you pointed to the lack of credibility toward our determination to deal with  inflation effectively  And then a few [moments] ago you said that the fundamental factors were  improving It seems to me that we've had those fundamental factors that we earmark such as the gas  tax and these other things like the energy program  Are you not saying, though, that probably the  one thing that could do most for our problems is a really meaningful anti-inflation effort that we  stuck by and that people could believe?  Is that what you're saying?      Hasn't it been saying that for the last six months?      Of course, we predicate our projections on specific rates of money growth; and  based on a 6 percent money growth projection, our real GNP estimates are somewhat below the  staff's  We would estimate about a 21 percent rate of real GNP growth during the year at 6 percent  M1 growth and inflation at about 65 percent, which is below the staff projection      Unemployment is almost 61, which is almost the [same]      Mr Chairman, in connection with what you have just said and this exercise we  went through, one of the things that is confusing to me is that we speak in terms of pessimism and  optimism, and we seem never to have really defined what we think would be the [desirable] rate of  growth or what we are pessimistic about  For example, suppose we are concerned, as you just  expressed concern, about precipitating a recession  Mr Chairman, if we are speaking of a  recession in the classical sense of the term, which as I understand it is two quarters of a negative  rate of growth, there's absolutely no intention on the part of those of us who are the most restrictive  in our attitudes toward monetary policy that we should bring [growth] down quickly enough to  precipitate that type of situation       I don't know whether this is the time or not to express one's opinion on this matter of a  recession but I think this is the hang-up that so many of us expressed  If we don't have an  expansive monetary policy, we will have a recession  And when you look at the record, sir, there  isn't a single demand-induced recession that has occurred since the World War that I can learn of,  that was not preceded by a significant drop in money growth for a sustained period of time  For at  least two quarters the rate of money growth dropped below the 20-quarter trend by at least 2  percent  And I don't think that even the mavericks like Larry Roos have ever suggested that we  should plunge the rate of growth down precipitously to below the trend growth of money  But if  we just reduce it to 6 percent--and I guess this comes in the next segment of this meeting--and hold  it there and make clear to the world that we are going to hold it there, and over a period of years  gradually reduce it, we can get this job done, in my opinion, without precipitating a recession      But even the most ardent monetarists, Mr Chairman, have spoken up  consistently for a very gradual reduction  But I think we are interpreted by people who disagree  with us as suggesting some precipitous reduction in the aggregates growth--      Aren't these long-term interest rates, though, somewhat of a reflection of  inflationary expectations?  In other words, if the aggregates continue to grow aren't those--      Mr Chairman, could you qualify it by saying as a footnote?  And just as a  [unintelligible] Congress will go crazy      M1 downgraded?      Well, Mr Chairman, just a procedural suggestion  You recall some months  ago I proposed to this Committee that we make more use of our economists throughout the System  It seems to me that several issues are surfacing, [such as] the Humphrey-Hawkins issue and this  issue, that require or justify a certain amount of serious discussion--more time than we can give to  it here  And I would ask--I don't know where that paper is--that consideration be given to having a  convocation of any Reserve Bank economic staffs that want to participate, as well as any of us,  within the next month or two to talk about some of these fundamental things that are occurring   We do it on membership, on automation, and on a lot of other things, and I think it would be  helpful      With downplaying, sir?      I'd say don't throw my M1 out  If we have M1, without ATS [I’d suggest a  range of] 3 to 5 and for M2, 5 to 9  And I think most important of all is widening the federal funds       10/17/78 50             range  If we try to stick to anything below 9-1/4 or 9-1/2, we can't possibly control the aggregates  as we're trying to do  So I'd suggest 8-3/4 to 9-1/2 for the fed funds range      3 to 5      What if this Committee at long last meaningfully [unintelligible] the  President's program?      Mr Chairman I think it's fraught with danger because, first of all, I think this  will be a controversial program regardless of what the White House puts out  The first charge  would be that our Chairman was sort of falling into line the next day  I think we'd lose our  independence  If we want to speak out as individuals, I think we're entitled to  I know their first  dog and pony show was to be in St Louis and there has been a tremendous difference of opinion  within the business community, which was asked to sponsor it, as to whether they even wanted to  give credence to it  So I think it's going to be controversial and I'd hate to see us put on the spot of  having to take an official stand        Thank you, sir  [Statement--see Appendix]       Jim, has the staff addressed itself to capacity constraints in considering the  possibility of a slowdown in output?      It would follow, therefore, that if we felt it was necessary in monetary policy  to deal with the softening that we could attempt to stimulate demand and have some productive  results?  In your judgment, it isn't a matter of bumping up against capacity [constraints]?      Thank you      Where I live they predict snow on the degree of woolly worm developments,  Mr Chairman, but we don't have the resources to study that  We believe that there are certain  fundamental monetary policy decisions--abruptly to hold down the [growth in the] aggregates to 4  percent or less--that would be about the only factor that would [militate] toward a recession in the  true classic sense of the word  Basically we are optimistic  If monetary policy is conducted as  we've set our targets, we would subscribe to Jim's figures      Christmas Eve you'll get a gross of woolly worms from the St Louis Bank!      Yes sir, I would recommend a top of 5 percent for M1 and for M2 a range of  6 to 9 percent  I don't have any comment on M1+  I think it would be desirable to have a fed funds  range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/4, moving to 10 right away  And I feel that an aggregates directive would be  preferable       Mr Chairman, the trend of the economy in our District roughly parallels the  staff observations  Loan demand continues to be strong and we don’t see any serious indications of  excessive inventory accumulation  As for Christmas retail sales, any information we can get seems  to indicate they will be fairly strong      However, we base our projections of the future, as you know, on an analysis of various  rates of money growth  And as surprising as it may be for any of you to hear it coming out of my  mouth, I would [echo] what I believe Mark said, and that is we should keep a wary eye on the  possibility of continued and perhaps excessive moderation of growth in the aggregates  The  softening of aggregates growth has not prevailed long enough for me to shift gears and suggest that  we abandon restraint, which certainly is a necessary element in dealing with inflation  On the other  hand, if the aggregates continue to grow at a moderate or less than moderate rate through future  meetings and we tolerate that, we could have serious consequences      For example, if there is an 8 percent growth of money over the next year, we think that the  output growth would be upwards of 3 percent  If money--this is M1 in the old context--grows at 6  percent, we would anticipate that real GNP would grow at about 2 percent  But if we were willing  to tolerate a reduction in money growth to, let’s say, 4 percent, we think that we’d have almost no     12/19/78          17    growth in real GNP  And we think money growth at that rate over a prolonged period--one quarter  or two or three quarters--could really precipitate a serious recession     My prescription for monetary policy at this meeting would be essentially what alternative A  or even alternative B provides with perhaps a widening of the fed funds range  However, I do think  that we should keep a close eye on whether or not aggregate growth does continue to moderate,  because I think we could be in as much trouble as a result of an excessive prolonged reduction in  the rate of growth of money as we are today in terms of the inflation that has resulted from three or  four years of excessive growth of the aggregates        If you have an M1 range of 2 to 6 percent during this next period, what do  you factor in as being the M1+ addition that you put in?      I mean the growth rate of M1+ in, let’s say, the next 4 to 5 weeks  What does  it look as though that’s going to be?      Mr Chairman, may I just ask a question before Chuck gets into this about  how you intend to proceed in considering this issue?  It is certainly of enormous importance; it’s  something your predecessor had planned to place before this Committee for consideration  I am     12/19/78          39    talking about how we conduct policy  It affects the way we go about either cooperating or not with  the Humphrey-Hawkins proposal       The proposal and the memorandum reached us on Friday morning and I don’t think it  reached any of the other Reserve Banks [earlier]  I don’t know of anybody who got it before  Friday, which meant that there was, in effect, only one workday in which to consider it if we were  traveling Monday  My question is  Is this going to be taken up for action today or is there a way  that after it’s presented and discussed more time could be made available to really consider this  with our research people and others and react to it?  I think it’s vitally important       If anyone shares my feeling on the importance of this, that might be an  argument to have a January meeting devoted in the main to an in-depth consideration of this  I  think it’s terribly important and nothing that should be decided without a lot of thought being given  to it         Well, Paul, we at least worked on it over the weekend and I think there are  some--       I would suggest, though, that Congress isn’t going to be lying in a docile  posture--letting us switch our processes and our signals to meet our own needs  I would agree with  Nancy that we’ve got to think of the Congressional relations aspect  If they think we’re trying to  dodge the intent or the spirit of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, I think all whatnot will break loose  and we’ll really be forced to do things that we don’t want to       If there’s a big overshoot, you have to show it       Everybody or voting members?       Well, why would that necessarily follow, Chuck?  Would that necessarily--       But wouldn’t you consider a telephone meeting in January a meeting?       Have we actually, in our own practices, ever discussed or agreed upon what  our ultimate economic objectives would be and then attempted to make our monetary policy  decisions consistent with the achievement of those objectives?  Or have we really sort of played  around with our monetary policy and then asked our people to project what they think will be the  result of that monetary policy  This has disturbed me       I always have been, Mr Chairman  Some of them don’t fly well  But 6 is  where I have really very serious concerns and I’d like to express them  In 6 the recommendation  the subcommittee made, in effect, provides that the long-term aggregates decisions and the  short-term decisions on targeting the fed funds rate really need not be related by a fixed rule  I feel  that the spirit of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act is--even if it isn’t written into law, it is the intent of  this Act--to call on us to set specific annual aggregate target ranges  And I believe that our ability  or inability to accomplish those ranges, at least under ordinary circumstances, will be judged very  critically by the Congress      Certainly if you look back, our record in setting ranges and staying within them has been  rather spotty since 1975 when we had the Concurrent Joint Resolution 133  We have computed  that out of 44 attempts to stay within certain short-term aggregate ranges we missed 22--50 percent  of the time  I don’t think in this new Humphrey-Hawkins arrangement, we are going to be able to  remain as invisible or as unaccountable in this regard as we have in the past  And in order to  achieve the objective that we read into Humphrey-Hawkins, I think the short-run aggregates targets  must be closely tied to these longer-run objectives  And I think that we must be prepared--whether  it’s on a fixed basis or on an automatic basis--to do everything humanly possible to see that the  funds rate is adjusted almost automatically whenever aggregate growth deviates from the  prescribed ranges  This is the fundamental disagreement we have had       Chuck, I would agree totally with the wording of your last sentence; however,  it’s the early part with which I strongly disagree  And if it’s in order, Mr Chairman, I’d just like to  either circulate or read a very brief substitute in wording that I would recommend for the early part  of Chuck’s number 6  It would read, unless I am out of order, sir--       “The spirit of the new law clearly requires changes in the present procedure  for formulating short-term tolerance ranges  The change in the formulation of the long-term ranges     12/19/78          60    will tend to focus greater attention on actual performance relative to these ranges when setting  short-term policy objectives  Therefore, we endorse proposals to relate short-term tolerance ranges  to the long-term growth ranges by a mechanism that would ensure that the agreed-upon long-term  ranges are achieved on an annual basis”  And then we would follow the exact wording of the last  sentence  I will be glad--       Would there be a way--and this is what I was driving at earlier--whereby  those of us who saw fit could communicate to Chuck in writing a point of view on this?  [I ask]  because I always feel that we have mass resources in our research departments and I would like to  have some of our professionals, who can articulate this a hell of a lot better than I, put something  down in writing before this decision is made  And they didn’t have time to do it  I think this is a  very gutsy decision that we will have to live with       How we perform in February in setting the directive will be affected  materially by what our attitude is on an issue such as this  All I am saying is that we should have as  much background as possible made available to the Committee prior to taking whatever action it  takes in February       12/19/78          62           But, Mr Chairman--and I’ll promise I’ll hush up after this--       It seems to me that the very reason that Chuck’s committee developed this  paper was to give some guidance to this process even though they can’t bind future FOMCs  And  if there’s a purpose in this memorandum being circulated, I think there’s a purpose in certain  aspects of the memorandum being debated even though we can’t bind anybody  That’s my only  point       Mr Chairman, my stomach is too empty to argue vehemently, but I’d like to  express a weak disagreement with Chuck       If whatever policy we adopted were publicly  [announced] by the Chairman or whomever as having certain specific  objectives, wouldn’t that help clear the air? In other words, do the  exchange markets have to function shrouded in mystery about all of  this? If we were to let the fed funds rate drift down, why couldn’t  we make clear to the world why we are doing that?   I have a question Jim, on the last page of the  monetary policy alternatives section, where you show projected growth  in Ml of 6-114 percent, the footnote indicates that that is in the  absence of ATS accounts In other words, if you included ATS  accounts, that 6-114 percent would be considerably higher?     2/6/79 -5-   M R   KICHLINE I'm sorry, the footnote perhaps is misleading  It would be something like 3 percent growth in observed M1   In other words, it's really adjusted   Okay   Excuse me Obviously, we're all very much  interested in the recent behavior of the aggregates, and I was very  much impressed with Steve's eloquence in describing what he considers  to be some of the reasons for that behavior But I don't have the  intellectual capacity, Steve, to absorb all this as you say it Would  it be proper procedure to ask Steve to send me at least, and anybody  else who wants it, the first part of your report in writing? [I would  like to see in writing] your rationalization for why this behavior is  occurring because it would be helpful to us   [Unintelligible] if that's how it works   Thanks   Mr Chairman, we just concluded a series of  meetings with the chief executive officers of major industrial  companies in our area and, as many others have said, we saw  practically no evidence of anything but a strong economy They were  almost unanimous in that point of view However, while the economy is  strong, at least in our part of the world, we do have some concern  about the abruptness and extent of the decline in the basic money  supply over the past three months Our concern arises from a belief  that if the money supply were to be reduced abruptly for several  quarters from an 8 percent rate to a 4 percent rate or less--those  rates being for the old M1--we would indeed have a recession We also  feel, of course, that through monetary policy we are capable of  guiding the extent of the decline in the money supply The recent  decline could be attributed to what Peter pointed out, that we have  been sellers of a significant amount of dollars--$5 billion plus--out  of our portfolio as a means, I would assume, of pegging our fed funds  rate at a rate of 10 percent or slightly above What I am driving at  is that, although the jury is still out, I think we should very  carefully watch these money trends in the next two to three months I  really am more concerned right now with the fact that if we set the  lower level for the M1 range at something like 1 percent and add 3  percentage points to it [for the ATS effect], in round figures we  could be reducing the rate of money growth rather quickly from 8  percent to 4 percent And I think that could precipitate the type of  recession that all of us would like to avoid   So specifically, I would suggest a narrowing of the M1 range  to perhaps 2-112 to 4 percent I would very strongly urge that we  permit the fed funds rate to drift down, if necessary, in order to  attain the growth in the aggregates that we prescribe To do that I  would welcome, and in fact would recommend, a widening of the fed  funds rate range I wouldn't even be concerned--although you will  probably feel this is a radical point of view--about a fed funds  target of something like 9 to 10-1/2 percent and a narrowing of our  attention to the aggregates, with specific concern on the lower parts  of the ranges for those aggregates As far as M2 and M3 are  concerned, I could live with the alternative A specifications proposed  by the staff   Mr Chairman, are you planning to elaborate on the  adjustments in M1 as has been discussed at the staff level? Or are we  going to go public, in effect, with these M1 figures, making some  allusion to the ATS effects in the--   Will the 3 percent figure be described or the 5  percent on the--   May I ask Scott a question, sir?     2/6/79 -30-    When the Chairman describes the adjustment for ATS  accounts and so forth, if that is perceived as being a more expansive  policy than the one we had last year, would that have a depressing  effect on the dollar?   What are we voting on right now, sir?   I just can't resist pointing out that, as I read  this, there isn't very much sentiment within this group to use the  Humphrey-Hawkins situation to signal a relatively important change in  how we [handle] this--in other words, to widen the fed funds ranges  significantly By doing so we can be masters of the aggregates'  destinies to a greater extent than we are Apparently a great  majority of us is still committed to pretty much sticking to doing  business as we have in the past on these fundamentals   Your St Louis guru would suggest targeting more  on the base but--   I will shut up [after this], Mr Chairman, but I  think there are a lot of sophisticated people who are trading in the  dollar foreign exchange market who are aware of the realities of the  aggregates too and who are somewhat suspicious [of our commitment to  these ranges], due to the fact that our past practice has permitted  the aggregates to overshoot And I believe those people would  welcome, in a dollar-supportive manner, some basic shift in our manner  of functioning, although I perceive that we don't feel now is really  the time to do that    My questioning was going to parallel somewhat what  John Balles said   Mr Chairman, my position is essentially reflected  on this button that I'm wearing which reads--   Well, I stole a page out of the MIT buttons and  this reads "MB 10-5 + 1Q = R" Translating that, it says that when  the monetary base decreases from 10 percent to 5 percent and remains  that way for one more quarter, there is a very real probability of a  recession Inasmuch as we're flooding the Midwest with these buttons,  I'll be glad to present this to you, sir, at the end of the meeting  because it is historic   In spite of that, I'll proceed! As we analyze the  behavior of money, and of course we do place a great deal of weight on  the behavior of money, we observe that from December of 1977 through  October of 1978, the monetary base grew at about a 10 percent rate  Since October of last year to the present there has been an abrupt  decline in that rate to an average of about 6-l/2 percent, with it  being close to 5 percent recently Growth in bank reserves, which we  think is important, has declined to a negative figure since October--  less than zero as compared to a 102 percent rate of increase from  December 1977 through October of last year   Mr Chairman, in spite of the confusion that some of my  colleagues have expressed, if we look back in history, most of the  postwar recessions that have occurred--with the exception of [the one  precipated by] unusual circumstances with the oil situation in '73 and  '74--have been preceded by an abrupt reduction in the rate of money  growth that has persisted for two or more quarters For example, what  happened prior to the recession in 1970 was that from mid-1968 through  the end of 1968 money was growing at about a 9 percent rate Early in  1969, monetary policymakers permitted that rate to fall to about a 3  percent rate; it persisted at 3 percent for a couple of quarters and  there was a recession Look at graphs Whenever this phenomenon--an  abrupt drop in the rate of money growth--has occurred and has  persisted, there has been a recession So based on that analysis,  which is not one to be taken lightly, I think if we're going to err,  we should err at this time in the direction of moving toward slightly  expanded growth in the monetary aggregates rather than anything of a  restrictive nature We should certainly watch this very carefully  this month and next month because if [the weakness] persists, we're  going to be in trouble I would just add in closing that there is an  old saying that politics makes strange bedfollows, and I'm glad to be  in bed with my strange bedfellow Governor Partee on this issue!     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -11-   If our concern, Mr Chairman, is to avoid or at  least minimize the recession, and if our concern is about continuing  to undershoot the growth ranges for the aggregates we had projected, I  think there's no way we should tolerate a range that could possibly  entail M1 growth at a rate as slow as 4-114 or 4-112 percent So I  would recommend raising the lower end of alternative A, if you will,  to 6 percent so that under no circumstances could M1 growth continue  at 4 to 4-112 percent The M2 range is satisfactory as shown and in  order to have the greatest opportunity of avoiding a continued  undershoot of the aggregates, I think we should widen the fed funds  range and allow the possibility that the rate could be reduced  significantly If the signal problem is difficult, let's make the  range 9-1/4 to 10-114 percent I think we should have an aggregates  directive and an understanding that the Desk should keep an eagle eye     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -31-   on these aggregates and not permit them to sag by concentrating on  maintaining the funds rate near the upper end of its target range    I'd like to ask one clarifying question and also a  question after that Early in your statement I believe I heard you  say, Steve, that the slower growth of the monetary aggregates reflects  slower demand for goods and services Then further on I understood  you to say, if I understood correctly, that in an inflationary economy  such as we have people tend to increase their demands or purchases of  goods and services Is there a conflict in--?   Could I just ask one further question, Mr  Chairman? What factors mitigate, in your thinking, the view that  there will be a rebound in the monetary aggregates in the period  ahead? What evidence would there be to justify your point of view  other than wishful thinking?     4/17/79 - 8 -    Mr Chairman, I think we're in an almost no-win  situation today We're in a posture that was of our own making, in  that we're reaping what we sowed 2 or 3 years ago by refusing to face  up to the fact that by stabilizing interest rates we were permitting  the aggregates to grow much too quickly I think concerning ourselves  with the subject of demand shifts is somewhat of an exercise in  futility because I don't think we, in our monetary policy function,  can control shifts in demand We're not able to do that I think the  problem is on the supply side Whereas the aggregates have grown  excessively for nearly three years, we're in serious danger of  repeating mistakes we've made in the past--and this is at least a near  monetarist speaking For us to jam on the brakes to permit the growth  of the aggregates to drop as abruptly as they have and to continue to  tolerate that is almost certainly an assurance of a recessionary  result I would just like to emphasize again that at no time did any  monetarist ever suggest that there should be an abrupt pulling down of  the rate of money growth from a high level to a low level That is  what is happening I think our main decision today has to be whether  we are going to expand the growth of money temporarily in order to     4 / 1 7 / 7 9  -12-   ease at least the extent of the recession or whether we are going to  knowingly--and if we do it knowingly, we have to accept part of the  responsibility--permit monetary growth to continue to be quite low  and, at least as we see it, assure the advent of a recession   Was that a nonmember bank?   Mr Chairman, I would opt for alternative A, for  easing If that were done, I would urge the Chairman to explain the  rationale that this is not a permanent softening of our anti-inflation  emphasis--that we are really doing it temporarily to try to reduce the  impact of a recession Sometimes our tendency is not to state our  reasons publicly I think we could probably counteract a certain  amount of the inflationary expectations that this signal might cause   Finally, I’d like to compliment you, sir, for your emphasis  on establishing and announcing longer-range strategies and sticking  with them, and abandoning our month-to-month fine-tuning over an 1/8  percentage point on the federal funds rate That comes like a breath  of fresh air It‘s the best news I’ve heard for three years!   No sir, I’ll wait   Mr Chairman, I‘m concerned about one bit of  verbiage where reference is made to two possible policies One says  u  S   policy is aimed at countering short-run disorderly market  conditions Then there is explicit wording in the Morton-Truman memo  which says that if US policy is also designed to resist exchange  market movements that carry the dollar‘s value beyond levels that are  deemed to be reasonable in either direction, the United States might  want to be prepared to accumulate substantial holdings My question  is this In terms of the rules of the game that we are playing, are  we contemplating going beyond just reacting to disorderly conditions  and actually trying to peg [the value of the dollar]?     4/17/79 -37-   Whose judgment is that, Alan?   I see   NO    Thank you, Mr Chairman I have always previously paid attention to  the aggregates and still do   As you recall, prior to this surge in the aggregates, I spoke out at the  last meeting for some ease because of my concern about the undershooting of the [MI] range I do  think that we should take it seriously, even though we don’t know whether the present surge is  temporary or not There is some historical perspective Last year at this time of the year the  aggregates did surge upward and they then remained at a fairly level but higher [rate of growth] for  a period of time, so I don’t think we can ignore this I would recommend that the Desk be  authorized to use the full 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent range for the fed funds target and be prepared to  permit the fed funds rate to move upward toward 10-1/2 percent in an orderly fashion If this surge  in the aggregates is temporary, then we can permit it once again to fall toward 10 [or even] 9314  percent So I think we ought to broaden the fed funds [movement] and use the full range and be  flexible as we see how permanent the present surge turns out to be   CHARMAN MILLER Larry, I commend you for also being consistent in watching  the aggregates But I’m not sure I understood what you thought the instructions should be to the  Desk or what the interpretation should be today as distinguished from over the period   Well, ideally, I would like to see us say to the Desk that it should move  [the funds rate] up to 10-1/2 percent if on the basis of its judgment it sees fit to do so Realistically,  I would say that to proceed in an orderly way we should move to 10-1/4 percent as quickly as  possible and [subsequently] move it higher And if the fed funds rate does continue to move  upward, Mr Chairman, I think some consideration should be given to an increase in the discount  rate   Fine    Jim, do you have any specific figure that you are  using to reflect the effect of energy price increases on inflation?  Have you quantified that even in a rough way?   Yes What has happened?   Mr Chairman, those of us who watch the longer-  term behavior of the aggregates are not in the slightest surprised by  the fact that we are seeing a softening in the economy There is  absolutely no question in our mind that this problem is with us; the     5 /22 /79  -26-   only questions that we see are how deep the downturn or recession will  be and how long it will persist Of course, we believe that the key  to how deep this recession will be and how long it will persist lies  in the control of growth in the aggregates We do not believe that  the aggregates have a life of their own; we think they are  controllable We believe that as long as the Committee continues to  attempt to stabilize the federal funds rate, we are going to have the  volatility in the behavior of the aggregates to which some of the  preceding speakers have referred  concentrating on aggregate growth, we would seek a 2 to 3 percent rate  of growth in M1; that may be [equivalent to] a 6 percent rate in the  old pre-ATS days We don't think the upturn in M1 in April is  necessarily conclusive evidence that growth will continue We should  watch it The way we see it, any one month uptick or downtick in the  monetary aggregates is not very indicative of anything If we had our  druthers--and we don't have our druthers--and were really  concentrating on control of the aggregates, we would encourage a  widening of the fed funds range and a narrowing of the target ranges  for the aggregates   Finally, in anticipation of the inevitable tendency to swing  [policy] around the other way and become expansive if a recession  occurs--and we think one will occur--1 would hope that in the calm of  this day we can resolve not to repeat past errors Let's resolve not  to panic at that time, not to move aggressively toward expansion or to  respond to the political pressures to get ourselves out of a softened  economy Basically, I think we ought to be firm I'd like to see us  target on the aggregates; I don't think I will live to see it, but  that would be our prescription, M r   Chairman   If we were controlling and   I would prefer alternative B with a wider federal  funds range of 9-314 to 10-112 percent And in order to help the  unreliable aggregates become a mite more reliable, I'd go with an  aggregates directive    We don’t view the slowdown in the economy that we’re presently     6/21/19 6   experiencing--technically caused by the small rate of money growth or the decline in the growth  of money since October--as an almost certain signal of some economic softening We view the  decline of the dollar in the past week essentially as a reflection of the recent dramatic  strengthening in the growth of the aggregates We think that a prudent slowdown in money  growth would not cause any significant further economic downturn, especially in view of the  recent strength in the aggregates And we think that a definite and consistent slowdown in  money growth would have a salutary effect on the dollar in international exchange markets The  conclusion we reach is that a moderate increase in the fed funds rate could be expected to have a  beneficial effect in terms of our dollar problems And we don’t believe that increase would be  the straw that would break the camel’s back in terms of contributing materially to any further,  continued slowdown in the domestic economy    Scott, you mentioned "fundamentals" at the end of  your report Isn't the recent expansion of the aggregates, and its  portending a less than effective determination to deal with inflation,  very fundamental regardless of energy and these other things? Doesn't  that come into the minds of these traders?   Jim, what weight do you give to monetary induced  inflation, the part of inflation that is a reflection of monetary  policy versus food and energy? Let's assume we have a deflator  increase of 10 percent, just in broad brush Sometimes I think we  like to believe that we are prisoners of exogenous factors What part  of that 10 percent is a reflection of monetary policy and what part is  a reflection of energy and food prices?   M R   KICHLINE Well, I don't think I can answer that question  directly The way the staff has looked at this is to view monetary  policy as affecting the markets and economic activity If we had an  "easier" monetary policy, as indexed by faster rates of growth of M1,  it would show up in our thinking in higher rates of expansion in real  GNP in the short run--assuming we're not at capacity--tighter markets,  and with some lag, more inflation Trying to sort out particularly  how much more inflation in this forecast is difficult I really  haven't thought of it in that way   Well, let me rephrase it, if I may Our  economists tell me that if one were going to quantify this, that  perhaps 70 percent of our inflation is money policy induced, or a  direct reflection of our monetary policy, that energy at its present  dimension may be responsible for 1 percentage point of [the deflator]  and food 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points That would mean, if that is a  valid assumption that we still are in a position to affect this in a  very real fashion by the decisions we make today Are these guys way  off base, do you think?   Yes sir, Mr Chairman I find this an extremely  interesting exercise because we are looking ahead and we are trying to  function on a longer-term basis I also find most interesting the  handout from the staff on past and prospective rates of growth in the  monetary aggregates And I think those figures, to a great extent,  explain what has happened We had money growth [in] '77 and '78  significantly in excess of 7 percent and we are reaping some of the  inflationary consequences of that rate of money growth We jammed on  the [brakes]--the rate of money growth dropped significantly early  this year--so we should not be in any way surprised by the recession  that we are experiencing The recent and continued upsurge in the  rate of money growth also would signal quite clearly that probably  this recession will be a "shallow saucer" configured recession   As regards what we should do, I believe very sincerely that  what we do--in spite of what OPEC does or has done--can have a very  real effect on future price levels I think it can have a 70 to 75     7 / 1 1 / 7 9  -23-    percent effect, with energy maybe affecting this scenario somewhat--  maybe 10 percent on a scale of a 100 I would have to respectfully  disagree with you, Mr Chairman If we really were determined to  [clamp] down on inflation gradually, we should feel greatly frustrated  by the OPEC action--1 think it's a contributing factor--but I think it  would be a shame to feel ourselves inhibited in monetary policymaking  by that occurrence   Well, I thought earlier that you--   Well, I was going to parallel somewhat what Bob  Black said I think the first question you'd get--and you're much  more experienced than I in appearing before those people [on the  Congressional Committees] is Mr Chairman, you've said repeatedly  that gradually over the years you are going to try to phase down  inflation, so how will these figures you've just given us conform with  that? In other words, will doing the same thing next year as we're  doing this year really be a meaningful first step to gradually  cranking this [inflation] down? That's what I would [expect]   I’d just like to suggest that we broaden the fed  funds range symbolically to 1 point, and I would be perfectly happy  with alternative I1 and 9-3/4 to 10-3/4 percent But if we are going  to signal a substantial and real interest in controlling the  aggregates in any way, somewhere along the line we will have to move  toward a broadening of the fed funds range   Let's have our December meeting in Acapulco!    I would recommend that we follow the directive-- let the fed funds rate move to 10-1/2 percent--and that we raise the discount rate 1/2 point  Yes sir, I would support it  Mr Chairman, do you want us to wait at this line or will you call us in the morning or what?  -10-    7/19/79  Are you coming back to the Presidents?   Scott, in your report you alluded to some apprehension or nervousness in the market in relation to this meeting today Is that nervousness that we may tighten monetary policy or that we may continue to vacillate? What did you mean by that?  But the bearishness is essentially a concern about expanding inflation? Is that what you mean?  Doesn't their major concern pertain to their inflationary expectations for the United States? If we came to grips or appeared to come to grips with inflation along the lines of the new Chairman's statements, wouldn't that have a constructive effect on the value of the dollar?  Yes, sir I purposely waited until the end of the batting order because up until the last few expressions of opinion I was so wholeheartedly in agreement with everything that was said that I didn't want to express that agreement until everyone was committed verbally to that position I didn't want to drive others off!  I subscribe, Mr Chairman, to your introductory remarks I think they express the best analysis of a longer-range strategy that I've heard since I've been a member of this group You have publicly expressed your determination to do whatever possible with monetary policy over a long range Certainly we aren't going to bring inflation down in a 6-month period And certainly we're never going to bring inflation down if we act on a month-to-month, quarter-to- quarter [basis of] fine-tuning I think it's terribly important, as so many others here have said, that we do something symbolically today to reinforce the credibility of the policies that you have expressed in the short time you've been Chairman  Specifically, I would favor at least the alternative C program I think we have to move toward widening the fed funds range and freeing interest rates to move more freely I would perhaps go beyond that, as Mark Willes expressed, by reducing the monetary aggregate ranges even below those in alternative C But I would not recommend anything more of [unintelligible] than that shown under alternative C  I eliminate my remark from the record!    8/14/79   Scott, you alluded to the fact that as the energy  induced segment of inflation improves--or recedes--it may bring some  improvement into the picture Don‘t most of the foreign exchange  market partipants really look at the monetary induced part of the  inflation picture, which of course reflects money growth? Don’t they  look at that? Don’t they recognize that if total inflation were to be  reduced from 10 to 8 percent, we’d still have the basic underlying  money induced part of the inflation? Won‘t that still be their  primary concern in terms of the market?   Yes sir, Mr Chairman In listening to Steve, I  found myself very much confused or disturbed by an underlying question  that maybe he or someone else can answer In Steve's analysis of  what's happening in M1, he decribed three possible or at least two  exogenous factors One is the public's desire to draw down cash  balances and the possibility that somewhere along the line the public  added to cash balances Steve did allude to the possibility that we  contributed to the explosion of M1 by trying to stabilize the fed  funds rate at a time of strong credit demands I think you, Mr  Chairman, mentioned the possibility of the oil situation contributing  to this I get the feeling that we sort of feel that these exogenous  factors that are beyond our control are really what leads to an  unexpected explosion in the rate of M1 growth Then when Steve gets  to his suggested alternatives, he essentially concentrates, if I heard  him correctly, on what we ought to do on the fed funds rate--either  stand pat or let it tick [up] or let it recede My question, and I  ask this really as a noneconomist, is Can't we through our open  market operations control the rate of M1 growth in spite of these     9/18/79 -13-   exogenous factors? I get the feeling that we continue to react to  some [developments1 out there that we can’t control Couldn’t we in  this room this morning, if we decided that we really wanted to, set a  target for M1 growth and mechanically through open market operations  over a long period of time achieve that target?   First of all, being from the other end of the same  rural state, I would have to disagree with Roger's analogy When one  prepares a chicken for serving, one usually has the best results if  the dish is served up without any guts, whereas I think monetary  policy--well, I'll stop at that   I'd like to take up very briefly some of the things that have  been said First of all, I'd invite your attention to page 10 [of the  Bluebook], the upper graph showing the growth of M1 during this year  [Some would] conclude that [policy has been appropriate] because the  average of M1 for the year appears to fall between our targets I  would point out that the roller coaster effect that we've experienced  is really very damaging to stability If you remember your friend's  button that I wore to one meeting--and was nearly fired as a result--I  implied that that dip early in the year would result in recession  The dip occurred and we are experiencing a recession I don't think  the up and down movement is a good thing I also am concerned--   Yes I hear some of my friends say that we have  moved interest rates up 100 basis points I don't think we moved  those rates; I think strong credit demand and inflationary     9/18/79 - 3 2 -    expectations moved those rates up If anything, we have leaned  against what the [increase in rates1 would have been had we not  expanded the money supply Furthermore, for those who feel that a  further rise in interest rates would have the effect of lengthening  and deepening the recession, I would point out that if--in order to  maintain the fed funds rate at its present level--we permit [such]  growth of the aggregates to continue, the public perception [will be  one1 of excessive aggregates growth And I think the result will be  interest rates that are even higher than they are now, in spite of our  attempt to keep rates where they are or to stand pat   Specifically, I think we have no choice but to do whatever we  can to bring M1 growth back under control I would urge two steps  One, our board was unanimous in its recommendation that the discount  rate be moved up 1/2 point [Second], whatever the range for M1, I  think the upper limit of the M1 range for the period ahead should not  exceed 5 percent exclusive of ATS or 6-1/2 percent with ATS I think  the best thing we have going for us is [the public’s] belief--in  reaction to the excellent statements by our Chairman--that we are  determined to maintain monetary discipline If we do anything that  can be interpreted as a move toward ease, I think our last thread of  credibility will be lost And a very important new policy that has  been enunciated by Chairman Volcker will be less than truly effective  if we do that S o ,  that‘s my thinking   I believe our range last month for M1 was 4 to 8  and you would adjust it to 3 to 8 percent The 8 percent bothers me,  Mr Chairman, because that 8--when we add 1-1/2 for ATS--means we  really would tolerate a 9-1/2 percent growth in M1 if we let M1 go to  the top of these specifications That's a heck of a growth rate if  we're trying to correct the overshoot that we probably already have  That's my only reaction I repeat that I really don't think [we  should have] anything over 6-1/2 percent as the upper limit; the upper  limit is much more important than the lower limit under the present  circumstances    May that wire be shared with our research people--  those cleared [to see FOMC material]?   Our research director?    Well, Mr Chairman, I assume that my credibility  with you and my colleagues would be severely jeopardized if I came out  flatly in opposition to this proposal! [Laughter] I also was told by  my father to keep my mouth shut when things are going well So all  I’ll say is briefly God bless you for doing this! [Laughter]   Recognizing that, M r   Chairman, rather than try to  plug in numbers today and agree on detailed procedures--if, as I  assume, we have a consensus on a change of approach--wouldn’t it be     10/6/79 -29-   wise to ask the staff to work on that? Perhaps we could ask the  Board staff as well as selected or interested staff representatives  from some of the Reserve Banks to wrestle with the details of how to  do this as well as the details of the specifications That could be  done between now and the time we would normally come here for our  meeting in a couple of weeks That might make sense rather than  trying to work with these figures that we have seen for a very short  time and that our research staffs, in most instances, have not even  had an opportunity to react to If you made this announcement on  Monday and if there were a 10-day period for staff to try to put  together more [precise] specifications and procedures, those could be  circulated and we could discuss them at our regular FOMC meeting  Would that be more productive? Some of us are not professional  economists and to sign off on specific numbers and specific details  today - -   Well, I thought we were going to get into the  numbers I was off base there   Couldn't your announcement say that over a  mandatory period of a couple of weeks we are going to do this in an  orderly, gradual, manner? Do we have to do it right from the  beginning?   M R   COLDWELL Yes   In your announcement Monday, will you announce any  figures?   Right, but not any more precise figures What I'm  worried about, for example--and I'm not trying to get specific--is the  8 percent monetary base figure referred to in this document Our  research staff said that if the people who watch this saw an 8 percent  figure for monetary base growth, that would immediately destroy the  credibility of the whole effort     1 0 / 6 / 7 9  -31-   I second that!     10/6/79 -45-   These are those who feel we should continue as  with everything we said this morning?   Mr Chairman, is this communication, this  [directive], going to be kept within this group as far as publicity--?   There are aspects that I think could cause some  trouble with the analysis I'm talking about the wire and the  [decision]    We would support using the full fed funds range  and exceeding it if need be One of the problems that we sense is an  uncertainty on the part of the markets--and probably more generally--  as to exactly how we intend to achieve all our goals I wonder if any  thought has been given, or should some thought be given, to our  announcing specifically the total reserves and base [levels] necessary  to achieve our M1 target? I would think the more specific the  information is that we give, the greater the degree of stability we  might expect from the markets and the various forces involved    You're only asking Committee members?    I wonder if some of the lack of dynamism or some of the sluggishness in this whole process might not be a reflection of the fact that large segments of the markets aren't quite sure exactly what we're doing That leads me to the question that I would direct to Steve or Peter What would happen if we specifically and publicly described what our paths are--or at least some of our paths--so that the markets could adjust to what they know our game plan really is instead of feeling that there's some vague thing going on that they're not sure of Their reluctance or lack of reaction may be due in part to the fact that people don't want to stick their necks out in the markets until they really know what our reserve path is or what our monetary base path is What are the negatives to defining those things publicly?  As this process goes on, Peter, and as we become a little more comfortable and confident in the process, would you anticipate that we would describe more publicly and more specifically what we're doing? Obviously, if unforeseen circumstances cause us to change, we could certainly explain why we're changing  Are we planning to go public with the nomenclature M-lA and M-1B? Isn't that going to get us some laughs? In other words, I think either M-1A or M-1B would be a very acceptable aggregate, but can't we rename the baby M1 again and explain it? I think every columnist in the world is going to write that you economists are fuzzing this up again Is that a problem or not?  -23-    1/8-9/80  But you're not going to publish the difference between M-1A and M-1B as such  Mr Chairman, does the Committee not feel that the marketing or explanatory aspect of this is important? I'm talking about the ability to relate to my friendly broker, who busted out of school his sophomore year! I'm being facetious, but isn't it important to make an effort to be as clear and as simple as possible in describing this?  Would we drop the other if--  Wouldn't you drop M-1A if they change the law?  First of all, if I may, let me commend the staff I think the form of this Bluebook is the best I have ever seen Maybe we will only keep it within our own family, but it enables us to make these decisions in the context of economic implications instead of just looking ahead for 2 or 3 weeks as we sometimes have in the past I would very much recommend that we announce--or that at least you announce--as forcibly as possible our intention to lower our growth rates over a 3-year period I think it's important to recognize that there is absolutely no way in the world other than by affecting expectations to anticipate a reduction in inflation during the calendar year 1980 The only possibility we have of accomplishing anything along these lines is to make our longer-term intentions sufficiently clear that anticipations and expectations would react favorably It's vitally important in the world in which we live that our new--and I certainly feel proper--approach to monetary policymaking not be pre-judged with the expectation that we will get results in the year 1980 I think that would cause political pressures that would be disastrous Specifically, I would recommend a 5 percent [growth] rate, as shown under the alternative 2 description on page 8, and strategy 3 on page 11 in terms of 1980, 1981, and 1982 Possibly, if it's unpalatable to think of actually putting out numerical [intentions] to the world--and I'd say in that regard that our primary responsibility is not to protect our own flank but to come  -45-    1/8-9/80  to grips with inflation and to accomplish these other [objectives]--at least our determination to reduce money growth over a 3-year period should be announced and announced clearly That's the only way we are going to have any effect in anything like a short-term context That's all I have  According to page 4 of The Wall Street Journal, it was a West German newspaper reporter quoting Saudi Arabia's oil minister as saying that the currency basket appeared inevitable  Mr Chairman, I am concerned about what you alluded to as a thread that ran throughout Steve's comments indicating a continued concern about interest rates because interest rate movements would affect output one way or another It seems to me--and I don't say this critically in your direction, Steve--that we did adopt and publicly announce a new program whereby, within broad limits, we were going to permit interest rates to fluctuate freely in order to concentrate on the control and gradual reduction of money growth I think we will frustrate our whole purpose and the possibility of succeeding in this new approach if we have tucked behind in our minds all the time the view that a primary, or at least very important, aspect of what we're doing is somehow continuing along the path that we were on of trying to control interest rates and hope that in this process we can achieve some [reduction of] money growth I don't think we can have it both ways I would ask Steve Is the staff still imbued with a real concern about interest rates?  Let me just ask this There has been reference made to the possibility that interest rates would drop I noted with interest and with admiration the fact that the Chairman in a recent speech said publicly to the world Don't be concerned if interest rates drop because under our new practices interest rates could  -63-    1/8-9/80  conceivably drop and not signal any easing of policy Now, isn't it possible, through the utterances of the Chairman and others, to say that we have somewhat of a new ball game? We're doing this differently and people should stop thinking along the lines they have been accustomed to thinking over the last 10 years because the last 10 years certainly didn't bring the desired results I'm fearful that we're just letting ourselves be a little bit pregnant and running all over the lot  I would like to be listed under the alternative B team I think there is a possibility that "C" would represent too drastic a reduction from a higher level of money growth to a lower level of money growth, and that could have recessionary implications So, I would opt for "B"  If we worked with a monetary base--and I know that is a dirty word--we'd obviate all these problems, I think  Mr Chairman, did I understand that if we have staff papers on one or more of these studies that you anticipate those being discussed in the morning meeting rather than at an afternoon meeting?  In spite of remaining flexible, the earlier we can get notification the more helpful it would be Getting travel reservations is a real problem   Could [we meet] on the original dates in those months instead of moving--?  Is there supposed to be a response?  When was that?  That was before the good days!  Just to set the record straight, I have a change of position since the advent of the age of enlightenment in St Louis We're strongly in support of contemporaneous reserve accounting I would subscribe to John Balles' concern about moving before the operational changes have been considered and made and [so forth] In talking to our bank relations people, I got the impression that as many banks dislike this lagged reserve arrangement as favor it Anyway, let the record show that whatever happened in 1976 does not reflect our present position We support it  SPEAKER(?) Yes, in June of 1976  Steve tells me we were the only people--  Jim, maybe you've answered this I am a little lost On the GNP implicit price deflator, where your projections show an increase into 1981, did you put any weight on monetary policy? In order words if, as we have announced, we are going to reduce gradually the rate of money growth, do you still anticipate this upward movement in the deflator, or was that not put in your--?  But you show it going up [initially]; it's sort of a roller coaster  -26-    2/4-5/80  Do you see that prevailing through the second quarter of 1981? In other words, you don't see any relief even though we're doing what we are doing here in gradually reducing the rate of [monetary growth]?  But if we hang in there, which we are determined to do, and keep firm control over and gradually reduce the growth rate of whatever Ms we are controlling, don't all these other things fall into line? Or do you still have to run 400 equations to see what--?  I base my projections almost entirely on a rate of basic money growth, and the figures I will suggest are predicated on a rate of growth of M-1A and M-1B of roughly 5 percent If there is a 5 percent basic money growth rate, I would see real GNP declining by maybe 1 percentage point fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter I would see the GNP deflator, which is what we look at really, at about a 10  -37-    2/4-5/80  percent rate during the fourth quarter of next year, or maybe 9-1/2 percent--obviously, these percentages can vary by 1/2 point--and I would see an unemployment rate of roughly 7 percent However, I feel very strongly that what we do will have a very direct bearing on the outcome of these figures, and if we were to set growth ranges for M-1A and M-1B at 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and if growth came in at close to 3-1/2 percent, that would have a significant weakening effect on these three figures that I suggested, as we see it In other words, GNP would be significantly lower and unemployment significantly higher And if growth came in close to the top end of that band, at let's say 6-1/2 percent, I think we'd see a much more serious acceleration in the deflator, a significantly stronger GNP result, and a significantly lower unemployment rate What I am driving at is that I think we have the key to this in our hands and that all three of these factors will depend on what we decide to do and how carefully and with what determination we stick with whatever we decide to do I would personally be very much opposed to a tax cut I would perhaps be much more tolerant of a tax cut that was an across-the-board, consumer- directed tax cut if later in the year or next year the government decided to give some tax relief directed to stimulating capital formation I think that might be desirable but I do not favor a tax cut, not that it makes much difference in that regard what I think But in what we do, we can make a big difference on the money growth  I found more to the change [unintelligible] I think there was some confusion last time Wouldn't M-1B--  Mr Chairman, I am a little at a loss to understand why some of our colleagues, who I know are much more economically sophisticated and learned than I am, express confusion and concern as to whether or not we have a fundamental policy mandate and whether or not we can accomplish that If one looks at this in a simplistic fashion, [one thing is] certain We have told the world that our primary objective is a reduction in inflation accomplished on a gradual basis so as to avoid, if possible, drastic recessionary consequences And we have said we're going to accomplish that objective by gradually reducing the rate of growth of the monetary aggregates It seems to me that there has been overwhelming approval, both in the press and the public, and very little expression of disapproval of this basic policy objective To me the biggest problem facing us, as I hear from people in our community, is a broad doubt or skepticism as to our willingness or ability to accomplish these objectives I vehemently disagree with those of you who say that it is questionable whether or not we can gradually reduce the growth of the monetary aggregates We can do it We can do it either by controlling the path of total reserves or controlling the monetary base or a combination of both I am a little concerned about the fact that we don't spend more time reflecting on what the monetary base and nonborrowed reserves and total reserves have done, as described on page 2 [of the Bluebook], because these are specific ways whereby we can accomplish our monetary aggregate growth [objectives] In order to do what we've said we're going to do, we have to strive for a 5 or 5-1/2 percent rate of growth in M-1A or M-1B over the next year I don't think we can react to short-term shortfalls or overruns on these  -57-    2/4-5/80  [aggregates] Anybody who says what has happened in the last two or three weeks is a cause for alarm just doesn't understand how this process works We have to set long-term targets and we have to stick with those long-term targets unless and until there are fundamental changes in public thinking and fundamental changes in our policy that would [point] toward our retreating from these longer-term targets  I would agree with Mark and others that it would be preferable, if we could possibly swallow this enormous step, to narrow our ranges so that we indeed can accomplish a 5 or 5-1/2 percent growth I don't think it's our job to try to position ourselves so that our targets are so broad that we can always say we accomplished our targets if the world [falls apart] while we're protecting our own reputations Our reputation is on the line People totally and broadly subscribe to what the Chairman has announced and I don't think we can enjoy the luxury anymore of vacillating The fat is in the fire and I think a narrow range under either alternative II or III around 5 percent for the M-1A and M-1B targets would be the best way to accomplish this  The Swiss did that on a contrived basis, though, to make their goods more competitive It wasn't because the mechanism is not workable   Larry Roos here In order to get something on the floor, I move that we raise  the upper limit to 18 percent If we don't have to use [the additional leeway] we won't, but it will be  there if the Desk needs it   I think my question was probably answered, Mr Chairman As I understand this process, every day you have a total reserve path target in mind, right?  But the figure on borrowings is available to you on a [daily basis]?  So, if you have a total reserve figure in mind and you know what the borrowings are, can't the adjustment almost automatically be made on the nonborrowed side to give you the total? If you know borrowings and if you know what total reserves should be, then can't you simply adjust the nonborrowed part of this to give you the total reserves you want?  I recognize that But if we offset, or if we don't supply the required reserves, what happens? Do we have to accommodate the needs of the banks? Or could we not stick by our total reserve target, and if they are short, they would have to scramble to adjust their operations to what we want to do  Is that a bad thing?  Are we fearful that interest rates will [rise]?  Well, we do want to do that, don't we?  They've ignored the farmers, haven't they?  Well, [Mr Guffey and I] are both from Missouri, and my approach to [policy] will underscore the great diversity of thinking that occurs in the great state of Missouri, Mr Chairman Very briefly, the general condition of the economy as we see it is a fairly level one with the exception of the building and real estate areas and automobile sales and manufacturing, which are obviously quite weak Just last week we had a group of savings and loan people in for lunch, and they reported very severe trouble, as your savings bank people are experiencing, Frank Our agricultural loan demand continues strong Basically, we haven't sensed any significant weakening in the last few weeks  With regard to policy, I would favor alternative B I would resist like the plague any narrowing of the fed funds range If anything, I would favor a widening of it; I certainly wouldn't seek that, but I would oppose a narrowing of it With regard to this matter of credibility, I wonder if it isn't incumbent upon all of us to go out of our way in the weeks and months ahead to explain what we are trying to do and have our staffs at their various speaking [engagements] concentrate on explaining it, too I think there is a general lack of knowledge Within this room there is the capability of telling people Don't look at the weekly figures; don't even look at the monthly figures I don't think we have to be slaves to this problem of credibility We should be missionaries and salespeople to the greatest extent possible and explain how we are trying to operate now Anyway, that's the gist of my point of view  -29-    3/18/80  I'd like to keep the 11-1/2   Mr Chairman, before we feel that our inability to forecast monthly behavior of the aggregates reflects some sort of weakness in what we're doing, I think we should keep in mind the fact that even the most ardent monetarists have never believed it is possible to control money or to avoid fluctuations on a month-to-month basis If we see an undershoot or an overshoot in the short term, even though it might seem desirable to lean against that deviation through the operations of the Desk, I really don't think we should Nor should we feel that because the aggregates are unpredictable on a month-to-month basis it in any way detracts from the wisdom of how we are conducting our business  I'd like to pursue, if I may, the reasoning that Steve expressed It's my understanding that back in October we adopted a policy of letting interest rates flow freely Indeed, interest rates did move up rather dramatically and we did not act to impede that upward movement; we let them move Now, Steve, if I understood you correctly, you expressed concern that if we permitted interest rates to decline dramatically, there could be adverse reactions from markets and other sources in terms of inflationary expectations--that they may misread that in spite of the fact that the Chairman has repeated frequently the possibility that interest rates might decline and that it would not be a signal of any easing of our determination to deal with inflation I have two questions One question is Isn't it illogical to let rates move one way and then get "antsy," if I may use a bad phrase, when they move the other way? Secondly--and I might pose this question to the Chairman--if we permit interest rates to drop, can't we in our published records, or through comments by the Chairman and others, explain that this is in no way any retreat from our primary concern with inflation? In other words, one of the things that I think causes the concern that you expressed is that in the past we have acted with a degree of mystery and secrecy and let the markets draw their own conclusions Can't we comfort them and explain the rationale behind what we are doing?  Are they limited, Paul, by the tradition of our taking an action and letting people decide what caused us to do what we did or are they limited for other reasons? I think your persuasive potential--and it isn't salary-setting time, so I'm not polishing the apple--is enormous [Laughter] But I think the Fed has traditionally not used that potential in past years because we thought we should just take actions and let the people out there decide why we did    4/22/80  Do you accept the fact that if we keep money growing slowly, there is a direct effect on output? Isn't that part of the risk?  I would subscribe to "B," Mr Chairman I think your analysis is totally consistent with the facts of life I don't want to belabor the 20 or 19 percent upper limit on the funds range other than to say that any change in it, to the person who concentrates on minuscule parts of what we're doing, might imply that  -29-    4/22/80  we still have an inordinate concern about the fed funds rate But I don't feel strongly about that "B" basically makes good sense to me  But Fred, if I may, Mr Chairman, the factors that would essentially cause interest rates to decline would be a softening of economic activity and a softening in the demand for credit of a substantial scope If that were to happen--if the economy were in a seriously weakened condition and credit demand fell off--and, let's say, we consulted, our only option it seems to me would be to pull money out of the economy with great force And boy, that would certainly put the final kobosh--if I may use another Missouri expression--on the recession Is that correct? I don't know what part of the world that expression came from But that would really drive a very serious nail into the recessionary situation and would be procyclical and accelerate a recession   This is Larry Roos from St Louis and I agree totally with Chuck Partee  This is Larry Roos I'd like to point out one thing My agreement with Chuck Partee is from the point of view of policy I'd ask those who feel that we ought to resist the downward movement in the fed funds rate if they don't recognize that the only way we can do that is by pulling reserves out of the System And that has the effect of exacerbating the downward movement of the economy, which I don't think anybody wants at this stage of the game   This is Larry Roos I would strongly recommend the 10 percent figure I think we've got to be willing to let interest rates move fairly freely, both upward and downward And 10 percent would be my position  There are [several] points I would like to make First of all, we have announced that the foundation of our policy is to permit money to grow at 55 percent Secondly, we have announced that we have abandoned the policy of attempting to stabilize interest rates And thirdly, I think we recognize that the most important objective of the Federal Reserve today is to restore credibility in our willingness and our ability to stick with a long-range policy and not change course the minute any short-term phenomenon occurs So in addition to what Tony Solomon said [regarding] our objectives, I think the most important objective is consistency and re-establishing our credibility And I know of no way to destroy that credibility more quickly than to start dancing back toward the stabilization of interest rates, after you and all the rest of us have said that we're no longer targeting on the fed funds rate  This is Larry Roos I feel that setting up a meeting a week from now could be bad practice, if we were to tolerate a further withdrawal of reserves Our big problem right now is that the aggregates are undershooting our targets If, for example, for four or five days the Desk had to withdraw reserves in order to keep the funds rate at 11 percent, that would further exacerbate our undershooting problems And I think we'd end up being accused of having once again been procyclical in making the prospects for a recession even more real  So has St Louis  Same for St Louis   Yes, Mr Chairman Peter, I'm a little confused about your April operations You attempt to achieve our aggregate growth targets, as I understand it, through the establishment and achievement of certain reserve paths--either for total reserves or the base Is that correct?    5/20/80  Well, I noticed [in] the Bluebook that [the staff], as I assumed the Committee as a whole would be, again was trying to understand the reason for the rather substantial drop in the rate of money growth during [April] Now, during that month actual reserve growth was 27 percent for total reserves and 19 percent for the monetary base  Let me ask you this Do you have specific figures in terms of the monetary base, for example, that you try to achieve as a guide for your operations?  These figures--the 27 percent, say, on total reserves and the nonborrowed part of that--I assume are significantly lower than the path that you sought Is that a fair statement?  Let me just ask this, pursuing this line of questioning Isn't it possible for you to achieve or at least to get closer to your path objectives than these two figures? It's mechanically possible to do, is it not?  What adjustments can you make, or do you make, if you see that we are coming out below the desired path, to supply reserves so they come out to a higher level? I thought you almost automatically try to adjust for that situation  When you observe that, Peter, can't you take compensating actions to inject reserves?  Couldn't you achieve a base path objective if you wanted to?  In other words, within the family, to be candid, is it the federal funds constraint that really causes us to miss these paths occasionally?  If you have an engine where both ends of that train are going in opposite directions, you have a very strange situation  Mr Chairman, isn't this the dilemma that plagued us over the pre-October period, though, where we had incompatibility between our fed funds objective and other objectives?  A lot of people in the real world--and I'm sorry to [belabor this] but I know we have them in the real world where I live--are hoping desperately that when this incompatibility occurs we will do what we said we were going to do Keep our eye on the reserve growth targets and let interest rates fluctuate That really is the fundamental issue that we face, and I think our credibility--  Mr Chairman, I think it is important to understand fully the nature of the decision we made on October 6 and    5/20/80  the potential or lack of potential for accomplishing what we said we were going to accomplish As I understood the meaning of what we said in October, it was that we were going to set fairly long-range targets for the growth of money By law we have to do that We have announced those targets to Congress and we've announced them publicly as targets for a span of one year [We said] that in any targeting of monetary growth there are inevitably going to be some overshoots and some shortfalls That is a part of the process And if our objective is to achieve longer-range targets, when we have a significant shortfall such as we have [now] we will take steps to compensate for that shortfall by expanding the rate of money growth in order to bring us back into the target range I've always seen it as similar to the process of steering a large ship If the ship swings off course, you attempt gradually to bring it back onto course And in my opinion, these overshoots and shortfalls are not totally beyond our control If they were, then we would be making better use of our time to be back in our various Districts trying to administer the various programs of a local nature We do have the ability at least to influence the growth of money in a very significant manner I think not only is the credibility of our October 6 program at stake, but the very credibility of the Open Market Committee is at stake in terms of whether or not we perform what we've said we were going to accomplish  I wish there were an alternative C that could get us back to the range even before September, but being a realist I guess alternative B is the best we can accomplish But also being a realist, I would bet a Christmas turkey--although I'm not a betting man--that there's no way of accomplishing alternative B and getting us back within the range by September with the constraint of a 9 to 14 percent federal funds target I see no reason why, after we've finally gotten into better habits than in the past by having a broader fed funds range, we're all of a sudden [talking about] narrowing it again I think we should have a 5 to 15 percent fed funds range on alternative B, and I would certainly prefer alternative B to alternative A  Let me just close by making one further observation As our Chairman has said repeatedly, as have others among us, accepting a reduction in interest rates in times like this should not be construed as an easing of monetary policy As for concern about the adverse effect that a further reduction in interest rates would have on the international exchange markets, the day that any of us says that publicly, [people will say] "Look, the Fed is retreating to its old practice of concentrating on the stabilization of interest rates" If that is said or if that is perceived, I think we'll have a catastrophe in terms of the value of the dollar on international exchange markets that will far overshadow the effects of seeing interest rates continue to drop gradually, if that is a necessary adjunct to achieving the objectives that were stated in October I feel very strongly that it's a critical time [for us to persist] in what we're doing I've felt a great deal of pride in taking to the hustings with the message that we are serious in what we're doing and we're going to stick with it If we vacillate now, Mr Chairman, I think the game will be over  Mr Chairman, are we as a Committee accepting the conclusion that we really see great dangers in freely rising and freely falling interest rates? When interest rates went way up, did that cause disorderly markets?  Did it really? Didn't the markets adjust to it? I hate to see the stock market go down or up But why is that different than the interest rate markets?  Do you feel in your contact with the public, Paul, that nobody out there knows that we are no longer trying to control or stabilize interest rates? Hasn't that message reached anyone overseas or here or anywhere?  Mr Chairman, doesn't the Desk have to know what we're shooting for in order to [operate]? Do they just sit there and see what happens out in the wild blue yonder and then try to do something cosmetically to make it appear we've achieved that? Don't we have to give the Desk certain specific instructions?  Mr Chairman, in that one week that might elapse prior to our consulting, couldn't a lot of potentially damaging work be done by the Desk? In other words, if they're bumping against the bottom end [of the funds range], couldn't they be pulling out reserves and couldn't that exacerbate the recession and make us look bad?  May we ask Mr [Sternlight] whether that's true? I'm not questioning what--  Mr Chairman, I think it's more than the process There is a very fundamental issue at this stage The way this meeting is going and the way opinion is apparently evolving, we are getting right back to setting interest rate ranges and the stabilization of interest rates, and I could not go along with that I think we're turning the corner, all for the worse, to right back where we were  Right  In other words, we're narrowing the range significantly, Mr Chairman  SPEAKER(?) We're back to where we started out in October  I can accept Chuck's, but I couldn't accept 8-1/2 percent It looks like fine-tuning   Yes  I feel strongly that our greatest danger currently would lie in draining reserves at a time when the aggregates are already on the weak side If anything were done to drain reserves further, I think we would merely be accentuating the recessionary influences that exist I thought we agreed a few minutes ago--and I thought we agreed in our last call--that we were going to set 8-1/2 percent as the bottom limit To equivocate and not to let the fed funds rate fall through the 9-1/2 or 9 percent level, if it would normally do that, I think merely creates additional problems for us Fundamentally, if we're going to be hanged, I think we're going to be hanged for letting the aggregates weaken as a result of our efforts to drain reserves when we started seeing interest rates and the federal funds rate dropping I think that's the fundamental issue And I feel very strongly that we should stay with our 8-1/2 percent floor until rates get there  I'm not really clear on the reserve path I don't have the--    6/5/80  Well, maybe the reserve path is the wrong reserve path From all I hear the aggregates are undershooting our targets The problem is even a little perverse as we see it now And if we end up not achieving our objectives in terms of the aggregates, I think a very good case can be made that the Federal Reserve has exacerbated the present recession, as it has many times in the past, by trying to inhibit the normal movement of the fed funds rate   Isn't that market perception contributing perhaps to the weakening of the dollar and an implication that we may be repeating some of the mistakes we have made previously that were inflationary?  In other words the markets are really in doubt as to whether we are determined to carry through with a primary emphasis on controlling reserves?  But I mean those market--  Do you tell them that it doesn't have any significance?  Good  I am very close to where Dave is on this I think it would be a terrible mistake to adjust these ranges This probably will be the first real test from a credibility standpoint of whether we are fulfilling what we announced our policy would be last October To horse around or to adjust the range to accommodate what is happening rather than what we set out to achieve would be very detrimental to our credibility I think consistency is terribly important I part company [with Dave], if I understood Steve's remarks about the inflationary consequences of moving back up into the range, in that I think that we should say publicly--I think you should tell Congress--that we have fallen below the lower limits of our announced ranges for the narrow aggregates and that we are going to do what is necessary to get back within the ranges But no one should construe that as having inflationary implications other than over a very short period of time We are going to get back into these ranges because we do not want to exacerbate the recession we are in We don't want to make it worse by continuing [to foster] growth of the narrow aggregates below the ranges And I think we should make at least a strong statement--we don't want to be specific--that going into 1981 we are going to reduce gradually the rate of growth of the narrow aggregates Incidentally, our people did a study of M2 and they feel that M2 is not an accurate predictor of GNP, so I'd resist moving to place greater emphasis on our M2 targets But I think we ought to tell Congress what we are going to do--that we are going to correct for this [current] undershoot and that next year we are going to continue our policy of gradually reducing the rate of money growth We will enforce our credibility by being candid I don't think we ought to play games  Don't you think, given the tendency of the Open Market Committee in past years toward base drift, that people--or at least interested market participants and others--knew that we were playing games in those days to make ourselves look good?  Mr Chairman, would you just record me--because you hadn't asked the question on wage and price controls--as being strongly opposed to them  I agree with you totally, Bob  Why don't we do what is necessary to keep M1 where we want it, in the middle of the range? Why do we feel that we have to wait and see where it comes in when, indeed, through open market operations we have it within our ability to have it come in, at least over a period [of time], roughly where we want it?  Mr Chairman, how does that differ from four years ago when Arthur Burns said in commencement addresses that we're going to gradually reduce the rate of money growth and we equivocated and procrastinated and that's why we're in this pickle today?  But, Lyle, we believe that there is a direct tracking of the rate of growth of money and prices and also the rate of growth of money and output  We're not committing to the waffle, though, by doing this?  I don't want to get there by September; that's what has me--  What are the figures, Mr Chairman?  I agree completely with the staff  Is that a misperception, Henry?  There's a fellow in Florida who always [proposes] as a toast "Confusion to the enemy" Maybe we'll do that, Henry; we'll confuse the enemy this time  If we were to adopt "C" or anything like "C," the record would show that we took action in terms of the monetary aggregates that would definitely deepen and lengthen the recession We can be pinned on being too restrictive at this stage, too, which worries me  Has the staff said that 8-1/2 to 14 percent on fed funds is consistent with 7, 8, and 8 percent [which are] compromises?  What is the rationale, though, on preferring the compromise over alternative B?  I'd prefer "A," obviously, beause it would get us [there] theoretically We know that The question is how much--  This is an acceptance with a waffle  What would happen though, Mr Chairman, if you were asked in your testimony whether this was unanimous? How would you answer [if] we didn't take a vote? In other words, there is a difference of opinion, I'm sure, on this '81 situation How do we resolve that in terms of reporting to Congress?  Obviously there are some, Nancy, who are committed to a consistent lowering [of the ranges] So how do we--  I said there are some  And how is that difference--the fact that it isn't unanimous one way or the other--described in the record?  Doesn't this get us to the nub of the whole philosophical issue of whether we put a greater priority on reducing inflation and enduring a certain amount of pain or bitter medicine-- which are words we've all used regarding that process--or whether we will opt, if push comes to shove, for bringing relief to the economy at the risk of perpetuating inflation? It's very fundamental it seems to me  I don't know if you hear this, Mr Chairman, or if it is just a product of where I live and work But we hear constantly the overpowering, almost pleading, request from the groups we bring in, including labor leaders "For heaven sakes, do what is necessary to bring down inflation, even if it means high unemployment for a while" There is a passionate pleading of that sort, and I really don't exaggerate when I say that  There's a lag though, Nancy, isn't there?  Mr Chairman, if we expressed the intention to reduce the aggregates next year and conditions in February were such that it was just unreasonable, couldn't we take our action at that time instead of expressing the caveat and reluctance now? After all, this is purely a projection If conditions deteriorated to where we wouldn't want to act on that projection in February, we'd still have the option of not making the reduction, would we not? I don't know what we accomplish by--   St Louis enthusiastically agrees with you  This is Roos I'd prefer the 1/2 to 1   How is our national interest adversely affected if that night the OPEC people shift some of their money into sterling? Whom does this hurt?  Is that bad?  Have we had such a--  Mr Chairman, we were disturbed, as perhaps Frank was, that in the Bluebook for the first time there was a reference to the relationship between the fed funds rate and the discount rate I think it would be a mistake in policy, or at least in practice, if we caused or inhibited the movement of interest rates for the purpose of maintaining some relationship between the fed funds rate and the discount rate That's a totally new concept, I think  It's to move--    8/12/80  Well, I must have misinterpreted that  As perhaps the two newest members might not know, we base our projections on output and prices primarily on the rate of money growth, M-1B specifically Our projections show a significant difference in what will happen depending on whether M-1B grows, for example, at a rate of 3 percent or 5 percent or 7 percent from the third quarter of this year on Let me very briefly give you the different results that we would anticipate for GNP growth in 1981 If money were to grow at only a 3 percent rate, we would see real GNP growth throughout 1981 at a negative rate of minus 1/2 to minus 1 percent, whereas if we persist in our announced target of about 5 percent money growth, we would see positive real GNP growth of approximately 3/4 to 1 percent If we lost our good judgment--that's a subjective statement--and permitted money to grow at a 7 percent rate, we would see real GNP growth at a rate of between 2-1/2 to 3 percent next year Price-wise, there is also a significant difference If we had the 3 percent money growth next year, by the end of '81 we would see a deflator of maybe 6-3/4 percent by the fourth quarter of next year If we persist in our 5 percent growth, we feel that prices as measured by the deflator would rise at about 7- 1/4 percent rate on an annual basis And if we lost our good judgment and went to 7 percent growth, the deflator would be up close to 8 percent, as we see it, by the end of next year So we feel there is a significant degree of responsibility in our hands in determining the rate of money growth and thereby influencing both prices and output for 1981  I'm a 5 percenter, Mr Chairman That used to be a bad word--5 percenter--wasn't it?  I'm in line with what Bob said Our research department has done quite a bit of work recently in checking the predictive value of these various aggregates Their conclusion is quite clearly that M-1B has predicted output much more accurately than the other aggregates If we can ever get this material edited, Mr Chairman, we will circulate our wisdom to this wiser body if you'd like  Thank you, sir  I have a preference for alternative B It's not a sharp preference, but I base my position on a belief that because of increased business borrowing and the extent of borrowing by the government, an increase in interest rates toward the end of this year is probably inevitable And if, as I sense, there is a reluctance among some of us to permit interest rates to rise because that would be viewed as contributing to cutting off the [recovery]--if indeed one were to occur--then I would see the prospect of expansionary policies ahead So I'd much rather position ourselves in a more restrained position a la "B" than the other alternative But I'm not going to dig in my troops on that particular decision because I don't think there's that much difference [between the alternatives]  It's nice to have you aboard  Wouldn't that have a perceptions effect?   Paul, Larry Roos Is there any intention to withdraw some reserves in order to compensate for the overshoot in the last week or so?  Yes, sir  Where did the reserves come from to support the money supply increase?  Paul, do your people have any estimates of the monetary base for this last week, in terms of billions?  Compared to what the previous week?  That doesn't logically add up to what we're getting   Yes sir May I start, Mr Chairman? Peter, we did an analysis of the direction of interest rates in the period from June 13 through September 5 That's about a three-month period And it's rather amazing, as you pointed out, that most short-term rates were up [significantly]--90-day certificates were up 239 basis points, 4-month commercial paper was up 236 points, and 6-month bill rates were up even more than that--and yet the fed funds rate increased by only 79 basis points according to our computation Why would there be that enormous disparity? Why would the fed funds rate have risen so much less than other short-term interest rates?  Doesn't the funds rate normally track these other rates?  You mentioned in your report the sense of the telephone conference, which caused you to intervene in the fed funds    9/16/80  market Did you have a feeling from that call that you had some constraints on--  But you don't feel that--  That wouldn't have been a major contributing factor to the fed funds rate moving up only 80 basis points, whereas everything else was going up 250 to 300 basis points? We weren't holding the funds rate down, were we?  Those figures in that period did seem to be [unintelligible]  Thanks, Peter    9/16/80  The Wall Street Journal has changed its team I noticed that Mr Foldesse, or whatever his name is, who used to write --or used to misinterpret this--is no longer on that column in the Wall Street Journal Is that his name?  Is he?  Well, if the level of borrowing comes in higher than we would anticipate, [can't] you reduce the level of the nonborrowed reserves path accordingly? Can't you adjust your open market operations for the unexpected bulge in borrowing or the unexpectedly low borrowing if you ignore the effect on the fed funds market? Can't you just supply or withdraw reserves to compensate for what has happened?  Do we have to supply the reserves?  [Why] do we have to supply the reserves? If we did not supply those reserves, we'd force the commercial banks to borrow or to buy fed funds, which would move the fed funds rate up What is lurking in the back of my mind is this Are we, in effect, frustrating our ability to achieve what we want with the aggregates and with reserves because of possible concern about fluctuations in the fed funds market? In other words, do we accommodate that problem?  You said it, Henry!  I hate to belabor this, but if we look at the quarterly average rates of money growth on page 7 [of the Bluebook], for example, we see that in the first quarter M-1B grew at 6 percent, in the second quarter it declined at minus 2-1/2 percent--[the number in the column labeled "Alt B"] is a misprint, I think--and in the third quarter its growth has skyrocketed to 12-1/4 percent One can't feel that our basic objective is being met with those violent fluctuations And I don't think those rates of growth in any way reflect any action that this group agreed upon or any policy or directive that we gave They're just all over the lot And what worries me is--  Yes, that's minus 2-1/2 percent, I think  But what worries me is that we will agree on something today for the next three months, or whatever period, and then we will hope like mad that somehow or other something out in the wild blue yonder will occur to enable us to meet that I don't have the feeling that we really are causing the events to occur through our operations that we on the Committee have agreed upon from time to time  Well, Paul, maybe we ought to do some work to try to see whether we're approaching this in the most effective manner in terms of accomplishing what we have all agreed we ought to accomplish and whether the mechanism [we're using] is really the best one or not  Chuck, I think we've made great progress All I'm asking is whether from time to time we shouldn't review what we are doing and try to make it even better  Succinctly, I would say that at a time when both major political candidates seem to be competing for what they can promise in the way of a tax cut, I would strongly support what you have said, even if you have to overkill, in terms of opposing a tax cut until we get through the November [drama]  I would prefer Dave Eastburn's alternative C I would be pleased with John Balles's alternative B-minus I would begrudgingly support alternative B if that's the best we can get I wouldn't go with anything more expansive than that For those who are concerned about higher mortgage rates, if we do anything that would imply the possibility of an explosion in the aggregates, I think mortgage lenders in response to heightened inflationary expectations would increase their rates anyway If we cut this by having a control on aggregate expansion on the down side, if you will, I think we won't  -38-    9/16/80  get any higher mortgage rates than we would going the other way And we would be consistent with our stated determination to give top priority to our concern about future inflation  Mr Chairman, it seems to me on the basis of the opinions that were expressed that the compromise would really be [halfway] between the [midpoints] of "A" and "B" and the midpoint between "B" and [the proposed] "C" A lot of people expressed an opinion of wanting to go further than "B" That would bring us up to "B" at the very best in terms of the compromise  Mr Chairman, I'm disturbed, not so much even about the figures as this I thought we had agreed, and that all thinking that has ever been expressed about targeting aggregates [suggests], that we had to set long-term targets and stick with them  -51-    9/16/80  Trying to fine-tune, as I think this discussion is demonstrating that the majority in this Committee is dedicated to, for 30 days in order to have some effect on interest rates I think is a reversion back to very thing that we abandoned last October It makes intelligently targeting on aggregate growth and on reserves an impossibility This whole conversation reflects, at least as of this moment, that we've thrown in the towel on our noble expressions and intentions of last October 6th We're right back to trying to control interest rates and trying to move from moment to moment, which is what has been happening in this Committee as long as I've been sitting in these meetings This is where we have gotten into trouble in the past; whenever we've been faced with a difficult decision we've always said, in effect, let's wait another 30 days or another 60 days We procrastinate And that is why, I think, we are in the inflationary situation in this nation that we find ourselves in today I apologize for that  Fred, we can't do both at the same time and accomplish both objectives if they're incompatible I'm being--   Peter, I'm a little confused Page 2 of the Bluebook shows a dramatic increase in August and September both in total reserves and in the monetary base Both skyrocketed, in effect, which should normally signal a massive increase in growth of the aggregates When you at the Desk see this type of thing happening, do you take steps to compensate for that? In other words, first of all, what caused the 16 and 229 percent monthly increases in total reserves and the 15 and 10 percent increases in the base? What [unintelligible] the Desk operation, or couldn't you take steps to drain--  When you observe a significant increase in bank lending, which obviously requires the availability of reserves, do you accommodate that? In other words, do you make those reserves available to the banks? Or sometimes if a bank decides to increase its lending and knows it is going to have to pay the piper two weeks later or a week later on this lagged reserve accounting, do the banks just assume that they can make these loans and price them because the good old Fed will come along and provide the reserves to enable them to meet their reserve requirements at a later date? Or do we sometimes say Look, you guys can't have it both ways You're increasing your loans and it's going to cost you more money in the federal funds market  What is the relationship between the nonborrowed reserve path and total reserves? We obviously agree that total reserves and the monetary base grew too quickly in August and September, right?  -13-    10/21/80  So, couldn't you have done something to avoid that explosive growth?  So it's a matter of degree, really?  But we don't really stick to them  That's the bottom line, right  This is a subject that is part of the overall study?  Tony, in defense in those of us who believe that we do have the ability to do it, in the study we are undertaking I would hate to close our minds to that possibility and reach the conclusion that the money supply cannot be controlled better than it has been It's only fair to stay open-minded on this Hopefully, the research that Steve and his people are doing might indicate that perhaps the way we went about controlling the growth of the money supply was not the most effective means of doing it In other words, I wouldn't buy the fact that it can't be done I'm not sure that we  -18-    10/21/80  did it in the most effective way But we could argue this issue endlessly This is what is being studied, correct?  There are a lot of people in the markets who feel that we announced we were going to do this and then we reestablished our practice of flirting with [controlling] interest rates, so we really only [went part way] in this process, not the whole way  I would caution, Mr Chairman, against our believing that we can move in an admirable fashion from M-1B, which certainly has been the primary focus for our attention in recent months, to M-1A just because we are running into trouble with M-1B I don't think we can fool the financial markets At Frank Morris's recent conference, which was attended by a lot of individuals from the financial markets, there was pretty strong allusion to the fact that the Fed has several different definitions for the aggregates just so it can conveniently use the one that seems to be working best for the moment I don't think we can get away with it I was a little concerned, actually, about what I sensed as a primary emphasis on M-1A in the Bluebook this time whereas [previously] we have talked about M-1B I don't think we can switch the tiller, or whatever we are using as the directing mechanism, at will and not confuse this Committee as well as the financial markets generally  I think that credibility is important not just because we like to use the word and like the ring of it, but because without credibility in what we have announced we are going to do, we are going to have high interest rates In other words, inflationary expectations [might be rekindled] because of the loss of credibility in our October program and we'd have high interest rates and inflation Now, let's go back just a second to October of last year We adopted a policy at that time, based on a recognition that inflation was generally at a much higher than tolerable rate in the view of the American people as well as in the view of the Federal Reserve We recognized then that in order ultimately to bring down inflation with the tools available to us we would try to reduce the rate of money growth gradually over a period of four or five years until it was brought down to maybe a 2 or 3 percent rate And that, in turn, we felt--and we announced--would have an effect in reducing inflation At that time in 1979 money was growing at about 7 percent per year We announced that our target for this year was 4 to 6-1/2 percent, with some hope [that it would come in near the] midpoint at maybe 5 to 5-1/2 percent That was accepted with satisfaction by the Congress as well as the public We have not succeeded Even with the most restrictive policy from now until the end of the year, we will not succeed in bringing that growth rate down much below the top of our range, or to approximately 6-1/2 percent Actually, M-1B, which I think is a good aggregate to use, has grown in the third quarter of this year at about a 13-1/2 percent rate According to the projections on page 6 of the Bluebook, under alternative A or B the staff expects something like a 9 to 10 percent rate of growth in M-1B for the fourth quarter  Now, I am assuming that we don't want to abandon totally what we said we were going to do, which was to bring down the rate of money growth gradually from 7 percent in 1979 to 6 percent, let's say, in 1980, which would in turn imply 5 percent money growth in 1981 But if we go from a 13-1/2 percent third-quarter rate to a 9 to 10 percent fourth-quarter rate and go to Congress and say we are going to shoot for a 5 percent rate of money growth in 1981, the only way we will be able to achieve that is by drastically reducing the rate of money expansion starting in 1981 from the rate of growth in the last six months of this year That will most assuredly cause a serious recession We've either got to bite this bullet now [or later] I don't like to use the word "politics" but I would rather dish out the bad medicine after the elections this year when everybody--or at least half of the people--is in a euphoric mood for a couple of months than wait until 1981 and face up to this very difficult task, which will not be accepted by the general public too favorably Therefore, I would [favor] neither alternative A nor alternative B--and I'm not a monetarist freak when I say this--because I think both of them imply [monetary] growth that is too fast I would suggest that M-1B growth, and I'm only going to speak of M-1B, from September to December not exceed 2 percent I would suggest that the growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in M-1B be 6-1/2 percent instead of the  -35-    10/21/80  9 to 10 percent figure that's shown here I would suggest that the range for the federal funds be increased to have a top of 16 percent, because unquestionably this is going to drive up the federal funds rate for at least a short period of time If we don't do this, we are going to have to face up to it next year when I think the facing up to it will be even more difficult If we don't do this, we are going to have high interest rates as inflationary expectations continue I think it's a very critical time for our credibility, and that's my recipe  That approach seems totally illogical to me, Mr Chairman, because we say that there's very little we can do to affect the rate of money growth right now and yet we say if something happens a few weeks from now, then we'll try to do something that will affect it, even though we can't affect it now I don't think that makes much sense, if I understand what people are saying If we really want to  -46-    10/21/80  do something about controlling the rate of money growth in the long pull, I don't think it's as complex [an undertaking] as we're making it when we talk about borrowings and all of this We are creating a terribly complex, complicated, and unworkable process of getting from here to there We're never going to get the job done doing it that way  But, Lyle, hasn't that been where we've missed the boat for almost the last five years? As recovery has begun to occur, haven't we always said Let's just look in the next 30 or 60 days and let's not rock the boat because we might abort the recovery? Haven't we procrastinated in taking any meaningful action so that in the aggregate what we've tolerated has led to this present recession? I've seen [that happen] ever since I've been on this Committee, whether we were trying to stabilize interest rates or were doing it this way We always have some fear that something negative is going to happen to the economy And almost inevitably we've had two [results] We've been surprised at the resilience of the economy and we've also failed miserably to do anything about inflation  I just want you guys to know that the Chairman can't starve me into submission!   To further confuse the issue, look on page 10 of the Bluebook I was always under the impression that strong interest rates domestically tend to attract foreign money into our economy and bolster the value of the dollar But on the bottom of page 10 it says "Continued intervention by the United States to slow the appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar could generate additional pressure in Treasury yields, as the Fed offers securities to the market to finance foreign currency purchases" It looks as though, if I understand this, we are totally chasing our tail because we are selling [Treasury securities] in order to seek [less] appreciation in the value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, and in the process we are doing something that could generate additional downward pressure on Treasury yields I thought that upward pressure on Treasury yields is what bolsters the value of the dollar Or do I have it totally backwards?  Except for what? It certainly doesn't do--  Will we get back on the Friday cycle this week?  In this connection, could someone just report briefly on the progress of Steve's effort to restudy how we are doing?  Mr Chairman, could I just repeat my question to Steve on the technical study of how we go about achieving our targets? Is that progressing well?  Well, some of what I say will be a repetition of what Roger said If one goes back to the fundamentals of what we are trying to do, I don't think there's any question that if anything emerged from the November 4 experience, it was a recognition that the people of this country--and we are serving them--are primarily and indelibly concerned with something being done about inflation I think the second fundamental that we have to address is the eroding credibility of our ability to perform effectively in what we've announced we're trying to do If we continue to operate as we have all year--I'm talking about our operating procedures--I would agree with the Chairman that the choice we make today in terms of the alternatives will probably have very little effect on anything because [the results for the year] probably won't be a reflection of the choice we make However, if the Bluebook is correct, it's too late really to accomplish our annual objective in terms of the targets for the aggregates But whatever action we take today will have a very real effect on our credibility Recognizing that the world knows that we're above the upper limit of our M-1B target, for example, if we don't choose an alternative that at least appears to attempt to correct for that overshoot, I think we will see a further erosion of our credibility  Secondly, another factor that is currently affecting our credibility is the increasing suspicions on the part of the public that we are indeed moving back toward what I at least consider to be a failed policy of attempting to stabilize interest rates Therefore, our fed funds range should not be narrower than the width we've adhered to most of this year I would opt for alternative C Under any circumstances, the danger that I would perceive in the future would be permitting interest rates to drop significantly And I would  -29-    11/18/80  not like to see us set a lower limit of the funds range at less than 14 percent  Finally, I would hope desperately that by February, when we go into [our deliberations for our targets] next year, Steve's study will have been conducted and will be taken seriously And I hope it will be conducted, as I know it will be, with an open mind to see whether we can't come up with a better operating procedure that would reduce the potential margin of error between the actions we take at these meetings or the alternatives we choose and how the aggregates actually [turn out]  No, sir First of all, I feel that the technique of operating with the nonborrowed and borrowed reserve paths is not working I can't answer your question because we place more emphasis on total reserves in our view than on borrowed and nonborrowed reserves  Well, I think we could control the total, couldn't we? Again, that's what Steve's people are studying and I hope they'll get data on that But I can't translate "C" specifically to nonborrowed and borrowed reserve paths because I haven't asked our people to develop that I am not prepared to respond to that  I think some of us looked at it as a very short- range [step] that would avoid our having to jam on the brakes next year  Didn't several proponents of "B," Mr Chairman, also suggest that the aggregate figures in "B" be viewed as the top limits and that we should not tolerate an overshoot?  In considering these figures, which are for the next six weeks--and I recognize that short-term fluctuations in money probably don't have a very real effect on output and the economy--are we overlooking the fact that the first six weeks of this quarter came in quite high? You speak of jamming the brakes on too hard with "C;" wouldn't that really be counterbalancing an almost run-away situation over the first six weeks?  Does anyone view M-1A as a serious aggregate?  Even though the change has occurred toward a broadening--  Are you saying that we bias it to tolerate an overshoot more than an undershoot?  What is the objective of that nuance? I'm a little lost I'm not asking that in a critical way Why are we not taking straight "B"?  That means that for a week we'll supply money too quickly  I was all set in the spirit of Thanksgiving and generosity to move from "C" to "B," but this whacky proposal bothers me  Lyle, have we resisted money growth, though, to an extent that would have a beneficial effect on reducing inflation?  Instead of starving us into submission, you've whacked us into submission!  -50-    11/18/80  Is that small group currently being subjected to a chastising?   This is Larry Roos I have two questions and I direct these toward Steve First, what would the December M-1B figure [have] to be [assuming] a 96 percent growth of M-1B in November to get us to the top of our annual range? Do you know approximately?  Paul, do you [want to] talk about the [public] relations [aspects] of an overshoot of those annual targets? In other words, it seems to me that the issue of what we do in the next few weeks really [involves] the alternatives of the fed funds rate rising, perhaps significantly, or the [money growth] overshoot occurring [unintelligible]    12/05/80  Yes, I have finished; that answers [my question]  On the proposal, I am fully in agreement with you  Paul, this is Larry and I have a question  You indicated that at our next FOMC meeting we're going to have a preliminary discussion of the 1981 ranges  Shall we be prepared to discuss that in some depth, or what are you planning to do on that?  Fine   Roos Okay   By doing this, though, we're not signaling any encouragement for more intervention than we are [doing]?  May I ask a question, Mr Chairman? I noticed, Jim, that you're now basing your Greenbook projections on assumed M-1A growth I'm a little curious in view of the fact that M-1A is probably the most volatile and least predictable aggregate in the short run Why do you use it as a predictive device?  In other words, there is no significance to the shift?  Paul, if we do choose to postpone until some future time our discussion of the longer-range strategy--  Well, I was just going to ask After the study of operating procedures is completed, is the plan to give the FOMC a little more time than usual to chew over it because it seems to me--  I think that might be seen as a sign of weakness  Mr Chairman, I'm going to address my brief remarks to the year 1981 in a broader context than usual And I'm going to base my analysis on three fundamental factors that seem clear to me One is that there has been an unusually strong indication that the public as a whole places inflation at the top of its list of priorities requiring attack by the government, by agencies such as ours  Well, I don't disagree with you But I brought a letter that I received last week from a builder in our area The gist of it was "I'm going down the tubes; I'm going broke But please, Mr Roos, express to your colleagues my hope and desire, in spite of my personal anguish, that you stick to your guns because until we resolve the fundamental problems, we are going to have a repetition of this periodically"  The second factor that I recognize is that there is an enormous degree of disillusionment about the ability of the Federal Reserve to act responsibly under these circumstances I don't base that merely on cocktail party or locker room conversation When the St Louis Democrat, which is an ultra-conservative newspaper, and the Post Dispatch, which is a liberal newspaper in our area, both editorialized that perhaps we all ought to be impeached, I think there is a degree of disillusionment with us that hasn't existed for some time  The third factor that I would inject into my analysis is the fact that, fortunately, we are no longer the only game in town in that the incoming Administration appears to be willing to base its policy on tough measures, if necessary, to deal with inflation So we won't be the sole recipients of any dissatisfaction that might occur with some rather bitter medicine that may be needed I think the issue we have to address, as you very clearly set before us Mr Chairman, is Are we willing to tolerate--and in fact contribute to--a certain amount of further economic distress in the months and the year ahead if that is necessary to break the back of inflation? And I would say yes If these are the choices we have, I would opt for gritting our  -36-    12/18-19/80  teeth and being willing to support a monetary policy that might bring even greater pain than presently exists if that is necessary to get over the hump and to restore some long-range tranquility, if possible, to our economy by reducing inflation  Specifically, I would recommend a policy of gradual reduction in the rate of growth of money based on our announced targets of last year I'd reduce those targets by maybe 1/2 percentage point this year and say we are going to persist with this for several years to come, enunciating this in simple yet forthright terms And I'd say that it might cause further trouble but we are willing to do this in order to meet the longer-term objective of reducing inflation In doing this we should concentrate on a few of the Ms or perhaps a reserve target We should make it as simple as possible, even though we will have to state the difficulties involved in projecting the effect of NOWs on the aggregates I'm not as despairing as some of you seem to be about our ability to explain to the public what we are trying to do I think there has been a tradition in the Federal Reserve, as in other central banks, to play the game in a rather secretive and mysterious manner--to put out little signals here and there, hoping that participants in the financial markets would be able to reach some conclusions through this less-than-forthright statement of what we are trying to do I think the greater candor we can express, the better we will achieve our purposes We must do whatever is necessary to improve our ability to achieve our announced targets, and I think that involves a very agonizing reappraisal of our operating procedures and operating techniques I hope that we will take whatever time is necessary to review how we can improve our ability to achieve the goals we announce because I think our credibility depends upon that Finally, I believe we should make a greater effort to communicate more effectively with the public--to sharpen up our public information techniques, if you will--because there is a feeling abroad that we don't always address clearly and candidly what we are trying to do A lot of people who are criticizing us don't understand the issues I think that can be clarified by making an intelligent and planned effort to communicate, just as any industry or any institution attempts to do from time to time when it's in trouble All these things are part of achieving an improved future; I think the monkey is very much on our back to face up to these challenges  I think the last sentence, with the expression of a narrower fed funds range, could be terribly disturbing to some who might view it as a signal that indeed we are moving toward greater emphasis even in the short run on targeting on interest rates If we narrow the range and set the upper limit at 20 percent--and we are over that now--with a lower limit of 16 percent, I think, that will wave a red flag to those who are suspicious of a possible tendency to move back to our old procedures  I just don't think the range should be narrowed I would disagree on the wisdom of narrowing it From a presentational point of view, I think narrowing it to 4 percentage points from the broader range that we've come to live with over the past year would be viewed by some as a reversion to the old [procedures]  I think this spotlights a very serious weakness in our present process whereby this Committee very carefully chooses aggregate growth targets and fed funds ranges and then the staff with some verbal guidance but no official guidance from this Committee makes the borrowing assumptions Sometimes the borrowing assumptions are not consistent with the [monetary aggregates and fed funds] decisions we have made Now, this may be something we ought to discuss when we talk about our future operating procedures, but I sense an awful lot of emphasis being placed on the definition of certain borrowing assumptions and shifts in those assumptions, which have an impact on the fed funds rate and on growth in the aggregates I don't think the Federal Open Market Committee necessarily makes a policy judgment in connection with these borrowing assumptions I know we talk about them  I'm as hungry or hungrier than Roger; nevertheless, I would be able to support this only if we don't have a narrow specific numerical range I would urge instead that we broaden that fed funds range If the Chairman at any time feels uncomfortable and wants to set up an interim telephone conference, that's the chair's prerogative But the tenor of this discussion has implied an awful lot of sentiment to get back on a federal funds rate constraint, and that just ruins my Christmas Eve  That means we are locking ourselves in in view of the--  -80-    12/18-19/80  What about adding a sentence, if we do have a higher M2 figure, qualifying it or explaining why that is higher  I'd like to raise one question along this line I'd invite the Committee's attention to page 18, which has language we have used in the past in the last paragraph It says "If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves," We are changing the words In this draft the wording is "If it appears likely that the monetary and related reserve paths are inconsistent with fluctuations in the fed funds rate," It seems to me that the latest wording places the fed funds rate as the anchor that will control aggregates behavior, and that's exactly the opposite, I think  I'd feel much more comfortable  That's the only thing I've ever discovered on my own, Mr Chairman!  -85-    12/18-19/80  15 to 20 percent   May I ask, Steve, is short-run month-to-month precision really important? I believe that even the most ardent advocates of aggregate control will freely admit that short-run precision is almost impossible to achieve Is this a necessary factor in deciding what we're going to do? Or if we announce and make clear that we are going to concentrate on achievement of our longer-range target, wouldn't this be it?  But if one were skeptical of the long-term wisdom of pursuing our present policies of trying to control money and credit through aggregate control, one would not use the staff conclusions that month-to-month precision is difficult to achieve That would not be a basis for walking away from considering the broader advantages or disadvantages of aggregate control  Yes  But reacting more quickly in adjusting the reserve path does not eliminate the desirability, possibly, that while you are doing that you may at the same time want to have the discount rate move more closely [with the market] or more frequently They are not mutually exclusive, are they?  So, we could think of [using] both  That's what you give up--control over rate volatility  Do you mean just on whether to go back to interest rate stabilization or--  -34-    2/2-3/81  I think there are several fundamental things that we ought to consider in charting our course First of all, it's important that we recognize that we have to do something that will be convincing, not just to those of us sitting in this room but to the broader body politic in the world in which we live I will start from a conviction that, right or wrong, most people who have observed what has happened since October 1979 are far from convinced that it was as much of a success or as satisfactory as maybe some of us would like to think There is a certain degree of disillusionment that we didn't achieve as effective control of money and credit as we announced in 1979 we were going to seek Under the present political conditions we face, to try to explain away in a convincing manner whatever shortcomings last year had is almost impossible to achieve  Secondly, I think it follows that to say we will continue as we did in 1980 but will do the job a little better, without announcing or without agreeing upon certain changes from that procedure, will be less than convincing to the people who are watching us Politically, if you want to put it that way, and without acting irresponsibly, I think we have to say that we are going to make some changes The world knows that we have conducted this study The world, or at least those who are interested in what we are doing, is going to be anxious to see the results of this study and what we do about it So, I don't think we can get away with either trying to say that 1980 was an unqualified success or that we drew a poor card because of certain extraneous factors And I don't think we can get away with just saying we are going to do what we did and do it better  Ideally, Mr Chairman, if we could press a button, I would say that we should announce that we are going to move the discount rate to a penalty rate more frequently in order to avoid the problems that we had in that regard last year Ideally, we should seek contemporaneous reserve accounting I think we should announce--and this may require longer-run action--that we will seek greater uniformity of reserve requirements I think we have to bite that bullet; we have to say that we will do that in order to achieve steadier control of credit and money I think we are going to have to say openly that we will permit interest rates to fluctuate more freely We can't have it both ways And I happen to believe that if we explain [what we are doing] as effectively as you did yesterday on ABC--and I would compliment you, sir, because I thought you were superb on that program--that we have the ability to tell people what we are going to do If we told people that we were going to do this, I believe we would have less volatility in interest rates than some people might think  Short of achieving these ideals, I think it's absolutely essential as a bare minimum that we change our procedures and move the discount rate more frequently to a penalty rate and also that we restore contemporaneous reserve accounting We have people out there who are aware of these issues People in the Administration--the Stockmans and the Sprinkels--are going to watch us like a hawk, and we're not going to be able to bluff our way through this I think we have to show that we are doing something, and try something new It would be a tragedy for the Federal Reserve to move back to interest  -35-    2/2-3/81  rate stabilization, even though it might be theoretically desirable; it will not fly in the political climate in which we're living That's my point of view, Mr Chairman, in a nutshell  Paul, I'd like to follow up on your analysis and Tony's and ask Peter and Steve a question What were the factors that led to not adjusting the nonborrowed reserve path more quickly last year? In other words, was it a conscious policy that caused you not to move as quickly as you might move this year under this new point of view or was it a concern about the effect on interest rates? And if the latter was the case, wouldn't you still have that concern in the back of your head starting next Monday?  -43-    2/2-3/81  If, in order to eliminate the problems we had last year, this Committee made a broad request of you to move it a little more quickly than you did last year, what would that mean in terms of what you would do starting next week?  But you still had hovering in your mind a concern about the effect on the fed funds rate, right? I thought I just understood that  How would the disclosure of which of these options, if any, the Committee agreed upon become public? Would that be in your testimony to Congress?  Paul, after we go down the laundry list, if there's a certain amount of indecision on things that some of us think should be reacted to more explicitly, procedurally would we express ourselves here and so be recorded? Or [are our views] not going to be recorded? We're not going to have a vote, I assume, on any of these things, right?  If I may, Mr Chairman, I'd like to go on record as favoring total elimination of the interest rate bands From the conversation throughout this morning and in the studies and comments that have been made and things that are thought--although who knows what things are thought--I think there is an implicit awareness of explicit and implied interest rate constraints I believe that acts in a contrary manner to achieving our aggregate targets If we're interested in consulting frequently on interest rates, I guess we should also be interested in consulting if the money supply seems to be functioning in an unpredicted manner I think there's a very basic contradiction in trying to control interest rates explicitly or implicitly and achieving our monetary target objectives And I would express myself as favoring the total elimination of any specification regarding interest rates  Paul, when we discussed before the problems of adjusting our reserve paths more quickly, it was specifically said that one of the costs--to those who view it as a cost--is wider fluctuations in interest rates So, maybe we can convince ourselves within this room that interest rates aren't a factor, but I think they lurk in the back of Peter's mind and--  But doesn't your--  May I make one observation? In countering what Fred said, I don't think this is a matter of our throwing everything at them at once If you recall--and maybe I'm hung up on this--the President, the present Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Stockman, and others coming into this Administration specifically suggested that we free interest rates and that we go to contemporaneous reserve accounting In other words, they [listed] a number of the things we are talking about Now, we certainly are independent of them If, as a result of this effort today, when the Chairman goes up to Capitol Hill all we do is say that we are going to try to adjust our nonborrowed reserves a little more quickly, it will be awfully obvious to people who are aware of the several things that were suggested that we really haven't moved on any of them very emphatically So, I think we're going to catch more flak if we merely do that one thing than be in any possible danger of being accused of throwing too much at them at once, if that makes any difference In the minds of the financial press, or portions of it at least, as well as the incoming Administration, there are rather specific views that the two or three or four changes that we are discussing today are necessary for the Fed to conduct monetary policy in a brave new manner And I think the omission will be as obvious as throwing in too much This is just said in a friendly way to give the opposite point of view  SPEAKER(?) If it works  Haven't there been studies that have shown there is a much closer relationship between the narrower aggregates and nominal GNP than the broader aggregates? May I ask that question of my friend on my right?  No faster than they have to  Well, just so that Governor Wallich isn't left to drift alone, I agree fully with what he says I think there is much unnecessary volatility in the financial markets as a result of some perceived signal from the Fed that it is going to do something that it indeed isn't going to do The more we tell them and the more we play our cards openly, the better everybody will be able to adjust to what we're trying to do So, I would endorse what you said, which may have eliminated the last vestige of success for it, Henry!  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] chance of success  We basically came out with more optimistic results practically all across the board We are in the outlier category in some instances, but I think our deviations were essentially based on the 5-1/2 percent M-1B assumption used, rather than a lower monetary growth assumption apparently used by the staff and most of our colleagues So, if we look more out of line than usual, it's because of that, and after tomorrow's meeting we will try to adjust it accordingly  This is essentially the product of our model This is what it spewed out and I'm merely parroting to some extent  Yes sir, even at a 5-1/2 percent M-1B growth rate we would see that rate of reduction because that [rate of] growth would be a significant reduction from the 6-1/2 to 7 percent growth rate of this year In fact--I guess we'll discuss this tomorrow--we think that a more abrupt reduction from the rate of aggregate growth that occurred during 1980 could bring much more severe shocks to the real economy Even on that basis of 5-1/2 percent we are more optimistic in terms of the price level reduction  Is it feasible to ask the staff to take this table on page 6 and run off a little supplementary table we can use based on whatever we are going to talk about tomorrow?  The left side is easier because those are the figures we have used in the past It seems to me we have to recognize that there will be a period of adjustment I feel more comfortable using the left side, not that I don't think we could adjust to either one But in your testimony last year, for example, you talked about 4 to 6-1/2 percent for M-1B; and our Bluebooks and our actions last year were all based on the figures as shown in the left column I'm just a little more comfortable with them, but we can use either one if we stick with it  Yes sir, Mr Chairman I'll be brief but please don't interpret my brevity as an inability to go through much of what has already been said I would opt for alternative I I believe we are committed to a policy of steady restraint with a gradual reduction in the rate of money growth in order to have an impact ultimately on reducing the core rate of inflation Intellectually, especially recognizing that a rather overly expansive growth of money might have occurred last year--we were a bit above the top of our M-1B range--to jam that down too abruptly could have serious effects on the real economy I think a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the M-1B range and a commensurate reduction in the ranges for the other aggregates is in order It maintains consistency with what we announced last year I agree with what someone else said that the real key is our ability to achieve our targets I don't think our problem in the past few years has been one of setting incorrect targets; it has essentially been our inability to achieve those targets We talked about that yesterday, and I expressed my reservations In sum, I would opt for alternative I, omitting the bottom portion of it  I would go with alternative I  All the way down the line, recognizing that in our peculiar way of looking at things we will concentrate on M-1B But I certainly would not be unhappy with [that]  Would it be feasible, Mr Chairman, in view of the problem we will have in the next few months, to use that as a hook to suspend temporarily the publication of the weekly figures? Is there any sense in that?  Mr Chairman, for purposes of impacting the economy, is it important that we specify an M3 range?  The record would state that others preferred to target the M1s and forget about M2?  I would lean toward either alternative A or alternative B I don't feel strongly enough that I would be passionately opposed to "C" But we should remember the experience we had in the early part of last year when we permitted the aggregates to drop from a rather high rate of growth down to a significantly lower rate of growth We had M-1B growth over the second half of last year of something like--I don't know exactly--12 to 14 percent, and we are jamming it down even with alternative A to a significantly lower rate In my way of analyzing the effects of changes in the growth of the aggregates, I am impressed by research that we've done that shows that when we have an abrupt drop in the rate of money growth from a higher pace to a lower pace and hold it there, that does have a very negative effect on output and can precipitate a recession And it usually does I think we should really try to avoid unseemly fluctuations in these aggregates I would intellectually lean toward the less restrictive of "A" or "B," but I wouldn't go to the mat on any of these three alternatives I do feel that the fed funds rate range, short of this Committee overwhelmingly going to a broad range of 1 to 20 percent, should be as broad as possible I'd opt for 14 to 20 percent to keep it broad  What are we talking about right now? I'm lost  Mr Chairman, I sensed yesterday in our discussion that the one improvement in our operating procedures that we were willing to sign off on, as of that time, was to move our nonborrowed reserve path more frequently to follow any changes in the borrowing level If we do that, it seems to me that it's less important that our borrowing assumption be totally accurate If we do what I think we said yesterday we were going to do, this will be adjusted frequently So, I'd like to suggest specifically--I hope I'm not moving too quickly into the directive but I think it's terribly important that we write this into our procedure because this is germane to what we are talking about--that we put a sentence in at the end of the paragraph of the draft directive shown on page 17 that would read something like this "The Committee assumes that member bank borrowings will average ___" (fill in whatever we assume during whatever period we use) "and instructs the Manager to adjust the nonborrowed reserve path appropriately and promptly if borrowings deviate from this assumption" Putting that in the directive gives us what I think we agreed yesterday would be a procedural change in our operating techniques It makes it an unmistakable reflection of what the Committee said yesterday it was seeking to do And it puts flexibility into this borrowing assumption exercise and really makes the initial borrowing assumption less important because we can adjust on a day-to-day or every-other-day basis if our borrowing assumption proves to be a mistaken one  We would assume that it's impossible to anticipate what borrowings would be Borrowings will occur due to forces not directly under our control We would merely adjust the nonborrowed reserve path to what happens from moment-to-moment or day-to-day in the totals of member bank borrowing so that we don't try to anticipate or estimate what number to plug in  Well, that's what I mean to try to achieve--a total reserves result consistent with what we want to do and, of course, it implies a--  Yes, that might be a better way of stating it But the principle, I feel, is important  I think there is a certain urgency to it because I honestly believe there's a great deal of anticipation and interest in what the FOMC will choose to do with the study that was conducted We sort of put in abeyance many of the proposals or the options that Steve's study highlighted But one that we didn't was this If we don't come up with something, I think we can be accused rightfully of, [despite] the study, still conducting our business in the same way that caused us to miss our targets last year Again, the big trick is not just choosing targets but accomplishing them in the year 1981  -166-    2/2-3/81  Paul, how would you respond to the question What is going to be done differently this year than last year? You said that, hopefully, your testimony will touch on that The public, or at least interested people, do know that we've had this study And the study was an excellent one How do you respond?  -167-    2/2-3/81 -168-  Well--and I say this with the greatest respect for all of you--if any of us tries to say that last year's performance was satisfactory, I would just have to disagree totally I think an awful lot of people would disagree  But I would hate, when I'm on my wedding bed and we're awfully close to making changes that we've been seeking for years and years, just to be lulled into sleep That's a bad--  In line with the spirit of quick adjustments on these, could we ask the Manager to incorporate in his report at our next meeting some record, as specific as possible, of what happened in terms of unanticipated fluctuations and how the Desk responded?   This is Larry Roos  I must disagree with you First of all, if you observe what has happened to the monetary base, there is every reason to believe that there would be this flat movement of the aggregates To me our biggest problem is to avoid like the plague a replay of what happened last year when we had a significant undershoot early in the year [My reason is that] I think people are looking to us to achieve a steadiness that was not characteristic of last year If we adjust our borrowing assumption upward, that has the same effect of perhaps leading to an undershoot in the long pull I just think that we    2/24/81  should reduce the lower limit of the fed funds range and provide whatever reserves are necessary to avoid a downward movement like the one that occurred last year in such a damaging way  Paul, this is Larry Roos I urge you to take some formal action because I feel strongly opposed to what everybody is agreeing to today If you look at the monetary base for the past four months and if you look at total reserves over five months, they have been flat We have these aggregates [unintelligible] have dropped from about a 14 percent growth rate over many months to zero recently All of this adds up to the potential for a very serious undershoot, and I have to dissent from this action I think it's a total mistake   I'd like to address this question to Peter or to Steve As one whose brain is not as facile as many of yours, when I  -16-    3/31/81  sense this confusion among so many of you, would there be an easier or simpler way of conducting this to be more effective and less complex?  A total reserves operation wouldn't help?  You mentioned the events of the period, draining reserves because of the--  That was a time when we were concerned about reserves growing too slowly, right?  Yes, sir I would opt for alternative C and I would base that on the following rationale I assume that our primary objective is to achieve a start on reducing the rate of inflation we have had and that there is an effect on inflation of reducing the growth of, let's say, M-1B We had M-1B growth last year at about a 73 percent rate A reasonable reduction, if we're able to achieve it, would be from that 73 percent to 6 percent growth, let's say, for the period from February through the end of the year If we set the paths for growth as reflected in "C," I think we can achieve that 6 percent annual growth I think we can do it without having an impossibly low rate of output We project, assuming 6 percent M-1B growth for the year, real GNP of something in the area of 0 to 1 percent That's obviously slow growth, but it's not negative growth I don't think that we can achieve a fast growth of output and still  -36-    3/31/81  have the necessary degree of monetary restraint to achieve a reduction in inflation Now, that 6 percent I'm referring to is on an unadjusted basis We assume--and maybe some would argue-- that NOW account flows have almost ceased and that in the period ahead we can use an unadjusted aggregate and not be in trouble inasmuch as we believe that the big NOW account change has already occurred So, to make a long story short, I think the best way of achieving our targets and the best way of bringing down M-1B growth as necessary to have a salutary effect on reducing inflation is "C"  Yes, I'm talking about the unadjusted figures 4-1/2 percent March to June M-1B on page 7 under alternative C  In other words, that would give us a 6 percent unadjusted  I think that's 6 percent from the first quarter of 1981 through the period ahead  That's correct  That's correct  Yes, but we have some differences with the degree of adjustment   This is Larry Roos I want to agree with the reduction of the nonborrowed reserve path and with almost everything that has been said   Steve, Larry Roos What do you anticipate total reserves to be next week at the end of the week?  I mean this week  This is St Louis I would agree wholeheartedly with you, Mr Chairman  Paul, Larry Roos I think it's almost impossible for nineteen of us to draft a statement You have a general feeling of support for what you're trying to do and I vote that you just go ahead in your own words   We sense a fairly strong base of economic activity in our area There are two dramatically weak segments, home building and automobile manufacturing, and the latter is a big factor in part of our District However, commercial building, as John said, is very strong, as are chemicals, military equipment, and oil and gas equipment Basically, we don't see many signs of weakness except in those two specific areas I noted  I think it's important to recognize that there is absolutely no way of reducing these interest rates, even short-term interest rates, through the old traditional way of pumping money into the economy We did an analysis in St Louis [It shows that] even when the weekly figures show an increase in the money supply, it is meaningless; within a week interest rates rise So, I don't know how we can bring these rates down through monetary policy other than by creating a credible track record where people will really believe that we are going to bring the rate of money growth down and stick with it  I don't know In all fairness, an awful lot of us who have been advocating monetary restraint over the years have said repeatedly that we can't get over a binge such as the one we have been on without suffering pain Whether it's Beryl Sprinkel or Joe Jones or whoever, those who have advocated restraint have also warned that there is no easy way out of it So, I'm not sure that there hasn't been some recognition of the pain that inevitably will be required to bring an economy out of the excesses that this economy has been experiencing  I would opt for "C" for most of the reasons already stated There is one further reason, and that is the possibility that the new seasonal adjustments are a bit unrealistic in terms of the degree to which they've adjusted the aggregates downward I'd like to throw in one other thought, too If we are interested in achieving the greatest degree of confidence that could reasonably be expected in the financial markets, I wonder if in the directive--and this piggybacks somewhat on some of the things that Fred Schultz has said--we ought to consider eliminating any reference to our federal funds rate checkpoints It seems to me that there could be a lot of reasons why the Chairman would consult at a critical phase It is conceivable that growth of the aggregates, for example, could be a source of concern that might lead to adjustments I do know that there is still a degree of uncertainty in the minds of market participants as to why we include a reference to checkpoints on the fed funds rate and not on some of the other [factors] that could influence our [need to] consult So, I think some consideration should be given to clarifying that with a statement, perhaps by the Chairman, that we consult for a lot of reasons and that under our new procedures fed funds checkpoints are no more meaningful than other checkpoints that would lead to consultation  Is there no reference to NOW accounts? That's because it's shift-adjusted I get you  Why wouldn't the same wording apply to the borrowing assumption and to the aggregates? In other words, isn't this an implicit prerogative of the Chairman on any of this? He can call us any time as long as he doesn't call collect!  If any mention of this were totally omitted, where could the problem conceivably arise in the markets? If we just stop referring in any way to a federal funds--   Mr Chairman, Larry Roos You're doing things beautifully; just don't change what you're doing I agree with you, Mr Chairman   Paul, isn't it our purpose, though, to impose the discipline of monetary policy upon the banks? And won't the fact that they had to pay more teach them a lesson? Won't it teach them that if we want to discourage their extending credit, for example, that they have to take it seriously and not anticipate that we'll be there with the funds they need for their reserve requirements when they need them? In other words, isn't this really the strategy of our whole policy currently, and isn't the level of the fed funds rate reflecting exactly what we want to achieve, if our strategy is right? We're using it as a means of affecting the commercial banks' credit activities  They haven't had this unfortunate experience in a long time  Well, Chuck, I thought our strategy essentially was to attempt to bring down inflation by controlling the availability of bank credit And I think the banks have been accustomed in the past to assuming that when Wednesday came around somehow or other the Fed would supply the necessary reserves in order to resist the otherwise upward movement of the fed funds rate Now, by letting the fed funds rate flow upward, even though it's more expensive to them, we will discourage their provision of credit Am I mixed up?  Tony, weren't these the same guys, though, who back in the fall of 1979 jumped all over our Chairman allegedly    7/6-7/81  because just the opposite scenario was occurring? They were concerned about the expansiveness of our policies and the dollar was terribly weak, and I remember our discussing this and wringing our hands somewhat around this table about that problem Aren't we damned whatever we do?  Maybe we're getting to where we ought to give some thought to the monetary base  Is this in addition to [the forecasts] we wired in?  Our projections for 1982 are almost exactly in sync with the staff's, whereas we project a little stronger economic growth in 1981 than does the staff and are a little less sanguine about the deflator However--and I guess maybe I'm always out of synchronization myself--for once I feel a lot more satisfied with what is happening than do some of my colleagues here at this table I think one has to look at it with a little perspective, recognizing that we have embarked on something quite different than what we had back in October of '79 We had an understandable year of adjustment procedurally to get the effect of what we said we were going to do We did this against a backdrop of a public and financial markets that had been promised an awful lot repeatedly and they were, and still are to some extent, somewhat cynical and understandably so as to what they might expect either from the Administration or from the Federal Reserve However, I think in the last several months our record on monetary policy--our record of holding monetary growth under control-- has been quite remarkable; and at least the utterances of the Administration, whether or not one agrees with them philosophically, are somewhat of a departure from anything that has been presented to the citizenry in a long time It seems to me that the key to the future depends very much on the next 6 to 9 months If we're able, as we appear to be doing now, to control the growth of money and if the Administration--and the politics of this are somewhat important in terms of people's attitudes--is able to produce and to persist in having a friendly understanding on the part of the public of what it's trying to do, and if we can stick with this over the period of the immediate future, I think the entire ball game might be significantly changed and changed for the better I am a little apprehensive Two months of control of M-1B or the monetary base or whatever else one may look at is not indicative of long-term results But it certainly is better than anything I've seen in a long time And I feel pretty good about it  I think you've resolved the question I had I was going to ask a procedural question Maybe I'm alone in this, but when Steve reports a lot of figures as he did--four pages of them--I don't have the mental ability to absorb that and to translate that into where we are going I was going to ask the question--  Well, I would support the basic position you expressed a little while ago That if we are going to err, which I hope we won't, it ought to be on the side of constraint rather than  -37-    7/6-7/81  ease I think that one of the big problems we have is the problem of credibility and how people see what we are doing If we were to do anything that would give the appearance of easing monetary policy significantly at the present time, I think we'd frustrate what would be the apparent objective of ease--bringing down interest rates and bringing relief to a soft economy So, I would support, Mr Chairman, what you have said as far as basic policies are concerned  Well, alternative 2 on page 8 [of the Bluebook] would be my preference in that regard That's the more restrictive of the two for the remainder of this year  Are we moving up?  No  That's the last half of this year  I would recommend alternative II in '82 also, going slowly at [our job of reducing monetary growth] Alternative II is consistent with our long-range objective of reducing our M-1B [range] by about 1 percentage point a year  For the short run?  The ranges should be left unchanged I think we ought to opt for the lower of the two alternatives to stay within the ranges, if I understand it  -40-    7/6-7/81  I would think, and this may be unrealistic, that at this particular time whichever way we go, it would be appropriate [to provide] an early explanation in a public statement by the Chairman or through some other mechanism as to what we actually were seeking to accomplish in this meeting In other words, in this situation an understanding of what we are trying to do is so critical currently that getting our story across through signaling [may not be the way to go] Maybe it is too early to talk about this--maybe it ought to be in the directive--but whatever we come up with, if we opt for what the Chairman implied earlier, I just wonder whether this shouldn't be expressed and explained quite openly or publicly without the 30-day lapse that usually accompanies these things  That's when--the 21st? [Secretary's note Chairman Volcker testified on July 20, 1981]  Monetarists don't shoot at other monetarists, Frank, and we're all monetarists  I would opt for "C" in its entirety I just think we [can't] afford to announce that we're going to tolerate aggregate growth above the "C" figures We must remember that these are adjusted If you take off the adjustment, the rate of growth is even higher But I'd suggest a borrowing assumption of about $1-1/2 billion  I would just add that I was very much intrigued or impressed with Fred's suggestion of reducing the bottom of the longer- term targets by 1/2 point, which would enable us to come up to the bottom of what we're seeking with this alternative C, if I understand it right  Yes  If we have the top of the fed funds range at 21 percent and it reaches 21 percent and the Desk starts injecting reserves, won't that be as--  How would that relate to our present range, which is 3-1/2 to 6 percent? Is that unadjusted or adjusted or--?  MESSRS PARTEE and SCHULTZ That's adjusted  If that's the case and if these next six months are critical and we will have another opportunity to change what we're going to do for '82 next February, in order to reassure the markets and to be consistent, why don't we say this time that we're going to reduce the numbers on M1 by 1 percentage point at both ends? And if at the end of the year the picture is different, we can still make an adjustment next February with less problem, in my opinion, than we'd have if we come out with testimony on July 22nd that we're really not going to continue our 1 percentage point reduction each year I think this is an important time to state once again what we're doing  Yes  If our primary purpose at this moment--maybe this isn't our purpose--is to impact inflationary expectations, we would have to announce, in understandable terms, a reduction in the rate of growth of the narrower aggregates I don't think it's realistic to think that we can say we're only going to shade down M1--if we're going to call it that--very slightly because we think something is going to happen to a thing called velocity or the money demand function When I read these financial letters, I seldom see any reference made to these more technical aspects of what we're trying to do They talk about our published ranges in simple terms and whether or not they think we're going to be able to achieve them So, I think they are two different things The technical aspect of what we're doing is something different from the impact we're trying to make on inflationary expectations And the latter has to be done in a simple manner and has to involve a discernable reduction in the actual figures from the current 3-1/2 to 6 percent to something that to less knowledgeable and less technically oriented people looks like a continuation of our resolve to reduce these ranges gradually  It's an expression I'm okay, you're okay  Hey, Fred, I changed my vote; I voted the [unintelligible] I looked at it again   Steve, in setting both M-1B and M2 targets, which apparently currently increases [our exposure to] certain incompatible situations, aren't we putting ourselves in an almost impossible position? Let me phrase it differently Listening to you, I thought you made a strong case that even though M-1B has some imperfections,    8/18/81  its imperfections are not overwhelming and that even if we wanted to control M2, certain parts of M2 are beyond our control What would happen if we just abandoned M2 and told the world why we were abandoning it and concentrated on M-1B, even though it has some problems?  Hasn't the NOW account phenomenon pretty well washed itself out?  I was under the impression, Fred, that the research studies that have been done indicate that there is a closer relationship between M-1B and real output than there is between--  What bothers me--and I may see it totally incorrectly--is that a couple of our targets seem somewhat incompatible, just as years ago our interest rate targets were frequently incompatible with the aggregates targets One can't steer with two compasses if those compasses aren't reconcilable  Paul, I would agree totally with your analysis of policy One thing bothers me, though It seems to me that what we do and how the world generally perceives what we do may be two totally different things With the sensitivity of the markets and with the enormous importance of what we want to achieve and how we are trying to [affect] people's expectations, is it conceivable that the directive, which is a pretty formal, cold, delayed statement of what we do, could be supplemented with a more foreceful explanation of what we are doing? Do these times call for something like that rather than relying to the extent we do on the directive? In the early segment of your remarks a little while ago, you said, for example, that the policy record that is going to come out at the end of this week might be interpreted as some easing in policy Now, it seems to me that if we stick by our annual target, which we are doing, that nobody who knows or who receives an explanation of what we're doing could imply that the Fed has all of a sudden eased in the sense of abandoning its anti-inflationary policy of restraint Is it possible under these circumstances, where everybody hangs on every little hint or signal of what we are trying to do, to say occasionally in a white paper form the sort of thing you just told us, which in effect says "Look the Fed hasn't eased up" Would that be in order? Are we so tied to the tradition of a central bank sending signals in a rather obscure way through directives that that's the best we can do in communicating?  I hope that the gentleman sitting at your left, Governor Schultz, will convince you to get on; I think you undersell the impact of your ability   We had a group of people from about 20 medium and large size businesses in last week and the reaction we had was very similar to what Fred reported In some specific fields and areas there are relatively serious problems, but by and large we got the feeling that there is an underpinning of strength And there was unanimous sentiment--as has been the case in the past--that if the Fed were to do a flip-flop and become really expansive, it wouldn't solve their problems In other words, their message to me was For heaven's sakes hang in there And we didn't sense any danger of a precipitous decline Of course this is a diversified Midwestern area  Steve, would you repeat the part near the end of your statement where you spoke of an increased demand for M-1B having some effect on the necessity of trying to get M-1B up to the lower end of the range? I was lost  In terms of positioning ourselves, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we have to think of our vulnerability from a public opinion point of view if the economy remains soft, as it probably will, to the end of the year If we visibly fail to bring M-1B into its range, won't people who are exaggerating the effect of so-called tight policy by the Fed have something to hang us with when they actually see that M-1B has come in below [its range]? I don't know whether that's a greater danger than the possibility of some misinterpretation of [the growth that] would be necessary to bring it into the range It seems to me, if we are thinking of public opinion --and maybe we shouldn't be--that the question is whether the heat of coming in below the range and being accused of precipitating a recession is greater or less than the possible misinterpretation of a degree of temporary expansiveness to bring M-1B into the range Those are two fundamental issues [that bear on] public response But maybe we shouldn't be concerned about that aspect of our policy  What is the rationale that if short-term interest rates decline that might result in stimulus to the economy beginning next year? And what were the negative consequences of that? I don't know whether it was Lyle or someone else who said that  Well, Mr Chairman, I would preface my remarks by saying that I still consider myself to be as hawkish in my desires to give top priority to dealing with the problem of inflation as one could be On the other hand, as I recall when we set our annual target ranges this year, they represented a gradual reduction from the previous year and they were intended as an anti-inflationary program By opting for alternative B, which I would prefer, I don't think I would in any way be relinquishing my underlying concern about inflation On the other hand, if we are too restrictive--if we go for "C" or more of an undershoot of our targets than that--we are really digging our own grave because I think there is a relationship between  -34-    10/5-6/81  the rate of M-1B growth and real output; and if real output continues to [weaken] significantly, we are going to have in our economy and in our body politic a reaction for strong stimulus next year to get ourselves out of a recessionary situation And that poses a real threat to our long-term efforts to cope with inflation So, alternative B is a reasonable middle ground We will be getting up toward the lower end of our target, which was an anti-inflationary target We cannot be accused of tolerating a continuing and persistent undershoot, which in many people's minds would be a factor in causing a further softening of the economy I think "B" is the best solution, remembering that it is an anti-inflationary and not an expansionist alternative  May I add one [comment]?  I think it's important that we think ahead to the end of the year into February when we're going to have to set our targets for next year If we opt for "C" and M-1B really comes in as projected in "C," we'd have average money growth of M-1B for this year of about 19 percent Then what are we going to do in February when we have to set next year's targets? Are we going to indicate at that time that we've all of a sudden become very expansive and set the ranges up to where they would be 1 percent below this year's announced targets, or are we going to reduce them further from the 19 percent average growth this year? In other words, if we don't bite the bullet now--if we don't get [M-1B] up there in the range--we're going to face that same concern of public perception of an expansive policy next February And it will be even more dramatic when we set annual rates if we set them from a very low growth rate for this year  -36-    10/5-6/81  Well, I think there's a middle course between the expansionists--I won't use the expression you did--a difference between going high and going low I do see a problem next year If our growth has been very slow this year, we're going to have to raise it next year, aren't we? Even though it would only be in the last month, we'd have to explain if we took a more expansive approach that it was merely to get us to or near the lower end of our anti- inflationary targets for the year 1981 I may be off base Am I?  We got ourselves into the problem by permitting ourselves to undershoot to the extent that we did, I would guess  Mr Chairman, could we have an understanding of consulting but at the same time not narrow the fed funds range in the directive to a 4-point spread? That's going to be interpreted as our moving back toward concentrating on controlling interest rates rather than what we've really said we're doing  It's been 5 or 6 most of the time  Some of us are   Yes, Mr Chairman Peter, at these meetings we set desired rates of growth for M-1B In the last 7 or 8 months [M1-B growth has been] significantly below the lower end of the target ranges that we've set As I listened to you, I got the impression that one of the reasons for that is that borrowings, as they actually evolved, were at a lower level than the assumptions we had made at our meetings Under our procedures, when borrowings are below what we anticipate they will be, do you adjust the nonborrowed path or the total reserve objective to compensate for that reduced level of borrowing?  Well, I was under the impression that we set targets and then we do whatever we think is [necessary] to achieve the M1-B target, for example So, if money growth is coming in below, and if borrowing comes in below, don't we take some action to counter that situation so that we can achieve the target that we've set for ourselves? It seems to me that if we adjusted upward the nonborrowed reserve path, we'd get total reserves at a higher level and thereby we'd be able to achieve, or at least come closer to achieving, our M1-B targets Or am I [wrong]?  But as I listened to your report, I got the impression that these adjustments were very small and slight Why aren't they made to the extent necessary to achieve the targets that we set?  Well, had we adjusted nonborrowed reserves to achieve our M1-B-- Let me put it differently You're suggesting that we did not respond as might have been necessary to achieve our M1-B target because we would have overshot the M2 target?  So, Steve, we're almost back to where we were when we had incompatibility of achieving interest rate targets and aggregate targets Now we have two aggregate targets that sometimes are incompatible Is that what you're saying?  Could we set those, if we really wanted to, and lock the doors? Could we set those two aggregate targets so that they would be compatible so you could accomplish both of them?  It depends on whether you're a smoker or a non- smoker  I have a question, Steve As I understood your rationale, you're concerned that if interest rates fall more quickly than somehow would be warranted by present economic conditions, that would have adverse consequences Am I not correct in saying that the only way to stop interest rates from declining at what anyone might think is an excessive rate is to withdraw money, which has a depressing effect on M1-B? Is that correct so far? The only way to keep interest rates from dropping by what anyone might think is a precipitous amount is to be frugal in the way we supply reserves?  All right Let me ask this then If we believe, and maybe we don't, that there is some relationship between economic activity and the rate at which the aggregates grow, especially the narrow aggregate, and if in order to keep interest rates from plummeting we keep the aggregates below what we think is [an appropriate] targeted range, can't that exacerbate the recession? And  -7-    11/17/81  if the recession is more pronounced, won't that cause interest rates to be low anyway? In other words, where does that string of reasoning --if you can dignify it by calling it reasoning--break down, Steve?  Nor do I  Yes, but I thought it--  Well, I would share your thinking that what we do today in the short run isn't important But my question--and maybe I was premature and it should be considered when we make our longer-term plans--was on this whole question of the relationship of [declining] interest rates and the aggregates I think that should be considered at that time, though maybe not today I thought that you were really addressing the longer-term game plan and--  If I were to express a preference among the three alternatives, I'd lean toward "A" or "B" But, as has been stated before, this decision is a very short-run decision If what has happened in the past few months were to happen over the next two months, regardless of whether we choose "A," "B," or "C," we probably won't hit our choice right on the nose So, I don't think what we do today is all that important I do think, though, that what we do in our next two meetings is extremely important, and I'd like very briefly to address myself to a couple of concerns that I've had as I have listened to the discussion today  First of all, regardless of the terminology that tends sometimes to disguise it, there is significant sentiment being expressed that we should revert to paying primary attention to interest rate stabilization That was our practice prior to October 1979 This [view] is apparently based on some very real skepticism as to whether the aggregates are meaningful, whether they're definable, and whether they're controllable I've heard a lot of people say that M1-B should be discarded because M2 somehow or other fits somewhat better today I would remind those people that if M2 were really the meaningful aggregate and were growing as strongly as it has, we wouldn't be faced with a problem of the slow economy and recessionary characteristics that we're facing today  -26-    11/17/81  However, I think there's an even more fundamental concern as we look ahead and that is the decision as to whether or not we ought to revert to our former practices We know that our mission is to try to achieve reasonable price stability and to achieve steady economic growth As some of you have said, it's not desirable to have [large] variations or ups and downs in interest rates Well, I would remind you that prior to October of 1979 we spent precious hours discussing whether or not interest rates should be set 1 point or 1/2 point higher or lower We attempted to conduct monetary policy by targeting on interest rates And I would remind you, unless I misread what happened, that when we convened on October 6, 1979, after many years of carefully attempting to guide the ship by controlling interest rates, we were very concerned that we had seen significant fluctuations, cyclical and other types of fluctuations, in economic activity and we also were experiencing shockingly high rates of inflation  Now, even though we may assume that our efforts to control the aggregates have not been as fruitful as we might have wanted, if you review what has happened since 1979, I think you would conclude that there is some relationship between the behavior of the aggregates and price stability, lagged, and economic growth Compare the times when the aggregates grew above our ranges and see whether or not there was a stimulative effect on the economy a few months afterwards Indeed, [consider] whether the slow growth we've had isn't reflected somewhat in the present weakness in economic output that we're experiencing So, I would conclude my remarks merely by saying that if we decide that [what we did in] October '79 was wrong, then let's tell the world that we're going to go back to where we were prior to October '79 I would submit that if we do that, we would have the most violent upward movement in the interest rate pattern imaginable and our credibility would be forever destroyed, because our Chairman has done a very effective job of convincing people that we are determined to pursue this new course But if we start equivocating, if we start waffling, I think we're in for severe problems These are some of the issues that perhaps we will discuss in the next couple of meetings Certainly today there are a lot of people who would say "Let's pitch out [the decision of] October '79 and go back to interest rate stabilization"  Fred, it was certainly implied when people said we have to avoid upward and downward gyrations in interest rates which, of course, contradicts any ability to control the aggregates At least I think [it does]  -27-    11/17/81   The Bluebook made reference to an anticipated reduction in the rate of money growth for the last part of December Does that appear to be probable?  I didn't get an answer, Mr Chairman  Obviously, things are relatively slow in our District, but I think it is important to remember that part of it can be attributed to the rather abrupt drop in the rate of money growth during most of this year As we look ahead into what next year will bring, especially the second half of next year, it is awfully important to keep in mind--unless I am the only one in this group who sees it this way--that the decisions we make this afternoon and tomorrow will have a direct bearing They will have even a greater bearing than what recent conversations with people in business might indicate for the future If we choose to set targets that imply a faster rate of money growth than we are presently experiencing, we are inevitably going to have a step-up in economic activity after a few months So, what we do will have a direct bearing, at least as we look at it, rather than just psychological [effects on] decisions that businessmen might be making  May I ask a question on the domestic end, of either Chuck or Jim Kichline? This next round of tax reductions, the ones that take effect in 1982, are those to a great extent offset by payroll tax increases?  Is that possible on these?  So it is not a cut?  Thank you  I share to a great extent what Lyle has just said It seems to me that we would sharpen this discussion if we were able to agree upon and accept for ourselves certain basic targets related to those objectives that we really are charged with achieving The two principal objectives we should have are to achieve certain targets of output growth as well as targets for the reduction of [inflation] and concurrently to consider what effect achieving those targets might have on the unemployment rate Now, for what it is worth, [let me tell you what] our people projected [would happen] if we were to come down on a broad conceptual objective of maybe a 5 percent rate of growth for M1-B in 1982 and 1983--assuming just theoretically that that was achievable by us and assuming a moderate slowing in the growth of federal spending and the tax policy as presently enacted They projected that fourth quarter of 1981 to fourth quarter 1982 nominal GNP would be something in the vicinity of 7-1/2 percent to 9 percent; real GNP would be 1 to 2 percent; prices as measured by the deflator would be 6-1/2 to 7 percent; and this would result in an unemployment rate of maybe 8-1/2 to 9 percent And in 1983 if these assumptions were held to, we again would see growth of nominal GNP of 7-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, with a bit higher real GNP of 2 to 3 percent, price [increases of] 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent--that is, a reduction of about another point--and unemployment still 8-1/2 to 9 percent I don't know whether these objectives are what the Committee would opt for, but it seems to me that it is important, and should be important when we discuss this tomorrow, for us to try to agree on what we think are the tolerable ranges of output growth, what price objectives we would like to achieve, and what unemployment rate we would be willing  -27-    12/21-22/81  to tolerate and then try to establish money growth rates that we think would achieve those objectives  Probably some of you would part from the rationale that I am trying to present by saying that money growth does not have a precise effect or even a meaningful effect on output or on prices I think what seems to be happening on prices is more than a reflection of the whims of the people who are negotiating wage settlements and that it really is a reflection of the reduction in money growth that we have achieved either purposely or otherwise So, in thinking about these things, I believe we should try to define our objectives and then regardless of how we come toward those--whether it is through money growth control or interest rates--try to agree on what we think are the decisions that would lead to the output growth and price targets that we agree on and the unemployment consequences  I don't think any monetarist ever maintained that a 1- or 2-month trend, upward or downward, will have an effect on GNP  May I ask Frank a question very quickly, Mr Chairman? If we had a shortfall in M1-B this year and we have a weak economy, how does that add up to the conclusion that there is little relationship between the growth of M1-B and output? I think that strengthens the case for the fact that M1-B is a predictor of economic activity  You are invited to St Louis, my good friend!  Chuck, doesn't the law say that we have to use the fourth quarter as a [base]?  I wonder, Steve, if you compared the quarterly rate of money growth to the trend rate, if there is any instance where we had two quarters of M1-B growth falling below the trend rate where we haven't had a significant downturn in economic activity  As a means of achieving growth in M1 next year of 5 percent, for the reasons I attempted to enunciate yesterday, I would favor the alternative A choice I wouldn't jump off the bridge if you adopted Tony Solomon's "B+;" I would be happier on Christmas Eve if we did widen that funds range a little, maybe to 9 to 14 percent or something like that A $350 to $400 million borrowing assumption would be consistent with this, I think  You wanted just voting members?  Anything that is a departure from customary terminology leads market people to read things into it, I think   I asked our staff to see if they could churn up some figures that perhaps would explain not the IRA thing but why M1 acted as it did And they did come up with some interesting figures that I'll be brief in touching on The bottom line of the figures they gave me indicated that we were somewhat slow in our willingness to change our nonborrowed reserve path under certain circumstances They looked at four periods One, for example, was the 3 weeks ending August 19 and, Steve, let me see if I can explain what I'm trying to say In those 3 weeks, the projected deficiency of total reserves relative to path averaged about $152 million, according to our records, and in that period we did not change our nonborrowed reserve path nor did we change the discount rate The average in the 4 weeks ending September 15--and this was when the aggregates were undershooting--was about $244 million The deficiency in the 3 weeks ending October 7 was about $405 million And in each of those periods, if my staff's figures are correct, we apparently did not change our nonborrowed reserve path nor did we change the discount rate Now, back in May of [last] year, when total reserves were projected to be about $500 million above path, we increased the discount rate and we reduced the supply of nonborrowed reserves by about $375 million And as a result of those actions, Ml began declining immediately and we did avoid a continuation of that We, in effect, interrupted the bulge that occurred then Is there any logic in their conclusion, based on that type of evidence, that one of the problems has been a problem of our not moving our nonborrowed reserves as quickly as we should?    2/1-2/82  In other words, that's the answer That you withdrew reserves by about $190 million  The excess of the total reserves was up in the $300 or $400 to $500 million area You say that if you had pulled all of those out, it would have had a dramatic upward influence on interest rates And that's the reason you didn't  Steve, our experience in May, though, when we had a similar bulge and when you did take strong action to reduce nonborrowed reserves--I think by about $370 million, if my numbers are correct--was that it did cause the fed funds rate temporarily to go to about 19 percent, but then it receded, didn't it? In other words, I wonder if we are exaggerating the possible volatility of those fed funds rates and whether we're not in the long pull affecting interest rates more meaningfully than if we really bit the bullet  I think it's important that we stick with our present targets If we were able to achieve precise gradations, I would think that M1 should grow as in the strategy [2] scenario at something like 5, 5-1/2 percent I'm not sure, with our present procedures, that we can hit our targets anyway much less achieve subtle differences between 4 and 5 percent I would agree with [Bob Black] in that I'm not disturbed about [the behavior of] M2 or M3 Except for the cosmetic aspect of it, the defensive end, I think we'd clear the air by not setting M2 or M3 targets because they don't affect output or prices as effectively as M1, and I think it would be disastrous to start horsing around with the base again People know what we're doing; they watch us like hawks And I think it's important for us to say what we're going to do and then try our level best to improve procedures to accomplish our targets  Do we assume that it is impossible to pinch off this bulge through our open market operations? In other words, we did it in the middle of last year What if we decided, instead of waiting to see what happens in a month or two or six weeks ahead, that we were going to instruct the Desk to sell securities out of our open market account in the amount necessary to pull down this bulge that has occurred And, if that goes too far, then we'd reverse that performance Can't we be the--  Peter, may I ask a question? In the Bluebook the staff usually gives us several alternatives for the short-run targets and also indicates an implied fed funds range for each of those    2/1-2/82  alternatives If my memory serves me, in the past as well as in this current Bluebook the most expansive alternative usually reflects lower fed funds rate projections and the more restrictive money growth projections are accompanied by higher fed funds ranges Now, at our last meeting, if we actually had set targets for money growth that were what has happened--money growth exploded--would you feel that normally that would have resulted in a lower fed funds rate or a higher one? It seems--  What I'm trying in a clumsy way to get to is this Is it not possible that our whole concept of how the fed funds rate reacts to the aggregate targets we set is exactly the reverse of what really happens? When money explodes, it seems to me that the fed funds rates and interest rates rise, as they are presently Is that not true? And if that is true, why do you continue under the alternatives that are suggested to imply lower fed funds ranges with aggregates that show a higher money growth?  No sir I'm suggesting that the relationship between money growth and the fed funds ranges is just the opposite of what our Bluebook shows us The Bluebook usually shows a lower range of fed funds when we opt for the more expansive alternative and a higher fed funds range under the alternative where money grows more slowly, implying that that will bring rates up And that's exactly the opposite of what happened, Chuck  Regardless of the theory that relates one to the other, Henry, if we see over and over again that when money grows the fed funds rate moves up, we're getting our theory--  Fred, all I'm trying to argue is that if--  If you look at what happens today when money grows more rapidly than people anticipated, these rates move up It's just exactly the opposite of the circumstances formerly, before we had inflationary expectations  But, Steve, regardless of what causes this--I'll buy any theory and I know you're both right--when money grows, rates go up So it is just the opposite of the way we project these things in our thinking in the Bluebook  But Tony if that's so--and I'll agree with you that it may be--still if we have an alternative that implies a higher rate of money growth, then we should project, regardless of the reason for it, a higher range for fed funds than if we're setting a lower rate of money growth That is my point regardless of why  Well, how would the economy be squeezed? What do you mean by that?  But the most--  I'd like to ask Steve to verify whether the following reasoning or these facts are right or wrong If M1 remains at its current level of about $450 billion throughout the first quarter of 1982, would the estimated growth rate for the first quarter be about 12 percent? Is that correct?  Then if money grows at this 12 percent rate over the first quarter, if we do what the Chairman suggested and stay where we are, what does that imply for the growth of M1 over the rest of '82? In other words, if M1 growth in the last quarter of last year was 6 percent and in the first quarter of this year is 12 percent, doesn't that imply, if we're going to stay within the long-term range that we have been talking about, something like a 3 percent growth rate for the next two quarters?    2/1-2/82  Okay If we had a 9 percent average growth for M1 over the last two quarters and we're forced to seek a 3 percent growth rate of M1 for the next two quarters, wouldn't that have a very traumatic effect on output late in the year?  Steve, your most expansive case, alternative D-- and I promise I'll shut up soon, Mr Chairman--has the lowest fed funds range of these four alternatives Yet, with the explosion of money growth that we have experienced in the last few weeks, the fed funds rate is already above the top of that alternative D range What makes you think that we aren't going to have increasing fed funds rates even if we go the more expansive route? That's what worries me about this whole thing  Can anyone accurately forecast the demand for money?  The prosecution rests!  Well, I think it's obvious that we ought to do what we did last year and pinch out this bulge If you recall, we had almost the same experience in the middle of last year; and when we took the action we did in April of last year, the fed funds rate did rise from about 13 to 19 percent It stayed there a couple of months But then it came down again and we were in a much more favorable position after we had taken the remedial action So, that's obviously my point of view I think we ought to do something sooner  Mr Corrigan, may I please just correct one thing, sir? The monetary base has grown much more quickly in the last quarter of--  No, not according to us We'll have to put you on our mailing list  If Mr Meese's comment this morning that the President would want to consult with you turns out to be meaningful, would that have any effect on the timing or on any aspect of this scenario that you are talking about?  I just meant could that have an effect on your timing in--  Of course, certain market participants are allegedly upset because we have been flexible--if you want to use that word--or volatile They say that we have not really been able to stick with, on a rather inflexible basis, a set program One can look at it either way Does the press know the date that you are presently scheduled [to testify]?  Because there could be dangers in misinterpreting a delay as--  You will be subjected, I am sure, to further questioning about our procedures and whether we just assume that we are doing this in the most satisfactory way, technique wise That is where we are going to get some flak, I think I assume that nobody around this table really would welcome or advocate any major changes, such as targeting on total reserves or taking the step that we have  -91-    2/1-2/82  heard over and over again, which is going to contemporaneous reserve accounting  Of course, Nancy, what disturbs me--and I say this with humility--is that I fear that what is being done may not produce the results we sought Procedurally, I don't think we really are doing what ought to be done to conduct monetary policy in the way that those who wanted to target on reserve targets had sought initially What I think will happen in the real world--I am not going to be around--is that this will not work And everybody, broad-brush, will say that the monetarist approach failed when I really do not think that we have conducted a true monetaristic experiment here But we could argue that for forever and a day  But, Nancy, I think a lot of people could say they did not like what happened when we were concentrating on controlling    2/1-2/82  interest rates That record is a very poor one and probably led to these high rates Anyway, I do not mean to be cantankerous  Whatever adjustment is made in March or April, especially if you have a meeting with the President, anything that can be construed as being more expansionary at that time of the year will be interpreted immediately as the Fed caving in to political pressure in view of the November elections They are going to be watching us The question I hear is Are you fellows going to be able to stand the heat from the politicians during an election year? And I think we have to be awfully careful that we do not fall into that trap and do something that may be better but that will be interpreted, in effect, as our climbing into bed with this Administration or any other--  Even now I think we do  It will be worse in the spring  It was just a passing remark in which he said he felt that the President was going to get together with [the Federal Reserve Chairman]--  Paul, would it be possible, without tipping our hand, to say that we might come back if it were tight? Can't you build a case that there are a lot of imponderables and that it may be necessary to change the targets without saying in which direction-- just signalling that we are always flexible  Voting members or everybody?  If we went with the present M1 target, would you consider saying that we would seek something at the upper [end of the] range?  That is a lesser of the two--  A meeting on March 1st or coming in then for a meeting on March 2nd?   Wait 'til that gets out! [Laughter]  I'll be glad to wait until tomorrow if you want  We had two very interesting experiences last week On Wednesday, we had the chief executive officers of about fifteen of our largest St Louis-based firms in for lunch These are large companies which in many instances are multinational in scope The following day we had eight of the chief labor leaders in our area in for lunch There was an interesting similarity in their attitudes There's no question that the industries and, of course labor in terms of unemployment, are feeling very severe recessionary pressures On the other hand--and I was especially interested in this reaction coming from the labor side--these people recognize that this was part of the process of bringing down inflation They felt that whoever made the monetary policy and fiscal policy decisions of a year or two ago must have known that this downtrend would occur They see it as a temporary phenomenon As Bill said, they anticipate a recovery And even from the labor group there was a strong recognition, and hope really, that we will continue to look to solving the long-term fundamental problems rather than reacting to the pain of the moment Even though these people were very outspoken in their expression of momentary pain, they were optimistic for the future And they were very strong in their support of monetary policy as in their view being much more assured of hanging in there, if you will, than fiscal [policy] Well, I didn't come away from those two experiences nearly as depressed as some of the others of you were yesterday  I think reasonable, in terms of less-than-might- be-expected settlements They realize that they have to be flexible under these circumstances and I think this will bode well for the effort to continue to hold down inflation These guys at least were not bitter in their reactions, and they said that even though their rank and file membership are experiencing things that they haven't experienced for some years, they're not reacting as they might have in the '30s They're not just saying the world is going to the dogs I felt more of an upbeat reaction in terms of the long pull than some of the others of you who expressed yourselves yesterday And in my own short experience on this Committee, I think we've tended to get carried away emotionally on the down side when things are gloomy  Si mentioned yesterday, when you questioned him, what is happening to farm prices in Illinois I remember just a few years ago we were all extremely appalled at the inflationary upward movement in farm prices So, I think it's important that we not get carried away and over-react to what hopefully will be a temporary situation  Explain that to those lumberjacks!  I have a question, and I apologize because I will confess to an inability, Steve, to understand every word in your presentation and the significance of it But let me just ask a couple of fundamental questions that I think have a bearing on which of these alternatives we choose Let's assume that our primary long-run concern is inflation and our primary shorter-run concern is the effect of whatever we do on the economy How would alternative A, alternative B, or alternative C impact output over the remainder of this year and how would they impact the longer-range inflationary situation? How would you describe the three alternatives in terms of their impact on these two results? Could you express that?  Would "A" or "B" imply that we're going to seek to get back within our [M1] range? Would that imply relatively slow M1 growth for the last 6 months [of the year]? Let me put it differently Would that imply M1 growth that could be so slow as to have a recessionary effect in the latter part of this year or an abortive effect on the recovery early next year? Or do you not believe that there is a relationship between--?  I guess I view this somewhat differently than some of you What disturbs me, Mr Chairman, is that it is apparent from past experience that when we have had a significant reduction in the rate of money growth--let's say, growth for 6 months below the trend rate prior to that 6-month period--inevitably it almost always resulted in a negative growth situation That is true if you look back at [the trends in money growth that] preceded previous recessions When we consider whether or not we would act quickly--to use the expression we've used--to "pinch off" another bulge, I think we have to look ahead and recognize that if any accommodation in policy today were to necessitate an abrupt reduction in the rate of money growth over the last half of this year in order to achieve our targets, the probability is that this would bring us back into a somewhat recessionary situation in the last quarter of this year or the first quarter of next year And I think that is an issue that    3/29-30/82  should be considered in whatever policy decisions this Committee makes today  Well, if I had to opt for something, I would say that if there is an April bulge, it should be brought down almost as quickly as possible in order to permit money to grow gradually over the last part of the year On the other hand, that could cause a 2- or 3-week--if one can define it [that closely]--upward movement of the fed funds rate and other short-term interest rates and that does frighten some people It's a matter, though, of whether we bite the bullet now in order to position ourselves for growth in the aggregates in the second half of the year or if we tolerate that, as we sometimes have in the past, and then are forced to keep money growing at a very low rate, as occurred for six months last year In our analysis, that is what we did from May to October of last year, and it was a contributing factor to our present weak economy Now, this may be seeing it from a monetarist point of view; I assume it is And some of you may not share that view But it worries us, looking into the future, that we may be setting the stage for problems at the end of this year and going into next year  Mr Chairman, I'd just ask one question, because I'm lost on this argument concerning the effect of NOW accounts NOW accounts are a part of M1, are they not? And if they are, that money is usable by the banks It's a different name for a different type of transaction balance But why does that distort M1 growth if a certain amount of M1 growth is a reflection of growing NOW accounts? I lost that If we are trying to figure total M1 as it is and are trying to quantify it in terms of the effect of its growth on the economy, and part of that M1 is reflective of NOW account growth, why does that distort the usefulness of M1 as an aggregate?  Yes, but that money is there in the bank and--  So, you are saying that our original targets were set differently than they would have been had we known that M1 was  -43-    3/29-30/82  going to be expanded by the advent of these NOW accounts? I think that's a--  Mr Chairman, as I stated prior to the recess, the decisions we make today have to be made in the context of what they will mean for our policy in the second half of the year In looking at this, I don't think we can take lightly the targets that we have announced I don't think we can assume glibly that we can arbitrarily adjust those targets upward when we make our July adjustment without risking a perception by market participants that our action was paving the way toward further inflation And if we made an upward adjustment in order to bring relief to the economy, I would assume that it would have exactly the opposite effect from what its proponents might be seeking; an upward adjustment in our annual ranges would probably bring an upward movement in interest rates rather than any reduction in interest rates  So, I would opt for something like alternative B because I think it would position us probably as well as we could anticipate under our present difficult circumstances But I feel just as strongly as anyone could feel that if we temporize, that if we do have an April bulge and if we say we don't want to be mechanistic [in responding to it] or however we phrase it, we are going to get ourselves in a position where we are going to have to live with unacceptably fast growth of M1 in the first part of the year If we look at it from day to day and from week to week, and if by doing so, as we have occasionally in the past, we validate that increase and don't take action to pinch it out and pinch it out awfully quickly, I think we are going to have to jam on the brakes in the second half of the year And that is going to bring us a negative reaction in terms of economic activity later this year or early next year and and we will be accused of having precipitated another recession Regardless of how we want to view it and explain it--and nobody is more skillful  -47-    3/29-30/82  than you are, Mr Chairman, in explaining the confusion that arises out of NOW accounts or sweep accounts or financial innovations--the people out there who set these interest rates have their eye on M1 You can't fool them into saying, well, M1 has performed this way and M2 has performed that way That is what runs this locomotive and I think we have to recognize those things And that's why I would disagree with those who say that we shouldn't respond quickly if this bulge occurs I think it is incumbent upon us to react very quickly  There have been studies and recent studies made-- not that our studies are necessarily all inclusive or all conclusive-- that show that M2 is a much inferior predictor of economic activity than M1 and that we can't control it   Paul, as the Federal Reserve, what is our responsibility in a situation like this--just to keep order? Is that our concern, rather than letting it take its normal course? I'm asking that naively, I really am  Well, I guess inevitably I just don't reflect what happens everywhere else around this table In our part of the Midwest I don't sense the pervasive gloom that some of you are reporting, and we have had CEOs of major corporations in the Bank just within the last two weeks I sense a general feeling that the economy is near the trough of the recession; I sense a rather positive recognition of some fundamental things that most of our people feel have been put into place First of all, they're comfortable with the level of inventories; secondly, they are extremely pleased about the downward trend of inflation; thirdly, they see a stabilization, or an absence of further downward movement, in the economy The basic feeling is that the economy has hit the bottom that was anticipated The one point that comes through to me constantly is this plea Please tell your colleagues that the one thing that could push us over the brink is if [monetary policy] becomes expansive because that would move interest rates up In other words, the basic feeling is that we're down the road in our cure process and they anticipate a recovery and hope that we, in our infinite wisdom, don't do anything to upset that recovery I would just say, as a relatively senior individual about to go out to pasture, that I can remember every time in the short seven years I've been here that when things were just about to improve a great many of us were saying "Oh my word, we're facing absolute disaster A couple more months and if we don't intervene in some way, everything is going to go down the drain" Well, I think we're on the brink of improvement [as do] most of the thinking people in our part of the country who are out of the realm of politics I think the politicians on either side always will be overly optimistic or overly pessimistic because that's how they do business But there is basically a subdued confidence, as I sense it, in our District  I wish I didn't have to be the guy to do it  Well, I'd like to express myself in terms of realities I would question very vehemently any implication that monetary policy in the last few months has really been as tight as some would imply it has been Even if money growth from April to June is zero, second-quarter growth of M1 will be somewhere between 3 and 4 percent And when combined with the first-quarter M1 growth of 107 percent, that would result in money growth of 6-1/2 to 7 percent for the first half of 1982 That is not starving orphans; it is not squeezing the economy to death It is relatively robust growth  I would opt for "B" because I think it would set the stage for M1 growth of about 5-1/2 percent for the second half of 1982, which should allow for positive growth of real GNP Even though that rate of growth, when combined with the 6-1/2 to 7 percent growth in the first half, would produce approximately 6 percent M1 growth for the year as a whole, which is slightly above our annual target, it would still work toward reducing the basic rate of inflation from the current 7-1/4 percent If we were to opt for an expansionary policy of something along the lines of alternative A, I think we would most assuredly end up with 6-1/2 to 7 percent growth of money in the second half of this year, and that sort of money growth would reignite inflationary expectations and start to undo the progress we've made over the past year and a half The consequence is--and apparently there is some difference of opinion and difference of understanding on the part of some of us on this Committee--that the inflationary expectations resulting from an expansive monetary policy would cause interest rates to rise, and I underscore rise, rather than fall  Finally, while I don't want to get into a philosophical discussion and would rather imply my attitudes toward this, I couldn't characterize monetary policy as it has been conducted as entirely a failure It has gotten us from those glorious double-digit inflation days that apparently some enjoyed a few years ago to inflation at a tolerable rate It has brought down short-term interest rates by 300 to 400 basis points And, unless I am as blind as a bat, I don't  -30-    5/18/82  think that that is all wrong Excuse me, Mr Chairman, but in sum, I would opt for alternative B  Can't you respond just by transmitting to him some sugar-coated, beautiful, unadulterated, double talk? I don't think you have to dignify the gentleman's request Frequently in the game of politics when somebody tries to put you on the spot, you respond in a very dignified way with some vacuous terminology and hope he makes an inspection trip to the Falkland Islands or something like that!  Do you have some idea, Mr Chairman, when we return how long you think [the meeting will run]?   I would start by saying that as far as the remainder of '82 is concerned I would prefer alternative A which implies an M1 growth of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent--in other words, maintaining our present range but with the understanding, either tacit or stated, that M1 will be permitted to grow either at the top or    6/30-7/1/82  slightly above the 5-1/2 percent upper limit of our range As for the longer-run growth strategy, I would prefer strategy IV, which assumes that M1 would indeed grow at 6 percent or thereabouts this year and be reduced to 5-1/2 percent in 1983 and 5 percent in 1984  I am really not surprised, according to the way we analyze the effect of money growth on the economy, about output I'm not amazed or surprised about where we are at the present I think the present extreme softness in the economy can be directly attributed to the period of approximately 6 months last year when we permitted money to grow at a very, very low rate I believe there is a definite relationship [because of] an abrupt reduction in money growth and our keeping it at below trend for as long as a 6-month period  In looking ahead, I think the downside risk is a very real risk because if we decide to attempt to bring growth of M1, which has been at about a 7 percent rate for the first six months of this year, significantly within our announced range for 1982, that would entail reducing the rate of money growth to about 3 percent for the last six months of the year And if we were to fall into that trap, it's almost certain that next year we would face either a continuation or an acceleration of the recession we're presently experiencing And that would pose a severe threat to what we've been trying to do because then those who are apostles of expansion would most certainly be on our backs and ask us [unintelligible] If we go into another economic dip in '83, I think that could well spell the end of an attempt to control money growth intelligently--some of you might not consider it intelligently--to accomplish certain economic purposes  Now, if we feel that we will resist the temptation to jam on the brakes over the last six months of this year in order to bring the aggregates within their ranges, we have the question of whether it's better to adjust our ranges upward and announce that now or to recognize at least among ourselves that there probably will be some overshoot beyond our stated ranges for the rest of the year Before receiving the Bluebook, I on three occasions tested groups of people at home our board of directors, twelve corporate treasurers of our largest companies who were in for lunch, and most recently the five heads of our major banks I asked them this hypothetical question If the Fed faces the inevitability of an overshoot of its present range in the last six months [of this year], do you think the Fed is better off to adjust its range upward or to tolerate the strength for the rest of the year and then say that there were certain circumstances that caused us to overshoot these stated targets slightly? And this is no exaggeration, Mr Chairman, there was unanimity, and I underscore unanimity--not one voice to the contrary They said For heavens sake, don't adjust your ranges upward because if you do that, it will be interpreted as a dramatic indication that you are softening up on your anti-inflationary effort This was just the judgment of a bunch of people, but they felt that the danger to our credibility would be significantly less if we were to allow a minor overshoot of our stated targets rather than announce an upward adjustment of those targets So, that's where I stand  Prior to '79 we were probably the most flexible--  Approached how?  Chuck, may I inquire, sir If we make a strong statement in reference to interest rates, doesn't that imply a significant departure and doesn't that signal that once again we are trying to balance interest rates and aggregate growth?  So you are placing primary emphasis on--  Well, I would opt for alternative A with a borrowing assumption of $900 million or something like that But I am concerned about the implication of some of the opinions that I've heard I don't think it's necessary to repeat that everybody around this table would like to see lower interest rates But these interest rates are quite obviously affected by how the financial markets view the signals that we send or the signals that we are imagined to send And I think any change of wording in the directive that could be interpreted as signaling even temporarily a return to placing primary emphasis on controlling interest rates--placing a cap on interest rates or anything like that--would be disastrous because people would say, after they've seen the effect on inflation of our 1979 change of emphasis, that we're going back to the old way of doing things In an historical perspective I think the last thing the markets want to see --and this goes for this business of flexibility--is a return to a fine-tuning, interest-rate-control-oriented method of conducting policy I think everybody always has to be flexible On the other hand, I'd hate like the devil to go on the open seas and know that the captain did not set a course before we left port and that he changed signals every day We'd be going around in circles And I honestly believe that for almost 15 years--and I was part of it, although I disagreed with it--the Federal Open Market Committee went around in gigantic circles, which led to our present predicament and resulted in high interest rates With that speech, I will hush up, Mr Chairman, and opt for alternative A and a borrowing assumption of $900 million  Chuck, how would that differ from the pre-1979 practices of our Committee?  Given the news about Mexico, we could say 5 percent "poco mas o menos"  I think that's great, sir  Do you think the Congress is serious? If they knew that we were talking this seriously and not recognizing it as a political byplay, I think that would make their whole Fourth of July weekend! They didn't really expect us to do more than put together some verbiage that would be respectful and dismiss it, did they?  What is the purpose of our response? Is it really to offer an intelligent guide to these fellows on Capitol Hill or just to get a response done? I think they are not asking for economic analysis; they're playing politics  Is Congressman Fauntroy going to put you through this kind of exercise, too, at his hearing?  Because he wants to pass the buck   When will the testimony be?  This is Larry Roos I would be most agreeable with the wording of the wire that was sent out to us I don't think anyone, including the markets, thinks that a half point one way or the other is an achievable objective I think there is a downside risk I certainly feel that we should continue to attempt to control the money supply to bring down inflation But if money really came in on the low side of either of these suggested targets, I think that might do in aggregate targeting forever and ever and we'd have another softening in the economy So, I would opt for the wording that was in the wire and whether we use "continue" or "adopt" I don't think makes too much difference  Well, Bob, the way we set these ranges in light of the strength in recent years is not as important as where we end up within a range that's either a half point higher or lower on either [end] or [whether we] indicate that we will shoot for the upper part of it, which I think would be satisfactory I have no trouble with the wire as is   If their picture became more dismal and there were a political reaction down there, obviously these types of agreements would be rather meaningless, wouldn't they? There is no way--unless we build oil tanks in all of our new Fed buildings--  Are there other problem situations in that part of the world that conceivably are likely to follow or fall into the same [difficulties]?  Jim, this follows the gist of your comments on [output] I noticed that in the Greenbook you have reduced your estimate for real output growth in the third quarter from about 2-1/2 percent to 1 percent In your analysis, was the slow rate of M1 growth over the past months--I think this has an effect on the decision we make later--a factor that led to your conclusion?  Mr Chairman  I find myself in the pleasant posture of agreeing with Tony and the others in terms of the ultimate objective I think we should avoid a continuation of slow money growth But I'm a little concerned about the thought of our attempting to lean against a further drop in interest rates because I think that would imply a further slowing of money growth Money has grown exceptionally slowly over the last five months and, at the risk of analyzing something in a little different manner than some of you do, our experience prior to every recession that we've had since World War II is that when money has grown below its trend rate for two or more quarters it inevitably leads to a softening in the economy and to a recession Even a rather unsophisticated set of eyes such as mine can see that this has been the experience And although none of us knows what the future holds, I have a great fear that if money is permitted to grow slowly for several more months, we could have a serious weakening in the economy at the end of this year and into the early part of next year If that were to happen, we could have a revitalization of the criticism that we have been too tight So, I would certainly favor alternative A,  -20-    8/24/82  but I would not be quite as concerned as one or two others have indicated about acting to prevent a further drop in the fed funds rate I think doing so would exacerbate the undershoot of growth in the narrow aggregate  The sort of wording we had in the directive in this previous period would have meant much more active reaction to what has happened In other words, what happened in the last week involved rather volatile interest rates, even though they were volatile in a pretty good direction  Would the changed wording cause eyebrows to rise within the--?  That's what bothers me, whether it would be read as a signal of a return to stabilizing interest rates  Isn't it desirable, with things at least presently going our way, in effect, to word this directive much like previous directives? In other words, isn't it desirable to avoid anything that might imply any [move away from such a directive]? I think the world today thinks that you have done a great job since '79 in getting us where we are right now and I just--  My side of the world  Well, is there anyone in the markets who doesn't think that if there were an unexpectedly volatile occurrence in credit markets that we would not consult? They assume that, don't they? In other words, do we have to tell them that exactly? Obviously, we'll accept your phone call, Mr Chairman, any time But do we have to say it? I just don't like to rock the boat  Haven't we had a 500 basis point fed funds range for a long time?  SPEAKER(?) Four or five [months]  Four or five We're leaving the aggregate targets about where they are Why don't we set a broader range and, certainly, if something unforeseen happens, the Chairman will call a consultation Why do we have to spell it all out? I think the important thing is not to deviate from what we've done, because we don't want to cause anyone to misconstrue that we've made a major change in our policy prescription  -38-    8/24/82  Isn't that implied, Jerry? We have always given regard to these things   Where are the [money growth] figures coming in,    9/24/82  Mr Chairman? Do you know what today's report will show?  Are you suggesting, Paul, essentially that we hold the line until we get together at the next FOMC meeting?  When would the first weekly figures be published that would show a significant increase in M1 growth according to Steve's projections?  I see   Peter, do the nonbank dealers let your surveillance group come in?  On what general basis? That it's the only way--  Mr Chairman  Just to avoid total desperation, we have a little more positive view of [the outlook] First of all, we weren't surprised at the fairly slow growth in output in the third quarter because we feel that it was to a great extent a reflection of the monetary contraction that occurred earlier in the year However,-  We think--and again it's a matter of relative value--that the contraction in output would have been even worse had there not been that expansion However, we feel that if money is allowed to grow at, say, 5 to 5-1/2 percent or slightly above that, we will see a much more positive effect on output certainly starting next year We observe in the record that the economy always tends to move toward about a 3-1/2 percent trend growth of output We think, inasmuch as we've had about 3 years of very slow growth--and we blame it on monetary contractions--and price increases have finally slowed and real interest rates are approaching normal levels, that much of the adjustment that was caused by that and by foreign competition being a factor in heavy industry has been completed We think that quite conceivably we could have a bit faster rebound next year, based on 5-1/2 percent money growth, than some others have forecast If I'm wrong, I won't be here, Mr Chairman; if I'm right, you'll hear from me!  Well, isn't this similar to the NOW account situation? Didn't we adjust for NOW accounts? Can't we do the same thing and avoid the possibility that people would misconstrue this as a major change in policy?  Mr Chairman, I would agree with Frank, strange as it may seem, that before we bury my old friend M1 at this meeting-- this [new instrument] won't take effect for a couple of months--there ought to be some work done by the various economic staffs to try to project the effect There are a lot of people who don't like my old friend M1, and whenever anything changes they say this is a good time to bury M1  But couldn't some study be done prior to changing our basic approach to policymaking? I'm a little paranoid--I guess I have been for most of my life with the Federal Reserve--that every time something comes up that casts some suspicion on M1, there's an awful lot of readiness to bury it Does our policy action today require that we do something that's a significant departure from the way we've been doing things? Couldn't this matter be studied and couldn't we have a summit meeting if necessary, a la Jerry's [suggestion], prior to our next meeting of the FOMC to see what the best brains in the System think will be the result of the DIDC action and everything else?  Well, you didn't suggest we praise it!  It was Mark Antony's  How should we respond, if we are on the speaking circuit and are asked what our impression is of the international situation? How do you respond to that?  Is it possible to assume that this international problem is not a consequence of our anti-inflationary efforts and that if our [anti-inflationary] program had never been undertaken this same sort of international situation could exist in a highly inflationary [environment]?    10/5/82  This would mean that we would set no targets for M1?  [Secretary's note The draft directive wording circulated at Chairman Volcker's request did not include a target for M1]  Mr Chairman, why would this be preferable to continuing to specify the target for M1 but putting in a disclaimer or at least the warning that M1 might behave in an unusual manner and if that occurs, we would reserve the privilege of adjusting it accordingly? I'd prefer that for the sake of continuity If we ignore M1 totally, despite the explanations that are given, I think people could read sinister purposes in it; it would make base drift pale in comparison to dropping one of our important targets totally I'd rather see us say that we're doing this but it is somewhat tentative due to what might happen on these new instruments To ignore M1 would really run the flag up that in some people's perception we are making a basic change There is still a significant amount of debate between Frank and me and others; some of us think that M1 is not as unreliable as others do I just think to drop it would look as though we've really retreated in that regard  Well, doesn't alternative B for M1 as shown in the Bluebook imply roughly that the fed funds rate would remain in the 8 to 12 percent range? In other words, how would this avoid--    10/5/82  How would this give you greater assurance, Mr Chairman, that rates could not [rise]? For example, if some people felt through some complicated thinking that ignoring M1 was an expansionary or inflationary act, how would this wording assure that the fed funds rate would not increase just as substantially as setting a "B" target for M1, for example, and saying it might be right or wrong depending on how people respond to--  Even if this were done, people will still measure M1 in their closets and under their beds and so forth in order to--  If, in order to keep interest rates artificially down or otherwise down, we have to inflate M1, the minute that becomes apparent we've lost the ballgame and we will have just as high--  Well, how does this differ, Chuck, from our experience with NOW accounts? I remember when everybody got all jumpy about NOW accounts  Well, who has been able to demonstrate any reliable relationship between the growth of the broader aggregates and economic activity? M2 was growing way above its range last year, I think, or the year before and the economy was sick  I can't read, but--  Do you think the evidence shows that M2 is as good a predictor as Ml?  You said a decline in the money supply?  SPEAKER(?) In the week  During that temporary period, may I just inquire whether we would continue to publish weekly M1 figures  Pres, what if those weekly figures over this temporary period showed a rather unusual and alarming increase in M1? They would be out there for everyone to see Do you anticipate that if that were to happen we would be able to move interest rates down? In other words, if the consequence of what we were doing [unintelligible] The traditional means of bringing short-term interest rates down was to pump money into the economy, and if that was reflected in the weekly figures and they showed a bulge, assuming that everyone around this table wants to see lower interest rates--  Well, I would suspect, and I'd be prepared to place a small wager on it, that the all savers phenomenon will wash itself out within 60 days at the most  In that order?  All right, I'd be pleased to  Let me say, Mr Chairman, that I was both impressed and depressed with your review of the world situation, and I don't minimize that in any way Let me also say that no one at this table would prefer lower interest rates more than I I do take exception to any implication that recent Federal Reserve policy has wrung out the economy of this country or has been detrimental to the international economy I think what has occurred is more a result of ten or fifteen years of irresponsible monetary policies throughout the world--as well as a well-meant effort on the part of the Federal Open Market Committee as long as I've been on it and until October 1979--to try to do just what we're doing today, and that is to lean against interest rate movements I think that contributed in a major way to inflation, which really led to this high interest rate pattern that we have I believe that what we're about to do today will unquestionably be viewed by those who watch what we do as a major change I don't think it will be possible to explain away the fact that, albeit temporarily, we are moving away from [targeting] a narrow aggregate that has predicted prices and output better than other variables It will be apparent, in spite of any disclaimers we may or may not make, that we are moving toward placing greater emphasis on controlling the fed funds rate And I think it will be misconstrued by the markets It will be associated with the forthcoming election; I think it will give comfort to those who, rightly or wrongly, have sat on the sidelines and implied that somewhere along the line we would cave in on our present policy posture  Mr Chairman, there's no question that under your leadership we have made enormous strides toward wringing out the inflationary problem and restoring the economy to at least a semblance of stability I think our credibility and your credibility are unbelievably and deservably affirmed at present If we fail to specify in this directive at least some M1 range, with all the disclaimers that these things that are going to happen could distort it and cause us to change, I think there will be a gross misinterpretation and misconception of what we are doing And it could conceivably destroy much of the progress that we've made So, although I don't have a vote, I feel it's a gross mistake to do what apparently we're about to do   Would you think it would be helpful in making some of these very basic decisions, if some input were invited from whatever Reserve Banks might be interested in getting into the act on these studies, as far as just expressing themselves? There are some very fundamental changes in the wind and I would think that anyone    11/16/82  within the System who had intelligent input to offer should be encouraged I think we ought to hear the Reserve Bank points of view as well as those of the [Board] staff  In looking ahead, I think it's important to keep in mind several fundamentals I don't think any economist I have heard from or read about really equates this recovery with other recoveries from troughs in economic activity in recent times People are almost unanimous in anticipating that the fourth quarter of this year, which is the time we're speaking of right now, will be essentially flat and that there might be, and hopefully will be, some pickup going into next year, with maybe 2 percent real GNP growth at  -18-    11/16/82  best in the first half of next year Some of us get exceptionally gloomy when we don't see the dramatic increase that has characterized previous recoveries Just last week we had the chief financial officers of the largest companies in our area in for lunch What many of you have reported was indicative of their points of view They did recognize a rebound in home building and home-buying activity, but it was essentially in higher priced properties The one significant hint of meaningful improvement came in the retail area where two large national retail firms, and another, said that they were sensing what they thought was an improvement that they hoped would carry over into Christmas as a significant improvement But I think it's important when we get around to making policy that we not react in an inflationary manner to a gradually improving probability because I don't think there is any way that we will get the sort of dramatic upswing that has occurred in the past without fueling the [inflationary] engines to an extreme But we saw glimmers of improvement among the contacts we had in the Eighth District  Well, I see this somewhat differently from Frank First of all, I would ask Steve a question because I may be analyzing this incorrectly One of the reasons for shifting our emphasis or attention away from M1 was to accommodate the distortions that the all savers certificates and other instruments might be causing as the all savers certificates [matured] If we have the M1 growth that is implied in any one of these three alternatives and if we project that growth from the present time, aren't we in effect projecting 5 percent in the case of alternative C, or 6-1/2 or 8-1/2 percent from a base that includes the all savers certificates where they are now? In    11/16/82  other words, don't we in effect validate that bulge that is a result of the all savers certificates termination? Don't we take off from that higher level and doesn't that give us for the year growth in that aggregate that is way above the--  I'm talking about 1983, yes What I'm trying to say, and I guess I'm saying it in a very clumsy fashion, is that I would feel no discomfort with 6-1/2 or 5 percent growth from October to December if that growth were after the effects of the all savers certificates have washed out  I think we're really moving from an inflated M1 because of its all savers component; if we put in a 5 or 6-1/2 percent growth rate above that, we're really getting a much higher rate of growth relative to our original targets than we had originally contemplated I don't know that I'm asking quite--  Well, I would see the effects of this on interest rates differently from the way Ed Boehne and Frank Morris perceive them to be Regardless of what we know about the behavior of the aggregates, there are a lot of people out there doing a lot of figuring And if money--whether it's M2 and M1 or a combination of these various Ms--continues to grow at anything like the rate it is growing presently, even though that money growth is authorized as a means of achieving lower short-term interest rates, I believe the opposite is going to occur, and I think it will occur very quickly In other words, we will start to get articles and a reaction that will boost rates rather quickly in the belief that we will reinflate Frank, I don't think we can turn this inflation [fight] off and on in any orderly way; people are still skeptical as the devil as to whether we are going to hang in there and keep our anti-inflationary posture If we have three months or four months of really fast money growth, I think we will see these rates skyrocket instead of coming down  Do you have any uneasiness or any fear that if the markets perceive the aggregates to be growing [rapidly], the movement in interest rates would be upward instead of downward? Is that a [concern] that should be factored into our decisionmaking?  It does take a little while, though, for the recognition of the change to sink in  If you count four or five months into the future, I'll be fishing and you all will still be wrestling with this But let's assume that by forcing rates down a little you do achieve an improvement in the economy and this stimulus starts causing interest rates to rise next spring as this long-sought recovery is reaching meaningful proportions Yet money has grown so quickly that the prospect of inflation is heightened Are you all going to be willing to apply the brakes at the time? If you don't apply the brakes at that time, we're going to be right back into double-digit inflation rates in a few years  Mr Chairman, may I just ask one question? Do we accept that the ground rules for this meeting are that we don't discuss even with our senior economists what we have done?  I don't mean to be a broken record, but I think it's important that we have uniformity in what we say or do not say to our own immediate, fairly eminent, associates such as research directors Are we all going to talk about the--  I think we have a potential problem, though, with our economists, some of whom are rather like prima donnas who have their noses out of joint by being expelled--correctly, I agree with you--from this meeting And unless there is some agreed upon way of handling that, one of those fellows will go and tell somebody that the gag rule is on I'm not disagreeing, Paul, with anything you have said, but I'd just like to get some agreement on this  If you do this, you'll deprive a lot of retired Federal Reserve people of a very important source of income, Mr Chairman, trying to figure out what you folks are doing!   Our District experienced significant strength in new home sales in November, and automobile sales seem to be improving Retail sales are up on average 6 to 6-1/2 percent But as Ed Boehne mentioned, the heavy equipment industries are in bad shape  I think I'm going to miss you The only way I'll ever be able to get my blood pressure up is to go back to arguing with my wife again! The impression I got from the paper that Steve and his associates put together--and I certainly can't add anything to it--is that all of these targets are flawed in one or more ways and that perhaps M1 presents fewer problems than the others I was tempted to conclude after reading that paper that there really may be no way to do the job with any certainty Maybe we ought to look at a lot of things and not concentrate on any one target, as some of us are quoted as saying But I'm not sure that that will work In the last few months we have looked at a lot of things; and although the M1 figures that we're seeing may be meaningless, that 16 percent growth over a quarter is disturbing to a lot of people  It seems to me that we have two primary objectives in this Committee One is to achieve as low as possible a level of inflation, and I think we should get very good marks for having achieved that, which incidently we achieved by a consistent lowering of M1; the other and probably the more immediate concern at this moment is to try to achieve an improvement in economic conditions As I see it, the worst thing that could impede our desire to improve the economy domestically and our hope for improved international economic conditions would be for interest rates to climb rather dramatically--if we had a significant backup in interest rates, at least at the long-term end, which I think is perhaps the most important ingredient in the market's perception of what we are doing  From the few people I've talked to, I sense a nervousness among some market participants in reflection of the problems that they know we face and in our statement that we would have to, for very understandable reasons, pull away from M1 [as a target] for a while    12/20-21/82  The question on the minds of those that I've talked to is Is this going to be temporary or is it going to be permanent? Rightly or wrongly the markets and the public generally have come to look at M1 as something that is important And if we're going to reject M1, it's going to have to be done in a very convincing way because that is the measure that an awful lot of people look at I would endorse what Bob Black said in that I think that it's terribly important, though I don't how to do it, to emphasize that we have very serious intentions of coming back at some time to M1 I would like to see our 6-month projections include some M1 figure, maybe with a much broader band, say, 5 or 6 points But that would at least give credence to the fact that we are not dropping M1 and that we really have something with which we're steering this ship I don't think we can say--and certainly nobody at this table would want to--that because this problem is so complicated we're just going to run our business by the seat of our pants, because that isn't going to be satisfactory and it isn't going to be productive This has nothing to do with theology I would hope, just for the sake of market perception, that some credence is given to M1 and that the Chairman will make a very strong statement that for the immediate future M1 is seriously flawed but that it does have certain long-term advantages not shared by most of the other possible targets I hope we will say that we have not forgotten M1, because once the markets think we are in effect closing our eyes because we're overpowered by this complex set of circumstances, I think we're in for real trouble I would just point out in closing that when the NOW account situation presented itself to us, as I recall, we really overreacted to the complication and the [duration] of the complication due to NOW accounts; that settled itself after a relatively short period of time and we were able to adjust I think we ought not to abandon M1 totally  Well, we were able to drop the adjusted M1, Frank, after less than a year And according to the analysis our research department did, had we targeted on unadjusted M1 and never had that adjustment we would have had a relatively pretty result that year  Well, of course, Frank, we have the capability of making our target, whatever it is, perform as we want it to through our open market operations and other techniques So, if it didn't perform in accordance with our desires, it may be that we didn't lean on it to the extent that we should have, but anyhow--  You pointed out in a very persuasive way at the last meeting that it was a matter of choosing risks, and I would agree with you But I fall out with some of this reasoning in that I believe that if the markets get the impression money is growing too  -22-    12/20-21/82  quickly, interest rates are going to shoot up and we're going to be faced with--  Well, we may be between a rock and a hard place  How would what you just described really differ from the 1977 to 1979 eclectic/pragmatic approach? I don't ask this in a critical vein, but does this all add up to conducting policy as we did prior to the need for shifting gears in 1979? Are we, in effect, going back to looking at a whole lot of things and using our intuition?  But it does have a reinflationary potential, doesn't it? Again, I'm not being critical, but isn't this fraught with danger in that regard?  Jerry, how would you control it?  Why do you reject alternative C or three?   Wouldn't that mean, Steve, if the Super NOWs don't take off, that Ml adjusted would be a more reliable target than either M2 or M3?
