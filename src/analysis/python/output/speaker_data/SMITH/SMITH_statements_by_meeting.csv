5570,2005-03-22," I’m reading from page 25 of the Bluebook  The wording would be “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing   the federal funds rate to an average of around 2¾ percent”   And then B modified is “The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy   action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability   should be kept roughly equal With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee   believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured    Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its   obligation to maintain price stability”  "
