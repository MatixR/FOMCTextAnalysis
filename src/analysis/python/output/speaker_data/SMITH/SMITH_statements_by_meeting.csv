6860,2001-08-21," Yes, the proposed language is shown, with strike-outs indicating   changes from the previous statement  "
7360,2003-08-12,"  I should just let you know that the media people know exactly when each   FOMC meeting begins  We’d have to explain to them that the meeting started at 730 am and   give them some reason for that  Otherwise we could see some excitement out front    We announce when the meeting begins Typically the media people wait   on the phone until 900 am, and someone from our office scurries back to the phone and says   the meeting began at 900 am   August 12, 2003 96 of 110     We would tell them it started at 902 am    As sort of an intermeeting meeting?    We haven’t had to face that  [Laughter]   SPEAKER(?)  Good answer    We don’t commit to having the statement out at 215 pm  It has just been   our practice to release it then    Right    I gave you a bit of a legalistic interpretation  These people will get a little   crazy if they don’t hear something from us around the usual time  "
7405,2003-09-16,"  Okay  “Nonetheless, members recognize that going forward they could   consider changes that might improve the Committee’s communication of its assessment of the   economic situation”      “May”?    “Nonetheless, members recognize that going forward they may from time   to time consider changes that might improve the Committee’s communication of its assessment   of the economic situation”  "
7483,2004-01-27,"  I can get other copies That one is for you    Governor Bernanke in his ABA speech raised the possibility of increasing   the frequency and the time period  I don’t believe that people expected you to make a decision   about that at this meeting, but we may get some questions about that  It would be a good idea for   you to give me some guidance    I think if we did announce that you were conducting a parallel test, you   would be forced to release the minutes early    I would recommend that the Committee not say anything about parallel   testing and give yourselves an opportunity to see how that process works  You could then   choose whether or not to make a comment    I don’t believe so  I think you all will experience some pressure from the   media and the public  And I think this issue will come up in the Chairman’s Monetary Policy   Report testimony  Reporters in the last week were saying that they expect some announcement   at this meeting on the conclusion of your efforts in this area  So I don’t think we have that   luxury  "
7715,2005-03-22," I’m reading from page 25 of the Bluebook  The wording would be “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing   the federal funds rate to an average of around 2¾ percent”   And then B modified is “The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy   action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability   should be kept roughly equal With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee   believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured    Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its   obligation to maintain price stability”                                  Chairman Greenspan  Yes   Vice Chairman Geithner Yes   Governor Bernanke Yes   Governor Bies Yes   Governor Ferguson Yes   Governor Gramlich Yes   President Guynn Yes   Governor Kohn Yes   President Moskow Yes                                            March 22, 2005 103 of 116    Governor Olson Yes   President Santomero Yes   President Stern Yes        "
7957,2006-06-28,  We can insert it  
7982,2006-08-08," Yes The directive would be, “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks   monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth   in output To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks   August 8, 2006 114 of 158                              conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of   around 5¼ percent”   Then the risk assessment is, “Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks   remain  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these   risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as   implied by incoming information”   Chairman Bernanke          Yes   Vice Chairman Geithner       Yes   Governor Bies Yes   President Guynn Yes   Governor Kohn Yes   Governor Kroszner Yes   President Lacker No   President Pianalto Yes   Governor Warsh Yes   President Yellen Yes   "
8152,2007-06-27,"  I will be reading the directive from page 29 of the Bluebook  “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster   price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run   objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets   consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5¼ percent”   And the risk assessment “In these circumstances, the Committee’s predominant   policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  Future   policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and   economic growth, as implied by incoming information”   Chairman Bernanke Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  President Hoenig  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  Governor Kroszner  Yes  President Minehan  Yes  Governor Mishkin  Yes  President Moskow  Yes  President Poole  Yes  Governor Warsh  Yes    "
8177,2007-08-07,  He’s coming  
8254,2007-10-30,  It was not changed from what you received  I have extra copies if you need   one  
8511,2008-08-05,  We can be pretty flexible  We’re okay    
8988,2010-05-09,"  Sure  I had a few sort of unorganized thoughts about this  One thing that I   think would be important is that our announcement should follow Ecofin’s announcement, and   that it should be as international as possible—so it would be the Federal Reserve, the Bank of   May 9, 2010 20 of 42             Japan, the Bank of Canada, and so on  In other words, it should be some sort of broader G-7   effort   I would also make a few other points  This is safe—we have never lost a penny, either in   the recent crisis experience or in the ongoing swap situations we’ve had with Mexico and   Canada  This is not novel—this is what central banks do  It is not a bailout, it’s not altruism—  this is in our interest  We have a recovery just getting going here in the United States, and this   helps keep European problems—and we wouldn’t say this in a statement—in Europe    I have a question about whether there’s anything new we can do on transparency in this   arena  If we could somehow say that we’re doing this in some newer, more transparent, quicker   way, I think that would help us to mitigate some of the political risk  I don’t know if we can do   that, but if we could, I think that would be helpful    The thing I would really try to underscore is that what the central banks are   doing is not a response to Europe’s problems  Europe’s problems are being responded to with   real measures in Europe  What we’re doing is helping to facilitate—structural plumbing, flows,   and so on—and protecting ourselves and our interests  So I’d emphasize that this isn’t about the   Fed responding, doing a bailout, or anything like that   May 9, 2010 21 of 42              I would say that it would be better if we could release those  You saw the   kinds of things that members of the Congress said in some of the hearings  Anything that we’re   keeping secret is just going to fuel their speculation    We’ll answer that question if we get it  "
9013,2010-06-22,"  Yes, got it  "
9040,2010-08-10,  Got it  
9106,2010-11-02,"  Right  I just wanted to remind people that you pull these projections   together four times a year  In the winter and in the summer, the Chairman goes and presents the   November 2–3, 2010 15 of 238             Monetary Policy Report to the Congress with these projections  So the press conferences would   be in the fall and the spring  "
9160,2011-01-25,"  Can I just make a comment?    From a communications perspective, I really think that’s a mistake    Yes    I think we’ve taught market participants to take every word of this   statement seriously  And I think it conveys a policy judgment that you all didn’t make  So I’m   comfortable that what is on the New York Fed website, as explained to me, has made this point    I’m afraid that if you do this, it’s hard for us to explain that it really doesn’t mean much,   particularly if you want to use it later to fine-tune  Now this signifies nothing, but later it may   signify something important  So I think you want to hold that in reserve until you are really   communicating something important  "
9185,2011-03-15,"  If you’ve got something really important to say, an ad hoc press conference   will certainly get the attention of people you are trying to communicate with  [Laughter]   The   bar is high for an ad hoc sort of gathering  Logistically, it’s possible, if there’s nothing that   makes it impossible  So you could do it  The New York Fed would probably say that   predictability of these sorts of things for market participants is preferred    Certainly    It might be helpful to mention that there are two basic models   internationally  There is the Bank of England/Bank of Canada model that has these sorts of   things four times a year that happen with the release of their projections or their inflation report    Then you have the ECB/Bank of Japan model, which is basically every meeting no matter what   gets announced and on the same day   I think what has come out of this is more of a hybrid approach  Not every time the   Committee meets are you doing something that the world isn’t prepared to accept and to   understand  Sometimes it is  Sometimes it’s more jarring; it needs some explaining  I think one   vulnerability here was exactly Narayana’s point, that you could have an important meeting at a   time that doesn’t sync up well with your quarterly plan, in which case you could improvise  You   could decide to have the Chairman give a speech the next day or two days later and, really, we   could pull that together  That is certainly possible  What you did back in the fall when you   decided to embark on LSAPs was the Chairman had an op-ed in the Washington Post the next   day  You could improvise to get your message out on those times, but we are blazing a hybrid   path between what the world central banks have got going    Yes, we could  Our intent would be to have this webcasted live  It would   be covered live, and we would have redundancy on the transcript  We have had brief   conversations with the FOMC Secretariat about having the transcription service that puts the   meeting transcript together also do that  And our experience is that almost every time the   Chairman is out in public, a transcript gets produced by the news services quickly, sometimes   very quickly  I e-mail it to you all pretty frequently  Sometimes it has got some slight spelling   errors in it, but we would clean that up and get it to you very quickly, and you would have a   video  The video of the entire event would live on our website    As people probably know, the ECB issues a very terse statement  Their   policy statement is about one sentence long and just says what the council did  Then in Trichet’s   remarks at the press briefing, he does what you all do in your statement  So, again, it’s a little bit   of a hybrid    I’m happy to take any and all questions    Correct    The end of the workweek  Through Friday    I think so    Can I mention something about that?  I would not recommend that we tout   the end of our blackout period one day sooner as a dramatic increase in transparency  It’s really   just a practice that you all have adopted over the years; it’s not a hard rule  So you might get   laughed at    I might get laughed at  [Laughter]  "
9286,2011-08-09,  I can get you copies4    Yes  It would help if you would read me the last paragraph of A    Yes
