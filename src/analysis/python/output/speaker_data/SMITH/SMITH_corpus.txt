 Yes, the proposed language is shown, with strike-outs indicating   changes from the previous statement     I should just let you know that the media people know exactly when each   FOMC meeting begins  We’d have to explain to them that the meeting started at 730 am and   give them some reason for that  Otherwise we could see some excitement out front     We announce when the meeting begins Typically the media people wait   on the phone until 900 am, and someone from our office scurries back to the phone and says   the meeting began at 900 am   August 12, 2003 96 of 110      We would tell them it started at 902 am     As sort of an intermeeting meeting?     We haven’t had to face that  [Laughter]   SPEAKER(?)  Good answer     We don’t commit to having the statement out at 215 pm  It has just been   our practice to release it then     Right     I gave you a bit of a legalistic interpretation  These people will get a little   crazy if they don’t hear something from us around the usual time     Okay  “Nonetheless, members recognize that going forward they could   consider changes that might improve the Committee’s communication of its assessment of the   economic situation”       “May”?     “Nonetheless, members recognize that going forward they may from time   to time consider changes that might improve the Committee’s communication of its assessment   of the economic situation”     I can get other copies That one is for you     Governor Bernanke in his ABA speech raised the possibility of increasing   the frequency and the time period  I don’t believe that people expected you to make a decision   about that at this meeting, but we may get some questions about that  It would be a good idea for   you to give me some guidance     I think if we did announce that you were conducting a parallel test, you   would be forced to release the minutes early     I would recommend that the Committee not say anything about parallel   testing and give yourselves an opportunity to see how that process works  You could then   choose whether or not to make a comment     I don’t believe so  I think you all will experience some pressure from the   media and the public  And I think this issue will come up in the Chairman’s Monetary Policy   Report testimony  Reporters in the last week were saying that they expect some announcement   at this meeting on the conclusion of your efforts in this area  So I don’t think we have that   luxury                                   Chairman Greenspan  Yes   Vice Chairman Geithner Yes   Governor Bernanke Yes   Governor Bies Yes   Governor Ferguson Yes   Governor Gramlich Yes   President Guynn Yes   Governor Kohn Yes   President Moskow Yes                                            March 22, 2005 103 of 116    Governor Olson Yes   President Santomero Yes   President Stern Yes          I’m reading from page 25 of the Bluebook  The wording would be “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing   the federal funds rate to an average of around 2¾ percent”   And then B modified is “The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy   action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability   should be kept roughly equal With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee   believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured    Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its   obligation to maintain price stability”
