 Yes Thank you, Mr Chairman  In response to the  wishes of the Committee for a discussion of productivity developments, the  staff will be presenting three briefings this afternoon  Sandy Struckmeyer  and I will discuss the staff’s view on structural productivity and potential  output Jeff Fuhrer will present the perspective of the Federal Reserve Bank  of Boston, and Charlie Steindel will discuss the productivity slowdown of the     6/26-27/01 7   late 1960s and early 1970s  We will be referring to the materials labeled  “Staff Briefings on Productivity Developments”2   The performance of the US economy in the second half of the 1990s was  nothing short of remarkable  One of the key factors driving this economic  resurgence was the substantial acceleration in labor productivity, following  nearly a quarter century of sluggish growth  As can be seen in the upper left  panel of chart 1, the average growth rate of labor productivity picked up from  15 percent in the period from the early 1970s through 1995 to 28 percent  since then As seen at the right, the growth rate of labor productivity has  tended to rise since 1995, although more recently it has dropped back as the  economy has slowed and as a retrenchment has taken hold in the tech sector   This briefing reviews what we know about the causes of the resurgence in the  second half of the 1990s and, given the most recent developments, assesses  how much of that pickup is likely to persist      As highlighted by the bullets in the lower panel, we first explore the  sources of the pickup, examining how much resulted from more rapid capital  accumulation and how much from a quickening of the pace of technological  progress We focus particularly on the role played by information  technology To assess the sources of the pickup, we use a traditional growth  accounting framework, relying primarily on the multifactor productivity data  produced by the BLS Following that discussion, we then turn to the question  of how much of the recent productivity growth is cyclical and how much is  structural Finally, given today’s economic situation, we discuss the outlook  for structural labor productivity and potential output      The upper panel of chart 2 lays out a simplified version of the standard  neoclassical growth accounting framework that we use--a framework that was  developed by Robert Solow and Edward Denison in the 1950s and 1960s  As  shown in equation 1--where dots over variables indicate growth rates--this  approach expresses growth in output (designated Q) as a weighted average of  the growth rates of the inputs The two inputs included in the equation are  capital services (labeled K) and labor hours (shown as L)  In this expression,  the growth rate of each input is multiplied by its income share--denoted by s  for the income share of capital and (1-s) for labor’s share  The portion of  output growth not attributable to growth in inputs is the multifactor  productivity residual (labeled MFP); it also has been called total factor  productivity It is a catch-all for technological or organizational  improvements that increase output for a given amount of input        Equation 2 decomposes growth in labor productivity (labeled LP)  In  this decomposition, growth in labor productivity reflects increases in the  amount of capital per hour worked (referred to as capital deepening) and MFP   2 Copies of this material are appended to this transcript  (Appendix 2)     6/26-27/01 8   growth In our empirical implementation of these equations, we also include  a term that accounts for changes in labor composition; that is, for the effects  of changes in the experience, gender, and educational attainment of the  workforce—factors that might affect labor productivity       Before getting to the numbers, the lower panel lays out some of the key  strengths and weaknesses of the growth accounting framework  One strength  of the growth accounting approach is that it is based on the microeconomic  theory of the firm, applied to the overall economy  In addition, the approach  is straightforward and intuitive, representing output growth as a simple  weighted average of the growth of inputs  And, it is a rich approach that can  help to identify the sources of growth in a period of structural change       A weakness of the growth accounting approach is that it requires several  strong assumptions about how the economy functions  For example, the  approach assumes that markets are competitive and always in equilibrium  In  addition, as typically implemented, the growth accounting approach assumes  that capital becomes productive as soon as it is installed  This assumption  seems reasonable for some types of assets, such as personal computers, but  probably is not reasonable for certain types of complex infrastructure--such as  communications networks--where elements put in place now may not be  brought on line for a number of years Also, a full implementation of this  framework imposes heavy data requirements, raising the possibility of  measurement error  Finally, this approach ignores the costs of adjusting  capital stocks For small changes, this assumption probably does not matter  much, but supply shocks that induce significant changes in production  technologies or relative prices--such as large energy price shocks--may cause  the model to go off track  Despite these limitations, this framework has been  a mainstay of growth analysis for many years, reflecting the widespread view  that it generates numbers that are sensible       Our empirical implementation of growth accounting is the subject of  your next chart  We start with the multifactor productivity data set put  together by the BLS, focusing on the nonfarm business sector  The output  measure--which is based on the National Income and Product Accounts--is  real GDP in the nonfarm business sector, and the measure of labor hours is  based on the series for hours of all persons published by the BLS For  capital, BLS uses the concept of capital services, which I will describe in a  minute  As indicated in the second bullet, the BLS uses these measures of  output, capital, labor, and labor composition to calculate MFP as a residual  using a growth accounting framework similar to equation 1       Currently, BLS has published MFP only through 1999  To extend these  data to 2000, we use published information on output and hours, and we  construct a figure for capital services using published data on investment   Because we translate investment to capital services at a higher level of     6/26-27/01 9   aggregation than will the BLS when they estimate MFP for 2000, there is an  extra element of uncertainty surrounding our numbers for 2000  To generate  quarterly numbers that can tie into our Greenbook forecast, we then  interpolate the BLS annual numbers for output, hours, capital services, and  labor composition  From these numbers, we calculate quarterly estimates of  MFP growth      The middle panel describes the capital services concept used by the BLS   Growth in capital services (denoted by Kt) is a weighted average of the  growth in individual capital stocks  These individual stocks are denoted Kit,  where the subscript i indexes the different types of capital  The weight for  each asset (the “w”s) reflects the marginal product, or relative efficiency, of a  particular asset The weights differ primarily because of differences in the  useful lives of each asset For example, a unit of computer capital has a short  useful life and likely will be scrapped after only a few years  Because the  cost of the computer is amortized over a very short period of time, it has a  high marginal product and gets a high weight  In effect, the service flow  from a unit of this capital must be large enough to cover the costs of rapid  obsolescence In contrast, a unit of office building capital--which has quite a  long useful life--generates a smaller service flow in a year and gets a smaller  weight because the costs of the asset can be amortized over many years       Using the growth-accounting framework and the data I just described,  the lower panel decomposes the growth of actual labor productivity growth  for selected periods The decomposition shown is quite similar to that  reported in a series of research papers, including work by Steve Oliner and  myself and by Dale Jorgenson and Kevin Stiroh The first two columns  compare the period of relatively sluggish productivity growth from 1973 to  1995 to the resurgence period from 1995 to 2000; the third column shows the  acceleration between the two periods  As can be seen on line 1, the rate of  increase in actual labor productivity rose from 15 percent per year to 28  percent per year--an acceleration of 13 percentage points  This pickup  reflected larger contributions from capital deepening (line 2), which stepped  up 05 percentage point per year MFP growth (line 6) accounted for the rest  of the pickup By these numbers, capital deepening accounted for a bit less  than half of the pickup in labor productivity growth      Because of our interest in information technology, we extend the system  to split the capital deepening term into the portion related to IT capital-­ including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment--and  to all other business capital And, we also split MFP growth into the portion  coming from the production of computers and related semiconductors and the  portion coming from all other sectors  To do this, we use information on  relative prices and shares of these high-tech products to estimate the MFP  contribution related to their production     6/26-27/01 10         As can be seen by comparing lines 2 and 3, greater use of IT equipment  and software more than accounted for the rise in capital deepening   Moreover, MFP growth arising from the production of computers and the  semiconductors that go into them (line 7) accounted for a noticeable chunk of  the step-up in MFP growth, even though these sectors represent a small share  of total output Taken together, the use of IT--represented by the IT capital  deepening numbers on line 3--and the MFP gains associated with the  production of IT (shown on line 7) accounted for 1 percentage point of the  13 percentage point resurgence in labor productivity growth in the second  half of the 1990s          Some analysts, most notably Robert Gordon, have argued that the pickup  in MFP growth was concentrated in the production of IT, and, indeed, those  sectors made a sizable contribution to the step-up in MFP growth  However,  as line 8 indicates, the sectors outside of the production of IT contributed 04  percentage point more to MFP growth in the second part of the decade than in  the first Although some portion of this pickup likely was cyclical, these  numbers indicate that this broader sector of the economy also enjoyed a  resurgence of actual MFP growth from 1995 to 2000           Sandy Struckmeyer will now continue our presentation    Mr Chairman, let me add one thing on the income-side numbers  In   addition to the material we presented, we have done this analysis using the gross domestic   income data  I can tell you what that would produce for Chart 3, which shows that labor   productivity growth picked up from 15 percent in the earlier 1973-95 period to 28 percent in   1995-2000 period, for a pickup of 13 percentage points  If we rerun that using gross domestic   income, the pickup would be about 03 percentage point more  So, as the Chairman said, there   may be some preference for the product side but it wouldn’t be that strong  If one went to the   income side, there would be a bit more of a pickup in multifactor productivity to explain  Indeed,   the Council of Economic Advisers in the way that they do these decompositions in their analysis   will typically average the income side and the product side in looking at the numbers, taking a   very agnostic view as to which is more correct    Let me start  Indeed, the standard growth accounting approach doesn't   take account of adjustment costs  The usual argument for that and why it evolved that way is that   originally the approach was used for looking at growth over very long periods--looking at one   twenty-year segment compared to another twenty-year segment  And over such long periods of   time it's presumably a reasonable assumption to say that the economy within that period   converged to an equilibrium and any adjustment costs have worn off  When one takes the   analysis to a higher frequency and starts to look at developments year by year, then indeed the        6/26-27/01 34   possibility that adjustment costs would matter more becomes more important  Certainly in   periods like the early ’70s and the late ’70s there were large adjustment costs associated with the   oil price shocks that the standard approach doesn't deal with well  Accordingly, the standard   approach was not terribly useful for understanding those periods    As for the Fernald paper, I found that paper very provocative  I think, as you said, that   theoretically it makes sense to consider adjustment costs, and the framework in Fernald’s paper   seems to be the right one  I believe he did the best job anyone can do in an effort to estimate how   large those adjustment costs are  But it is a very challenging task to parse out how much is   adjustment cost  When a firm is adjusting its capital stock it is difficult to determine how much   involves an adjustment to its desired stock today as compared with how much involves building a   telecom infrastructure, say, that is put in place today but won't become productive for a long   time  That “time to build” phenomenon--or the lag between the investment and when the actual   productive impact is felt--can be difficult to separate from the adjustment costs  So, I think that   paper does the best job that can be done, but the task is very challenging    May I make just a brief comment?  There’s a very interesting paper by   Eric Brynjolfsson and Loren Hitt in last fall’s Journal of Economic Perspectives that provides   some very nice evidence on the importance of organizational improvements  Also, on the   adjustment costs point that Presidents Parry and Minehan mentioned, I didn’t mean to suggest   that a zero adjustment is appropriate just because we do it that way  That is only a baseline  It’s   a very simple, transparent framework that people understand  I think, as you suggested, that   adjustment costs are a very important issue, and the work that John Fernald did is an important   first step in thinking about that  It is something that I think we need to continue to focus on    Hence, the reason I mentioned it as one of the weaknesses of the approach as we implement it    Three to five years, depending on the type of software   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  labeled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”  The incoming data largely  have ratified the bleak near-term outlook we projected in the December Greenbook;  the spending data have painted a gloomy picture, and readings on employment and  production were even weaker than we had expected  Starting first with the  employment data, the top left panel of exhibit 1 shows the dramatic worsening of the  labor market in recent months  Private payrolls declined almost 520,000 per month  on average in the fourth quarter The panel to the right shows manufacturing  industrial production excluding motor vehicles  Factory output has been plummeting  as manufacturers are responding aggressively to declines in both domestic and  foreign demand The motor vehicle sector has been hit particularly hard  With  extremely sluggish sales, automakers have been slashing production—plotted in the  middle left panel—and we anticipate a sizable further reduction in assemblies this  quarter   Turning to households, the latest data confirm that consumers continue to  retrench As shown by the blue bars, real PCE for goods other than motor vehicles  appears headed for a very large drop in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate a further  decline this quarter These projections are similar to those in the last Greenbook  In  the housing sector, starts (the black line in the bottom left panel) declined further last  month and now are less than one-quarter of their peak level in 2006  With the level  of permits (the red line) still below starts, we expect further declines in starts in the  next few months  All told, as shown to the right, we project that real GDP contracted  at an annual rate of about 5 percent last quarter  Given the greater weakness in the  employment and production data, we have lowered our forecast for the first-quarter  change in real GDP to minus 5½ percent In the second quarter, the rate of decline in  real GDP moderates as the new fiscal package—discussed more in a minute—boosts  demand   The top left panel of exhibit 2 summarizes the medium-term outlook for real  activity  We anticipate that recovery will begin, albeit slowly, in the second half of  this year, with real GDP projected to increase at an annual rate of about 2 percent;  next year, output is expected to rise about 2½ percent  The box to the right lists key  factors contributing to the onset of recovery  Financial stress begins to recede,  housing begins to stabilize, monetary and fiscal stimulus provide a boost to demand,  and inventory liquidation comes to an end  Regarding fiscal stimulus, although the  precise composition of what will be passed remains a moving target, we now assume  a package of $800 billion, $300 billion more than what we penciled into the  December Greenbook  The larger size of the package is an important source of our  slightly stronger outlook for economic growth than in the last Greenbook  The bullets  in the middle left panel highlight our estimates of the response to the various  provisions of the plan Households begin spending the tax cuts of $180 billion and  transfers of $90 billion when received  On the other hand, we expect the investment  response to the business tax cuts to be limited  In addition, of the total new funding  for state and local governments, we project that only 40 percent will be spent by the                          January 27–28, 2009 86 of 267  end of 2010 as infrastructure projects take some time to get under way and as the  spending of other grants is smoothed out somewhat     The panel to the right puts the pieces together  We estimate that the fiscal  package will boost real GDP growth by a bit less than 1½ percentage points this year  and almost 1 percentage point next year  Our estimates of the GDP effects are  smaller than those of some other analysts, with the discrepancy mostly reflecting our  assumption of slower spend-out rates by state and local governments  Inventory  dynamics—the subject of the bottom panels—are another element importantly  shaping the recession and recovery  The table in the bottom left reports the  contributions of inventories to real GDP growth in key periods over the business  cycle The first column shows the contributions in the current episode, and the  second column shows averages for the postwar period  As can be seen on line 1, in  the year before the peak in real GDP in 2008Q2, inventories were already being  liquidated aggressively, in contrast to the usual positive contribution  As shown on  line 2 of the table, from the peak to the trough, inventories hold down real GDP  growth only a little Because inventory liquidation was already quite rapid before the  peak, once the contraction in sales got under way, the rate of liquidation needed to  steepen only a bit more  In contrast, during many past episodes, the drag from  inventories was much larger as manufacturers had to play catch-up once sales turned  down In the year after the trough (line 3 of the table) liquidation comes to an end,  and the swing in inventories boosts real GDP growth 1 percentage point, about in line  with historical averages  This increase in the inventory contribution is an important  feature of the projected recovery in real GDP  Karen will now discuss developments  shaping the outlook for households and businesses    The top left panel of exhibit 7 provides some longer-term context  for the deep recession and sluggish recovery that we are projecting  The red line  shows the level of real GDP, indexed to its own peak in the second quarter of last  year By way of comparison, the green and blue lines show the paths of real GDP  during the recessions that started in 1973 and 1981, respectively  As noted to the  right, the projected contraction in real GDP in the current episode is broadly in line  with those two earlier big postwar recessions, but the projected recovery is noticeably  more sluggish In part, this pattern reflects the influence of financial turmoil on the  macroeconomy   Gauging the hit to the economy from the recent financial stress is, to put it  mildly, an inexact science  One benchmark is the typical pattern experienced by  economies during and after the onset of financial crises  As noted in the bullets in the  middle left panel, research on this topic—most notably the work by Carmen Reinhart  and Ken Rogoff—indicates that downturns linked to major financial crises in                January 27–28, 2009 90 of 267  advanced economies tend to be severe  Reinhart and Rogoff identify five major  financial crises in advanced economies in the postwar period; these include Spain in  1977, Norway in 1987, Finland and Sweden in 1991, and Japan in 1992  The panel to  the right shows one possible metric for gauging the magnitude of output loss in these  episodes The first blue bar shows average growth in real GDP in these five countries  during the four years prior to the crisis  The red bar shows average growth in the  worst two consecutive years after the onset of the crisis  The average step-down in  real GDP growth after these financial crises was about 5 percentage points  The  right-hand side of the bar chart shows figures for the current episode in the United  States The blue bar shows average growth in the four years before 2007, the date  used as the onset of the crisis The red bar shows our projection for average growth  in the worst two years following the onset, 2008 and 2009  On this metric, we are  projecting a pattern similar to, though not as severe, as these other episodes  Still, we  see the evidence from past financial crises as suggesting that the risks to activity are  tilted to the downside   The bottom three panels highlight the alternative simulation in the Greenbook that  explores that possibility As you know, in the baseline forecast we anticipate that  financial market strains will gradually wane over the next two years  In contrast, in  the “more financial stress” scenario, we assume that risk premiums on a variety of  securities move up significantly from their current levels and then come down more  slowly than in the baseline As shown to the left, real GDP in this scenario contracts  considerably in 2009 and increases only a little in 2010  The unemployment rate (the  middle panel) peaks at 9¼ percent, and core inflation (the panel on the right) moves  below zero   The top panels of exhibit 8 examine the cyclical properties of labor productivity,  plotting the level around the staff’s estimate of trend  As noted in the first bullet in  the middle left panel, in some earlier recessions—such as those that started in 1973  and in 1981—labor productivity was pro-cyclical  That is, labor productivity fell  below trend during the recession—likely reflecting some labor hoarding—and then  rose fairly quickly thereafter  During the 1990 recession this pattern was barely  evident, while it was not observed at all during the 2001 recession  In the current  episode, shown in the top right with a magnified scale, we expect that labor  productivity will exhibit a mild pro-cyclical pattern  With this recession anticipated  to be quite deep, we expect many businesses to find that deeper job cuts would  require shedding core personnel, leading to some labor hoarding in the near term   Later this year, firms in recovering sectors expand production without initially adding  to payrolls Accordingly, job losses in the private sector continue in the second half,  and the unemployment rate (the black line in the middle right panel) rises further   Given the additional near-term weakness in our outlook for activity, the  unemployment rate now is expected to peak at 8½ percent early next year, a bit  higher than in the last Greenbook This slack in resource utilization puts considerable  downward pressure on inflation  In addition, the sharp drop in energy prices (the  bottom left panel), along with declines in import and commodity prices, also restrains  our forecast of core inflation As shown to the right on line 3 in the table, we project                         January 27–28, 2009 91 of 267  that these factors will push core PCE inflation down to 1 percent this year and to  08 percent next year With the decline in energy prices, total PCE inflation (line 1)  dips a little below core this year but then rises a little above core next year as energy  prices increase a bit   Shifting gears, exhibit 9 reprises material from the pre-FOMC briefing that Bob  Tetlow delivered yesterday; it takes a closer look at an unconventional policy action  included as an alternative simulation in the Greenbook  As you know, in our baseline  scenario, the zero lower bound constraint on the federal funds rate is binding until  2013 This constraint partly explains our pessimistic baseline forecasts for  unemployment and inflation, which are shown as the black lines in the panels at the  top of the exhibit We can demonstrate the implications of the lower-bound  constraint for the economic outlook using an unconstrained optimal control  simulation, much like the one you saw in the December Bluebook, which would  prescribe lowering the funds rate to about negative 4¼ percent by the end of this year   The effects of such a monetary policy, if it were feasible, are shown by the green lines  in the panels As you can see in the top left panel, by 2011 the unemployment rate  would be more than 1 percentage point below the baseline path, and the top right  panel shows that inflation would be ¾ percentage point above baseline at that point   A large-scale asset purchase program—or LSAP program, for short—of  mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury securities is one of a variety of  the unconventional monetary policies that could, in principle, combat this problem   The efficacy of such a program depends on several assumptions, summarized in the  middle left panel  First, these assets must be imperfect substitutes for short-term  debt—an assumption most economists would find reasonable; otherwise, actions  intended to affect their returns could be undone through arbitrage with short-term  securities Second, Treasury bonds and MBS must remain good substitutes for other  types of long-term debt, as they are thought to be under normal conditions, so that  reductions in yields on the targeted securities spill over to other private interest rates   Third, movements in long-term rates should ideally continue to favorably influence  stock prices, the exchange rate, and other financial markets, thereby boosting the  program’s stimulative effect  As noted in the middle right panel, the LSAP program  we used for the alternative simulation assumes purchasing $500 billion in Treasury  securities as well as further purchases of $500 billion in agency MBS beyond those  already announced  These purchases are assumed to be carried out over the next year  and a half and are eventually unwound over 2012 and 2013  As indicated by the next  set of bullets, we assume that these purchases reduce various long-term interest rates  between 75 and 125 basis points over the next few months; these estimated effects are  consistent with the analysis in the notes completed in December that dealt with  various zero lower bound issues Using these estimates, the macroeconomic effects  of the program are shown by the red lines in the panels at the top  According to the  FRB/US model, the unemployment rate follows a path only modestly above the  theoretical unconstrained optimum, and inflation is closer to the unconstrained  trajectory Moreover, the federal funds rate (not shown) rises above the lower bound  at the beginning of 2012, one year earlier than in the baseline projection                                 January 27–28, 2009 92 of 267  The potential benefits of this particular LSAP program notwithstanding, some  important caveats are laid out in the bottom panel  On the financial end, the direct  interest rate effects of the program are highly uncertain, if only because we have so  little experience with this sort of program  Second, the current dysfunction in some  financial markets could limit the magnitude of indirect effects—that is, the spillovers  into markets other than those in which purchase activity takes place  Third, the size  of the program may be subject to economies—or dis-economies—of scale  Fourth,  LSAP programs, and unconventional policies more generally, introduce tricky “exit  issues” regarding how to unwind the program without disrupting markets, incurring  large losses on the Federal Reserve’s portfolio, or sparking a longer-run inflation  problem  Regarding macroeconomic issues, with credit availability so constrained at  the moment and uncertainty so high, the model may understate—or overstate—the  size of the response of consumption and investment to changes in financial conditions  of a given magnitude In addition, possible heavy reliance on mortgage rates and  housing to drive economic recovery entails some risks, particularly if spillovers from  mortgage rates into other asset prices are limited  All told, as this discussion makes  clear, some significant potential benefits and costs need to be weighed when  considering the possible implementation of large-scale asset purchase programs   Trevor will now continue the presentation    You could do these types of cyclical comparison charts either way, dating   from the NBER peak or dating from the series-specific peak  What is done here is to index to the   series-specific peak so that you look at each of the path cycles and say when GDP turned down   in that cycle In many cycles, that is the same as the NBER peak, but in some cycles it is not  In   this cycle, in particular, it came a couple of quarters later  You could do it the other way—in   which case you would see the red line rising first and then coming down  It is just a different   way of presenting the same information    Arguably, it really just comes down to that it is a different way of   presenting the same information  You get a cleaner comparison because every business cycle   has some unique features and the timing differs in some particular ways  This is trying to   abstract from those differences in timing  But one could do it the other way    So I share your pain [Laughter]  Regarding how we put this together, we   are not looking at any particular model  We are looking at a range of models and trying to make   the best judgment that we can about how the various forces that affect inflation are likely to   come into play over the next couple of years  In terms of frameworks, we look at some pretty   standard, backward-looking models that do not have any forward-looking components, just   traditional measures of resource slack  We also look at some forward-looking models in which           January 27–28, 2009 100 of 267  we incorporate various measures of inflation expectations to try to avail ourselves of the   information in some of the survey-based measures of inflation expectations that have a more   forward looking component   In terms of the factors that are particularly important for this contour, the very large   amount of resource slack shown in that picture as captured by the unemployment rate—although   one could measure that in many ways—is one important feature in the considerable slowdown of   inflation We think that a lot of slack will be putting downward pressure on wages and prices    Then we add to that the movements in energy and other commodities and materials prices and   the movements in import prices, which have all been quite dramatic recently in the direction of   pushing inflation down We think that all those things in terms of the forward-looking   component are also going to be weighing on inflation expectations and that, as businesses and   households in the economy see all of those factors and see headline inflation numbers coming   down, inflation expectations themselves will be coming down some  So we do the best we can   with a range of models and try to bring the best judgment we can, and this is where we land    To pick up on the business side of that first—we looked at the experience   from the 2002–04 business tax cuts, and our best reading of that was that we just did not see   much effect In terms of the empirical work that we did, we just don’t think that there is a big   kick there, perhaps particularly in a period when many businesses are in tough times and taking        January 27–28, 2009 103 of 267  losses It just may not be enough or the right kind of thing to get them to start investing  So our   reading of the evidence is that on the business side there just will not be much    I guess that channel would come through a user-cost effect on large   expenditures and so on pushing up interest rates and generating crowding-out through that sort of   a channel We do have a modest increase in Treasury rates in this forecast for a variety of   reasons, but we also have quite a dramatic decrease in, say, Baa bond rates and those spreads   coming in during this period, when we think, as the macro risk diminishes, we are going to see   some declines in credit spreads  I think that decline in credit spreads going forward is likely to   more than offset whatever forces there might be from the kind of expenditure-based crowding-  out   On the household side, we are looking at the proposed tax cuts as being permanent  We   are treating them as permanent tax cuts, so we are treating those the way that we would typically   treat a change in income in the usual model  We have a marginal propensity to consume of   about 07 We have some lags by which about 60 percent of the spending that is going to happen   happens in the first year and about 85 percent by the end of the second year, and we are doing a   pretty standard sort of analysis there with the types of numbers that we are getting    Yes    We are interpreting this proposal as a down payment on a permanent   change    If you look at the picture in Part 1 of the Greenbook, we have some   confidence bands based on Greenbook errors If you compare the large-scale asset purchases   line in that picture with the baseline, the large-scale asset purchases line is near the edge of the   70 percent confidence interval So they are different  [Laughter]  It is important to acknowledge   that there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty, particularly in thinking about these types of   programs and the effect of these types of programs  If you think about all the steps as you go   through the exercise of trying to gauge what the effect of these programs is and you go through   all the steps of the purchase of securities—what is the effect on interest rates in the market where           January 27–28, 2009 107 of 267  the securities are purchased; what is the spillover to other markets; and then in this environment,   what are the implications for economic outcomes?—there are many places to be very uncertain    Well, the confidence bounds are based on a draw of errors over the past   20-plus years That may not correctly capture the environment that we are in now    We did  Those numbers are hard to interpret, but we did a calculation    In the sorts of calculations we talked about of figuring out what the   impulse is, we have a multiplier of about 13    Yes If you compare that with others, though, it is very important to be   careful because those multiplier calculations include all sorts of different things  What are you   assuming is endogenous or exogenous?  What other things move, and when you do that        January 27–28, 2009 109 of 267  calculation, what of those things that move are you including or not including?  So we think that   is very much in the range of the numbers that other analysts looking at this type of program are   using We do not think we are doing anything particularly different there  You might see a   number that looks different, but if you dig under the surface and you do an apples-to-apples   comparison, I think we are very much in the range of what others are doing there    Absolutely    We are projecting a deficit for fiscal 2009 of about $18 trillion    I do not have those numbers    I can tell you a little about that  We did unpack the simulation and think   about what if it was just $500 billion in MBS What does that look like?  What if it was just   $500 billion in Treasuries?  What does that look like?  It is very important to highlight the   uncertainties that Dave Stockton just mentioned with these estimates being incredibly uncertain    We are trying to do something consistent with what was in those zero lower bound notes, but   boy, there is a lot of tough stuff going on So when we do that and we think about a $500 billion   Treasury package, we would see Treasuries coming down about 50 basis points and Baa yields   and mortgage rates coming down about 30 basis points  The assumption there is that you get a   hit on Treasuries and then a somewhat smaller spillover into other markets    Yes, and there is no great science here  It is looking at correlations of   rates and how these rates have moved historically and so on  If you look just at MBS, you find   that you would get a bigger effect on mortgage rates, maybe something on the order of 90 basis   points on mortgage rates, 50 on Baa, and maybe 30 on Treasuries  Then when we take all of that   and we run it through FRB/US and think about $500 billion of this and $500 billion of that, what   are the output effects?  In FRB/US, the output effects are pretty similar for those two programs    Now, there are many channels through which these programs would affect the economy that are   not captured in FRB/US One could make very plausible arguments for why, in fact, those two   effects might not be the same, so let me just leave it there    At the aggregate level, right           January 27–28, 2009 112 of 267   Oh, yes But if you look at what the change is in the unemployment rate   relative to the baseline, it is about the same    Right, the composition is different    What is the comparison that you are doing?    Yes, and then comparing it is lower than what?    These numbers are very rough I feel like I am being tortured, giving   these out here [Laughter] They are very rough   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material   labeled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”  The economic situation since   the time of the last Greenbook has, for the most part, unfolded about in line with our   expectations  One wrinkle of note, however, is that the improvement in economic   activity appears to be more front-loaded than we had projected in the last Greenbook    As shown in the top left panel of the first exhibit, we have revised up considerably   our estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter and now expect it to clock in at   an annual rate of better than 5 percent  But we have also marked down the first-  quarter growth rate  The panel to the right pinpoints the source of these revisions    The contribution of final sales to real GDP growth (lines 1 and 2) was revised little in   both quarters, but the contribution of inventories (lines 3 and 4) was marked up   sharply in the fourth quarter and down in the first quarter  While part of this revision   reflects an accumulation of wholesale inventories of farm products, the revision also   appears to reflect a timing shift of production adjustments   The middle two panels provide some additional perspective  As shown by the   black line on the left, firms began to draw down inventories in 2008, and this   liquidation became more aggressive in early 2009  The pace of drawdown appears to   have slowed sharply in the fourth quarter as firms apparently became more confident   about their prospects and moved production rapidly back up toward sales  As noted   to the right, this slowdown in the pace of liquidation came sooner than we had   expected in the December Greenbook as firms across a wide swath of the economy   appear to have pulled forward production adjustments that we anticipated would have   occurred later   Apart from inventories, the recent data have been consistent with our forecast of   strengthening final sales  The bottom left panel focuses on the goods component of   real PCE; the underlying data on retail sales and unit sales of motor vehicles through   December point to a moderate fourth-quarter gain, and we expect another decent-  sized increase this quarter  We also expect solid near-term gains in equipment                                                     3 The materials used by Messrs Sichel, Palumbo, and Sheets are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   January 26–27, 2010 98 of 260    purchases  The panel to the right shows that both orders and shipments of nondefense   capital goods excluding aircraft moved up recently, on net  With orders now having   moved into alignment with shipments, backlogs of unfilled orders are stabilizing    Moreover, an important contributor to the recent uptilt in orders and shipments was   the tech sector, where falling prices imply that the recent nominal gains will translate   into larger increases in real investment                      The next exhibit turns to the medium-term outlook  As shown in the top left   panel, we made only small changes to our forecast of strengthening economic   activity  The bullets to the right highlight the main factors that we believe will   contribute to the recovery  accommodative monetary policy, financial conditions that   continue to become more supportive of growth, reduced drag from past declines in   wealth, and improvements in household and business confidence   Although changes from one Greenbook to the next are often incremental, a more   notable upward revision to our outlook is evident when we look further back in time    The middle left panel compares our forecast for real final sales with that in the June   Greenbook  Final sales now appear to have been considerably stronger in the second   half of last year than we had projected last June  We also have marked up our   forecast for final sales growth this year about ½ percentage point   The box to the right highlights key changes between the June and January   Greenbooks  On the positive side of the ledger, financial developments have been   more favorable than we had anticipated in the June Greenbook  As shown in the   bottom left, equity prices have moved quite a bit higher, the triple-B bond yield is   considerably lower, house prices appear to be on a more favorable trajectory, and   mortgage rates are a little lower  In addition, summary indicators of financial market   stress (not shown) have, for the most part, improved significantly faster than we had   expected last June; however, bank credit standards remain very tight, and bank credit   has continued to contract   Returning to the bullets in the middle right, we also had a bit more fiscal stimulus   in the second half of last year than anticipated, and we expect a little more this year    This extra fillip reflects both the additional package that we assume will be passed   this year and other piecemeal provisions that were enacted in recent months,   including the expansion of unemployment benefits and the homebuyer tax credit  In   addition, foreign growth has been stronger and the dollar has been lower than we had   anticipated in June   On the negative side, we have been surprised on the downside by the extent of the   ongoing weakness in employment and some other labor market measures  For   example, as plotted in the bottom right panel, total hours in the nonfarm business   sector came in noticeably lower last year than we had anticipated last June  Michael   will now discuss the outlook for individual sectors    January 26–27, 2010 99 of 260      An important element of our outlook is the anticipated pickup in   private payrolls  As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 6, we expect payrolls to   flatten out this quarter and then to begin to turn up more definitively in the second   January 26–27, 2010 102 of 260    quarter  Final sales have been growing for a few quarters, which should help   businesses gain confidence in the resilience of the recovery, a point supported by   recent indicators of business sentiment  In addition, as shown by the blue line in the   panel to the right, the recent very large increases in labor productivity have, in our   estimation, pushed the level of productivity in the nonfarm business sector well above   its structural level (the red line)  We believe that there is limited scope for firms to   achieve further outsized gains in productivity, suggesting that hiring will need to   commence soon as output continues to expand         Indicators of layoffs also are broadly consistent with a leveling-out in   employment  For example, the middle panel plots initial claims for unemployment   insurance over recent business cycles  The turquoise bars mark NBER recessions,   while the yellow shaded region to the right covers the range that we currently   estimate to be consistent with unchanged employment  As you can see, claims have   just entered the upper end of that range  The bottom left panel highlights some   margins of adjustment other than direct hiring that firms tend to use around the time   of an upturn in employment  The workweek (the black line) and temporary-help   employment (the red line) both have turned up recently  While the recent upturns in   these series are modest so far, they are in the range of moves that have been   associated with employment upturns in the past, with those points marked by vertical   lines for the last two episodes  However, indicators of hiring remain lackluster  The   bottom right panel shows a composite index of help-wanted advertising that blends   the old newspaper index with a measure of Internet job listings; this series has   flattened out recently and has yet to show clear evidence of an upturn  Although we   view the available information as supportive of our forecast of a pickup in payrolls,   considerable uncertainty attends our forecast of imminent employment gains   Exhibit 7 turns to the outlook for inflation  The red line in the top left panel   shows our estimate of the NAIRU plus the effect of extended and emergency   unemployment benefits (labeled EEB)  The sum of these two pieces is about   6¼ percent over the forecast period, and the shaded area above the red line shows our   estimate of resource slack  We continue to expect that the wide margin of slack will   put downward pressure on inflation  In our projection, however, this effect is muted   by the relative stability of long-run inflation expectations  As shown to the right,   survey measures of inflation expectations (the black and red lines) have been quite   stable; although readings on the TIPS measure in recent months (the green line) look   a bit elevated relative to earlier years, extracting a signal for inflation expectations   remains difficult  Elsewhere, we see little evidence of significant upward pressure on   consumer price inflation  As shown by the blue bars in the middle left panel, labor   costs remain quiescent  Compensation per hour has decelerated in recent years, and   we project that increases in this measure of compensation will remain modest this   year and next  Moreover, given the large recent increases in labor productivity, unit   labor costs (the red bars) are estimated to have fallen considerably in 2009  And we   expect these costs to increase only modestly over the next couple of years  Finally,   although core import prices, the middle right panel, are projected to move up   noticeably in coming quarters, we estimate that this increase will have only a limited   January 26–27, 2010 103 of 260    effect on consumer price inflation  All told, as shown by the blue bars in the bottom   panel, we continue to project that core PCE inflation will slow a little further over the   medium term, reaching about 1 percent next year  Overall PCE inflation (the green   bars) is pushed up this year by a pickup in energy prices, but we expect the headline   index to converge toward the core next year as energy prices decelerate  Nathan will   now continue our presentation                    I think the broad story on food prices would be that there was the big run-  up with commodity prices through 2008 and then we saw the big backoff on crop prices and the   underlying food commodity prices  That’s obviously finished  With the recent freeze, there is   going to be some near-term volatility in food prices  But we do see food prices rising going   forward, not at a rate particularly different from core prices, but we do see increases going   forward   January 26–27, 2010 110 of 260      I think they are highlighting a very important risk and one that we are   acutely attentive to  As we put the forecast together, we were looking at a number of different   things  We have some indicators that are laid out here that I think provide some sense that, based   on the historical record, a pickup in hiring is plausible  The stage seems to be set for that  There   is a macro story that’s laid out in that top right panel that suggests, conditional on our ability to   January 26–27, 2010 112 of 260    assess the structural underlying rate of productivity growth, that a pickup in hiring would be   imminent  But as you note, we heard the same stories about business uncertainty, and it does   seem that it is going to need to resolve to some degree before hiring begins to pick up   I think some indications that it may be happening—and I don’t want to assert this too   strongly—come from some of the business sentiment surveys  Some of the improvements in   financial market indicators suggest that it may be happening  And we are now in a period when   final sales will have been growing for a time, suggesting that there may be some growing   confidence in the resiliency of the recovery  But, boy, that’s a lot of forecast and hope rather   than a lot of hard facts to which I could point you suggesting that we really have great   confidence that is going to happen  We think that is the best way to put together the pieces of the   macro story, but there’s a lot of risk there     Again, that is a fair point, something that we have thought a lot about  I   would note that the typical pattern prior to the last two jobless recoveries was that, after GDP   turned up, it took employment a couple of quarters to turn up  That does not mean that it is   going to happen this time, but that was the typical pattern   January 26–27, 2010 113 of 260    I would also note looking at that help-wanted index, if you look at the vertical lines that   show the point at which employment picked up in the past, in those earlier episodes that turn   came pretty quickly  So when the macro forces and the stars lined up the right way, hiring   started  It is kind of an uncomfortable thing for us to have to say that the second quarter here is   what we are going to get  At some point it’s going to happen, and it may happen pretty quickly    It might not be the second quarter  It’s sort of uncomfortable to be forecasting that so close, but   again, the macro story seems to line up, suggesting that it’s a sensible forecast to write down,   subject to all of the risks     Yes  So one thought on that—we have done a lot of work trying to blend,   connect, and splice together the current Internet job postings with the old help-wanted index    You’re absolutely right that doing these long comparisons across time is treacherous because job   postings now probably aren’t the same thing that job postings were 30 years ago  As we look at   that index, we really do not try to make much of secular trends  We really think it’s more useful   for identifying shorter-term movements  Whether shorter-term movements in Internet postings   are similar to shorter-term movements in the old newspaper postings is an open question, but we   still think that there is some useful information here
