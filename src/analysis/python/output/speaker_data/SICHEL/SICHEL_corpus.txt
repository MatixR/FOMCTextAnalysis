 Yes Thank you, Mr Chairman  In response to the  wishes of the Committee for a discussion of productivity developments, the  staff will be presenting three briefings this afternoon  Sandy Struckmeyer  and I will discuss the staff’s view on structural productivity and potential  output Jeff Fuhrer will present the perspective of the Federal Reserve Bank  of Boston, and Charlie Steindel will discuss the productivity slowdown of the     6/26-27/01 7   late 1960s and early 1970s  We will be referring to the materials labeled  “Staff Briefings on Productivity Developments”2   The performance of the US economy in the second half of the 1990s was  nothing short of remarkable  One of the key factors driving this economic  resurgence was the substantial acceleration in labor productivity, following  nearly a quarter century of sluggish growth  As can be seen in the upper left  panel of chart 1, the average growth rate of labor productivity picked up from  15 percent in the period from the early 1970s through 1995 to 28 percent  since then As seen at the right, the growth rate of labor productivity has  tended to rise since 1995, although more recently it has dropped back as the  economy has slowed and as a retrenchment has taken hold in the tech sector   This briefing reviews what we know about the causes of the resurgence in the  second half of the 1990s and, given the most recent developments, assesses  how much of that pickup is likely to persist      As highlighted by the bullets in the lower panel, we first explore the  sources of the pickup, examining how much resulted from more rapid capital  accumulation and how much from a quickening of the pace of technological  progress We focus particularly on the role played by information  technology To assess the sources of the pickup, we use a traditional growth  accounting framework, relying primarily on the multifactor productivity data  produced by the BLS Following that discussion, we then turn to the question  of how much of the recent productivity growth is cyclical and how much is  structural Finally, given today’s economic situation, we discuss the outlook  for structural labor productivity and potential output      The upper panel of chart 2 lays out a simplified version of the standard  neoclassical growth accounting framework that we use--a framework that was  developed by Robert Solow and Edward Denison in the 1950s and 1960s  As  shown in equation 1--where dots over variables indicate growth rates--this  approach expresses growth in output (designated Q) as a weighted average of  the growth rates of the inputs The two inputs included in the equation are  capital services (labeled K) and labor hours (shown as L)  In this expression,  the growth rate of each input is multiplied by its income share--denoted by s  for the income share of capital and (1-s) for labor’s share  The portion of  output growth not attributable to growth in inputs is the multifactor  productivity residual (labeled MFP); it also has been called total factor  productivity It is a catch-all for technological or organizational  improvements that increase output for a given amount of input        Equation 2 decomposes growth in labor productivity (labeled LP)  In  this decomposition, growth in labor productivity reflects increases in the  amount of capital per hour worked (referred to as capital deepening) and MFP   2 Copies of this material are appended to this transcript  (Appendix 2)     6/26-27/01 8   growth In our empirical implementation of these equations, we also include  a term that accounts for changes in labor composition; that is, for the effects  of changes in the experience, gender, and educational attainment of the  workforce—factors that might affect labor productivity       Before getting to the numbers, the lower panel lays out some of the key  strengths and weaknesses of the growth accounting framework  One strength  of the growth accounting approach is that it is based on the microeconomic  theory of the firm, applied to the overall economy  In addition, the approach  is straightforward and intuitive, representing output growth as a simple  weighted average of the growth of inputs  And, it is a rich approach that can  help to identify the sources of growth in a period of structural change       A weakness of the growth accounting approach is that it requires several  strong assumptions about how the economy functions  For example, the  approach assumes that markets are competitive and always in equilibrium  In  addition, as typically implemented, the growth accounting approach assumes  that capital becomes productive as soon as it is installed  This assumption  seems reasonable for some types of assets, such as personal computers, but  probably is not reasonable for certain types of complex infrastructure--such as  communications networks--where elements put in place now may not be  brought on line for a number of years Also, a full implementation of this  framework imposes heavy data requirements, raising the possibility of  measurement error  Finally, this approach ignores the costs of adjusting  capital stocks For small changes, this assumption probably does not matter  much, but supply shocks that induce significant changes in production  technologies or relative prices--such as large energy price shocks--may cause  the model to go off track  Despite these limitations, this framework has been  a mainstay of growth analysis for many years, reflecting the widespread view  that it generates numbers that are sensible       Our empirical implementation of growth accounting is the subject of  your next chart  We start with the multifactor productivity data set put  together by the BLS, focusing on the nonfarm business sector  The output  measure--which is based on the National Income and Product Accounts--is  real GDP in the nonfarm business sector, and the measure of labor hours is  based on the series for hours of all persons published by the BLS For  capital, BLS uses the concept of capital services, which I will describe in a  minute  As indicated in the second bullet, the BLS uses these measures of  output, capital, labor, and labor composition to calculate MFP as a residual  using a growth accounting framework similar to equation 1       Currently, BLS has published MFP only through 1999  To extend these  data to 2000, we use published information on output and hours, and we  construct a figure for capital services using published data on investment   Because we translate investment to capital services at a higher level of     6/26-27/01 9   aggregation than will the BLS when they estimate MFP for 2000, there is an  extra element of uncertainty surrounding our numbers for 2000  To generate  quarterly numbers that can tie into our Greenbook forecast, we then  interpolate the BLS annual numbers for output, hours, capital services, and  labor composition  From these numbers, we calculate quarterly estimates of  MFP growth      The middle panel describes the capital services concept used by the BLS   Growth in capital services (denoted by Kt) is a weighted average of the  growth in individual capital stocks  These individual stocks are denoted Kit,  where the subscript i indexes the different types of capital  The weight for  each asset (the “w”s) reflects the marginal product, or relative efficiency, of a  particular asset The weights differ primarily because of differences in the  useful lives of each asset For example, a unit of computer capital has a short  useful life and likely will be scrapped after only a few years  Because the  cost of the computer is amortized over a very short period of time, it has a  high marginal product and gets a high weight  In effect, the service flow  from a unit of this capital must be large enough to cover the costs of rapid  obsolescence In contrast, a unit of office building capital--which has quite a  long useful life--generates a smaller service flow in a year and gets a smaller  weight because the costs of the asset can be amortized over many years       Using the growth-accounting framework and the data I just described,  the lower panel decomposes the growth of actual labor productivity growth  for selected periods The decomposition shown is quite similar to that  reported in a series of research papers, including work by Steve Oliner and  myself and by Dale Jorgenson and Kevin Stiroh The first two columns  compare the period of relatively sluggish productivity growth from 1973 to  1995 to the resurgence period from 1995 to 2000; the third column shows the  acceleration between the two periods  As can be seen on line 1, the rate of  increase in actual labor productivity rose from 15 percent per year to 28  percent per year--an acceleration of 13 percentage points  This pickup  reflected larger contributions from capital deepening (line 2), which stepped  up 05 percentage point per year MFP growth (line 6) accounted for the rest  of the pickup By these numbers, capital deepening accounted for a bit less  than half of the pickup in labor productivity growth      Because of our interest in information technology, we extend the system  to split the capital deepening term into the portion related to IT capital-­ including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment--and  to all other business capital And, we also split MFP growth into the portion  coming from the production of computers and related semiconductors and the  portion coming from all other sectors  To do this, we use information on  relative prices and shares of these high-tech products to estimate the MFP  contribution related to their production     6/26-27/01 10         As can be seen by comparing lines 2 and 3, greater use of IT equipment  and software more than accounted for the rise in capital deepening   Moreover, MFP growth arising from the production of computers and the  semiconductors that go into them (line 7) accounted for a noticeable chunk of  the step-up in MFP growth, even though these sectors represent a small share  of total output Taken together, the use of IT--represented by the IT capital  deepening numbers on line 3--and the MFP gains associated with the  production of IT (shown on line 7) accounted for 1 percentage point of the  13 percentage point resurgence in labor productivity growth in the second  half of the 1990s          Some analysts, most notably Robert Gordon, have argued that the pickup  in MFP growth was concentrated in the production of IT, and, indeed, those  sectors made a sizable contribution to the step-up in MFP growth  However,  as line 8 indicates, the sectors outside of the production of IT contributed 04  percentage point more to MFP growth in the second part of the decade than in  the first Although some portion of this pickup likely was cyclical, these  numbers indicate that this broader sector of the economy also enjoyed a  resurgence of actual MFP growth from 1995 to 2000           Sandy Struckmeyer will now continue our presentation    Mr Chairman, let me add one thing on the income-side numbers  In   addition to the material we presented, we have done this analysis using the gross domestic   income data  I can tell you what that would produce for Chart 3, which shows that labor   productivity growth picked up from 15 percent in the earlier 1973-95 period to 28 percent in   1995-2000 period, for a pickup of 13 percentage points  If we rerun that using gross domestic   income, the pickup would be about 03 percentage point more  So, as the Chairman said, there   may be some preference for the product side but it wouldn’t be that strong  If one went to the   income side, there would be a bit more of a pickup in multifactor productivity to explain  Indeed,   the Council of Economic Advisers in the way that they do these decompositions in their analysis   will typically average the income side and the product side in looking at the numbers, taking a   very agnostic view as to which is more correct    Let me start  Indeed, the standard growth accounting approach doesn't   take account of adjustment costs  The usual argument for that and why it evolved that way is that   originally the approach was used for looking at growth over very long periods--looking at one   twenty-year segment compared to another twenty-year segment  And over such long periods of   time it's presumably a reasonable assumption to say that the economy within that period   converged to an equilibrium and any adjustment costs have worn off  When one takes the   analysis to a higher frequency and starts to look at developments year by year, then indeed the        6/26-27/01 34   possibility that adjustment costs would matter more becomes more important  Certainly in   periods like the early ’70s and the late ’70s there were large adjustment costs associated with the   oil price shocks that the standard approach doesn't deal with well  Accordingly, the standard   approach was not terribly useful for understanding those periods    As for the Fernald paper, I found that paper very provocative  I think, as you said, that   theoretically it makes sense to consider adjustment costs, and the framework in Fernald’s paper   seems to be the right one  I believe he did the best job anyone can do in an effort to estimate how   large those adjustment costs are  But it is a very challenging task to parse out how much is   adjustment cost  When a firm is adjusting its capital stock it is difficult to determine how much   involves an adjustment to its desired stock today as compared with how much involves building a   telecom infrastructure, say, that is put in place today but won't become productive for a long   time  That “time to build” phenomenon--or the lag between the investment and when the actual   productive impact is felt--can be difficult to separate from the adjustment costs  So, I think that   paper does the best job that can be done, but the task is very challenging    May I make just a brief comment?  There’s a very interesting paper by   Eric Brynjolfsson and Loren Hitt in last fall’s Journal of Economic Perspectives that provides   some very nice evidence on the importance of organizational improvements  Also, on the   adjustment costs point that Presidents Parry and Minehan mentioned, I didn’t mean to suggest   that a zero adjustment is appropriate just because we do it that way  That is only a baseline  It’s   a very simple, transparent framework that people understand  I think, as you suggested, that   adjustment costs are a very important issue, and the work that John Fernald did is an important   first step in thinking about that  It is something that I think we need to continue to focus on    Hence, the reason I mentioned it as one of the weaknesses of the approach as we implement it    Three to five years, depending on the type of software
