6302,1999-02-02," The main changes in our forecast on the  international side have been driven by events in Brazil Our previous     2/2-3/99 24   assumption that Brazil’s exchange rate peg would hold has obviously been  proved wrong Your next chart focuses on recent developments in Brazil  and highlights the key policy problems facing the Brazilian authorities at  this time As can be seen in the upper left panel of Chart 5, the Brazilian  real depreciated by more than 40 percent in the last three weeks through  last Friday The real has appreciated about 8½ percent following the  announcement that Arminio Fraga, a former intern in the Division of  International Finance, [laughter] would replace Francisco Lopez as the  head of the Brazilian Central Bank   Early in January, a dispute over intergovernmental debts between the  state of Minas Gerais and the Brazilian Federal Government, though  relatively insignificant by itself, highlighted the lack of consensus on the  need for fiscal consolidation within Brazil’s complicated federal political  system As the dispute threatened to widen to other states, pressures on  the real mounted On January 13, the Brazilian authorities attempted a  controlled devaluation of 8 percent Significant capital outflows continued  and the real was allowed to float two days later   The anticipated fallout from the collapse of the real--including  continued high price-adjusted interest rates, heightened economic  uncertainty, a greater burden of foreign currency denominated debt, and  pressures on the financial system--is projected to cause a severe downturn  in economic activity in Brazil this year As shown at the upper right, we  now expect the downturn in Brazilian GDP to steepen in the first half of  this year and to extend, although at a diminishing rate, for the remainder  of the forecast period   Brazilian policymakers now face a dilemma With the change in the  exchange rate regime and the sharp devaluation of the real, it may be  necessary to keep interest rates high to contain inflation But Brazil’s  fiscal position remains precarious, owing in part to high debt service costs   The red bars in the middle left panel indicate that Brazil’s public  sector borrowing requirement was over 8 percent of GDP last year, even  with a modest surplus on the non-interest, or primary, part of the budget  Fiscal policy actions enacted since last fall are expected to increase  Brazil’s fiscal balance by about 3 percent of GDP this year But a  substantial overall deficit will remain unless interest costs decline   Over the last year, domestic short-term interest rates in Brazil--the  black line in the middle right panel--averaged about 28 percent, while  inflation--the red line--was only about 3 percent Roughly two-thirds of  the government’s domestic debt carries an interest rate that is linked to  overnight interest rates At the end of last year, Brazil’s federal debt was  already equal to about 50 percent of GDP, up from just 35 percent in 1996     2/2-3/99 25   Persistent high interest rates could put Brazil’s government debt on an  explosive path On the other hand, high interest rates may be necessary to  contain inflation expectations One of the critical uncertainties facing  Brazilian policymakers at this time is the degree to which the recent  devaluation will pass through to inflation   The bottom two panels offer some perspective on this problem The  bottom left panel shows the exchange rate, domestic interest rates, and  inflation for Mexico over the period from 1994 to 1996 In this case the  sharp devaluation of the peso at the end of 1994 was followed by a burst  of inflation that peaked at an annual rate of over 100 percent The lower  right panel shows the same three variables for Korea over the last two  years The devaluation of the Korean won at the end of 1997 was roughly  the same magnitude as the devaluation of the Mexican peso, but in the  Korean case inflation only reached a peak of about 30 percent Before  1997 Korea had less historical experience than Mexico with either large  exchange rate depreciations or high inflation, and this may have helped to  limit the passthrough of the depreciation to inflation expectations and  hence to domestic inflation itself   Our forecast for Brazilian inflation over the next year falls somewhere  between the Korean and Mexican examples Empirical analysis of  exchange rate passthrough in Brazil, covering the period before the  adoption of the real plan in 1994, would have suggested a pattern more  like the Mexican example But over the last four years the Brazilian  government has pursued policies intended to limit inflationary dynamics  For example, explicit indexation of wages was banned in 1995  Obviously, there is considerable uncertainty about our inflation forecast  for Brazil   Your next chart focuses on our outlook for other emerging market  economies Our current forecast does not anticipate extreme contagion to  other emerging markets from recent events in Brazil To some degree, this  represents a change in our thinking, in that in our previous “worse case”  analyses we assumed that a failure of Brazil’s program would likely  generate severe financial pressures on other emerging market economies  This change in our thinking reflects the fact that over the last several  months financial markets have increasingly distinguished Brazil from  other emerging market economies   The top left panel of Chart 6 shows yield spreads relative to US  Treasuries, for Brazilian, Mexican, and Argentine Brady bonds In the  immediate aftermath of the Russian devaluation and default in August,  these spreads generally moved together But since December Brazilian  Brady spreads have moved up more sharply than those for Argentina and  Mexico Domestic interest rates in Mexico and Argentina, shown in the     2/2-3/99 26   top right panel, are up some since the middle of January, but these  increases are modest compared with those seen in August and September   Perhaps not surprisingly, the financial contagion from Brazil to Asian  emerging markets is even more modest Credit spreads for Korean and  Thai sovereign bonds--the black and red lines in the middle left panel-­ ticked up when the real was devalued, but those increases have been  reversed The events in Brazil raised some speculation about the viability  of currency pegs in Hong Kong and China, but these pressures were  relatively mild As shown in the middle right panel, the 1-month Hong  Kong interbank interest rate has increased about 150 basis points since  mid-January Interest rates implied by offshore forward contracts for the  Chinese renminbi moved up somewhat more but this was probably related  to the Chinese government’s decision not to give preferential treatment to  foreign investors in the bankruptcy of GITIC, a failed Guandong  investment company   Our outlook for GDP growth for emerging market economies, other  than Brazil, is shown in the lower right panel The repercussions from  Brazil’s economic difficulties are expected to have negative impacts-­ lower exports to Brazil and some spillover of financial market pressures-­ on other Latin American countries Consequently, we expect the rest of  Latin America to suffer a recession in 1999, with real GDP in these  countries falling about 1½ percent before rebounding 2¾ percent in 2000  In contrast, real GDP in all five of the so-called “Crisis Asia” emerging  market economies--all of which experienced serious financial crises and  sharp declines in output in 1998--is expected to bottom out and return to  positive growth by the end of 1999 As you can see in the lower left  panel, industrial production has already returned to positive territory on a  year-over-year basis in Korea, and Thailand is not far behind We  continue to assume that Hong Kong’s peg to the dollar will hold, but at the  expense of somewhat higher interest rates Accordingly, real GDP in  Hong Kong is now expected to decline 2 percent in 1999 Real GDP in  China is expected to grow by about 6 percent in 1999, a slower pace than  estimated for 1998   Your next chart presents the staff’s outlook for Japan and Canada  We continue to be very pessimistic about the prospects for recovery in  Japan Since mid-November long-term Japanese government bond yields  --the red line in the top left panel--have moved up more than 1½  percentage points, and the yen--the black line in that panel--has  appreciated about 6 percent relative to the dollar The sharp increase in  bond yields followed the mid-December announcement of a 1999 budget  and associated financing plans that envision somewhat greater fiscal  expansion and greater bond issuance this year than most market  participants had expected The change in Japan’s cyclically adjusted fiscal     2/2-3/99 27   deficit, shown in the upper right panel, is expected to exceed 2 percent of  GDP this year and to be about ¾ percent of GDP next year   There are few signs of a reversal in the downward trajectory of  underlying private domestic demand, however In the fourth quarter of  last year, housing starts and new car registrations fell to their lowest levels  in over a decade, and the labor market remains depressed Since the  beginning of the year Japanese bank stocks--the red line in the middle left  panel--have been buoyed by potential mergers and the perception that the  Japanese authorities may be beginning to move more aggressively to  reform the banking system Such optimism may be premature In late  January, Moody’s downgraded the long-term credit rating of five large  Japanese banks, including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi   We project that Japanese real GDP--the black bars in the middle right  panel--will continue to fall over the forecast horizon even with significant  fiscal stimulus Japanese consumer prices--the red bars--are expected to  fall 2 percent in 1999, but part of this decline is the reversal of special  factors that artificially elevated consumer prices at the end of last year   Our outlook for other industrial countries is not so gloomy Declines  in commodity prices over the last two years put downward pressure on the  Canadian dollar, shown in real effective terms as the black line in the  bottom left panel, particularly in the first three quarters of last year Given  that we now project a pickup in both oil and non-oil commodity prices this  year, we expect the Canadian dollar to appreciate somewhat against the  US dollar this year and next Our outlook for Canada is shown in the  lower right panel Canada should register growth near 2½ percent this  year and in 2000--the black bars--with only a modest uptick in inflation, as  shown in the red bars   The staff outlook for Europe is presented in Chart 8 Exchange rate  strength has been an important factor in a tightening of monetary  conditions in Europe over the past year and a half The black line in the  upper left panel shows a constructed series for the real effective exchange  rate for the euro area, using the DM as an historical proxy Although the  real value of the effective euro has fallen since October, this move  retraced only partially the steep appreciation that occurred following the  outbreak of the Asian crisis in mid-1997 The real value of sterling--the  red line--experienced an even greater appreciation, which started earlier,  before it, too, eased somewhat in recent months   The latest data suggest that momentum behind European growth has  ebbed lately and the outlook for Europe has softened This has been  especially apparent in Germany, but has started to show through in other  key European countries as well As shown in the middle left panel,     2/2-3/99 28   indicators of business confidence in both Germany and France--the black  and blue lines, respectively--have fallen steadily since the spring of last  year Despite a sharp uptick in late 1998, UK business confidence--the  red line--still is well off its early-1997 level Euro-area labor market  conditions improved somewhat last year, as illustrated by German and  French unemployment rates in the middle right panel But the declines in  unemployment rates have been modest and, as activity has slowed  recently, those rates have leveled off   The upper right panel shows three-month interest rate futures in  Europe In view of increasing signs of deceleration in Europe, markets  appear to have factored in a modest decline in euro-denominated short- term interest rates over the near term Futures rates also suggest that  market participants expect the Bank of England to cut rates further  following substantial declines already implemented since October  The staff forecast is consistent with this pattern   The European outlook for real GDP growth is summarized in the  lower left panel Growth in both the euro area and the United Kingdom  should slow by about ½ percentage point this year before recovering  somewhat in 2000 UK inflation, the top line in the lower right panel,  should stay on target at 2½ percent  Although inflation rates will vary  across the euro area, they should stay low on average and well within the  target range of zero to 2 percent specified by the ESCB   My next chart outlines the influence of the foreign outlook on the  US external accounts The top left panel depicts trends in the value of  US exports to our principal export markets US exports to Europe--the  black line--and to Canada, the green line, advanced steadily last year  Exports to Latin America--the blue line--remained relatively strong  throughout 1998 as well US shipments to Asia--the red line--fell sharply  last year The jump in shipments in the fourth quarter to Asian markets  was largely due to aircraft   US exports have been restrained by weak economic activity abroad  and a strong dollar Turning to line 1 in the table in the top right panel, we  estimate that economic growth in the foreign industrial countries was  below trend last year; we project that growth will pick up only slightly  during the next two years Strength in Canada and Western Europe will  only partially offset the effect of the recession in Japan   As shown in the middle left panel, the dollar had appreciated sharply  in real terms during the past two years, by nearly ten percent against major  currencies--the red line--and by more than 15 percent against those of our  other important trading partners--the black line--before depreciating  during the past few months In our forecast, the dollar remains essentially     2/2-3/99 29   flat in real terms, appreciating against the currencies of Latin America and  depreciating with respect to most of the currencies of Asia and Europe  This assumption reflects a balancing of risks, with the prospect of strong  US growth tending to support the dollar and concerns about the widening  US external deficit tending to depress the dollar   The middle right panel depicts the arithmetic contribution of US  exports and imports to US GDP growth Real exports of goods and  services, the black bars, fell during the first half of last year before  rebounding last quarter We project that exports will decline again during  the first half of 1999 and then stage a slow recovery We project that  imports--the red bars--will continue to advance at a slower, but still strong,  pace this year and next   The US external accounts are plotted in the lower left panel  We  estimate that the nominal US trade balance--the red line--in current  dollars in the fourth quarter recorded a deficit of $182 billion, nearly $70  billion larger than in the fourth quarter of 1997 With accumulating US  current account deficits and the resulting deterioration in the US net  international investment position, net investment income--the blue line--is  projected to continue its decline through 2000 We project that the deficit  in the current account--the black line--will increase to $374 billion in 2000  which, as shown in the lower right panel, is equivalent to 40 percent of  US GDP, noticeably above the peak reached in the 1986-87 period   In recent months financial market participants have focused  increasingly on the widening US external deficits and their implications  for the exchange value of the dollar  Your next chart considers the  relationship between the value of the dollar over the medium term and the  likely path of the US net investment position--that is, US foreign assets  less US liabilities owed to foreigners The top right panel shows the ratio  of the US net investment position to GDP, on an inverted scale, over the  next 20 years under two assumptions about the path of the real exchange  rate The black line shows the path under the assumption that the dollar  depreciates, in real terms, at a rate of about 1½ percent per year after the  end of the Greenbook forecast period The projection is based on an  updated version of the long-term model the IF Division used in its Current  Account Sustainability project two years ago One of the conclusions of  that project was that a steady depreciation of the dollar of 1½ percent per  year was sufficient to stabilize the net investment position As the black  line in the upper left panel indicates, that conclusion is no longer valid  The red line on the chart indicates that even a 3 percent rate of  depreciation is not quite enough   The main factors that change the basic result are shown in the upper  right panel of the chart First, the dollar has appreciated substantially     2/2-3/99 30   relative to the baseline that was used in 1997 Second, the current account  deficit over the last two years has been above the 1997 baseline Finally,  our new higher estimate of US trend growth makes a substantial  difference because the income elasticity of US imports is estimated to be  substantially higher than the income elasticity of the demand for US  exports   The bottom two panels of the chart show the net investment position  to GDP ratio and real effective exchange rates since 1980 for Canada and  Australia These are the only two major industrial countries that in recent  decades have had negative net investment positions of the size we are  projecting for the United States In both cases their exchange rates have  trended down but with considerable variation   That these projections have changed so much over the last two years  is indicative of the fact that in such long-run projections initial conditions  matter a lot Moreover, there is no way to know, as the experience of  Australia and Canada suggests, exactly how large a country’s net  investment position could be, nor when the prospect of further  deterioration would prompt a financial market reaction But these  projections do suggest that the potential problem for the dollar has gotten  worse rather than better over the last two years, and the prospect of  widening US current account deficits is likely to exert downward  pressure on the dollar at some point in the future   Dave will now continue our presentation   I think in part what you are picking up are the initial   conditions and compounding effects If we have a cyclical swing that makes the situation   worse now and if the other economies come back later, we will in the interim experience   a further increase in our net external debt position And because of the compounding,   that matters  An underlying assumption in the Greenbook forecast is that there will be   some strengthening in foreign economic activity during the forecast period, but faster-  than-trend growth abroad is delayed until the period beyond the Greenbook horizon So,   part of the problem is that if we have a boom and therefore a bigger trade deficit in the   current account now, we will accumulate additional foreign debt; and the interest cost of   that will mount In part, therefore, the growing external deficit is the effect of the   compounding  "
