48,1976-04-20,  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]  Mr  Gramley will now complete our [presentation with a discussion of policy alternatives]     4/20/76 - 6 -             I think it’s about 40 percent for one month  In subsequent months the  weight of the man-hours [unintelligible] sharply  
127,1976-07-19,"  “The [unintelligible] of business activities slowed perceptibly [from a]  rapid rate earlier this year  Preliminary GNP estimates for the second quarter are being  released”      Well, I was starting off with a flat statement that reflected the numbers  [unintelligible] suggest that I thought that things were moderating from an unsustainably higher  rate to quite a healthy balanced expansion in the economy     Well, it’s model projections, Governor  These are judgmental projections,  and the average over the next six quarters is slightly under 3 percent  It tapers down, however,  very slightly in a--     In this system, that is the number that we come up with     No, we figure a rate of increase in the second half of ’76 of about a little  over 3 percent, and it drifts down to a 2-3/4 percent rate by about the end of ’77     Under the 3 percent  This is nonfarm productivity--the long-term trend is  about 2-1/2  It remains slightly [unintelligible], and seems to us consistent with a rate of growth  in real GNP and real activity that is somewhat above that  "
170,1976-09-21,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Well, the more negative qualitative reports that I’ve heard have been  largely from the retail sales area, particularly from those chains that concentrate on nondurable  goods  And they have every reason to feel somewhat depressed  The rate of growth in these  sales has been very weak in recent months, but there has been a significant pickup there--and if  things continue to rise as we expect they will, I think they will have a somewhat brighter outlook  in the near future  They remain very cautious, obviously     Otherwise I really haven’t heard much that I would characterize as negative--rather,  cautious [instead]--and I think this has probably been a very good thing  It’s resulted in a very  careful attitude toward inventory investment, which has kept things well in line there and I think  keeps the economy in a position to move ahead as final demands increase, as I think they will   Are there any specific areas that you can put your finger on?     I think they are fairly reasonable  For the near term, it appears that food  prices are likely to continue to be rather moderate and in fact possibly to continue down     9/21/76 - 10 -    somewhat  The outlook for meat prices looks pretty good  This may mean somewhat larger  rises in 1977, but it is hard to project the food area that far ahead     As far as other sectors are concerned, in terms of cost, our productivity performance has  been really quite good  The rate of increase in productivity over the last half year has been in the  5-1/2 percent range, and unit labor costs have been between 3 and 3-1/2 percent, which has been  moderate, certainly, [relative to] performance of the last couple of years and I think does not  suggest undue pressure on prices  The key--we anticipate continued good gains in productivity,  obviously not as strong as we’ve had, but we do think that this will be a factor limiting the  increase of prices     The area, of course, that disturbs us is energy prices  They have been rising very rapidly,  but we think that this period of rebound--after all, there was a decline in energy prices, and this is  a period of adjustment upward, and that appears to be coming to an end, and we see fairly  moderate increases in energy prices ahead     We have built in a one dollar increase per barrel of oil, Mr Chairman  It’s  certainly possible, and we are considering the likelihood of a dollar and a half increase in oil  prices     A 15 percent increase rather than a 10 percent increase, by our calculations,  would affect the consumer price index by only 1/10 of 1 percent  It would not be a major factor   If things get no worse than that, I would hold with our forecast for energy prices  Over the next  few months, I think some of the pressures on gasoline will be diminishing  We have passed  through the period of greatest demand this summer, and in fact there have been a few indications  of price reductions in gasoline  I think we will see at least some easing of prices after  September  I think, overall, given perspectives that we have now, it seems to us that the 5 to  5-1/2 percent range is a reasonable one     My impression is that it’s a total effect     Well, the difference between 10 and 15--excuse me, I didn’t quite  understand  The effect of a 15 percent increase would be something in the neighborhood of  about 3/10     9/21/76 - 11 -       Well, the machine tool series has begun to rise and shows a significantly  more rapid increase--of course, as you know, it’s quite a small proportion of the total, between 1  and 2 percent of purchases of nonelectrical machinery  You’re perfectly right on the repairs and  additions, and we have built in a very strong rate of increase  We have been aware that this has  been a strong element of support for activity     Yes, we have such projections for the total nonfarm economy, not for  manufacturing  However, there are implicit productivity projections for manufacturing  For the  nonfarm economy, our projections of productivity call for a much more moderate rate of increase  than we have had  As I indicated, the rate of increase in the first half of this year shows  5-1/2 percent  We expect it to drop down to 3 percent or a slightly under 3 percent range for the  remainder of the projection period  This would be slightly above the long-term trend  And we  feel [we are being] consistent with a rate of growth of real output in the roughly 5 to a little  above 5 percent range       9/21/76 - 12 -     In terms of unit labor costs, they have been running slightly over 3 percent  That’s a  function of the very rapid productivity gains which are typical in the early stages of recovery   The unit labor costs will be edging up a bit  As I remembered them, they are in the slightly  above 4 percent range     They are in the middle-4 range at the end of ’77--about 4-1/2 percent for  the second half of 1977 for unit labor costs  This is in conjunction with a productivity increase  of about 28, 29, and compensation increases during that period of about 7-1/2 percent     Well, we would be delighted to  We do keep an eye on these prices, of  course  I’d be delighted to prepare some analysis, although it tends, as you know, to be a fairly  volatile kind of area, and it’s a little difficult to interpret short-term movements  But we’ll take  this under consideration, review the numbers, and see whether we can make something  meaningful out of this and provide such an analysis      Well, I’m afraid we can’t  I wish I could put my finger on which of the two  series I believe [for] last month, but I can’t  I’d say the problem has always been that, for any  given month, there may be a difference in the way the two series behave  And the thing to do is  to watch them over a several-month period     The thing that gives me a little bit of confidence about what the payroll series is signaling  is the fact that there were two months in a row of fairly good gains in nonfarm payroll  employment, accumulating to half a million, and that’s a rather impressive number  We’ll just  have to wait and see  I think that, over a longer period, the two series do tend to follow pretty  much the same paths  They both slowed down considerably after the spring  As you remember,  the household series rose quite strongly the previous month while the payroll series rose this  month--I think at the moment I’m willing to at least accept the fact that the payroll series  suggests that employers are adding to their staffs     Well, as you know, the rate of growth has been a laggard series or area in  the recovery, but it’s beginning to move in a pattern that seems more sensible  And the rate of  increase in business fixed investment in real terms was about 8 percent last quarter; we expect it  to be rising from here, if we’re right, into the 12 to 14 percent rate range, which would be, again,  a reasonable rate of increase, although coming rather late in the recovery     The other dimension, which is the level of investments, of course is another matter  In real  terms, investment has not recovered  It remains well below earlier rates, and in that sense we can  consider this to be a sector which is still depressed in a sense  “Depressed” may be a strong  word, but still relatively low compared to what it should be in terms of the contributions to  building capital stock     I was listening to you, Mr Chairman  And may I add my visceral, if  nothing else, reaction [regarding] the last 20 years to your earlier analysis--I agree with you  completely  I can’t recall a strike that we didn’t overestimate the impact of  Even that steel  strike, we thought the world was coming to an end and it really quite didn’t     But that’s sort of a general statement  In specific terms, it seems to us that a strike of  something over a month would be necessary before you really felt any significant impact  The  response to a Ford strike and a GM strike seems to be very different  Obviously, there is the  tremendous difference in the volume of production and impact, but beyond that, in our analysis  of the past several strikes, the spillover, that is the demand for other model cars, seemed to be  quite large during the Ford strike, and in effect the total loss in consumer sales tends to be  relatively small     Right     For the 1967 Ford strike, which was for nine weeks, our estimate was that  the actual loss in sales--that is, the loss forever--was really quite small  There were two kinds of  offsets  One was a shift to other models, the second was purchasing later  And our calculation  was that the loss was only in the neighborhood of, oh, possibly half a million units in total during  the entire period     There are a couple of factors operating to moderate the early effects of the strike   Producers of component parts and materials continue manufacturing on the assumption that  Ford, when it starts up again, is going to be running flat out to make up  Number 1  Number 2,     9/21/76 - 17 -    Ford this time had a much longer lead time in anticipating the likelihood of a strike than they did  last time  Last time, I think, they were told the day before the strike that they were going to be  hit  This time they’ve had enough time to build up stock, and our estimates are that there is a  fairly good stock of cars in dealers’ hands at this point     As far as supplier industries are concerned, rubber, at least, is likely not to be affected very  strongly by the strike because they’re in a period of recovery from their own strike and are  building inventories and would be operating at virtually full capacity under any circumstances at  the present time     To be specific about how long the strike may be before it really has a significant effect, our  estimate is that certainly a one-month strike would hardly be felt because the first two weeks are  at the end of this quarter and rather minimal  The last two weeks of the strike would be in the  fourth quarter and would be offset by activity in the remainder of the quarter  We would think  that something beyond six weeks would begin to have a significant effect     In very general magnitudes, it tends to be extremely high in basic- commodity-producing industries     About 20 percent in those     For all the industries as a whole, I think it’s closer to 5, in that general  magnitude, if I remember correctly  "
315,1977-02-15,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     We’ve taken the optimistic tack, assuming that the caution that  businessmen have evinced in their treatment of inventories over the last several quarters will  continue, and they will not be panicked into a rapid increase in inventory investment during the  second and third quarters when we get these temporary surges  After all, they were burned in  1975, but I must say that they could well be burned again, in the sense that we might very well  have a rapid increase in inventory investment and then face the situation in which final sales do     2/15/77 - 9 -           not support that rate of inventory accumulation, and we move into an inventory adjustment  toward the end of the year  In terms of the probabilities, I hate putting numbers on things, but  maybe I’ll say one in three     One in three, possibly     Well, the postwar average, as you know, was about 09 [percent], and our  assumption more recently has been somewhat under that  And we have averaged somewhat  under that for this period  We rise to above that rate toward the end of the projection period     Yes, we have incorporated the minimum wage increase that occurred  January 1st into our projection of the--     No, that is all we have incorporated  Anything else that may occur, of  course, would add to the pressure  This increase in the minimum wage, to $230, affected--our  guess is--about 2 million people, to some extent in residential construction and to some extent in  trade and services  It is hard to know how much of an effect it has  It certainly has a tendency to  push everybody up slightly  That is, we have an estimate in the first quarter of the impact of that  on our wage costs     Apparently there are, in some parts of the country, relatively low wage  construction people  I don’t think that’s the major group     So I have been told     You are perfectly right  There were a number of factors operating in ’75  that are not exactly similar to that here, and we may very well get a somewhat larger total effect  from the rebate  However, I must say, we’ve used ’75 as a base for making our estimates of the  impact of 1977 rebates, with a few judgmental adjustments for those special factors       Well the projection for ’77 that we have is approximately a 6 percent rate  of real GNP growth; that is the average of the four quarters, which would accomplish a moderate  reduction in the unemployment rate--we anticipate getting down to 7 percent, or that general  magnitude, by the fourth quarter  I think one has to make judgments about the implications of  the rapidity of making that kind of progress for considerations like inflation  I think the  approach that would involve a moderate rate of improvement over a period of several years is the  more sensible one, and I think this rate of growth of approximately 6 percent, possibly a little bit  larger than that, is consistent with something close to an optimum, given the continued  sensitivity in the economy to inflationary anticipations  I think that’s a critical dimension here   One can set various goals, after all, and can push the economy to reach those goals at greater or  lesser speed  But to the extent that our judgment is that the rate of increase that we have  projected appears consistent with no increased inflationary pressures, this suggests that we may  be on the right track     That’s correct     Productivity has weakened and that has reduced the trend, correct     That is right     Well, as I recall it, our calculations for capacity use in manufacturing bring  us to about 85 or 86 [percent] by the middle of next year  And that is beginning to move--      About, by the end of next year  I think one can view this in several ways   One, of course, is to argue that one ought to have some sort of steady-state pattern throughout  the period toward an objective  One can operate reasonably with a slightly more rapid rate of  increase in the early period, moderating down as you approach fuller use of capacity and begin  to get close to the danger zone  The argument in favor of this would be, of course, to reduce  social costs in the early stages, where you still have extremely high rates of unemployment     Our projections on the labor force are [for a] less rapid pace than we had  last year  We’re figuring on about a 2 million rate of growth in numbers for 1977 versus about 3  million in 1976  That is larger than the average and larger than the growth in population [and it]  assumed continued increase in participation of women largely--     Well, let me break it down into three broad components--food, energy, and  other  As far as food is concerned, we have situations for the immediate future deteriorating to  the extent that the cold weather has had some effect on prices of fruits and vegetables  But, as I  indicated, we expect that to be a fairly short-term phenomenon  Other than that, the last month  or two has suggested that meat prices were going to be lower--weaker than we had earlier  thought--so that without the freeze we probably would have edged off [our] estimate of food  price increases in the first quarter     As far as the remainder of the year is concerned, it is really very difficult to say  The  drought in the West--I’m no agricultural expert, but [our expert] tells me that, at the moment, his  evaluation is that the people are being a little pessimistic about the implications of the drought in  the West for supplies  Grains are apparently in considerable supply  And later there may be  some effect on California-produced fruits and vegetables  But they would not be a very  important factor overall  So that basically, our feeling is that, unless we have continued bad luck  in terms of weather, food prices would not be a factor pushing prices up markedly in the period  of 1977     As far as energy prices are concerned, we have made assumptions in regard to OPEC  prices which involve a 5 percent increase, edging up to 7-1/2 percent  If that got worse, we  would obviously have some problems  There are some additional costs associated with increases  in gas which we have incorporated in our projections  We’ve made some assumptions in regard  to the implications of the use of intrastate natural gas in the interstate system  It’s a very small  factor overall  That’s obviously a factor pushing prices up, but not extremely rapidly, given our  assumptions     So we come back to the element of unit labor costs from other sectors as being a major  determinant of prices  And there, productivity plays a large part, as do wage increases  The  outlook for wage increases this year, it seems to us, is no worse than last year  Possibly slightly  higher increases, but very little  We don’t have any really large negotiations which involve a big  catch-up to compensate for increases in the cost of living  Probably the most dramatic  negotiations that we will have [involve] steelworkers, and that is going on right now  They are  covered by a cost-of-living clause, which has kept their real wages above what [they were] when  they negotiated the contract, so the pressures are not too intense     It’s a big settlement, it’s a big year--there are some 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 million people being  covered by contracts, but they’re very widely dispersed, and virtually all of the big ones do have  cost-of-living protection  So we are not going to get that kind of surge  And we are anticipating  that wage compensation increases will remain under 8 percent--in the 7-1/2 percent to 7-3/4  percent range     As far as productivity is concerned--based upon past experience, a rate of growth in real  output in the 6 percent range is consistent with above-average increases in productivity  And we  would think this probably will be the case now, since business generally suffered probably its  worst productivity performance--certainly in the post-World War II years--during the recession,  and I would think there would still be continued pressure to try to recover some of that  And,  while [our forecast is] not terribly expansive on productivity-- our average is a little above 3  percent for the year as a whole--[but] if we’re right on that, this gives us a unit labor cost     2/15/77 - 16 -           increase of about 4-1/2 percent  That roughly would be consistent, we feel, with price increases  slightly above that  And this gives us a pattern of price increases for the year which are  somewhere in the 5 to 5-1/4 percent range     I wish I could answer that question  I really don’t know  I think one has to  speculate about it  Certainly the past half year has been instructive in a sense  In a period when  we had not only excess capacity but also a rather sluggish economy, [and] one looks at industrial  prices abstractly from special consideration such as energy, one sees that the rate of increase, if  anything, accelerates  This is not what one would have anticipated based on the kind of model  that we are used to analyzing  So I think [we] have to start thinking about business attitudes and  business perceptions of what their costs may be, what inflationary implications may be, what  government programs may involve in terms of price regulation of one sort or another  I think  these are in a sense new dimensions that have to be taken into consideration     That’s very much in line with our assumption  We figured a rise in fruit  and vegetable [prices] of about 25 to 27 percent  We built that into a higher level for prices for  the year     Roughly--     Historically, this kind of--quote--windfall, which is what I think it’s  generally called, has involved something in the neighborhood of 25 percent spent in the current  period, and then drifting up to 40 or 50 percent total of it spent, possibly, and the remainder  saved  And we built in about this kind of pattern; however, I think you’ve got an additional  element that’s come into play here, and that is the extra gas bills which are going to be coming in  now  It’s conceivable that people, to the extent that they are aware of these rebates, will be  figuring they are going to use that rebate to pay their gas bills  So that adds another dimension  of the word “uncertainty” on how’s it going to operate     Well, they have to pay their gas bill anyway     Well, the payments out of these rebates, which are at $46 billion annual  rate, come very late in the second quarter--May and into June--so that most of the--     There’s a lagged spending response to them     Well, I can comment a bit  I would ask Mr Reynolds to supplement my  comment, since I am not as familiar with the worldwide situation, obviously, as he is  My  impression is that we are not in a situation where the pressures in capacity worldwide [are] what  they were then  And, in fact, the other day there was a comment from the conference of business  economists group that there seemed to be a considerable amount of available capacity in these  basic metal producing sectors worldwide  And so I think, to that extent, that we are not facing  the same kind of pressure points that we did face back in ’73  John, do you?  "
340,1977-03-15,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Well, nobody really does  The amount of the shortfall at this point seems to  be, including a rough estimate for February, in the $9 [billion] to $10 billion range  It seems to  be distributed fairly widely among expenditures categories, including unemployment insurance,  Veterans Administration payments, defense, and several other categories     [As to] the “why,” well, there are just conjectures  It was felt last year that it was sort of a  characteristic pattern of government agencies anticipating, or putting in, a budget item which  would fully cover what they anticipate their spending to be and then coming in somewhat lower- -because it looks better to come in somewhat lower, in effect  I might say that the pattern of  anticipating higher spending than actually occurs has been characteristic of, oh, possibly the last  two decades, and over the last--      Yes, our people tell us that the average spending has gone below the  anticipation, as of October in this case, by about 1 percent on average for about two decades and  about 2 percent for the last half-dozen years       Yes, there were times when it ran above  But as I recall the figures, there  were years and years, many more years, in which spending ran below, than above--over the last  decade, roughly     I might make an additional comment  A number of these items are not likely to affect  activity  They are financial in nature--at least they’re not likely to have an immediate effect on  activity, such as payments to the Defense Department by foreign recipients of military hardware,     3/15/77 - 5 -           which is an offset to spending, and there are other such offsets to spending that don’t really have  a significant current effect  The [overestimate] of unemployment compensation payments, for  example, would not be a negative factor in any sense, because that means that they have  estimated that unemployment would be higher than it really turned out to be, and if  unemployment is lower, presumably people are working, which is a good thing  The “why,”  though, remains still obscure in terms of the volume of the shortfall at this point  We expect  much of it to be made up in the second quarter  But not all     That was for February     I may be wrong, I think the figure was 7 in January and an estimate of 9 in  February  But that’s roughly--     That’s a cumulative figure     Some of the shortfall would be made up by legislative increase in the  expenditures for the second quarter, which in a sense are already built-in by $3 [billion] or  $3-1/2 billion     Well, the productivity performance, if I may focus on that immediately, is  very directly related to the weakness in real activity through much of the year  And typically,  except in certain cyclical situations, one doesn’t get good gains in productivity associated with  sluggish gains in real output  And we’re anticipating for 1977 a faster rate of growth in real  GNP, in the 6 percent range, and for private output it’s about 6-1/2 percent  And we feel that this  is consistent with a faster rate of productivity gain in 1977 than 1976, by about 1/2 percentage  point  The productivity average for 1976 was 28 for the four quarters, and we are projecting  about 3-1/3     In terms of the wage side I’ve expressed myself on this earlier  It’s being optimistic, but it  seems that there’s really no strong basis for assuming a rapid acceleration in wage increases this  year  I think that there will be some increase over the rate of gain that we had last year  But in  general it seems to us that you’re not going to get the kinds of big catch-ups that occurred over  the last two years, since a much larger proportion of the labor force is protected by the cost-of- living clauses--have their wages protected thereby--and you’re not going to get big, first-year  increases  And we see compensation per hour rising on average a little above 8 percent, as  opposed to about 7-3/4 percent     And so this is a standoff, in a sense  We have the compensation rising slightly faster, the  productivity rising slightly faster, and our unit labor cost outlook, therefore, is about the same as  last year  Which is about a 4-3/4 percent rate of increase     3/15/77 - 7 -             That’s for four quarters versus four quarters in 1972     Well, I will comment briefly and then turn the floor over to Mr Axilrod for  his reactions to that  As you know, our projections are basically judgmental in nature, and the  translation, therefore, is not a rigorous mathematical translation  However, we do have an  econometric model we use for simulations for this purpose, and there does not seem to be  anything in the econometric forecast which would be significantly out of line with the  projections that we have prepared judgmentally, that we feel are consistent with the M1 growth   The--     Well, Mr Axilrod, I think--     No, they’re not [higher]  Our estimates are actually a bit lower  The  immediate spending of the rebates--we estimate that it’s about 20 to 25 percent, cumulating to a  total of only about 1/3 by the end of the year       Cut the telephone lines between them     We have been very concerned with the increase in commodities prices,  Governor Lilly  There has been a range of increases among nonferrous metals; lumber, which  has edged off a bit  A number of food and related items--all rather special situations, such as the  coffee price run-up  But as far as the metals [are concerned], for example, we’ve been  concerned  It seems to have been an unreasonable sort of increase, except to the extent that the  prices on a number of these commodities had dropped rather sharply earlier, and this would  appear to be an attempt on the part of these manufacturers to recover profit margins  If that’s the  case, and we feel that it probably is, it may not be a harbinger of continued increases, particularly  since demands are really not that intense worldwide     It certainly has bad psychological implications, and we will be monitoring  this very carefully     The labor force growth that we have projected is still fairly substantial  It’s  2 million, roughly, and involves a steady increase in the participation rate  It is not as rapid as  the increase that we had in 1976, and we feel the major factor there is that the pressures from  price increases and declines in real family income are not as intense as they were  They had  pushed a lot of women, a lot of secondary workers, into the labor market at that point  As so we  feel that [given] an easing of this particular pressure [because of] rising real incomes, we will  move back toward a more reasonable rate of growth in the labor force     It could, yes     Well, like you, my contact with businessmen has not suggested any great  concern during 1977, at least  The possibility of impinging upon capacity--[there has been] some  talk that that may occur in 1978, if things continue at a vigorous pace in selected industries  So  that has not been a major concern here     In terms of macro policy--I assume fiscal policy--I assume you mean those components of  policy that are generating or helping to generate a given rate of growth from the economy--is that  the point you have in mind, Governor?  With the first point, the rate of increase in real GNP  growth that we have projected is somewhat greater than the increase in capacity that appears to  be on stream, which is somewhere between 4 and 5 percent  So we will be moving back toward  the capacity line, but we would be moving at a rather moderate pace  In our projections, it isn’t  until mid-’78 that we begin to get to a point with capacity utilization for either materials or  manufacturing that we may begin to see any significant bottlenecks, even in selected areas  And  in macro terms we would still be well below the potential rate of growth  That’s not a substantial  factor       3/15/77 - 14 -           I think the concerns that we have relate to the shorter run, that is, in ’77--a worry about  inflation and its psychological impact and an aggravation of inflationary anticipation  There are  implications both for inflation itself and for attitudes of business and consumers  For ’78, we see  these situations beginning to possibly concern specific areas     This is a big year, so ’78 should be a small year  This year is bigger than  last year  It’s about 4-3/4 million, and last year it was a little over 4, and then it’s a three-year  cycle--pretty much standard     Yes, we have built in an increase in the second half of ’77 and early ’78,  which reflects the news that’s come in--unfortunate nature of the weather in the West and  Midwest  I think we are still on the relatively optimistic side of the range of forecasts  It’s  conceivable that if the news continues bad, if the weather really is as bad as it appears to be at  this point, and that continues to be the case, we could easily get another 1 to 1-1/2 percentage  point rise in food prices in late ’77 and early ’78     Well, it certainly will affect the GNP forecast in the sense that this will be a  tax on consumers for higher prices for food, and this has a negative effect in general--aside from  the distinct possibility that it may erode consumer attitudes about the outlook for the economy  and may be evident in a much more significant way in purchases of other things     There was, as I mentioned earlier, actually a rundown of inventories late in  the year  The only thing we have for January to date is manufacturing and wholesale trade  inventories  There was some rise in materials, particularly, and raw materials, and goods in  process  It’s felt that a significant amount of that was a backup because of the inability fully to  ship during the cold weather  So we don’t really see any intended buildup in inventories very  clearly as yet     Our assumption has been that there would be a moderate rate of growth in  inventory investment--actually, a rate of inventory investment that’s quite modest during this  period  If I may refer to the discussions I’ve had with business people, particularly at the retail  trade level, I have asked them about their anticipations in regard to the impact of the rebates   And they tend to be rather cautious  One of them said, for example, that he was afraid that the  individual stores will start over-responding     I am reporting the thinking of an economist at one of the chains  I suppose  I should distinguish between businessmen and economists--you’re right, Mr Chairman  But the  company policy in this particular chain and in the case of several others was to be rather  conservative in building inventories during this period     3/15/77 - 24 -          "
366,1977-04-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     I’ve seen no results; it would take a while before we get that kind of report     We have taken a position which is something of a compromise between the  proposal made by the Dent bill and the Administration’s proposals  We are assuming a July 1st,  1977, increase to $265  The Carter proposal was $250 on July 1st  The Dent bill was for  $285  In talking to some people on the Hill, they fear that some modest increase above the  Administration proposal would probably be worked out  This should apply to about 4-1/2  million people  And its effect on compensation is to raise it by about 3/4 percent for that quarter      No, we haven’t gone beyond midyear, and as we say, our projections for  the first half of 1978 are about 5-1/2 percent for the fixed-weight index  It varies slightly from  the deflator because of variables, items such as pay raises  Certainly the problem in the nonfood  sectors [is that the] underlying [trend in these prices] is likely to be much more serious  We  intended to utilize basically the trend in cost that we see--unit labor costs--in describing the  pattern of price projections as we move that far out  Corporate profits have recovered rather  well, and in that kind of environment we still feel that prices will track reasonably well with  costs  We don’t see any explosion in wage demands developing at the moment at that point   And we’ve taken a rather moderate view of the outlook for productivity  We have increased our  wage projections slightly, to slightly over 8 percent, and with about 2-3/4 percent increase in  productivity, that gives us a unit labor cost increase of about 5 or 5-1/4 percent  This is our  projection for prices     It’s extremely difficult to assess that  Obviously, retail sales would be very  strong, and that would be consistent with some anticipatory buying, but we are unable to  evaluate that  We’ve made a small allowance for that, assuming that some spending occurred in  the first quarter  But not a great deal     Yes     And between the last month and this month, while we still had rebates, we  had changed our assumption to incorporate some of the rebates in the third quarter, some with  payments to nontaxpayers, so that the earlier projections that we said incorporated--     The levels [without the rebates] remained below what they would have  been with the rebates, despite the fact that the rate of growth accelerates     4/19/77 - 7 -             We didn’t change housing projections, but we did raise total construction  expenditures slightly     Yes, we were--quite surprised     Definitely, we will revise them upward     At the maximum, we had about a point, and that was before the--some of it  was stripped away last month, so the effect of withdrawing all of it becomes quite a bit less     Well, you certainly haven’t been informed by me, Mr Chairman  There  have been no revisions at the national level of this magnitude  There was the usual revision last  year of the benchmark, but it was not a very large revision  There will be another one coming  out later this spring  But I have heard nothing to suggest that there was going to be anything of  this magnitude at the national level       4/19/77 - 11 -           I think that the local data and state data are subject to substantially greater revision  And  there is an awareness that those data are not adequate  There has been a congressional  commission established to study the employment, nonemployment statistics, and one of their  major emphases is going to be on trying to improve the collection process of local and state data     They come from the state employment services through the Bureau of  Labor Statistics     Well, I really don’t--I’m not familiar with those numbers, as I indicated   We will look into it and try to get a report to you on what they mean and what their implications  are for both the national--     We’ll do that, Mr Chairman     In terms of the balance of the economy, we still are obviously running with  capital spending significantly below what it should be, given past performance in an expansion  period  And the outlook is still somewhat unclear in that regard  We anticipate moderate rates  of growth, but it will be some time before the rate of capital spending would be in reasonable  balance with other components of the economy in terms of historical relationship  But in terms  of other sectors of the economy, inventories are in good position at this point, and in fact  probably a little on the low side, so that there is room for expansion there  Housing has moved  along at a very good clip recently     But we are not in a position where we are impinging in any very significant way on  production capacity as yet  Looking over the materials producing sectors, production as a  proportion of capacity has moved up significantly, but there’s still a fair margin to move there,  and we don’t expect any significant shortages developing into at least the first half of ’78, unless  the economy moves much more rapidly than we’re assuming  So in that sense, I would say that  the expansion has not developed any severe distortions as yet  "
391,1977-05-17,"  No     Well, yes, there was a very large increase, particularly in retail trading  inventories in March     The $33 billion for total business--manufacturing and trade, the average for  the first quarter is about $30 billion  Given the very rapid increase in wholesale prices, our IVA  is jumping and now is somewhere in the low 20s, so that it’s possible that the inventory figure, as  you suggest, may be stronger in the first quarter  I wouldn’t expect it to be a great deal stronger   It is a little hard to make out that retail trade inventory figure for March because it comes in the  face of very strong growth in sales and perhaps, quite frankly, [is] a bit surprising     In terms of the point about consumption, Governor, Jim earlier cited the increases that we  are projecting for personal consumption expenditures in current dollar terms  I think the story as  we can foresee it is even clearer if you look at it in real terms  For the second half of 1977, we’re  forecasting about 3-1/4 percent real rates of growth for personal consumption expenditures  And  that’s really quite modest  In terms of the possibilities of a weakening, of course, they are there   And there’s a very real concern about that, but we have had fairly substantial gains in income  recently; wages and salaries have been rising at 1-1/2 percent per month for the last several  months, and that gives a strong basis for continuing growth in consumer outlets  And our  judgment is that even with the slowing down of personal consumption expenditures to something  like a 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate, there’s enough strength evident in the other sectors of the economy  to keep the momentum moving at something close to 5-1/2 to 6 percent overall for GNP      We have business fixed investment certainly moving up strongly  I must  say, our assumption about inventories remains approximately what it has been in recent months,  to wit, a rather conservative rate of growth  The inventory-sales ratios continue edging off all  through 1977, and we just turned them around as we move into 1978  That I consider  conservative, given the projection of business fixed investment we have in there  There’s  generally a buildup of durable goods inventories that is associated with that, and so I think that’s  a conservative picture  We do have considerable strength in residential construction for the next  couple of quarters, but I think that’s pretty well in the bag with the kind of increase we’ve  already had in housing starts  So we [have what] I think in those two sectors are reasonable  views on what is likely to happen     Certainly, I think the key to this is really business fixed investment, as Mr Kichline said  earlier; if we don’t get the kind of growth that we are now anticipating, then the economy could  well falter later in the year  But we have had some fairly good news there  The orders figures  have held up well  McGraw-Hill survey figures have come in quite strong, the backlog of orders  has begun to build for nondefense capital equipment, so there seems to be a basis for assuming  continued growth     No, I think, Governor, that you were making a valid point in the sense that  there is a somewhat closer relationship between the growth in industrial production and real final  sales than between industrial production and, let’s say, the commodity portions of GNP at the  moment, because of the relatively sluggish growth in inventories  We expect that industrial  production will be rising relatively more rapidly in GNP later on as we start building inventories   The relationship is really quite close over the last couple of quarters, but by late this year, we  expect growth rates of industrial production in the 8 to 9 percent range as inventories are built     Well, I--aren’t they really basically the same?     The balance of gross national product has been heavily toward services, in  part because of the lack of investment in inventories  If there were more rapid rates of growth of  inventories, that sector of the economy would be growing somewhat more strongly, and so the  balance between services and goods would be somewhat more normal than it’s been recently     There hasn’t been too much; there have been some reports in that direction   We don’t have very great quantitative information, but you have the reports of purchasing  agents, which seem to be fairly concrete, and there has been some tendency in that direction, but  nobody is complaining very greatly yet, as far as I can tell     Deliverywise     On the part of consumers or on the part of businessmen?     5/17/77 - 15 -             It’s a little hard to evaluate since we have no real concrete information  But  it would seem to me that, given the generally available capacity and no significant indications of  shortages in the immediate future, I wouldn’t think that there would be too much stockpiling  except as you suggested, some possibility of anticipating further price increases     It’s a mixed picture  I hate to use that phrase, but it is  You mentioned the  contract settlements in the first quarter  They were not out of line with what we had been having  through 1976  But there has been a distinct speed-up in average hourly earnings, and we think  that this is a function in part of the composition of recent employment growth being oriented  toward high-wage industries, which happens to jack the figures up  But also, there are hints that  earnings may be rising a little more rapidly than we thought, and we have built in a slightly  larger projection of compensation for 1977 this time than last  It’s about 3/10 more     It’s going to be expensive  Obviously that goes directly into labor costs   The proposals, which carry through over a number of years and eventually involve no ceiling on  employer contributions, run into a fair amount of money  We have some rough estimates of the  amount  Most of that is far off, several years from now  The adjustments that we’ve already had  are fairly significant; let’s see--     It runs above 1 percent of payroll, Governor  I think, if I remember  correctly, the adjustments run 1, 1-1/2, and 2 percent of payroll over three succeeding years  "
428,1977-06-21,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Those figures, I must say, are not the best base that we have, but they come  from the CPI, and they show a fairly steady rate of increase in rentals over the last year      I don’t have that figure with me, I am afraid     6/21/77 - 2 -           I think that’s right  But, of course, the rise in the consumer price index, Mr  Chairman, has accelerated considerably recently because of the food and the--     The revision occurred basically in corporate profits repatriated from  overseas  Its counterpart on the product side is net exports  So two figures on the income side  were corporate profits, which now show a slightly larger rise than they did in the earlier  estimate; and net exports, which show a slightly stronger figure than before, and this resulted in  an upward adjustment in the GNP projection for the first quarter       Inventories were unchanged from the earlier figure     Final demand [was] revised up to a 42 percent real rate of growth for the  first quarter      It’s very heavily judgmental     The model doesn’t sustain capital spending as strongly as we--     Excuse me, Mr Chairman, the model does not sustain capital spending as  strongly as we do judgmentally into ’78     Of course, the relationship of consumption to capital spending and the  generation of income is obvious     Well, we have gone through a period in which the economic information  that’s come in has grown progressively stronger  The evidence, for example, of consumer  markets has been for a considerable degree of consumer optimism, apparently  Retail sales have  been very strong, and we have been going through a process recently of revising upward our  estimates of consumer outlays    The other area where we have shown additional strength to support continued [economic  growth] [has been] residential construction, which has proved to be substantially stronger than  we had thought it was [going] to be six months ago  And this has proved the basis for a very  strong growth as well  So that, basically, while the information on prices has been on the  negative side, the information on real demands has been on the positive side  And I think this  has been the key that has allowed us to get what otherwise might seem to be an inconsistent set  of adjustments, to wit--rising prices without any negative effect on real output       6/21/77 - 5 -           Yes, you are perfectly right  My view of the price situation has deteriorated   along with, I guess, my perception of what seems to be happening  You are perfectly right, also,  the adjustments at the moment are very largely in the food component  Those prices came in  much larger than we had anticipated for the last couple of months and have resulted in our  raising our estimate of second-quarter food price increases--doubling them from about the 6  percent range     12 for the quarter  And this is, in itself, a shock  There are elements in  wholesale food prices that are still to come through to retail--coffee is a particular case     What we have been getting unfortunately--well fortunately--     That’s correct  That’s exactly--     --so that, as the Chairman points out, the reductions we are seeing really are  going to prevent future increases from being as large as they would otherwise be     That’s correct  In that sense, Governor, I had commented that we may be  getting some of the price increases clustered in the second quarter that we had anticipated might  occur in the second half--     I think there’s a certain validity in that Governor--     I’m just searching for them  I’m sorry      I’m a little surprised at the rate of growth of the IVA in the first quarter that  you cite, Governor  I thought it was somewhat below that in the--actually below $30 billion   We would anticipate a more moderate rate of increase in the IVA because we do have some  moderation in the rate of price increase later in ’77, as the Chairman pointed out  I’m sorry,  we’ll have to look into this and I’ll have to get back  We’ll give you an answer on this     It could have, I don’t  know  I’ll have to look into it     Very small increase in the first quarter      6/21/77 - 12 -           We have a very moderate rate of increase in profits projected for the second  quarter     We’ll have to look at this a little more carefully, Governor, and report to  you       We have a rapid increase in federal grants to states, which are coming into  play in this period, so in a real sense this will underlie the increase in state and local spending  that we anticipate in this period  You’ve got a number of pieces of legislation that relate to  public service employment and other support programs, which move the federal grants to states  and localities from about a $4 billion rate at the moment to about a $12 billion rate, I presume, in  the first half of ’78  And that’s a big element in the swing in the budget and should be evident in  terms of stimulus to real activity     Well, we haven’t changed our view of the likely rates of inventory  investment of this--what you note is a reflection of the fact that we got a larger inventory  adjustment in the first quarter than we had been expecting  And rather than a moderate rate of  growth sustaining through the year, we now tend to have a slower rate of growth later in the  year  And basically the inventory-sales ratio at the end of the period remains about the same as  we had had it earlier  But we get there a little earlier, in a sense       6/21/77 - 14 -           Yes, that’s right  They do show a very different picture     I trust Dunlop puts a good deal of emphasis on that kind of analysis of the  wage market, that is, the differentials, and in fact that proved to be a very important factor in  areas like construction and raising wages     Excuse me, I think there’s no question that that’s going to have a  significance  That’s going to play some role in wage determination in the near future  My own  feeling about wages, I think, has deteriorated slightly because I’m afraid of the feedback from  the rapid increase in prices that we’ve had recently  And I think that’s been the most significant  factor in my own adjustment upward of the outlook for wages later on this year     As far as inventories are concerned, Governor, the first quarter was  extremely strong in part because it was a substantial shift--a swing in inventories from the fourth  [quarter] to the first  The actual rate of inventory accumulation in the second quarter is higher  than the first at a reasonably--not a high rate, certainly relative to GNP, but certainly within a  reasonable range relative to the growth in GNP     The net export situation in the second quarter is reflecting a continued high import of fuels,  a much larger import of fuels in the second quarter than we had anticipated, and this involved an  upward revision of the import figure and of further weakness in the net export figure for the  second quarter  Now, there is a bit of a long lag there, obviously, in getting figures on foreign  trade, and those could be revised by the time the figures come out  But they look like they’re  moving in that direction     We’ve revised upward our personal consumption figures for the second quarter and now  have a very strong increase in that sector, so I think we have a pretty strong rate of increase in  that sector  It’s certainly possible that the second quarter may turn out to be even stronger     The inventory figures we have are for April  They don’t show any great acceleration from  the earlier months, but they could move up rather swiftly       We have kept in touch following your comments last month, Governor   We kept in touch with this legislation and, obviously, you are perfectly right  The producers are  disturbed, quite worried--     They do anticipate--     They do anticipate action very soon on this legislation  And on the basis of  our discussions with Detroit, we have continued to assume that the legislation will get out very  soon and that they will be able to move on to ’78 production on schedule  And they are making  that assumption      At higher prices  "
455,1977-07-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     Well, as you point out, this is a matter of offsetting forces operating  On  the positive side, you point out that fiscal policy is becoming somewhat more stimulative, but  only rather briefly  It happens to be occurring over the next half year or so, and then the high-  employment budget begins to move back into balance again, in the absence of any new fiscal  initiatives, toward the end of 1978  And that’s one of the factors tending to retard growth     But on the negative side, we’ve had an extremely rapid recovery recently in residential  construction activity  Housing starts for single-family housing are at record levels  While there  probably will be some further gain in multifamily housing activity, it’s not likely to be providing  the kinds of support that the growth in single-family construction has provided us over the last  year, and this will begin to be a retarding factor as we move on     We have similarly had a fairly substantial recovery recently in inventory positions  Our  attitude, in part, reflects the recent very conservative attitudes on the part of businessmen toward  their inventory positions  But unless they change their views significantly, we feel that  inventories are likely to be providing less support to the economy from here on out  Similarly,  consumption--     It would be a very brief kind of activity, and possibly a destabilizing one at  that     7/19/77 - 9 -       I am sorry, sir--     That’s right  So basically, we have several sectors of the economy which  have provided very substantial support in the recent past which are beginning to fade  And  happily we have some components to the economy which are coming along to provide some  support and give us a rate of growth which, in our projections, seems like a reasonable path  toward higher employment     No, the unemployment rate at the moment is about 4-3/4 percent     This is our calculation and therefore a projection  Yes, and different from  the Council [of Economic Advisers]’s projection, to that extent  The key point here, of course, is  not so much the level, which will differ depending upon who does the calculation, but the  movements  And my presentation really was to suggest that, interestingly, the last half-year was  a period in which the full-employment [budget] moved into surplus [with] a rather large, rapid  increase in real GNP, and that it moves back into deficit because of fiscal initiatives and certain  other factors later this year  And [it] tends to act as some support, particularly in terms of the  grants to state and local governments     We expect 32 PhD dissertations on the subject, but at the moment we  don’t have any definitive way of answering that  That is certainly a possibility     We specialize  Mr Kichline will answer that one     Those rates are pretty high relative to the peaks that we obtained in  1973--particularly for manufacturing, a little less so for materials  Actually, the 88 percent is  very similar to the peak rate that we achieved for total manufacturing through 1973  Materials a  little better  Our peak in major materials was 93 percent     93 percent  So we remain a bit under there, and of course this is the sector  where we ran into trouble back in 1973     It’s 88     We’re 5 points below, so we still have a fair amount--not a fair but a  reasonable amount--of margin there  But certainly we will be approaching the position where  selective problems will be developing, I would think     In terms of your reference to unemployment, I think one has to, as you  know, recognize structural changes that have tended to occur in the labor market--tended to bias  up the unemployment rate  And, in addition, we’ve just recently been through a period of  enormous growth in the labor force, which was very largely made up of women, who tend to  have high frictional rates of unemployment  I think the 6-1/4 percent rate, really, for comparison  with past periods, has to be adjusted down somewhat     Well, 6-1/4 by capacity, yes     Not at 6-1/4, but as a goal  But the Council [of Economic Advisers] has  recognized--the government, Administration--has recognized the fact that a goal of 4 or 4-1/2 is  now unrealistic, and we’re talking about 5-1/2, 5-3/4, in that neighborhood     The mid-60s, roughly     What--     --about 1 percentage point difference     We will know more about that as we get reports in  Basically, we derive  our stock figures, our capacity figures, from producers themselves, and there is some lag in  getting that kind of information  But as we get it, of course, we will build that in, and it will  reflect their view of what the energy situation has done to their capacity     Well, the GNP inventory estimates attempt to make--     I’m sorry  The GNP inventory estimates attempt to make an adjustment for  shifts between LIFO and FIFO  They do surveys periodically to get some kind of estimate of the  percentage of firms using each of the types of accounting procedures and adjust for it  Now,  there is obviously a lag in that kind of calculation because they get that kind of information, at  best, yearly, and it’s probably not very accurate  But an effort is made to put out a figure which  is a real deflated inventory total on a consistent basis     Well, it’s certainly true that--     What bias do you mean, Mr Chairman?     You mean as prices tend to rise, biases over a period of time exist?     That’s correct  You would get that kind of thing  I think this is one of the  most difficult areas to calculate, to deflate and calculate a real figure  But looking at the various  kinds of inventory figures that we have available--the book-value figures are generally     7/19/77 - 17 -    undeflated and without adjustments for types of accounting procedures; and the GNP  numbers--the configuration certainly in a cyclical sense appears to be relatively similar  Over a  longer period of time, you do get a bias introduced, and that is a problem  There is a real  question about how much of a downward bias there may exist in inventory relative to sales     The book-value figures are not standardized  Nor are--     Absolutely correct     There is a deflated rate series on book value  Is that what you were talking  about?     There is a series on book value that is deflated fairly recently, and there is  the GNP deflated series     Unfortunately--I don’t want to [complicate] the discussion--but apparently  firms switch back and forth, though they are not supposed to  At the end of the year they use one  process, and then during the year they use another process  It’s apparently a terribly, terribly  messy business and tends to give you within-year swings in inventory  But certainly what you  suggested is the approach, and Commerce is attacking it that way--inadequately, I might  say--and we’re trying to keep up with it     Apparently there is some institutional problem in the sense that the people  who report to the Census Bureau on book-value inventories give slightly different figures     Yes, we’ve introduced the minimum wage change which apparently has  been agreed to by the Administration, that is $265 as of January 1, 1978  And that will be  indexed to straight-time earnings in manufacturing, and that affects our compensation figures in  earlier 1978 to the tune of--I don’t remember--it’s a couple of tenths     Well, I may be wrong on that--     Yes--     Let me correct my figure-- we’ve jacked up the first quarter of 1978 by  7/10 percentage point as a result of the minimum wage  It isn’t quite as bad as I said; 3/4 percent  effect of the minimum wage in the first quarter of ’78     7/19/77 - 21 -       We’ll try to run some very specific comparison, although it is rather  difficult since you do have to introduce various assumptions  But we will see what we can come  up with  Generally, what we do is evaluate individual sectors rather than the model as a whole,  because they involve assumptions--an individual sector--which differ between the judgmental  approach and the econometric  But we will do what we can to provide an answer     Starts there, but it gradually moves up     Close to the increase, slightly under 50  "
536,1977-10-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     A very good point  And my first observation, it appears to me that there  may have been a plotting error because one would think it would go directly through     I can see it being off part of the time, but it seems to me that it’s off the line  far too much  Now we have to assume that the general configuration [unintelligible]     One thing we can do, obviously, is to ignore the three-month moving  average     [Statement continues--see Appendix]     Yes  The auto sales on domestic was a 91 million annual rate in the first  10 days  We don’t get foreign sales, however, on a 10-day basis     Nothing outstanding  The most recent news has been on the good side   Housing starts have held up somewhat better than we had anticipated, and there seems to be a  certain sense--indications of continued demand  It’s true that there are some suggestions that  some of the overheated aspects of housing demand in California and a few other areas have  dampened, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing  The commitments figures are quite high, the  savings flow figures remain high, and it just appeared to us that there was enough in train to keep  us moving at a reasonably good rate over the next few quarters     It’s money and demand rather than supply     And demand rather than supply     It’s the projection     It shows an acceleration from the second quarter rate of increase, although  not an extremely strong rate of growth in real personal consumption outlays     The second quarter was extremely weak, Mr Chairman, and in real terms,  personal consumption expenditures rose by less than 2 percent at an annual rate, and even with a  reduced estimate for the third quarter, we probably may see a gain  I certainly hope so     That is the projection, yes, Governor  We have the rate of growth in the  real personal consumption expenditures at a rate of somewhat under 4 percent during the period   It’s not very rapid, and that’s manifested, of course, in the tendency for the saving rate to rise, at  least over the next couple of quarters  But the major factor supporting our projection in personal  consumption expenditures is our projection of real disposable income     Absolutely     10/17-18/77 - 17 -           You’re absolutely correct  "
588,1977-12-19,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     --was about 4 percent     That was real final demand     --was 47     There is a revision that will be coming out this afternoon that you may be  aware of  I haven’t seen it yet       [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     About 3-1/4 percent, as I recall     12/19-20/77 - 47 -           It’s slightly less than this year, Mr Chairman, about 1/2 million less, as I  recall, but substantially well above the normal, that is, the increases in population and long-term  trends in participation rates     Oh yes, closer to 3 million     Yes, we are--certainly in the housing area--at the upper range of forecasts  generally being made, and we think we have a reasonable defense of that position, and Mr Ettin  is prepared to provide that     But let me make a few comments first about autos, if I may  I mentioned that we are  concerned, obviously, with what appears to be a deterioration in the rate of sales of autos, and  that deterioration, when one looks at a chart, suggests that it was occurring well before the  introduction of the new models, which is now being blamed in part for the weakness  But a  couple of points, I think, must be taken into consideration  First, in the early part of the year, the  strength in auto sales was in part a rebound from the strike late last year  There was a deficit of  possibly a quarter of a million cars in about the fourth quarter, which was probably made up  early in the year  So that moderates somewhat the decline that appears     In terms of the underlying factors that give us some optimism, a major factor supporting  auto demand is household formation  Household formations are very much on the upside these  days  These demographic factors, according to our studies, suggest an increase in demand for  cars of about 150 thousand a year in that factor  The second factor is the second and additional     12/19-20/77 - 49 -         car syndrome in America, which continues, apparently unabated, as reflected in the vans and the  light trucks as well as cars     I think that’s a very good point, and that is reflected in part, of course, in  young people establishing their own household  But it is reflected as well in women having to  get to work and young people having to get to a job and expecting to have a car to get there--I  think a strong support to car purchases  And just to round out, we feel that our projections of  disposable income through the year are fully adequate to support the kinds of projections of auto  sales that we’ve made based upon past performance  And we have not really projected sales  rates in 1978 that are substantially higher than ’77--they’re about the same  They may not be  quite that strong; I’m not concerned about that overall  I think we’ll wait and see on that one   On housing, Mr Ettin is prepared     The staff has been following it  I’m afraid the staff that’s here is not expert  on that matter  We have someone following it, Mr Chairman     Yes, I’ll send you a table        Both have been growing recently     Both of them have been growing quite vigorously over the last couple of  quarters, as the Chairman points out  There’s an enormous variation month by month  You get a  sudden decline like last month, but basically they are both on an upward slant  "
629,1978-01-17,   [Statement--see Appendix]   
693,1978-03-21,"  The rate of growth in the labor force is at about 2-1/2 percent or slightly   under that, as opposed to slightly over 3 percent for last year  It has moderated somewhat       Not particularly  They have increased recently the size of the sample for   collecting labor force employment and unemployment data but that should have improved the data,  if anything  They have changed the pattern slightly, but basically there seems to be no significant  deterioration in the quality of those data    "
756,1978-05-16,"  Yes, there are just a couple of points I’d like to make  It’s recognized that  there has been an upward bias in the unemployment rate from various sources  The age/sex  structure of the labor force, for example, has over the last couple of decades tended to move the  unemployment rate that is the minimum rate of unemployment at high levels of income up  somewhat largely because of the large proportion of younger people and women--people who  move in and out of the labor force  That’s tending to move slightly in the other direction at this  point, so that the effect there is to dampen that bias somewhat  Another factor over the last couple  of years is the extension of unemployment benefits to well over a year, which has had a tendency,  we feel, to bias the rate up  But most of those programs have now been phased out, so that  probably has less of an effect now than it had, let’s say, late last year  Nevertheless, there are  variables operating to raise the rate  As Jim said, a very rough estimate we’ve been making  suggests that it is somewhere in the 5-1/2 percent range, but I wouldn’t want to give a point  estimate    "
808,1978-07-18,  The inventory situation doesn’t look like it contains any major significant  imbalances  There are some reports of a back-up in inventories of consumer nondurables  But that  is the sort of thing that usually can be run off rather quickly and we don’t seem to be seeing any  progressively larger problems developing  So for the moment things look reasonable; and our  projections implicitly assume that businessmen will continue to maintain a conservative posture    
833,1978-08-15,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       The major revision is likely to be in the net export figures and that's  substantially upward  That could be as large as, what--       Which would be possibly 3/4 of a percent or in that range       It's the second quarter, right, so [GNP growth] could well be above 8  percent for the second quarter       Obviously, that's rather a key element in the forecast  We maintain the  saving rate in the upper 5 percent range--somewhere around 57 percent toward the end of the  projection period  If the saving rate were to be significantly higher, obviously, the implications for  consumption and overall activity would be on the downside  Our feeling is that the relative price  movements, particularly for food, housing, services, and other necessary outlays have put so much  of a burden on disposable income that just to maintain the standard of living is going to require  people to keep their saving rate at a relatively low level during this period  And that's, I guess, the  key element in our projection       Debt burdens are high in historical terms  They are particularly high when  one incorporates mortgage debt burdens along with the others  However, there has been no  indication as yet of a deterioration in the quality of debt, and defaults don't show any significant  deterioration  Our feeling is that as long as income growth is maintained at a reasonable pace, we'll     8/15/78             8  probably be all right  But obviously, we have factored in this high debt burden and it's one of the  elements that led us to conclude that consumer outlays would not be rising at a very rapid pace over  the next year    "
956,1979-02-06," You're absolutely right And, of course, this  is one of those areas, among others, about which we know relatively  little We know almost nothing about this, particularly recently We  have an assumption of a 1 percent rate of increase [in productivity];  our feeling is that under the pressures of rapidly rising wages,  businessmen will be doing what they can to keep their costs under  control In fact, we're in a sense building in a slight adjustment of  employment-to-production levels We feel that this has gotten out of  hand to some extent over the last year, and [that efforts will be  directed toward] somewhat more effective control of the size of the  labor force and labor costs in 1979 and 1980 But, as you know, it's  not a terribly optimistic forecast at 1 percent for growth of  productivity    All right There are differences between our  estimates of the change in the high employment surplus/deficit and  those of the Council [of Economic Advisers] These are not  projections of levels; we specifically did not project levels because     2/6/79 -6-   there is a pretty universal sense that one can get almost any level  one likes depending upon the assumptions used And, in economic terns  or analytic terms, a change in the full employment surplus or deficit  is more significant But even taking that into consideration, for  1979 the numbers from the Council suggest a somewhat more stimulative  situation than we have [in our forecast] We have looked into this  very carefully and have talked to them in great detail Part of the  answer is that we have higher inflation assumptions than they do, but  that's only part of it The rest is apparently a rather technical  problem involving the fourth quarter of 1978 and the first quarter of  1979 in the sense that they got locked into a fourth-quarter estimate  of GNP which turned out to be weak, as you will recall They were  assuming something like 4 percent, and we got 6 percent They had  built up their high employment levels from that and then brought them  down I won't go into the details, but basically we feel we're right  for 1979 We're trying to work it out For 1980, we're really not  very far off; the change is in the same direction and the differences  are not major    I have three    There's a movement toward [restraint] in each  year by differing amounts  "
1003,1979-04-17," There was a big CCC payout in the fourth  quarter--I’m sorry    This kind of sawtooth pattern drives us insane,  but it is very common  "
1046,1979-05-22, I think mortgage interest rates probably played  a part in the differential  are driving that measure up; they don't play that kind of role in the  gross business fixed weight price index  weighting is probably the most significant variable   They have a heavier weight in the CPI and   I think the difference in  
1064,1979-06-27," We have a number of indications that the current quarter  and the remainder of the year will be weaker than we had been anticipating  Consumer demand has been particularly hard-hit Retail sales have been  sluggish all year; in real terms, they were down more than 5 percent from  December to May Major factors have been the weaker growth in  employment and income and the effects of inflation More recently, gas  shortages appear to have affected demand adversely, with widespread  reports of reduced sales We don’t have retail sales figures for June as yet,  but domestic auto sales in the first 20 days were at a 7-112 million annual  rate, down from 8-1/4 million in May and 91 million in the first quarter   There are also signs that business fixed investment may be losing  momentum Shipments of capital goods in the past two months were below  the Q1 average in real terms Construction activity is generally less  ebullient and truck sales have weakened substantially Some of this may be  strike- related, but the recent drops in capital goods orders and in  commitments for commercial and industrial construction suggest something  more fundamental   Housing activity continues sluggish Starts rose somewhat in May--by a  little more than 5 percent to 18 million--but the slight rebound was entirely  in the erratic multifamily category Single-family starts edged down further  and housing activity remains well below the 21 million rate recorded in the  fourth quarter   It appears that we may be getting some inventory backup as a result of  weaker demand Book value inventory figures were up sharply in April  ($647b), particularly in manufacturing ($39b) and in autos and trade  ($lob) Auto stocks rose sharply further in May--by about 6 percent  Again, some of this may have reflected strikes   The price picture remains bleak Despite a more moderate food price  rise, the CPI was up 11 percent in May, with very sharp increases for  gasoline and fuel oil--up 5 percent--as well as for homeownership costs and  new car prices The price of gasoline in May was 20 percent--not an annual  rate--above the December price With larger energy price rises now in  prospect and upward pressure on grain prices as a result of crop conditions     6/27/19 2   in the USSR, it appears that we can look for little easing of inflation late1  this year   On balance, a small negative GNP appears in the cards for the current  quarter With the deterioration of consumer attitudes, further price rises,  and a likely weakening of business spending, somewhat larger declines in  GNP over the new few quarters have also become increasingly likely That  concludes my remarks   [Secretary’s note The staff briefings ended with a report by Mr Axilrod]  "
1089,1979-07-11," I'm responsible for the recovery! It's true  that the contraction is a rather sluggish one and our assumption of  the lack of fiscal initiatives involves less stimulus from government  activity--other than the automatic stabilizers operating, which are an  offset in effect  "
1159,1979-08-14," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   No change in fiscal policy other than the automatic adjustments   And the present targets on monetary policy   Right [Given] the contraction that we've projected--which affects unemployment benefits most importantly in an automatic way but social security benefits to some minor degree and food stamps and so on--the total impact is about $1-3/4 billion automatically on transfer payments The receipts are adjusted down by about $3 billion, I think, but I don't have those figures [in front of me] I will have to check that   That is for fiscal year 1980   Yes, that's right   Well, obviously the growth in the labor force is a significant element in our projection procedure We don't have any concrete evidence from current economic series indicating layoffs of any substantial magnitude beyond the employment figures that I referred to--that is, the cut in manufacturing employment by about 130,000 over the last few months   We have those and they don't show any really dramatic changes Our assumption is that labor force growth will be quite moderate in the coming year--around 1-1/2 percent, which is about half the rate it was in 1978 Characteristically the participation of women has not suffered particularly during recent recessions That's a function of social and other considerations, as well as the fact that women tend to go into employment sectors which continue growing But basically we are projecting a fairly stable overall participation rate That would mean a continued decline in the participation rate of adult males, particularly older adult males and a continued rise, although at a more moderate rate, for women And I would consider our projections of labor force growth to be on the conservative side The projections of the employment side, of course, fall out of our production projections   You mean that they would tend to stay or continue--   Basically, the participation rate of the adult men, let's say those age 25 to 54--what we generally call the core of the adult male labor force--tends to remain pretty stable, and we would expect it to remain stable There's a certain degree of discouragement reflected in those who are more marginal members of the labor force in that group; they move out [of the labor force statistics] when they're not looking for work But basically the decline that we get in the [adult male] participation rate when the labor market weakens is among people who are older They are making decisions about whether to stay in or not When the employment market is strong and there are attractive job opportunities those older workers tend to stay in When things look poor and the opportunities are not there, they tend to drop out So we tend to see some accelerated decline in the participation of men in the age 55 and over group We would expect that the participation rates would be held up in part by the degree of inflation--the pressure on household incomes That tends to result in women particularly looking for jobs or staying in the labor market   I certainly hope so, in a sense My social conscience is at war with my economic view of [the situation] The lack of a rise in unemployment, which is the other side of the coin of a cut in employment, is reflected in the enormous deterioration of productivity in the last couple of quarters Obviously, if one believes the output figures, then employers have not rationalized their labor forces yet; they have not adjusted Possibly this reflects the fact that they were taken by surprise by the decline in output Possibly they want to hold off for a while In any event, I would think that rational behavior would dictate substantial cuts in employment over the next couple of quarters   That's correct But when they look at their books and see what happened to profits in Q1 and Q2--and probably will happen to profits in Q3--given the employment levels that currently exist in the face of declining output, I think those [numbers] are going to be persuasive arguments to them to cut back on employment   It's a bit worse than average but you are quite right, Governor Teeters, that the pattern is not unusual   That's correct This one seems to be a little worse; the decline in productivity is a bit more dramatic   I think you are quite right, in the sense that they not only offset one another in some respect but also that the degree of confidence we hold in our forecasts [of those two measures] is very similar However, that degree of confidence is extremely low   I'll speak first about inventories and I will let Mr Truman attack the problems of projecting net exports Quite frankly, our projections of inventories are determined largely by  -17-    8/14/79  business behavior in regard to their management of stocks in recent years Businessmen have tended to be quite conservative; they have tended to respond very quickly to their perception of any backup in stocks We saw a number of very small, very rapid adjustments in production, too, whenever there was an indication of stock building We are projecting a continuation of that behavior There are indications that inventories had built up in June and in automobiles undoubtedly in July also There has been some buildup in inventories in real terms elsewhere We think production adjustments are occurring rather rapidly, but they are not very large so they can be put out of the way rather quickly And we would expect that businessmen will attempt to continue to keep their stocks more or less in line with sales--in fact on the conservative side over the projection period But we have a number of equations to forecast, and I don't put any more credence in those equations than I do in this kind of visceral judgment based upon recent past performance   The level is fairly high and the burden is a bit higher than it was back then [Mike], do you have those figures?   That's a record level   The article in the New York Federal Reserve [publication] makes a point that the simple view of this probably overstates the burden of debt   Yes, that's correct The July increase was quite small--04 both for total sales and sales ex-autos Both May and June were revised up, which suggests that the second quarter consumption figures will not be as weak as we had thought earlier   Other things equal, they probably would revise GNP up by 1 percent or so   It's fairly significant But as I pointed out, the pattern is still a relatively weak one   Well, we still have differences in the level, and those differences are a reflection of a different approach in calculating the figures We tend to move generally in harmony, however, with the Council's movements at this point   We both show a rising surplus, yes I think that's really the most significant way of assessing these numbers To come back to this issue of how much of a loss as a result of the recession, the projected decline in the deficit increases in our projection between '79 and '80 by about $10 billion and the high employment move is an additional $17 or $18 billion I guess a very simplistic view would be to add those and it comes close to $30 billion in fiscal loss But we will calculate that carefully for you and send a note along "
1265,1979-11-20, In a sense the productivity factors have been  changed  
1321,1980-02-04," Basically it is associated with our assumptions or conclusions about more rational behavior by employers in regard to their staffing The deterioration in productivity is the other side of the coin of this tremendous increase in employment relative to the lack of growth in output We're anticipating that the pressures of rising costs and the evident lack of strength in markets over the next couple of quarters will persuade employers that they are overstaffed and that, therefore, they will be laying off employees and trying to bring their costs better into line, which will show up in a somewhat improved productivity performance But as you will note, we have negative productivity throughout 1980 It just isn't as bad as it was in 1979   That is true, yes  -41-    2/4-5/80 "
1495,1980-07-09," Well, the point you made earlier applies to virtually all of the variables in the sense that we get low growth in disposable income in part because of the sluggish improvement in employment, which is related to the sluggish improvement in output, which is consistent with the sluggish improvement in productivity The question is Where does one get aboard the--   Of course, any improvement in productivity performance would give us the potential for a greater increase in real income In a sense that's partially endogenous and partially exogenous Our projection of sluggish productivity growth is consistent, as I mentioned earlier, with our projection of the very sluggish recovery in output growth But it's also consistent with the longer-term problems that seem to be plaguing productivity performance We have an underlying trend rate of growth of productivity of less than 1 percent at this point If productivity were performing, let's say, as we thought it was back in the late '50s and '60s--at another 1-1/2 or 2 percentage points above that--that would give us the potential for a considerably improved outlook So that could be very significant   Well, over the longer haul, obviously, that's correct Over the short run it would not be a significant variable   The capital/labor ratio, as I'm sure you know, has deteriorated in recent decades and people feel that that has played a significant role in the deterioration of productivity But a lot of other factors appear to be operating as well   Well, several things are operating One factor is the behavior of energy and food [prices], and I think we ought to abstract from those But even [so] we had a very significant deceleration Part of the answer is the very vigorous recovery in output and productivity during that period The productivity swing between 1974 and 1975 was about 8 percentage points; it went from about a 3-1/2 percent decline to a 4-1/2 percent increase We are figuring on a recovery in productivity of a little more than half that So in a sense we don't get the improvement in unit labor costs and the removal of pressure on prices that such productivity--   Well, yes   I don't have [compensation figures] quarterly; I have hourly wages figures   That was a very important component We had an explosion and then a deflation, so that played a significant role temporarily A combination of forces was operating that I'm afraid cannot be exactly disassociated from one another   It is very deeply related I think that's absolutely correct   We'd also have a good deal less pressure on unit labor costs and prices and presumably the ability, therefore, to move into a different fiscal position as well   But what we have provides the basis for allowing that, I believe   I think it's about 6 percent Governor Gramley, do you recall?   Yes, we'd be consistent with that   That's correct   That's correct, and we do build in a calculation of the effects of mix on the compensation figures The average hourly earnings index itself declines between '80 and '81 by slightly more than 1 percent I don't have a figure for the fourth quarter '81; it would be a bit more than that, though, as opposed to a compensation decline over that same period of 03 So the point you're making is absolutely correct The underlying wage adjustment has to be greater than the compensation decline that we show   As far as the first point is concerned, it's always possible that we are estimating capacity incorrectly But we have tended to scale down the effective capacity level in our index by introducing a factor of downtime that is much greater than we had earlier So I think we're far more realistic in terms of effective capacity than we were, let's say, 6 years ago As far as the latter point is concerned, certainly that [possibility] is there The tendency to shift toward capital because of the [high] relative price of labor versus capital has existed and continues to exist We have tried to build that in What we've viewing here is a cyclical performance rather than the longer-term secular considerations which really bear upon that to a greater degree We also are moving out of a period in which pollution control and related expenditures have borne such a heavy weight relative to total expenditures, as they did a few years ago So that's a factor lowering the possibility for [business investment] expenditures   Combined "
1600,1980-10-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   We haven't plotted it monthly, Mr Chairman, but it does imply some contraction in activity toward the end of the year, in November and December, seasonally adjusted  -21-    10/21/80   We assume that housing starts will drop off rather sharply   Activity and spending continue for a while, and that's why we get as much increase as we do in GNP We are assuming very little growth in personal consumption expenditures--actually none --for the fourth quarter We don't assume any substantial increase in employment or income during that period The saving rate has already dropped in the third quarter; we don't expect any further decline in that, or nothing major So that's the major element We also won't be getting the kind of help from the foreign trade sector that we have had   It probably would by December because we come into the fourth quarter at a rising slope, so I think we have to get some [decline]   I would think industrial production would not be as weak That's right Industrial production was down about 2-1/2 percent in the third quarter--about 10 percent at an annual rate And I would think we'd begin to get some pickup from that toward the end of this quarter and so we'd come into the fourth quarter at a higher level and that would hold pretty well We are not anticipating the continued strength in spending for automobiles and other consumer durable goods that we were getting Basically, that's the sector showing weakness "
1736,1981-02-02," They were down 24 percent Do you have that number?   940,000 "
1923,1981-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we have the expert here, Mike Prell Our interest rate assumptions are for relatively little change from the current rates but Mike can elaborate on that   The budgetary deficit is not one of all joy The Administration has moved to adjust upward its estimate of the fiscal '82 budget [deficit] to about $60 billion from what had earlier been $40 plus billion Our estimate is a deficit of about $88 billion for that period The major differences are the assumptions, or shall we say conclusions, regarding the state of the economy and its implications for spending and receipts, and we have some higher assumptions for interest rates as well On an NIA basis, as we move to the second half of '82 calendar year, we really begin to see the effect of the second stage of the tax cut--that is, the 10 percent phase that comes in on July 1 of '82 And we have a deficit that runs about $150 billion on an NIA basis for the second half of '82 That's a very substantial shift in those terms and in high employment terms as well   $106 billion   That's fiscal year   Yes, it should be next week Well, GNP comes out on the 19th, which is tomorrow The retail sales figures came out with a 13 percent increase, but a very substantial amount of that gain was a rebound in car sales from the very low post-rebate level of activity The sales rate in any realistic sense is still very weak It is sufficiently weak to result in producers adjusting down their assembly rates significantly Excluding automobiles and household repair kinds of expenditures, retail sales were about unchanged in current dollar terms between--  -21-    8/18/81   It looks as if there is about a balance as far as the GNP figures are concerned There were some upward revisions in retail sales, and some downward revisions in housing are likely; in general it appears as though it might well be a wash and end up close to what we have "
1974,1981-11-17," 840,000 is our low in [the quarter]  SPEAKER(?) We'll have a bald eagle! "
2030,1982-02-01," Yes, it is apparently a fairly common part of a limited number of such agreements so far, and one can understand why In a sense it's one of the things the union is trading away; that is, the union is willing to accept a generally reduced fixed rate of increase in wages leaning heavily, let's say, on cost of living adjustments But they want the opportunity to come back in to take advantage of any improved profit position of corporations And I think your point is well taken that it creates greater flexibility and a more rapid response of wages to any change in demand Usually there is a lag situation with 3-year contracts; it takes a while for any tightening of the labor market to be evident in a wage adjustment I think this will occur more rapidly but, of course, it depends in a sense on how tight labor markets get Our forecast certainly does not suggest an environment that would be conducive to very effective bargaining on the part of labor   Well, it's not entirely in the future, but you're perfectly right that in large degree it is We did have a reduction in compensation over this past year As I noted in my presentation, I think one has to look through that compensation figure a little to the wage figures behind it The wage rate figures improved somewhat more than compensation last year We had an $18 billion social security tax increase that raised compensation costs by about 3/4 of a point; and if we adjust for that, we have a better performance of compensation Beyond that, we expect further improvements in the rate of increase in wages We have an extremely poor labor market projected 9 percent unemployment persisting through another couple of years This will have been, by the end of the projection period, about 4 years in which the unemployment rate was higher than anybody's [estimate of the] natural rate that I'm aware of in any event And the logic leads us to feel that this is going to result in further easing in wages [Looking ahead,] we have    2/1-2/82  as well less of the self-inflicted damage that occurs when social security taxes are raised We have a relatively small tax increase of about $5 billion this year as opposed to last year's $18 billion and a relatively small increase next year as well So, we think things are working in our favor   Well, it's hard to know, but one can--   The kinds of adjustments that President Solomon mentioned a few minutes ago suggest that we finally are getting the wage adjustments that we were really hoping for   You're perfectly right In analyzing those industries where institutional wage adjustments remain [to be made], they did tend to be characterized--in industries that were under very substantial pressure--by market pressure of one sort of another There are other sectors, for example petroleum, where a wage adjustment apparently occurred which was in line with the kinds of inflationary wage increases that have been occurring in recent years But we expect spillover effects from this [pressure] It creates an atmosphere in which bargaining is done against standards that are less inflationary than in the past And we feel this will have an effect In addition, of course, we have had a cost-of-living pattern recently that has been somewhat less inflationary; it has been rising somewhat less rapidly That has a feedback effect as well   That's generally true of wages as well They have held up really quite well in the services sector We feel that market considerations will be operating there; that is, the generally slack product and services markets and relatively slow growth in real income will be operating to damp prices somewhat   The last real figure would be the fourth quarter   Yes   I would think it's an aberration There's a certain amount of--   We were involved [in a side conversation] here The answer, I think, is yes If people don't spend money on consumption items, it shows up in the saving rate "
2107,1982-06-30, [Statement--see Appendix] 
2291,1983-02-08," No, not a drop but a slightly smaller rise   Well, we are faced with a situation in which our forecast is substantially under the average performance of a recovery period--explicitly, about half the rate of growth in the first year compared to that in the average recovery in postwar expansions Second, we have been through a period in which the trend rate in productivity, at least as best we can measure it, has been very weak Our feeling is that trend productivity may be in the 1 percent range at this point Earlier in the postwar period productivity rates normally ran about 2-1/2 percent So, in a sense, we're operating around a different slope I think those two factors play rather important roles President Solomon, we are forecasting a productivity increase of 2-1/2 percent in 1983 and of 1-1/2 percent in 1984 So, the rate of increase shown on the chart does come down a bit   It's probably negative   I think you're right I don't have the numbers at my fingertips but I think in general there is a tendency to understate the vigor of the recovery One just doesn't see the sources of additional strength We're still hampered by that particular problem; when one looks at the various components and adds them up, one gets a rather restrained recovery   That is certainly true And it does appear that the rate of inventory liquidation in the fourth quarter is larger than the Commerce Department estimated, or that we estimated as well, from    2/8-9/83  the data available at that point And that would suggest that a stronger first quarter--that is, a rebound in activity--would not be unlikely The question is What are the fundamental forces sustaining that growth? Essentially, the information that has become available just doesn't suggest to us that there is very much additional [strength]; it is possible that a slightly stronger outlook is in prospect but nothing has changed our view of the forces that are generating income and building activity   That's correct   Yes   They make a good deal of sense and they're a source of considerable concern to us, basically In regard to the point about effective capacity and the factory that can be used on line, we have been very concerned about this and have been looking at it industry-by-industry I must add that at this point it's quite a judgment call, but it appears to us that a realistic assessment of capacity that really should be considered obsolete or not likely to be usable would change our capacity utilization figures by about one percent We'll know more when we get our annual survey In that survey, we essentially ask businessmen about what they consider their    2/8-9/83  real capacity and, presumably and hopefully, we get a realistic assessment at that point Nevertheless, I'm inclined to think there's a certain amount of elasticity cyclically in any event--that as things begin to pick up, what was considered obsolete capacity may be brought back on line   Yes, we end up at about 74 percent as I recall   Let me just make a brief comment about the use of electric power That's really relevant on a month-by-month basis It's far [less relevant] in the long term because electric power consumption is really used just within a year to [estimate] these figures from month-to-month Over a longer period of time we drop out the electric power and use shipments and physical measures of activity So, the version that resulted from the run-up in oil prices in '72 presumably is taken into due consideration by use of other than    2/8-9/83  electric power data later But to the extent that these figures distort the month-to-month [changes], as you might guess, we do have problems and have to adjust for it "
2316,1983-03-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   The smoothness is the nature of forecasting, Mr Chairman   CCC has had a tendency in the last 3 years approximately to rise very, very sharply toward year-end, much more rapidly than it had historically And that's one of the problems in the sense that if it had been going on long enough it would be in the seasonals and it would be damped But as it stands, we have tended to get these huge payouts in the fourth quarter and then a smaller rate of payout in the first quarter for the last couple of years, and this has tended to distort the numbers This will be less of a factor next year But for the time being, it really does distort   They've been running about 3 to 3-1/4 percent in both quarters So, it's fairly moderate It suggests that--   Leaving out CCC   Leaving in other components of government, however--just taking out CCC  -23-    3/28-29/83   Oh, there are   Well, it changes the pattern If you exclude net exports, you'd get a slightly larger deceleration, but it doesn't change the fundamental picture Excuse me, final sales excluding net exports were about 4 percent in the fourth quarter and about 3-1/4 percent in the first So, it's in the same ballpark, I suppose   No, we don't really This is a forecast and it's a forecast based upon the fact that the inventory level in real terms has been reduced to at least, or actually below, pre-recession levels; it's extremely low The inventory/sales ratios have been brought down considerably There are indications in some very key sectors, such as automobiles and steel, that the end of liquidation is at hand and they're beginning to build a little And these factors are sufficient to indicate that we've just about run the course on our inventory liquidation We have some liquidation actually in the total continuing for the next several months, but the rate of liquidation decelerates considerably and by the end of the second quarter is no longer a factor   Well, the exchange rate too   It's an '83 event Breaking it down into equipment versus construction--that's important because they are really in different phases--we expect a recovery in purchases of business equipment to start very shortly, within the next quarter roughly Looking back at past relationships between purchases of business equipment and production, there tends to be something like a one-quarter lag there Typically, it starts with purchases of trucks, cars, office equipment--off-the-shelf kinds of items But we have a rather moderate turnaround occurring On the nonresidential construction end of things, we expect weakness to continue throughout '83 and then relative stability in '84   Well, there was a one-month jump in January--   Up But the vacancy rates on commercial buildings have been rising and are quite high And we feel that there's a fairly long digestion time involved, given--   Well, the January spending figure was up   There was a flattening out, an indication that they were weakening But there was not a sharp decline, no   I think the initial response might well be in consumer expenditures, in terms of the effect on disposable income, [which might tend] to damp the growth somewhat The longer-term response is, of course, a function of changes in attitudes and market perceptions of the implications of these changes I think they would be positive over the longer run, but I do think the first response would be to slow down the recovery somewhat   Well, that would depend on how large--   Oh, the third stage alone No, I don't think so The third stage is not really that big As it stands now we're talking about something in the neighborhood of a net effect of about $30 billion at an annual rate for Q3 from that alone I don't think that would undermine the growth momentum overly   That would be mostly in the form of transfers and, therefore, will show up in state and local purchases   Well, that gets a bit obscure; I think there is a promise that a good deal of it is so dedicated, but I don't know if all of it is   Mass transit, yes It's not a big item in any event Wait a minute No, I'm sorry that's the bill that's [unintelligible]; the jobs bill is not so big   The jobs bill is $46 billion over a 3-year period it reaches a maximum in 1984 of about $3 billion of expenditures   That's an interesting question We don't have a very vigorous forecast and it's already in a sense damped by historically high interest rates, particularly in real terms, whatever that means Further movement in that direction could well have a significant effect on attitudes; it depends on the degree, I think It's one of those extremely difficult questions to answer because business attitudes are likely to be very sensitive at this time   On wage rates do you mean?   The BLS does collect state and local data--with a fair lag, but still the data are available Unfortunately, I'm not really familiar with what they've been showing recently   The question is--   Yes, rates in the market have been moving up "
2352,1983-05-24," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the lower one, always the lower one! The deflator for the first quarter was distorted by very sharp swings in net exports, particularly the importation of fuels, which was down sharply We expect that figure to move back into line in the second quarter We think the CPI and the fixed weight price index are a better measure of what was happening to fundamental price movements in the first quarter And those were quite good indeed; they were in the 2 to 3 percent range   Theoretically, both capture it   Yes, it should The attempt certainly is made to capture the actual increases in prices The deflator is a bit more sensitive to shifts in weights The rising increases in the proportion of defense spending would affect that index somewhat more But actually over the last half year or so defense spending has lagged There has been no increase since the third quarter of last year, and we are rather expecting a surge in outlays because this was supposed to be the big year for procurement   It seems sad that when capacity is way up prices run up sharply and when capacity is down prices run up sharply It sounds like a Catch-22 situation I hadn't heard that particular argument   Yes The first year is when we get a major kick in output and our projections fall short of the average for the first year of recovery; it's about 70 percent or so Our projections make it up in a sense in the second year when on average recoveries begin to lose some of their steam and we are maintaining the same rate of increase in the second year as in the first We have increases of 4-3/4 percent in both the first and second year of the recovery   Well, we have [only] the first quarter; I'm addressing myself to our projections of the first year   The only thing we have to date, Mr Chairman, is the first quarter and that was a rather modest increase of 2-1/2 percent, which is well below the typical rate   Incorporating the first and second quarters together probably brings us fairly close to the average   For industrial production and employment--the figures for which we have monthly data--that's correct They're really quite consistent with the average recovery at this point   As I recall, excluding the CCC gets you something in the neighborhood of 3 to 3-1/2 percent for the last couple of quarters I don't have GNP excluding CCC; I have the final sales excluding CCC That was 33 percent in the fourth quarter, 3 percent in the first quarter, and we're [estimating] 27 percent in the second quarter    5/24/83   Well, final sales certainly are stronger in the first quarter when one makes that adjustment and certainly weaker in the fourth quarter because CCC outlays were enormously high in the fourth quarter So, you get a somewhat more stable pattern Final sales trail off a bit in our projection in the second quarter largely because of the net export situation Basically it's a situation, depending on what you take out, where we seem to get a pattern that's reasonably stable, excluding CCC, at around 3 percent over the last several quarters   I think I'll let Mr Truman answer; it's his forecast   One can never be confident about a sector like inventories because there is so much of the visceral in it What is a reasonable level of stock is very much in the eyes of the businessman and his expectations about the outlook We are assuming a reasonably conservative inventory posture over the next year and a half, largely because we feel businessmen first of all have been badly burned in their inventory policies recently, and secondly because the cost of holding inventories remains relatively high given our assumptions about interest rates Essentially, we're saying that inventory investment is not going to be a big force for expansion The behavior of inventories recently, as typically, has been the major factor turning the economy around We've had a rather typical deceleration of inventory liquidation, which gives us an increase in GNP That was a big factor in the first quarter Excluding inventory liquidation-- that is, looking at final sales--it was a 13 percent increase We now are assuming that inventories will stabilize beyond the second quarter and start rising but at a relatively moderate rate   I will I think it was of use in the sense that while a diversity of opinions was represented, one did get a central tendency both about the residential construction activity and housing starts The forecasts that were quoted appeared to range very closely to our own expectations for 1983 in terms of housing starts And we got some confirming indication about expectations for commercial and industrial construction--that is, that they were turning down and that expectations were rather weak We found them generally useful   About 3-1/2 percent   The productivity performance over this year--I think it's 36 percent that we are forecasting--is really a cyclical rebound in productivity that reflects the more efficient use of both capital and labor as output increases And it's not an unusual performance The underlying trend productivity that we have is not really much better than what we had been having recently We've jacked up our trend productivity just a bit We've been using a figure of about 3/4 of a point--a very, very poor productivity trend-- until fairly recently The underlying figures seem to suggest a little improvement Now we're using something like one percent; that's really not very much better And our forecast does not assume a large productivity increase in 1984 We get back down toward the trend of about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent toward 1984 So, we're really not leaning on any very significant improvement in our fundamental productivity trend to get our inflation forecast It's really a function more of the fact that we have a weak labor market, which we project will continue through the entire forecast period We have had very good price performance Wage negotiations have a tendency to be  -14-    5/24/83  backward-looking and they are now looking back at very small increases in the cost of living And we think that will be helping the overall performance of wages and, therefore, labor costs and prices over this period In addition, of course, we have been and still are benefiting from the strength of the dollar and its implications for both imports and the competition of those imports with domestic producers So, we have had a lot of things going for us and they are still going for us And we think the inflation outlook is really very good, at least through this year, and we're assuming no deterioration in 1984 but no further improvement either We stabilized our price projection at 3-1/4 percent in 1984 as well   It's back fairly close to the long-term trend, which is a relatively poor trend performance I hope you're right   Well, that's the third stage of the--   Yes, the tax reduction There have been discussions of capping it or removing it and so on It seems rather late at this point to accomplish very much   Well, I would say certainly 90 to 95 percent   That's certainly one fairly large source of additional funds that is up for discussion I think there will be some attempt possibly to replace the withholding of interest and dividends with some other kind of increase in taxes and so--  SPEAKER(?) Part of the banks-- "
2389,1983-07-12," It goes slightly positive, President Solomon   Thank you This is part of a series of such adjustments that have occurred over the years, periodically We will be bringing the new numbers out later this month They involve an adjustment in capital and capacity utilization figures, utilizing all sorts of data that we can put our hands on industry data, survey data from McGraw-Hill, data from our own Census Bureau survey, and so on It involves a revision of capital stock, which raises the capacity utilization rate by 1-2/3 percentage points at the current time There are substantially larger increases in some industries, particularly some hard goods industries, but on balance it really doesn't change the situation dramatically I might say that we've had to be rather conservative in the way we approach these adjustments, particularly in the middle of a contraction phase of the cycle, because what firms say they are putting out of production today they may change their minds on six months down the line if production increases considerably So, we tend to be rather cautious about it But, generally, that is the nature of the adjustment   I think the capacity utilization rate changes 5 percentage points But, of course, it remains relatively low, so that [the reduction] doesn't have any particular significance for pressures on that industry    7/12-13/83 -5-   I don't think it's a fundamental [difference in] unit labor costs trends, although there are differences in the views of productivity trends We may be a little more optimistic in our view of productivity than some, but not a great deal because we remain rather conservative Our view is that long-term productivity growth at this point is just a little over 1 percent, up about a half point from where it was assumed to be but certainly nothing like the kinds of productivity [trends] that we had earlier I think it's more a function of a reading of the implications of the speed of recovery and its effect on wage adjustments and pricing performance I must say that our staff, in evaluating past performance and utilizing whatever quantitative tools we have available, tends to come out with rather optimistic results about the inflation outlook--somewhat more optimistic, in fact, than we have incorporated here   I think those are relatively stable in real terms   No, labor force growth doesn't drop off sharply; actually, it increases quite a bit We feel that a 4-1/4 percent increase in GNP is close to 2 percent above capacity growth and that this decline in the unemployment rate of about 3/4 of a point is historically reasonable using something like an Okun's law calculation   Our productivity is low, certainly based on earlier postwar experience, [such as] in the '60s when productivity was rising [unintelligible] percent or so It is now in the [1-1/4] percent range But it is higher than it was running in the 1970s; it is twice as high, and that of course plays a role That is, in fact, relatively low productivity But incorporating that productivity trend into the calculation--if one wants to take this kind of mechanical, that is, purely the Okun's law approach--I think does give us a decline of something like that magnitude for a rate of [GNP] increase of 4-1/4 percent   No, I don't think so We still have fairly vigorous productivity gains In manufacturing, productivity is rising certainly 4 percent or [even] above that   The growth in capital outlays? Well, the only thing we have hard evidence on at the moment is new orders for nondefense capital equipment, which shows a pretty vigorous turnaround Now, that doesn't tell us much about what is going to happen in 1984 but it tends to be a reasonably good lead indicator for the near term   I think they have started to fall Excuse me, they have turned around   Yes, you can Our forecasts for capital spending are based upon relationships with real output and the multiple effects of demand on capital outlays And in this case they are pretty much in line with past performance   No, the new orders figure is for nondefense equipment alone   Obviously, we really don't have a great deal to go on, but we had some data for June employment and related production data They already indicated that we're coming into the third quarter with a very considerable degree of momentum We ran through some arithmetic exercises making rather conservative assumptions about the next couple of months They provide the basis for, I think, a conservative estimate of the GNP increase or at least an increase in non-agricultural output of this general magnitude  -12-    7/12-13/83 "
2527,1984-01-30," That's about right, if I remember correctly No, it's about 2 percent   I'm sorry, that's right We have a 1 percent increase in participation--about a 1 percent increase in population   Well, we've had a very, very substantial increase in business fixed investment recently In fact, it has been in the phenomenal range and we don't expect that to continue We think that some of the increases that have occurred over the last few months are a surge in one-time activity But there is a very widespread, and we think very fundamental, increase in expenditures And what we have projected is a fairly strong recovery by historical standards The assumption is that a number of factors have operated to reduce the relative cost of capital--the stock market rise, tax law changes for accelerated depreciation, and so on--and apparently have laid the basis for a considerable recovery in capital outlays We have it moderating through 1985   Well, we certainly have data on the composition in broad terms Over the last couple of quarters, the third and fourth quarters of this past year, producers durable equipment rose by annual rates of 22 percent and 28 percent respectively During the same periods the outlays for structures were [up] about 10 percent, which is fairly strong The outlays were rather concentrated in public utilities; commercial activities have not been so strong In terms of further detail, we have some shipments and orders figures that show fairly strong growth in heavy non-electrical machinery, communications equipment and--of all strange things--farming equipment; but the growth is fairly widely distributed   For producers durable equipment we have projected increases in the 12 to 15 percent range for 1984 and in the 6 to 8 percent range for 1985   They came out at 1000 am   They were up 8 percent "

2608,1984-07-16," Well, it's hard in any absolute sense to evaluate them They have shown a reasonable pattern There is no question that they have been remarkably optimistic in measuring the rate of [increase] and they have been somewhat lower than the employment cost index, which is another measure of wages and other changes for a broader group including supervisors and white collar workers Those data have been showing something closer to the 6 percent rate It's conceivable that this has a somewhat downward bias because it includes just production workers Essentially, other than that, I don't have any basis for questioning them except that they look awfully good   Yes, something of a credibility gap   It's another one of those things that are very difficult to grab hold of Kendrick, I think, would be one of the first to admit that in many areas we don't have any very hard [data] that address the issue of productivity growth He has demographics and he has a couple of other things, but when you cumulate them they only make up a relatively small proportion of the forces that really determine productivity gains As you point out, productivity in the early postwar years of the 1950s was in the 2-1/2 percent range and there has been a progressive deterioration through the postwar years How do we evaluate what we have? Obviously, productivity has a tendency to swing very wildly during a cycle With real GNP increases of 9 percent we're going to have a different productivity performance than when GNP growth is 4 percent First-quarter productivity appears to be at about a 4 percent rate We have a model--I say this with a certain temerity--which attempts to characterize the cyclical behavior of productivity consistent with the trend; and the numbers that we are getting at the moment still appear to be consistent with an underlying trend in productivity, when adjusted for cyclical performance, in the 1-1/4 percent range There is certainly reason to argue that there is the prospect for an improved productivity trend That sort of thing takes time, however The introduction of new technology, for example, has a marginal [effect] It doesn't overwhelmingly change the character of the production process overnight The effect of the maturing of the labor force again is a slow accretion in productivity We just don't see enough solid evidence yet to convince us that a significantly higher productivity trend than we have been able to measure is warranted I think we will know a great deal more within a few quarters when, in a sense, we have a fully matured cycle to look at Also, by the way, when we have some revised GNP numbers in a few days they may tell us a slightly different story about productivity   Yes--that is, to the extent that it's consistent with a very slow rate of productivity improvement In previous expansions over the postwar years the underlying productivity trend was substantially higher and, therefore, the cyclical performance was overlaid with a higher-- "
