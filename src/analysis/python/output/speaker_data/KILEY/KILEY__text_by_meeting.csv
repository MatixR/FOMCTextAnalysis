8773,2009-06-23,KILEY,"6  I will be referring to the materials that were just distributed   Recent data suggest that economic activity has continued to contract, but at a more  moderate pace than the breathtaking declines registered around the turn of the year   As shown in the top left panel of your first exhibit, job losses remained sizable  through May, albeit smaller than those recorded earlier in the year; despite the  moderation in job losses, the unemployment rate jumped another ½ percentage point  last month, to 94 percent   In manufacturing, the rate of decline of industrial production (shown in the top  right panel) has lessened somewhat in recent months, with the moderation in  production cuts broad-based   We expect that real GDP will rise a bit in the third quarter  While the most  significant factor behind the expected near-term pickup is the progress firms—  especially automakers— have made on adjusting inventories (a topic I will return to  shortly), the stabilization in household demand since late last year also plays an  important role  As shown in the middle left panel, real consumer spending has been  roughly stable since January  The stabilization in household demand is also apparent  in the housing market  As shown in the middle right panel, sales of existing homes                                          June 23–24, 2009 102 of 261  through May, released earlier today, and sales of new homes through April have been  roughly flat since late last year     In contrast to the stabilization in household demand, recent data suggest that  business outlays have continued to contract  As shown in the bottom left, shipments  of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft (the red line) continued to trend down  through April And, with new orders well below shipments, we expect further near- term declines  We will receive information on orders and shipments through May  tomorrow morning   As shown to the right, we expect real GDP to fall at an annual rate of 1 percent  this quarter, and to rise ¾ percent in the third quarter   The top panel of exhibit 2 lists some of the key factors shaping our medium-term  outlook The outlook for inventories drives much of the contour over the second half  of this year As shown by the blue bars in the middle left panel, firms’ efforts to trim  bloated inventories in the first half of the year were a sizable drag on GDP  In the  second half, the slowing in the rate of liquidation provides an arithmetic boost to  GDP growth Next year, as inventories come into better balance, the advance in GDP  is driven primarily by final sales   Returning to the box at the top, several factors shape our expectation that final  demand will begin to improve next year  First, the stabilization in the housing market  brings about an end to the drag from residential investment by early next year, and we  expect housing construction to turn up modestly thereafter  More broadly, we expect  risk premiums on corporate bonds and equities to decline further, which, in  conjunction with the declines we have already seen and support from monetary  policy, contribute to gains in household wealth and a lower cost of capital   The middle right panel provides some perspective on the impact of wealth on  household outlays The declines in household wealth associated with falling house  and equity prices are estimated to have placed a substantial drag on consumption  expenditures both last year and this year We expect this drag to ebb by a percentage  point next year, which, in conjunction with improved access to credit and the effect of  stabilization in the labor market on household incomes, helps consumption  expenditures to advance 2¾ percent in 2010   The bottom left panel presents the familiar accelerator mechanism, where  business fixed investment as a share of output (shown in red) tends to track, with a  lag, the growth rate of output (shown in black)  We expect the deceleration in output  over the past year to damp business investment through early next year; thereafter,  equipment and software spending is expected to pick up  However, spending on  nonresidential structures is likely to continue to decline for some time, reflecting high  vacancy rates, falling prices of commercial real estate, and persistently tight credit  conditions in that sector                                        June 23–24, 2009 103 of 261  Putting the pieces together, we project that real GDP will advance a bit more than  1 percent at an annual rate over the second half of this year and about 3 percent next  year, both higher than in the April Greenbook  The somewhat faster pace of growth  relative to April reflects the positive effects of lower risk premiums on corporate debt  and equity, a lower exchange value of the dollar, and a modestly better outlook for  foreign activity, which together outweigh the heightened drag from higher mortgage  rates and oil prices   Your next exhibit summarizes the inflation outlook  The readings on core PCE  price inflation in March and April averaged ¼ percent; these gains were boosted by  the response of producers to the increase in federal excise taxes on tobacco  Given  the news in the May CPI report, we estimate that core PCE prices advanced a more  moderate 01 percent in May   Turning to the panel at the right, we project the unemployment rate to rise to  10 percent by the end of this year and to edge down a bit in the second half of 2010   We have also boosted our estimate of the NAIRU a touch, to 5 percent, reflecting the  accumulation of evidence that the high rates of permanent job losses in this recession  will raise the level of frictional unemployment for a time   Our energy price forecast is shown in the middle left panel  With the price of oil  projected to be about $15 a barrel higher, on average, over the projection period, we  anticipate somewhat more acceleration in energy prices through the middle of next  year than in the previous projection   Finally, we expect core import price inflation (shown at the middle right) to pick  up over the second half of this year, reflecting, in part, the run up in non-oil  commodity prices and the decline in the exchange value of the dollar   As shown by the green line in the bottom panel, we expect overall PCE inflation  to slow from 14 percent this year to 11 percent in 2010  Core inflation is projected  to slow a bit more  The projected deceleration in core inflation reflects the substantial  drag induced by economic slack   Given the central role of economic slack in our projection, the next exhibit  discusses uncertainty regarding our estimates of resource utilization   The upper two panels focus on the differences in the degree of slack signaled by  our current estimates of the output gap and the unemployment gap—that is, the  deviation of the unemployment rate from the staff estimate of the NAIRU  The panel  to the left plots the output gap (the black line) and the unemployment gap (the red  line, plotted on an inverted scale) As highlighted to the right, the output and  unemployment gaps typically provide similar signals; this similarity is largely by  construction, as we use information from developments in both product and labor  markets to jointly inform our estimates of potential GDP and the NAIRU  However,                    June 23–24, 2009 104 of 261  a sizable discrepancy has opened up during this recession—with the unemployment  gap suggesting an even greater degree of slack than suggested by the output gap     In the Greenbook, we highlighted several possible explanations for the  discrepancy First, the GDP data, as currently published, may understate the  contraction in real activity; indeed, the data on Gross Domestic Income, which in  principle estimate overall economic activity as does GDP, have been significantly  weaker than GDP since 2007 Second, labor force participation may currently be  boosted to an unusual degree by the Extended Unemployment Compensation (or  EUC) program, by the declines in wealth and their effect on the labor supply of near- retirees or other workers, or by other factors, such as an unusual concentration of job  losses among individuals with strong labor force attachment; such unusual boosts to  participation would have a large influence on the unemployment gap but not much  effect on the estimated GDP gap  Finally, we may currently have underestimated the  size of shifts in the NAIRU or other elements of potential, possibly contributing to  mismeasurement of slack   Indeed, we often change our estimate of output gaps with hindsight  The panel at  the middle left shows how our current estimates of the output gap (the black line)  differ from the initial estimates we made over the history of the last 20 years (the  green line); such differences may reflect revisions to data, changes in the staff’s  methodology, and the fact that underlying trends are more easily detected looking  backward than looking forward  Nonetheless, the revisions over the past two decades  are not especially large The root-mean-squared error from the initial to current  estimate is less than one percentage point over this period  This size of revision is  much smaller than that found in some academic studies that focused on the 1970s or  early 1980s   Another way to assess uncertainty regarding resource utilization is to compare  estimates of slack derived from different methods  As highlighted in the box at the  middle right, different methods will imply different estimates of potential GDP  I  consider estimates from three methods  The first is the staff estimate, which is  loosely based on a growth accounting approach along with a number of underlying  models (related to productivity dynamics, Okun’s law, and the Phillips curve, for  example)  The second is a trend-cycle decomposition of GDP using a simple Phillips  curve in which inflation is a function of the output gap, a model that has been used in  many academic studies  The third is derived from a dynamic stochastic general  equilibrium (or DSGE) model developed at the Board  This model, called EDO for  Estimated, Dynamic, Optimization-based model, consists of a set of equations for the  spending, production, and wage and price decisions of households and firms that are  derived from utility- and profit-maximization under model-consistent expectations    The bottom panel presents the range of estimates generated by these methods, the  90 percent confidence interval around this range, and the staff’s estimate of the output  gap Three points are apparent First, uncertainty is significant the 90 percent  confidence interval for the second quarter of this year spans from about -2 percent of                               June 23–24, 2009 105 of 261  potential GDP to about -8 percent of potential GDP  Second, the staff’s estimate of  the output gap is in the lower half of the confidence interval, but it is not the most  negative estimate; the estimate from the DSGE model is more negative, at a bit  below -7 percent Finally, the entire confidence interval for the output gap is below  zero, by the largest margin seen over the past two decades  In summary, it seems  highly likely that the economy currently is operating with considerable slack   Your final exhibit focuses on two other risks to the inflation outlook  As  discussed in the top left box and shown in the upper right, long-run inflation  expectations have been reasonably well anchored for some time  In our projection,  this prevents a sharper deceleration in inflation  However, an unmooring of  expectations is a risk  For example, expectations could shift down markedly in  response to the weak economy and decelerating wage gains; alternatively,  expectations could ramp up, perhaps in response to our expanding balance sheet   Another important risk surrounding our inflation projection relates to the links  between resource utilization and inflation, discussed in the middle panels  Inflation  appears less sensitive to resource utilization than in the past; for example, the middle  right panel presents estimates of the slope of a simple Phillips curve using rolling  20-year samples; these show a lower sensitivity of inflation to utilization in the most  recent data  This apparent reduction in sensitivity is one factor that contributed to our  projection that inflation will decelerate by less than it did during earlier periods of  substantial slack  But it is possible that the recent data are leading us astray, because  reliable identification of the slope of the Phillips curve may require large movements  in utilization The post-2003 estimates plotted in the chart are based on sample  periods that exclude the early 1980s, and they may not be a reliable guide now that  we have reentered a period of high unemployment  If the effect of utilization on  inflation were similar to that apparent during the early 1980s disinflation, we could  see deflation   The bottom panels illustrate these risks using two alternative simulations from the  Greenbook In the first, we assume that long-run inflation expectations  (corresponding to the PCE price index) rise 1 percentage point, to 3 percent, by early  next year This increase becomes partially self-fulfilling, and core PCE inflation  averages 1½ percent in 2010 and then climbs steadily, reaching 2½ percent by 2013   Given the stronger price outlook, the federal funds rate lifts off from zero a year  earlier than in the baseline     The second simulation (labeled deflation) assumes an effect of slack on inflation  and an accelerationist structure to the Phillips curve more consistent with models  estimated over sample periods including the 1970s and early 1980s  As a result, core  prices are flat or falling through 2011, and only rising slowly thereafter   I think that’s mainly just looking at rates of changes versus levels  It’s true   that the level in 2010 is picking up, but the rate of change is decelerating, because we’ve seen a               June 23–24, 2009 112 of 261  big run-up right now in oil prices, and that will be passed through over the second half of this   year   Right A lot of that is jargon, terminology  We were trying to create some   definitions that could be consistently applied across many models  So certainly in our model   there’s a natural rate of output or an equilibrium rate of output that would be consistent with   economic efficiency according to that model or with the absence of wage and price rigidities   according to that model  Those two wouldn’t necessarily be the same  But one could have many   different definitions of the natural rate of output or the equilibrium rate of output   We’ve published papers on using that model and constructing those   measures  Those measures depend upon a set of assumptions regarding certain elements in the   structure of the economy that many models don’t even make assumptions about  So we couldn’t   compare that concept with a time-series model, like the trend-cycle decomposition of GDP  Nor   could we compare that necessarily with the staff’s estimate; in putting together potential output,   the staff takes a long-run growth accounting view and doesn’t think about what would happen if,   for example, it removed all price and wage rigidities for the economy                 June 23–24, 2009 114 of 261  We wanted to place all of our models on an equal footing, so we took a very standard   definition of potential output for this exercise for the EDO model—the Beveridge–Nelson   definition The model has a representation of the economy that has stochastic trends and unit   roots and all of these things in it, and we can crank through all of that machinery and generate a   long-run forecast for output, just as you could in a time-series model, or in the FRB/US model,   or in basically any model  We considered that to be a really good thing, because we can actually   use the same idea across models—we’re not mixing apples and oranges   When we do that in this model, there’s a lot of slack right now  Other models of a similar   type could give you a different answer—it could be that the natural rate of output gives you a   very different answer So you have to think about why you want to look at all of these concepts,   and think about what you’re comparing across different models  This seemed like the simplest   way to compare across models In response to a different question, you might want to use a   different concept   That’s absolutely right, and I just want to clarify one thing  The definition   of “potential” here is a statistical definition that’s consistent with the model  We didn’t say,   “Okay, we’re going to use this statistical method for the output gap,” and then put it in the   model, and a bunch of Phillips curves, or a bunch of other things  The model is completely              June 23–24, 2009 115 of 261  independent of that statistical machinery, and wages and prices and everything are being driven   by all of the things that are appropriate in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model  It’s   trying to match the data, so when you generate a statistical measure of the output gap from this   model, that statistical measure will forecast low inflation, because statistically that’s what it   thinks happens in the data That theoretical concept plays no role in the model—it’s a statistical   concept   No In a simple three-equation model that’s true  But once you have   sticky prices and sticky wages, monopoly power, other sources of distorting shocks, there is no   simple relationship between what would happen in the absence of wage and price rigidities and   what would happen to inflation You could write down a model—a very simple model—where   that would be true But it need not be the case    We forecast inflation with the model I’ve displayed  It forecasts very low   inflation, because the output gap is so big That’s not a behavioral relationship, that’s a   statistical regularity   In the model, it doesn’t  But the model is trying to capture the data  You   can simulate the model a million times, generate data, and then regress anything against anything   and you find reduced-form relationships The reduced-form relationships, consistent with the   model and the data, are that output gaps predict low inflation  And that’s a reduced-form   characteristic of the model that comes from its structure  It’s a pretty big and complicated   model, as many are these days But, because it tries to capture the data, and because it looks like   that’s a regularity in the data, it’s generating that prediction  "
9081,2010-10-15,KILEY,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  One of the background notes sent to the   Committee earlier this week discussed issues related to the possible adoption of a new   policy framework, including the specification of objectives, tools, strategy, and   communications   With regard to the specification of objectives, the memo highlighted three   approaches, each of which includes a summary of the FOMC’s interpretation of the   statutory mandate to promote “maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate   long-term interest rates”   Under the qualitative mandate approach, the FOMC statement would provide a   qualitative assessment of current inflation and unemployment in light of the   Committee’s statutory objectives  It would also indicate whether employment and   inflation are expected to converge toward the Committee’s longer-run goals at an   acceptable rate without further policy action in the near future  Such an approach   would not require much change in the FOMC’s decisionmaking process, but it also   might not deliver much additional clarity about the Committee’s objectives and its   plans for achieving them   Under the second approach, the statement would include an explicit numerical   inflation objective  An explicit inflation objective could help keep inflation   expectations well anchored by increasing the public’s confidence that the Federal   Reserve will keep inflation close to its objective and, thus, could allow the Committee   greater flexibility to put in place more stimulus in the near term  To avoid the   misperception that the FOMC was downweighting its statutory mandate to promote   maximum employment, the statement also would summarize participants’ views   about the longer-run sustainable rate of unemployment  Participants’ estimates of the   sustainable rate of unemployment could be drawn from the Summary of Economic   Projections (SEP), provided the Committee were willing to interpret its long-term   projections in that way; the inflation objective also could be taken from the SEP, or   the Committee could periodically vote on its inflation goal   October 15, 2010 6 of 62             Under the third approach, the statement would provide an explicit target path for   the price level along with a summary of participants’ judgments about the longer-run   sustainable unemployment rate  A target path for the price level could aim to raise   inflation temporarily above the Committee’s longer-term desired rate to compensate   for inflation having previously fallen short of that rate  For example, if the target path   starts in late 2007 and rises at an annual rate of 2 percent, then moderately higher   inflation of around 2½ percent for three years would be sufficient to bring the PCE   price index back up to the target  In theory, price level targeting would lead inflation   expectations to adjust in ways that help stabilize the economy, but how it would   perform in practice is an open question, given that no country has recently used this   approach   Under any of these options, the Committee might also wish to reconsider its   strategy for adjusting its policy stance  The Committee has made substantial   adjustments to its large-scale asset holdings on only three occasions  November   2008, March 2009, and August 2010  Taken together, these choices may have   suggested to the public that the Committee prefers large and infrequent adjustments to   the SOMA portfolio  Such an approach has possible benefits, including potentially   eliciting more sizable macroeconomic responses and clarifying the FOMC’s   intentions for the size of the balance sheet for longer stretches of time  Large,   infrequent policy actions also may have costs  Because policy actions would be   triggered only by large shifts in the outlook, the approach may prove insufficiently   responsive to a gradual accumulation of “bad” or “good” news  In addition, such   actions could increase economic volatility because the effects of large portfolio shifts   may prove to be different from what the Committee intended  Finally, the Committee   may judge that its experience with this approach has underlined the difficulty of   explaining infrequent policy adjustments   Alternatively, the FOMC could adopt a strategy of making more frequent and   (typically) smaller policy adjustments  This approach might better calibrate policy to   incremental changes in the outlook  It also may reassure the public that policy will be   adjusted more promptly, thereby helping to keep the economy on track through better   management of expectations  Finally, it would allow the Committee to initiate   incremental sales in response to improvements in the economic outlook, if desired   The background note also highlighted how a strategy for adjusting the SOMA   portfolio (or alternative instruments) more frequently could be informed by   quantitative benchmarks  Such benchmarks are familiar in the context of the target   federal funds rate, and the note illustrated several points regarding “rule-based” or   “optimal-control-based” policy prescriptions for the SOMA portfolio  First,   benchmarks that embed a moderate sensitivity to gaps between current inflation and   employment from their objectives would not necessarily prescribe additional stimulus   at this time  Second, more activist rules would imply more stimulus, potentially   substantially more, and hence would push inflation and activity toward their   objectives more quickly  And finally, strategies that involve credible forward   guidance that policy will likely remain accommodative for a sustained period of time,   October 15, 2010 7 of 62             as is assumed in the optimal control simulation, are particularly effective because of   their impact on expectations   Indeed, the importance of managing expectations under all the possible   specifications of objectives and strategies implies that the Committee’s   communications may need to evolve in conjunction with any change to the policy   framework  To illustrate how this might be done, the background note presented   three draft statements, reflecting hypothetical decisions regarding objectives and the   magnitude and timing of policy adjustments; the draft statements also emphasized the   potential role of guidance regarding possible future balance sheet actions   To facilitate its communication, the Committee might also consider enhancing the   SEP to include information about participants’ assessments of the appropriate path of   policy, potentially with regard to both the funds rate and the balance sheet  Such a   step, coupled with the announcement of an explicit inflation objective and   quantitative information about the long-run sustainable unemployment rate, might be   particularly effective because the policy projections would help the public understand   how the Committee intends to set policy to foster its objectives over time  The   Monetary Policy Report might also shift in emphasis with a change in the policy   framework, providing information on the Committee’s assessment of the outlook   relative to its objectives and on the role played by policy in that outlook   Finally, a number of major central banks, such as the ECB and the Bank of Japan,   regularly use press conferences as part of their communication policies  Post-FOMC   press conferences could offer an opportunity for the Chairman to inform the public   about the Committee’s decisions in more detail  If the Committee decided to adopt a   new quantitative framework, participants may wish to consider this possibility  That   concludes my remarks  "
9335,2011-11-01,KILEY,"1  Thank you  Early last month, Committee participants received a  memo on “Alternative Monetary Policy Frameworks” that I coauthored with Chris  Erceg and David Lopez-Salido  The memo discussed several policy strategies that  the Committee might wish to adopt that could potentially provide additional stimulus  or protection against especially undesirable outcomes   As highlighted in the box at the top of your first exhibit, these commitment  strategies are broadly consistent with flexible inflation targeting—that is, with a  policy framework that combines commitment to a medium-run inflation objective  with the flexibility to respond to economic shocks as needed to moderate deviations  of employment from its “full employment” level  In our analysis, we assumed that  the Committee aims to achieve an inflation rate of 2 percent, consistent with the  majority of longer-run projections from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kiley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   November 1–2, 2011 5 of 282              and other communications by the Committee  In addition, the full employment goal  is interpreted as an unemployment rate in the range of 5 to 6 percent, also consistent  with the majority of longer-run projections from the SEP     Given these objectives, we focused on how strategies that involve making  conditional commitments about how the policy rate will be adjusted going forward  can contribute to improved macroeconomic outcomes relative to the current strategy  of the Committee, which might be described as one of constrained discretion  To  illustrate the role of commitment, we considered two examples of optimal control  simulations of the type presented in the Tealbook using the FRB/US model  One  example, the “discretion” case, assumes that policymakers follow an optimal policy  on a period-by-period basis and are unwilling to promise future accommodation; the  second example, the “commitment” case, assumes that policymakers are willing to  commit (conditional on economic outcomes) to future policies that are potentially  more expansionary than would otherwise be chosen in order to stimulate activity  today   As shown in the figures in the next three panels (which also include the  projections in the September Tealbook, which are little different from those in the  most recent projection), these different approaches result in notable differences in  outcomes for inflation and unemployment  In the discretion case, policy, as measured  by the federal funds rate (reported in the middle-left panel) is only slightly more  accommodative than in the Tealbook baseline, whereas the commitment approach  involves a plan to maintain the federal funds rate near zero until the end of 2015  In  the simulation, the additional accommodation under the commitment approach brings  about a persistent fall in the unemployment rate (shown in the middle-right panel) and  a sustained rise in inflation (reported at the bottom left) to a little over 2 percent   Given the tight labor market and slightly above-target rate of inflation in future years  under the commitment strategy, future policymakers would presumably be tempted to  renege on the accommodative policy stance promised, but given their commitment,  they are assumed not to do so   As highlighted in the memo and noted in the bottom-right box, several features of  the optimal policy evident in the FRB/US simulations appear robust across a range of  models  First, the optimal policy given the baseline outlook involves a commitment  to hold the nominal funds rate near zero roughly until the unemployment rate  approaches its natural rate  Second, unemployment falls below its natural rate and  inflation may rise above its target for a time later in the decade under an optimal  commitment strategy  Third, while the degree of inflation overshooting is larger in  dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models such as EDO and SIGMA than in  FRB/US, optimal policies do not result in inflation substantially above 2½ percent for  a protracted period under the modal outlook in the models we examined     While there appears to be substantial benefits in principle from following an  optimal commitment strategy, “optimal” policies may be of limited use in FOMC  communications, because they are both complex and model-dependent, and because  they do not provide clear guidance about how the Committee would respond to   November 1–2, 2011 6 of 282              changes in the baseline economic outlook  The next exhibit examines possible  practical strategies that may overcome some of the communications challenges and so  help achieve some of the benefits of commitment I just outlined  As highlighted in  the box at the top left, notable improvements in resource utilization were achieved by  two of the strategies we examined—enhanced forward guidance consistent with an  aggressive response to resource utilization as in an inertial version of the Taylor 1999  rule, and nominal income targeting  However, price-level targeting, strictly  construed, delivered poorer performance in terms of resource utilization in two of the  models we considered, including the FRB/US model  This occurred because a strict  version of price-level targeting would not place any weight on resource utilization  and because plausible assumptions for the current price-level gap would imply little  need for near-term policy accommodation  In contrast, nominal income targeting, by  responding to both the price level and real activity, would imply a sizable gap at the  current juncture under plausible assumptions  This can be seen in the panel at the top  right, which shows the path of nominal GDP in the September staff projection and a  hypothetical target path for nominal income  The latter assumes that the target equals  actual nominal GDP in the fourth quarter of 2007 and then grows at the target rate of  inflation, 2 percent, plus the past and projected growth rate of potential output  estimated by the staff  Based on current estimates of the output gap of around  6 percent, the nominal income gap would be around 7 percent in the third quarter of  2011   The middle panels report the September Tealbook projection along with the  outcomes (using the FRB/US model) under the approach in which the federal funds  rate is set according to an inertial Taylor rule and nominal income targeting  Key  results are also summarized in the bottom panel  As highlighted in the next bullet  point, the inertial Taylor 1999 interest rate rule brings about a notable improvement in  the unemployment rate, at the cost of somewhat higher inflation  This result—that an  aggressive response to resource utilization as in the inertial Taylor 1999 rule implies  less anchoring of inflation—was apparent in other simulations reported in the memo   Nominal income targeting also improves outcomes for unemployment while bringing  inflation closer to 2 percent; indeed, the inflation and unemployment outcomes are  fairly similar to those under the optimal commitment strategy shown in the first  exhibit   Finally, as emphasized in the last set of bullets, each strategy involves a clear and  credible commitment to respond to economic conditions for the next 5 to 10 years in  a particular way, thereby importantly influencing financial market and inflation  expectations  As a result, policy communications that lay out the expected course of  the federal funds rate or communicate the conditions that may trigger the onset of  tightening could facilitate achieving better outcomes  For example, under the  nominal income–targeting approach, the federal funds rate remains at its effective  lower bound until the unemployment rate falls below 7 percent, while under the  inertial Taylor 1999 rule approach, the departure of the funds rate from its effective  lower bound occurs around when inflation is expected to persistently exceed  2½ percent; an incremental step in the direction of communicating these approaches   November 1–2, 2011 7 of 282              could involve specifying triggers such as these (a topic analyzed in greater detail in  the forward-guidance memo sent to the Committee in September)   The third exhibit discusses the robustness of these results across different  scenarios or economic models  In our memo, we examined a recession scenario and  an inflationary scenario; the top and middle of the exhibit focus on the recession  scenario  As highlighted in the top-left box, we considered a recession scenario in  which aggregate demand weakens enough to bring the unemployment rate to over  11½ percent for much of 2012 and 2013 under the baseline strategy (which uses the  outcome-based rule reported in the Tealbook and could be interpreted, roughly, as a  continuation of the Committee’s historical approach)   The federal funds rate (the top-right panel) remains at its effective lower bound  until the end of 2015 under the outcome-based rule (the black line) while core PCE  inflation falls to about 0 percent by 2014  The inertial Taylor 1999 rule (the blue  line) leads to lower unemployment in 2014 and 2015 and also cushions the decline in  inflation, which falls below 1 percent over 2012 to 2014  Nominal income targeting  (the red line) limits the rise in unemployment and better mitigates the decline in  inflation  These effects arise because the nominal income–targeting approach allows  the unemployment rate to eventually fall significantly below the long-run sustainable  rate in order to push nominal income back up to the assumed target  Specifically, the  shortfall in activity implies lower nominal income both directly via a decline in real  income and indirectly via the repercussions for prices of lower economic activity;  nominal income targeting acts to unwind the lower price level induced by the  recession by boosting inflation above target later through policy actions that remain  accommodative for significantly longer than under the estimated historical policy  rule, thereby providing additional stimulus   Of course, the effectiveness of nominal income targeting in this scenario depends  on the assumption that this strategy credibly influences the public’s beliefs about the  policy approach likely to prevail five or more years ahead  The public may doubt  such long-horizon commitments  Indeed, the credibility of the policy strategy is  central to all the approaches we examined, and the Committee may need to take  several steps related to its internal deliberations and public communications to  achieve even some of the gains in economic performance associated with the  approaches we considered    As highlighted in the box at the bottom, we also considered an inflationary  scenario in which adverse price shocks and rising inflation expectations bring about a  persistent increase in inflation  Our analysis showed that nominal income targeting  performed well in such a scenario, stabilizing both unemployment and inflation; in  contrast, the approach consistent with the inertial Taylor 1999 rule, by responding  substantially to resource utilization without an anchor for the price level, stabilized  unemployment but amplified the impact on inflation   Finally, the results emphasized in these exhibits were fairly robust when we  considered the performance of these strategies in models other than FRB/US    November 1–2, 2011 8 of 282              Nominal income targeting also achieved improvements in inflation and  unemployment in simulations of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models  (such as SIGMA and EDO, two staff models) and in a small model based on research  by economists throughout the Federal Reserve System  In contrast, price-level  targeting performed poorly in the FRB/US model and the small model  Finally,  price-level targeting performed well in the EDO model  This model is perhaps most  similar to that used in some recent research that suggests price-level targeting can be  a good strategy  As a result, our analysis confirms the support for price-level  targeting provided by some research while highlighting that this result is sensitive to  assumptions regarding the structure of the economy   Moving to your final exhibit, Committee participants received a set of questions  related to these issues on October 25; for your convenience, these questions are  reproduced here    In all of the cases, whether it is nominal GDP targeting or the inertial   Taylor rule approach, policy is actually governed by a rule, not by a pure targeting approach  So,   there is no specific objective for how quickly nominal income approaches its target   We assumed that the policy strategy would be highly inertial so that policy adjustments   would be very slow  We did that because the policy literature suggests that in many models,   highly inertial policies are a really good idea  Those strategies imply that nominal income hits   the target, depending on which model, late this decade or under some of the models even later    In the FRB/US model, nominal income would hit the target around, say, 2018 and overshoot  In   the EDO model, it hits around the same time, and there is no nominal GDP overshooting  It   essentially hits that level  In the small model we considered, because inflation is so inertial, it   could take even longer, and nominal GDP wouldn’t hit the target over the next 5 to 10 years    November 1–2, 2011 9 of 282              The answer to the question depends upon the model and the specific degree to which the nominal   income targeting is inertial    One way to communicate that would be by laying out a simple policy rule,   and that obviously was what we did in all of the models and is one thing that is robust across   models  It doesn’t depend on when nominal income achieves target  Showing how you would   change policy in response to nominal income doesn’t depend on a specific model’s rate at which   the nominal income gap closes, but, rather, depends on your model  Then, one could explain that   in terms of your baseline outlook for nominal income or—     It is a period-by-period choice for the policy rate, given a long-run   objective  The policymaker is trying to choose where inflation and unemployment will go on a   period-by-period basis  They don’t reconsider the 2 percent inflation objective  That is   hardwired into a policymaker’s DNA    That is right    Any simple instrument rule will not be the optimal discretionary policy    There would be an incentive to deviate from it    As I noted, we would view the historical approach of the Committee as one   consistent with constrained discretion  Clearly the Committee doesn’t adjust policy willy-nilly   and doesn’t reconsider on a meeting-by-meeting basis every aspect of its strategy  Definitely,   there are commitments   Indeed, under the discretion case, as you noted, we take a number of commitments off the   table and assume that, for example, an inflation objective of 2 percent is hardwired in the   policymaker’s DNA  In addition, policy communications have given guidance regarding the   outlook for the federal funds rate, for example, and I am sure the Committee and the public view   those as conditional commitments  It would be false to suggest that the policy approach involves   zero commitments  The optimal discretionary case here involves a number of commitments as   well, and the extent to which there could be gains from further commitment is consistent with the   story that we have told in illustrating commitment versus discretion    There are the modest movements in the Tealbook’s natural rate   November 1–2, 2011 11 of 282               It is  That is not particularly important, because that is only an adjustment   in the next year    Yes, that’s correct    That is technically true  In much of the literature actually incorporating   unemployment in models like EDO—in practice, that is not the result that comes out  The   natural rate of unemployment is often very smooth  In addition, it is important to be consistent   across all the implications of a model if one wants to push the story that far  For example, in   EDO, given the definition of the natural rate of unemployment that you are suggesting, that   would be higher  It is also the case that there is a natural rate of interest that should be accounted   for in a model like that, and that is actually much, much lower because of the effect on financial   frictions estimated by that model  If you take both of those factors into account, you would want   policy to be even easier than in a model like FRB/US  One shouldn’t cherry-pick a particular   implication of a model  One needs to walk through the analysis very consistently, and it is not   always what one thinks    One could have different opinions on that  At the current juncture, I think   the answer is clearly yes, the data are timely enough  Over the period that we are considering   these strategies, nominal income would provide a reliable enough signal, because we are not   November 1–2, 2011 13 of 282              talking about whether the federal funds rate should be up or down 25 basis points this quarter,   and then adjusted next quarter  We are looking at a situation in which, in our estimation, a   plausible nominal income gap is about 7 percent  The measurement error or the degree of   revision in nominal income is just not that high, but there are revisions   It is certainly possible that when the economy is back closer to steady-state conditions   that that type of a consideration would be important from meeting to meeting  I think that’s   something that one wants to consider when one is thinking about whether or not an intermediate   target like nominal income is appropriate for the next 5 to 10 years or is appropriate forevermore   And the answer to that question is that it doesn’t have to be the same  Right now we are   in extraordinary times  One of the problems with nominal income targeting—that we are not   exactly sure about the level of nominal income this quarter—is actually not that important right   now, even though 10 years from now I hope that that is a really important consideration    I am not sure that there is a uniform step  The way that I would think   about it is that certainly within a given model, or a given view of the world, specifying a trigger   and an outlook for the funds rate is the same as saying that you want a target for nominal GDP    But as I noted earlier when we were talking about the rate at which nominal GDP might   November 1–2, 2011 14 of 282              approach its target, those implications are not robust necessarily across different views of the   world; whereas reference to a set of goals—and those could be unemployment goals and   inflation goals, those could be nominal income, those could be something else—may be more   consistent across frameworks   The way that I would view it is that there is some distinction between simply saying the   funds rate is going to be a certain value for the next X quarters and a framework, because the   framework provides information to individuals who have a different view  And over time they   will learn whether their view is confirmed or disputed by the data and presumably update their   expectations     Certainly, under the baseline outlook you get some of the benefit from the   trigger and some of the benefit from the overall framework  And then, in the shocks, when   things turn out different than you expect, the triggers don’t necessarily tell you what is going to   happen in all cases, because they may involve differences in policy in periods after the trigger   has happened  The framework provides some of the benefit     In the simulations, or in the forward-guidance memo, triggers that signal additional   policy accommodation are helpful at the current time, if one wants to improve outcomes for   resource utilization  But there appear to be some gains from moving beyond that    Yes, that is the hard part    Right  And certainly, across different models is a less-good   approximation  We had one example of nominal income targeting a specific rule, changing those   parameters slightly  It is not going to be quite as good an approximation of the optimal policy   rule    This is a huge shock, so the economy takes a long time to get back to   steady state    It doesn’t actually take that long to get back to 2 percent  This is sort of   the peak, and it starts coming down and will be going back closely to 2 percent in the several   years after that  But the economy won’t settle down  It will undershoot, and then it will come   back up, because the economy under this particular policy strategy, which is just focusing on   nominal income, will be oscillating in toward that steady state for a while under the FRB/US   November 1–2, 2011 16 of 282              model  That is not necessarily true in all the models  But as I noted, part of the success of that   strategy in this scenario is this willingness to have inflation go to 3 percent    We certainly did simulations in which, when you see that, you just back off   and want to give up on nominal income targeting  That trims the gains and puts it closer to the   Taylor-type strategy    Yes    Nominal income targeting is just one example of flexible price-level   targeting  Because there are an infinite number of examples of flexible price-level targeting, we   picked the polar cases that are easy, round numbers; we picked 0 on the output gap, strict price-  level targeting, and 1 on the output gap, nominal income targeting  But you are absolutely right   that flexible price-level targeting is the best thing to do in some models, and we just chose to   focus on the one case  People have some empirical papers that have considered flexible price-  level targeting  For example, the one by Gorodnichenko and Shapiro, let’s say they have a   coefficient of 1 plus some inertia on the price level, and then an even bigger coefficient on the   output gap than 1  They would be even more aggressive than nominal income targeting  So one,   of course, could have a smaller coefficient on the output gap, and performance would be   sensitive to those assumptions  But one would move from “price-level targeting performed   poorly” in a couple of the models we considered to “nominal income targeting performed   reasonably well” in those models  One would move in that direction as one became more   flexible in price-level targeting and put some weight on the output gap    I agree  That is a really hard question, and certainly things can go wrong    It is hard to know what those are  I think if one committed to interest rates of some fixed path   until 2030, things would be very likely to go wrong  That is why we talk about strategies that   would be conditional on economic outcomes   In terms of what could trigger a repeat of the 1970s, obviously, I don’t know  It is   notable that nominal income targeting was proposed in the late 1970s by people like Jim Tobin   and James Meade, precisely because inflation was a problem  Then, a subsequent analysis by   people in the 1980s—Marty Feldstein, Greg Mankiw, many people—showed it is a good   strategy in response to those kind of shocks  The idea, actually, was to prevent that kind of   outcome    There is one important aspect of commitment that isn’t captured by the   Taylor rule  In all of our baselines, the Committee is committed to following some reasonable   strategy  The baseline is always a simple rule—the outcome-based rule or something like that   The types of commitment strategies that Dave and Chris and I were talking about move   beyond that simple rule, because they involve some commitment to undo undesirable movements   in the price level  So one is willing to have inflation run at 2½ percent for a while, for example,   if unemployment is very high, to a degree that is greater than embedded in something like a   Taylor rule  That is an insight in the policy literature that can be a good idea, and that is   behavior inconsistent with simple policy rules that involve inflation  That price-level-type aspect   of nominal income targeting or the optimal commitment strategy or price-level targeting does   move beyond the types of commitments that the Committee has, for the most part, been willing   to make in the past    First, I’ll give you technically what we did  This is a question very similar   to the question Governor Raskin asked in terms of its implications at the current juncture  What   we did mechanically is not be particularly concerned about any trend differences in GDP prices   November 1–2, 2011 21 of 282              and core PCE prices, and we set the target for 2 percent for GDP prices, and that’s slightly   different than a target for 2 percent for core PCE prices or for overall PCE prices   During normal times—when we are there, 5 to 10 years from now—that would be really   important if one’s very concerned about 2 versus 22 percent  If the gap in nominal income is   7 percent, 2 or 22 percent just doesn’t matter  It’s not important for the types of simulations   we’re doing right now, but it is important for behavior potentially at other times    It’s a hard question  The approach we took was simply I’m on the staff   with the Board, and I think our estimate of the output gap is pretty reasonable  [Laughter]    Taking a view in which it happened to be the case that the output gap was pretty close to zero   before the recession started in our estimation now, and we said, let’s take that as the initial   condition because it might be something that one would want to communicate—that we’ve seen   a bad few years and want to make up for those bad few years—and we came up with a   reasonable number   November 1–2, 2011 22 of 282              Other people would go back to that same date and just write through a trend line, and   they would have an even bigger gap—not the 7 percent we had, but a 10 or 11 percent gap—  because they wouldn’t be accounting for the unfortunate decline in potential that we’ve seen in   that period  Or you could start from today and say, “the gap is zero, but we’re going to follow   this strategy in the future,” and that would have very different implications  "
