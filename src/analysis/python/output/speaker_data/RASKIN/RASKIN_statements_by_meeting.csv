8845,2010-10-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As the newest Governor, and therefore the last   to speak, we’re at the point where everything has already been said, but not everyone has had the   chance to say it  [Laughter]  So I will make a couple of comments   October 15, 2010 57 of 62             I would lean towards option 2, the explicit inflation objective, which has two virtues  one is   that it has the goal of anchoring inflation expectations, and the other is that it potentially has greater   flexibility as an alternative form of stimulative policy, if credible  If credible, I think an explicit   inflation objective above the current target would raise inflation expectations, leading to a reduction   in real interest rates  As we know, an advantage of this tool is that we don’t run into the lower   bound problem because real interest rates can be negative  Credibility on this policy option is   critical  What is going to happen if there’s a divergence between the targeted inflation rate and the   actual inflation rate?  Would we follow through?   For example, if we were in a situation where we   had targeted, say, a 3 percent inflation rate, and in two years the unemployment level had   miraculously fallen to 5½ percent, and inflation, say, were 2 percent, would we allow   unemployment to fall to get the inflation rate at 3 percent, or would we declare victory and say we   are now at 5½ percent unemployment, so we can now aim for 2 percent?  So I think the credibility   component of using this objective in a stimulative way has some challenges   On option 3, price-level targeting, I think it might be difficult for us to have tight control on   inflation on a year-to-year basis, because inflation changes with significant inertia  Also, as the   Cleveland paper points out, there could be a significant degree of overshooting, which also makes   tight control difficult   The current approach has a problem, namely, how to keep inflation expectations anchored    In other words, I think there are benefits in terms of increased demand, but those benefits may be   small, and the future costs could be large  I know this Committee is aware of those costs, which   would be related to a post-recovery unwinding  For example, banks’ excess reserves could fuel   enormous expansion in private credit and demand, and unwinding could be practically or politically   difficult to achieve  As an aside, let me note that the unwinding problem itself that’s inherent in the   October 15, 2010 58 of 62             current approach could be helping to stimulate spending today by raising inflation expectations   today  But, again, the problem with this approach is that inflation expectations are not being   anchored the way they could be, if we were to move to option 2  So I prefer the explicit inflation   objective, but I think we want to make sure we are dealing with the credibility issue  Therefore,   following through, once a recovery is under way, is important  The financial markets don’t know if   the Fed is going to put on the brakes and start raising interest rates   I also wonder whether there’s any virtue to telling markets explicitly that an inflation target   will be maintained until certain events occur, so that the inflation target formulation would be   conditioned upon a certain unemployment threshold—or, if there are difficulties with quantifying an   unemployment threshold, then it would be conditioned upon certain qualitative features having to   do with the maximum employment goal  Then, once unemployment crossed that threshold, or once   certain qualitative features were met, as would be described very specifically, the target would be   removed and reevaluated  This would all need to be laid out ahead of time, so that there would be   clarity regarding what the Committee may do in the future  I’ll stop there  "
8865,2010-11-02,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My projections are roughly consistent with   those described in the Tealbook  The economic recovery remains quite gradual  Aggregate   demand remains inadequate, and I’ll underscore two ways in which I believe this is manifest    First, weakness of aggregate demand is reflected in the fading effects of the federal stimulus   spending and the fact that local and state governments are shedding tens of thousands of   November 2–3, 2010 91 of 238             employees  In particular, in the state and local sector, budget pressures are projected to ease only   slowly, as any expected rise in tax collections from the recovering economy are partially offset   by the unwinding of the federal stimulus grants  So real spending in this sector is anticipated to   increase only about ½ percent next year and 1¼ percent in 2012  Further weakness is evident in   the housing sector  The level of housing prices is down by roughly 1 percent since August    Housing demand remains weak, and foreclosure volumes are sizable  Anecdotally, the   slowdown in home sales now exacerbated by foreclosure documentation issues impinges on   labor mobility; in other words, people’s ability to move to new cities to look for jobs is being   hampered, exacerbating unemployment issues   In sum, the latest growth numbers for GDP of 2 percent cannot produce the demand   needed to reduce our 96 percent unemployment rate  Indeed, the unemployment rate is not   expected to fall below 9 percent until 2012, and inflation remains below levels that are consistent   with the FOMC’s objectives for quite a bit longer  Being this far from the dual mandate goals   presents problems  If high unemployment continues, our country risks losing human capital, as   the skills of the unemployed erode, and this very low inflation could heighten the risk that   adverse shocks could lead to deflation and a protracted period of extremely poor economic   performance  Thanks    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given that the economic recovery is too weak   to deliver acceptable progress toward our dual objectives, additional monetary accommodation is   appropriate  Although it is appropriate, I believe its effect should not be overstated, and its risks   need to be monitored  The effects need to be viewed as not particularly overwhelming at this   point  FRB/US simulations suggest that the implications for real GDP and unemployment would   be small  Moreover, there currently is not a particularly robust short-term accommodative fiscal   policy  In addition, I wonder about the strength of the linkage between longer-term interest rates   November 2–3, 2010 190 of 238             on Treasuries and the terms and availability of credit to small and medium-sized businesses    These businesses, as we know, are an important source of job creation, and I’m uncertain about   the extent to which lowering longer-term interest rates will open the spigot further to new   lending  This uncertainty is exacerbated by a supervisory policy that is uncoordinated, either   rightly or wrongly, with monetary policy  Similarly, I view the so-called wealth effect as having   minimal further effect  Equity prices have risen and may rise a bit more, but perhaps not enough   to induce households to embark on much of a sustained spending spree   Despite these mitigants, the staff estimates that $600 billion of purchases leads to a   reduction in the unemployment rate of approximately 03 percentage point  This is small, but not   inconsequential  Alternatively understood, it’s small but, at this time, is not overtaken by risks   that make doing nothing the better course of action  Incidentally, I cast substantial doubt on the   proposition heard around the table this morning that doing nothing here will somehow push and   direct fiscal policy in the right direction in a timely and predictable way  I view fiscal policy as   highly uncertain, and, frankly, I believe it disingenuous at best to think that we can pass the   buck, so to speak, back to the Congress   Accordingly, I would support the policy action and statement described in alternative B    As between A and B, it strikes me that it is desirable to maintain flexibility in the timing and   extent of any purchases above and beyond the $600 billion  An even larger purchase program   could be necessary, and alternative B signals that possibility  A more incremental approach   gives the Committee the chance to understand with precision the effect of increases in the   balance sheet and the chance to incorporate incoming data—in a “regular” if not a “continuous”   way—that could permit a more precise determination of the amount of stimulus or withdrawal of   stimulus that the economy will need  In addition, this more incremental approach may help allay   November 2–3, 2010 191 of 238             any lingering concerns among some members about the Committee’s ability to execute a smooth   exit from policy accommodation   Moreover, whether this is desirable or not, public statements by members of this   Committee, this so-called stagecraft, have provided financial markets with the strong expectation   that the Committee will announce an expansion in the balance sheet at this meeting  Should we   choose to determine that the threshold for undertaking further accommodation has not been met,   as in alternative C or D, we would significantly surprise market participants and, as a result,   longer-term interest rates would rise more than forecast, which, in my view, would stall the   recovery at this point  Since the time of the Chairman’s Jackson Hole speech, we’ve seen that   the prospect of purchases can succeed in lowering interest rates  Given the magnitude of excess   capacity, there’s little risk of inflation today, and the risk of future inflation is minimal, so long-  term interest rates should not rise dangerously in response to the interventions because this   Committee has a credible record of reasonably anchoring inflationary expectations  That record   is what makes the course of accommodation described in alternative B, to my mind, credible   Thank you  "
8891,2010-12-14,"  Nathan, what do you anticipate would be the effects of an announcement   at this point of the extension?    So, from that perspective, you’d like the announcement to occur with a   sufficient amount of time before the deadline    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I believe the state of the recovery is more   promising than it was at the November FOMC meeting, but I see considerable continuing   downside risks in terms of both price stability and unemployment  Information we have received   for this meeting suggests considerable reasons for optimism  In particular, private domestic final   purchases are looking stronger, business purchases of equipment and software are increasing,   and wholesale inventories and merchandise trade have been marked up  Since the last meeting,   equity prices are higher, the yield curve is steeper, and risk spreads have narrowed  I read these   financial indicators as implying that financial markets could be recovering from their nervous   conditions of this spring  Given these stronger indicators and the additional confidence provided   by our latest program of large-scale asset purchases and by the likelihood of more fiscal   stimulus, I think there are some reasons for cautious optimism that the recovery is on a path to   becoming stronger   December 14, 2010 69 of 127             There remain, however, significant downside risks  Specifically, in addition to the   continued weak housing market, problems in Europe, and weaker banks, the recent decrease in   measures of core inflation, I believe, bears continued attention  While I don’t think that we’re in   serious danger of deflation, I hope that the continuing decline in core inflation does not   eventually affect inflation expectations and, thereby, lower wages as well as raise real interest   rates  While break-even inflation rates have been stable since our last meeting, professional   forecasters, as measured by the Livingston survey, appear to be revising their forecasts   downwards, and the level of economic slack continues to be substantial  If inflation continues to   fall, becoming difficult to reverse, inflationary expectations could become unanchored, and I   worry that rising real interest rates could offset the added monetary and fiscal expansion  Thank   you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would support alternative B  I also believe   that the verdict on our latest round of LSAP purchases is still out  I’m discouraged by the rise in   December 14, 2010 101 of 127             the longer-term yields since our last meeting but am well aware that there’s no way of knowing   where yields would have been if we had not acted   At the very least, we’ve learned that the communication of monetary policy is as critical   to the conduct of monetary policy as is the actual decisionmaking  I think more work has to be   done in identifying up front the various audiences of our actions with an eye to considering how   to tailor the message of our policy decisions   Regardless of the ultimate verdict on this round of large-scale asset purchases, I think it   would be premature to reverse last month’s decision  I believe it has been somewhat successful   in moving us towards meeting our dual objectives  In any event, the fact that there is a   significant hole to dig out of suggests the need for no reversal  In addition, and significantly,   such a reversal would, at the least, cause confusion and could well threaten the Fed’s credibility    Thanks  "
8919,2011-01-25,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  This question is for Nellie, and it refers to the   real estate piece on exhibit 11  You said that the estimated losses from potential mortgage put-  backs ranged from $25 billion to $75 billion and that they could be material for a few firms  You   then indicated that this estimate reflected a markdown in light of notable settlements with Fannie   and Freddie  My question is whether the markdown took into account future probable put-backs    In other words, did you look at the full universe of what those put-backs could be?    But leaving the private-label stuff aside, did you take into account the full   range of GSE put-backs?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy has entered 2011 with more   momentum  We’re seeing promising upticks in business investment in equipment and software,   and potentially sustainable increases in industrial production  Appearing positive but not yet   definitively propelling are improvements in auto sales and net exports, which are also moving   demand  Conditions in the labor market have improved modestly, but considerable slack   remains  Despite these upward positive trends, the housing market, in particular, continues to be   troubled and is exerting downward pressure on economic growth  The housing market shows no   January 25–26, 2011 142 of 282              signs of emerging from the significant overhang of real estate that is in foreclosure or entering   the foreclosure process   I continue to be troubled by the failure of financial institutions to address   comprehensively the underlying causes of mortgage documentation and related servicing   problems  Giving short shrift to these problems unnecessarily elongates the pace of sales of   foreclosed properties, which contributes to lower priced and lower quality housing stock, both of   which will result in weaker consumer demand and stunted national growth until addressed   In addition to these persistent operational risk factors in servicing, home foreclosure rates   will likely be higher this year as financial institutions publicly assert that they have fixed their   internal servicing problems and restart the foreclosures that had previously been halted  In other   words, the properties subject to foreclosure that were held back by financial institutions during   the robo-signing period will most likely come to market, and these surges will increase the   uncertainty of supply, resulting in further uncertainty regarding home values  If more   documentation and processing problems resulting from operational inadequacies come to light,   the delays in the recovery in the housing market will be extended  In addition to the elevated   volume of home foreclosures, elevated inventories of unsold homes and high vacancy rates for   commercial properties contribute to the overhang exerting downward pressure on home values    The quality of many homes also has deteriorated, resulting in more downward pressure on prices    In short, the day of reckoning, when institutions that service loans address the failures in their   processes and systems, apparently has yet to come, and, therefore, the process of clearing the   housing market will remain fitful and unpredictable  All of these possibilities could depress   house prices, discourage potential homebuyers, and depress housing starts   January 25–26, 2011 143 of 282              I’m also not certain that the allowance for loan and lease loss reserving that banks have   done in response to foreclosure-related investigations and litigation is adequate for future losses    If such investigations and litigation entail significant cost, concerns could be renewed about the   adequacy of bank capital  There also could be further damage to the confidence of firms and   households, leading to delays in purchases of business capital and consumer durables  If severe   deficiencies in reserves were to materialize, credit availability could again contract   Inflation expectations have remained anchored despite the fact that core inflation remains   low  This stickiness benefits the recovery by preventing the natural contraction in economic   activity that would occur were real interest rates to rise more dramatically  My previous forecast   noted that reductions in employment, income, and wealth had left many households with the   need to repair their severely distressed balance sheets  In short, I don’t believe that consumer   confidence has returned yet to the levels that would be necessary for a faster paced recovery   My previous forecast also noted continued uncertainty regarding the mortgage   documentation problems, which, as I’ve described, act as a continuing drag on the resurgence of   the housing market  I believe these problems have not yet been resolved  In fact, I think they   could be exacerbated by related problems, such as the facts underlying the adverse ruling by the   Massachusetts Supreme Court regarding mortgage assignments “in blank”   Neither my prior forecast nor my current one explicitly considers any additional, that is,   beyond the baseline, effects of consolidation at the state level  In particular, even after making   deep spending cuts over the last two years, states continue to face large budget gaps  At least 46   states struggled to close shortfalls when adopting budgets for the current fiscal year, which began   July 1 for most states  Fiscal year 2011 gaps total $130 billion or 20 percent of budgets in these   46 states  To comment upon President Dudley’s observation that this shortfall is a small portion   January 25–26, 2011 144 of 282              of GDP, I would add that these gaps come on top of the large shortfall that 46 states faced in   fiscal years 2009 and 2010  States could continue to struggle to find the revenue needed to   support critical public services for a number of years, threatening hundreds of thousands of jobs    Even for those states whose gaps have been filled and whose budgets are balanced, this story   may not be over  Families hit hard by the recession will experience the loss of vital services   throughout the year, and the negative impact on the economy could then be prolonged  In terms   of federal aid to states, about $60 billion remains to mitigate these 2011 fiscal problems  By   2012, this number will be $6 billion   Continued high unemployment could keep state income tax receipts at low levels and   increase the demand for Medicaid and other essential services that states provide  High   unemployment combined with households’ diminished wealth due to fallen property values   could continue to depress consumption  Thus, sales tax receipts also would remain low  These   factors suggest that state budget gaps could continue to remain larger and last longer, themselves   manifestations of a slow recovery  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support the action described in   alternative B and the statement in alternative B which reaffirms the intended increase in   securities holdings and the pace of purchases that the Committee first announced in November    The economic recovery is, in fact, continuing  The growth in household spending picked up late   last year, and business spending on equipment and software is rising  However, housing and   January 25–26, 2011 185 of 282              labor markets remain weak, and the action described in alternative B, I believe, reflects that  The   actions and language of alternative B should reinforce investor confidence that the economic   recovery is proceeding and that employment and inflation are evolving in a manner consistent   with a gradual return to levels more consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate   Adjustments to the program should not be made at this time  The adverse consequences   of unexpectedly discontinuing or reducing the current program would be unsettling to business   and household confidence, and, given challenges in communicating, such a change would   require great care  In addition, there are significant benefits to waiting for additional information   pertaining to the strength of the recovery and likely trajectory of inflation before deciding to   make an adjustment to the stance of monetary policy   I also want to weigh in on the debate regarding the inclusion of the $80 billion  President   Lockhart stated it in the negative, seeing no reason not to include the language  I think President   Fisher has also raised some good points regarding the precedent it sets of always having to   communicate in terms of what the monthly pace would be  I just want to insert a somewhat   different perspective on that language  As the communications experts know best, there are   several audiences listening and critiquing the performance of this Committee, and these   audiences include financial participants on Wall Street as well as business participants on Main   Street  They include politicians of all ambitions  In my case they include a neighbor who   continues to corner me in the express lane at the grocery store right when I’m pinned in between   the tabloids and the gum, asking for clarification  [Laughter]   I think we learned from the communications around the LSAP program that some of   these audiences can only hold one number in their heads at a time  That number, I think,   currently is $600 billion  So another perspective on this debate is that if we inject another   January 25–26, 2011 186 of 282              number, in this case the number is $80 billion, to certain audiences it could appear to be   something new, something that was recently decided, something that could be misinterpreted as   a fresh round of money printing  That is not at all what is intended, and that is not at all what has   occurred or been decided at this meeting  So, at the very least, I think putting in that number   could encourage some kind of speculation about why the quantity of purchases implies a pace of   $80 billion rather than $75 billion, and, given that this Committee has not made any change in   the course of the LSAP program, we may need to consider whether the $80 billion figure will   signal some kind of fine-tuning or something that we have not, in fact, decided  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank the members of the   subcommittee on communications for helping to guide this discussion  I have certainly learned a   lot listening to everyone’s comments  Certainly, the notion of having an overarching   philosophical statement is a good one, so, in that spirit, I would offer the following  In   considering why central banks communicate with outside people, I start with the overarching   principle that they do so to enhance transparency, and there are really two fundamental purposes   in doing so  First is accountability  There’s enormous power inherent in a central bank, so the   political process has the ongoing responsibility of evaluating whether our exercise of that power   is meeting society’s goals  In other words, the public has to have information to conduct an   effective evaluation of our work  The second reason we aim to enhance transparency is that   we’re in the business here of managing expectations of inflation and of the future path of the   policy rate  In thinking about the second reason, which is essentially about the conduct of   monetary policy, my evolving view is that we want to make sure that we remain accountable   while at the same time we want to make sure that we are correctly managing expectations  And   we want there to be an explicit responsibility  To use Governor Duke’s metaphor, we wear the   FOMC hat when we’re in this room, and we wear it when we’re outside this room  And, because   we’re in the business of managing expectations, anything that we communicate is, in essence,   communicating something about our personal views or the Committee’s views   If we believe in this second purpose of transparency, then we have a collective   responsibility to make sure that our communications serve the policy paths that we have agreed   to  When we significantly depart from this responsibility, we undermine the Committee’s   decisions, and we inject significant suboptimality into the policy decisions   January 25–26, 2011 228 of 282              So when you think through the notion of the optimizing the work that we do here, I think   you can see guidance evolving towards one that includes some notion of timing  We’ve been   talking about content, but there’s also a notion, I think, of timing  So in other words, we think   through when it is, how long we’re going to give decisions time to play out, and at what point we   let views come in that could be shaping, in essence, the policy decisions that are made in this   room   I’ll summarize by saying that I think the FOMC is a collegial committee and is   responsible for the conduct of monetary policy, and as such, its responsibility extends through   the whole decisionmaking time line  It extends to pre-announcement effects of prospective   actions  It extends to what goes on in this room and persuading colleagues of the views   expressed when we do our deliberations, and it also extends to the effects of our policy   statements and the minutes on market expectations  I will stop there  "
8945,2011-03-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic recovery is proceeding at a   moderate pace, but as I’ve noted before, reductions in employment, income, and wealth have   hurt households since the onset of the financial crisis  I don’t want to restate many of the   excellent points that have been raised around the table, so I’ll use my time to underscore but one   aspect of my outlook   In short, the views of your so-called business contacts are supported by the views of my   so-called household contacts  [Laughter]  Admittedly, with two teenagers at home and one home   from college, all of whom consume large amounts of milk, cereal, facial cleansers, and gasoline,   the age of my sample size is skewed to the downside  That said, consumers who are full adults   and run households face more downside risk from higher prices at the pump as well as a   groundswell of fiscal austerity facing the nation at all levels of government  As we know,   consumer sentiment tumbled in early March, reversing just about all of the improvements since   last October  Optimism on the employment outlook among consumers also retreated  The   Reuters/Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index primarily attributes the overall swoon in sentiment   to surging gas prices  This swoon would tend to be consistent with the fact that the drop in   confidence is considerably steeper among lower-income for whom gas prices are hitting   especially hard than for higher-income households  This sharp reversal of what had been an   upward drift in consumer sentiment between October and February is disconcerting  It doesn’t   bode well for economic growth  The rising cost of food and fuel, especially if these factors   continue to rise, together with the effect of suboptimal job creation, could hinder or even derail   growth in consumer demand   I’d also like to remind the Committee that the housing market is also hindering growth in   consumer demand  Household equity is far from being restored  From 2005 to the end of 2010,   March 15, 2011 79 of 165              $68 trillion in home equity has been lost  With our staff’s assumptions of there being a   $003 loss in consumption for every $100 loss in home net worth, this $68 trillion in lost home   equity represents a loss of more than $200 billion in consumption  And given the delays   between drops in household equity and changes in consumption, the losses to consumption have   not all been realized   House prices continue to decrease, and despite household efforts to pay down their   mortgages, home equity continues to fall  Indeed, cash refis are flat at zero  So not only is the   so-called wealth effect of housing on consumption flat, but the ability of homeowners to tap   quickly into any equity to fund household needs and other consumption is all but gone  The   housing market still shows no signs of emerging from the significant overhang of residential real   estate that is in foreclosure or entering the foreclosure process   The baseline forecast of continued recovery depends importantly on steady improvements   in, among other things, consumer confidence and the willingness of firms to hire, but these   improvements may be materializing slowly  If so, risk aversion among households will increase,   boosting precautionary savings by households and making firms more reluctant to boost capital   spending and increase payrolls  The recent payroll tax cut, which was effective in January of this   year, appears so far to be unnoticed by consumers, and if it remains as such will not have an   appreciable effect on consumer spending   I haven’t addressed the economic impact of the earthquake and tsunami tragedies in   Japan on household net worth, but I believe they loom large and will exert downward pressure   on household consumption  The consequences on consumption and economic growth are not yet   fully known, but, if realized, will slow the path toward recovery  Thank you, Mr Chairman   March 15, 2011 80 of 165               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support the action described in   alternative B  I am comfortable with the current stance of monetary policy and underscore the   need for vigilance and care as we watch the current course of commodity prices and their   potential for dislodging stable inflation expectations  That said, the path to full recovery is   prolonged by several risks  One significant risk that has been underscored today is the extent to   which slowdowns in consumer spending and continued weakness in housing markets raise   concerns about the strength and durability of the recovery  The run-up in energy costs, if it   persists, also could weigh on household spending and on non-energy goods and services, and the   turmoil in the Middle East and the disaster in Japan may exacerbate this effect  This question   March 15, 2011 120 of 165              alone suggests a high threshold for making an adjustment to the purchase program    Unexpectedly discontinuing or reducing the current program at a time of heightened uncertainty   regarding households’ abilities to absorb higher food and gas prices would prematurely inhibit   the consumption component necessary for more-robust growth   I also support the President Kocherlakota changes to paragraph 2, as further amended by   President Williams, and look forward to debate on changes proposed by President Lockhart and   President Fisher    One question I have has to do with the scope of the rule, so to speak, and   that is, I assume that the blackout period, although shortened, covers everybody, even individuals   who may have dissented at the meeting; is that right?  "
8970,2011-04-26,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate the richness of this debate   regarding the parameters of exit, and while I believe it premature to begin the exit program, it’s   certainly not premature to discuss the contours of what will be a process that, if poorly conceived   and poorly communicated and poorly received, could lead to unintended macroeconomic   consequences  For that reason, I applaud the fact that we’re now having this discussion, and   while not being present for the precursors to the analysis that began in April of last year,   appreciate both that there’s been a lot of careful thought on this topic and that the duration and   components of the accommodation are different now than they were in April of last year   April 26–27, 2011 81 of 244              I have several observations  First, I want to underscore the Chairman’s view that public   statements regarding exit not confuse the notion of “when” with the notion of “how”   Second, both options for sequencing, as presented in the staff memo, assume that a   sizable amount of reserve draining will be conducted before the first anticipated increase in the   federal funds rate target  I’m still grappling with how such a sizable amount is going to be   reduced in a mere six months in option 1 or in a mere three months in option 2  I understand   President Lockhart’s concern about starting the draining too early, but if reserves are as high as   $16 trillion and the required reserve level at which movements in the federal funds rate affect   loan balances is at something like $74 billion, how do we drain $1½ trillion in the short period of   time without disruptions?  If these reductions prove to be too slow and there is strong evidence   that a recovery is self-sustaining, perhaps we would then feel it necessary to engage in some   accelerated asset sales ahead of a preannounced schedule in order to drain   Third, I want to make sure we understand the current effect of the GSEs in the federal   funds markets  Commercial banks are awash in reserves  So my question is whether the largest   sell-side participants right now are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  Now, footnotes 17 and 18 of   the staff’s memo on the long-run policy implementation frameworks describe why limits to   arbitrage have resulted in market rates typically being in the range of 10 to 15 basis points below   the interest rate on excess reserves  So if we suppose that the Chairman and the Secretary of the   Treasury agreed that Fannie and Freddie could no longer be part of the federal funds market,   would we then remove the ability for commercial banks to trade with the GSEs in such a way as   to eliminate the gap between market rates and the interest rate on excess reserves?  So then if the   federal funds rate were at the IOER, the FOMC, it seems to me, would have greater control when   it begins to raise the IOER because the fed funds rate would move exactly with it   April 26–27, 2011 82 of 244              Fourth, regardless of whether Fannie and Freddie remain part of the federal funds market,   I want to underscore the communication challenge that was raised by President Bullard and   others that will need to be addressed, and that is that raising the interest rate on excess reserves   will result in annual payments to banks, which will certainly require some explanation to the   Congress and others in the public   Finally, when we discuss asset sales, we assume that such sales include sales of   Treasuries in addition to sales of agency debt and agency MBS  As we’ve heard, there are   permutations to how these sales are executed that involve sales of one type before sales of   another type, and from this perspective, I think it’s worth remembering that MBS have a more   direct linkage to mortgage rates than do Treasury bills  Also, it’s worth noting that President   Kocherlakota’s observation regarding the pro-cyclicality in MBS sales needs to be factored in   ahead of time as well, if we decide to start MBS sales ahead of Treasury sales   I will turn quickly to the questions  One, Should the first step in exit be to stop the   current policy of reinvesting?  I would say, yes  I think that redemptions would generate a   significant reduction in the balance sheet under an approach that is operationally simple, easily   communicated, and not disruptive to markets  For the second question, it is also my view that   putting asset sales on a largely predetermined and preannounced path is preferable  I haven’t yet   bought into the full substitutability of the two tools primarily because of a lack of a robust   experiment in that regard  Third, at this moment I probably would favor starting to sell assets   after the increase in the federal funds rate  I don’t place a high priority on reducing the size of   the SOMA portfolio quickly, especially if that would delay liftoff of the federal funds rate  Of   course, I would say that subject to the caveats I mentioned regarding the ability to drain or a   April 26–27, 2011 83 of 244              dangerous supply shock that would trigger a big jump in inflationary expectations  And I do   agree with the three statements in question four  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The moderate pace of the recovery is   continuing  The economy continues to face a number of headwinds limiting its ability to grow   faster  These headwinds include higher gasoline prices, reduced government spending at both   the state and national levels, and a housing market characterized by low equity values, supply   overhang, and deteriorating quality   Historically, my projections have been more pessimistic than the staff’s because of my   continued concern regarding the housing market, low state and local spending, and the slow   resumption of consumer demand  Wanting to offset this pessimism with the seemingly good   news that the unemployment rate was looking lower—and not daring to wade into the debate   over modern finance models between President Evans and President Lacker, nor having really   the extensive list of interlocutors known to President Fisher, and, finally, seeing no short-term   end to the fact that I will always be last in the economic go-round [laughter]—I had no choice   but to hit the road last week in search of some observable data and traveled to an unemployment   center   The one I visited is known for its cutting-edge approach in providing training, job   prospects, credit counseling, foreclosure counseling, and other enhancements to people moving   in between jobs  I claim no academic precision to the sampling here, nor do I claim anything   about the temporal dimension to these observations  I went to the unemployment center with no   April 26–27, 2011 159 of 244              preconceived notion except data from the latest household survey showing that the number of   people involuntarily working part time had increased by 90,000 in March to 84 million  The   household survey also indicated that the nation’s 13½ million unemployed people have been out   of work, on average, for at least 39 weeks  With all of this labor available, one question I had is   whether the recent increased inflation could lead to a wage–price spiral of the kind that typically   ignites the runaway levels experienced in 1979 when inflation was 1332 percent  Another   question I had is whether improvement in the unemployment rate alone should cause us to claim   “mission accomplished”   What I observed at the unemployment center—actually, it was more positively called an   employment center—is a pipeline that carries the newly unemployed between jobs  The   existence of jobs at the end of the pipeline is what motivates people to even enter the pipeline   and participate in services provided throughout the process, such as resume writing, computer   literacy, one-on-one counseling, and foreclosure prevention  The quality of the jobs at the end of   the pipeline was not particularly exciting  The day before I was there, the city’s stadium had   been rented by Monstercom to accommodate job seekers and employers  The job seekers   showed up in droves, but the bulk of vacant jobs represented by the few employers that   participated looked mostly like multilevel marketing jobs that paid commission only and were   based on the number of friends you signed up   Not all job seekers were uneducated  Most recent additions of job seekers to this   particular employment center were college and graduate-school educated  On the day of my   visit, they were pharmaceutical company employees, and they were clogging the pipeline, in the   view of the less educated, because the more educated were settling for jobs that were lower   paying and of a kind that the less educated were vying for  Once the less educated saw that they   April 26–27, 2011 160 of 244              were losing out, they left the pipeline, thereby abandoning the retraining programs that could   have been of some benefit and increasing the time these people remain jobless and with   insufficient income   Another group of employees clogging exit from the pipeline were the so-called surviving   employees  These employees have jobs but are so demoralized and exhausted by being the sole   survivors holding onto their jobs and picking up the slack of the laid-off employees that they,   too, are looking for jobs  Once they add to the competition for a vacant job, they bump away the   unemployed in the pipeline who believe themselves to be increasingly stigmatized by the length   of time they’ve been without work  So the existence and attractiveness of jobs at the end of the   pipeline determined whether people even entered the pipeline to begin with   For the recently unemployed, the challenge of this employment center was to tighten the   link between the employer doing the layoff and the about-to-be-laid-off employee so as to get the   employee into the employment center before being laid off  This way the employee would stay   engaged in a job search  Of course, despite enhancements like resume writing, one-on-one   counseling, and computer literacy training, the only real enhancement seems to be a high   probability of their being a job   I’ll stop there but sum it up by saying that this picture, were it to be duplicated somewhat   consistently across the country, is not a picture of robust job creation, nor one that seems   susceptible to setting off a dangerous wage–price spiral, nor one that shows bargaining and   negotiation over wages to be anything but concessionary  It’s a long way of saying that labor   markets will be strong when the economy can absorb the people who want to reenter the job   market  Thank you   April 26–27, 2011 161 of 244               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B, because the economic   recovery is too halting and uneven to warrant a substantial shift now in the stance of monetary   policy  The unemployment rate has come down, but it remains high relative to other labor   April 26–27, 2011 202 of 244              market indicators, which show a high number of people wanting full-time work but finding only   part-time work  Wage gains are minimal, and unit labor costs are not changing   Measures of inflation have moved up, reversing a small part of their decline since 2008    That said, the run-up in energy prices is slowing consumer spending  In addition, political unrest   in the Middle East and North Africa, and the resulting upward pressure on oil prices, have   increased the likelihood of an adverse shock to real incomes and to household confidence and, to   a lesser extent, business confidence, and thus to private domestic final demand   If there are further increases in oil and commodity prices, and a more-than-transitory   spillover to other prices, one could imagine inflation expectations becoming unanchored  Given   these conditions and others that have been discussed, I think that the current stance of monetary   policy strikes me as appropriate  Thank you  "
8997,2011-06-21,"  Thank you  Mr Chairman, I just want to remind the Committee that   what we are discussing here are exit strategy principles and not concrete intentions  And   whether or not there are any conceptual concerns with the addition of Narayana’s sentence, I   would say that it does somewhat stick out from a tonal perspective in the sense that it reflects a   current anticipation and a precise number of months  If you look through the tone of the   principles, there really is nowhere else where we indicate with precision what exactly the timing   would be  One possible way of moving through this is to pick up the “probable” language that   we use in paragraph 5, where we indicate “probably within a few months” and tack that onto the   end of the first sentence in paragraph 4, where we could then indicate that it would probably be   within a half-year, or whatever it is, after the modification of the forward guidance  I think that   would be more consistent with the tone of the set of principles that we’re talking about    I would suggest, “probably within a half-year after the modification of   the forward guidance”    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am broadly comfortable with the approach   set forth   June 21–22, 2011 53 of 282               Thank you, Mr Chairman  The moderate pace of the economic recovery   continues to be shaken by various forces  As a result, in the short and medium terms, we seem to   be moving further away from our mandates  And, as we learned from this meeting’s financial   stability presentation and memo, financial stability, too, is presenting a key risk  To my mind,   the forces that are shaking us off the moderate growth path are related to declining home values,   rising prices, and growing and longer-term unemployment, all of which are weighing on   consumer confidence  Wrangling over the debt ceiling isn’t helping as our lawmakers remain at   odds over raising the cap by $24 trillion  The Conference Board shows a dip in the confidence   index, even from April  Americans are more pessimistic about the economy and their income   prospects  Something I had never heard of before I came here, the so-called misery index, which   means what it sounds like it means, is on an upward trajectory   As I have noted before, one fulcrum of concern is housing  Residential construction has   subtracted from growth in GDP in four of the seven quarters since June 2009  That is a contrast   with the past three recoveries, when housing added to economic growth for at least a year and a   half following the downturns in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s  Two years ago home prices   stopped falling, as low prices, along with homebuyer tax credits, spurred a surge in sales    Demand then collapsed last summer when those credits expired  Markets currently don’t have   enough buyers to absorb a steady flow of foreclosed properties  This phenomenon is broad   based  Twelve of the 20 metropolitan areas tracked by Case-Schiller have posted new lows    Only the Washington, DC, and Seattle metropolitan areas saw month-to-month growth  Indeed,   June 21–22, 2011 152 of 282              the share of mortgage borrowers who have negative housing equity has moved up further in   recent quarters to above 25 percent  This figure translates into about 12 percent of all   households  These falling equity values dent consumer confidence  They remind homeowners   that each month they are making monthly payments on mortgages that exceed the value of their   homes; it underscores that the investments in their homes are shaky and not capable of being   drawn upon for home improvements, college tuition, or unforeseen medical expenses  Some of   these homeowners will throw back the keys, but even more will attempt a modification in order   to try to get some relief from a burdensome monthly payment  Those who become delinquent   will get on the slow train toward foreclosure   This is a train to nowhere, not just for the homeowner, who will soon no longer be a   homeowner, but for the bank that holds the mortgage  The large bank holding companies most   actively involved in mortgage-related activities continue to add provisions for repurchase losses    Repurchase reserves for the four largest bank holding companies now stand at about   $118 billion, which, even at that staggering amount, is believed by many supervisors to be   insufficient  Foreclosure is also a train to nowhere for the economy, because increased   foreclosures are a continued rightward drift in supply, further depressing home prices   One of the big pressures on the demand for housing is the creation of households by   younger people  In a sign of the interconnectedness of the problem of unemployment, many   young people—who are suffering more than average from unemployment right now—are   doubling up, moving in with friends, with family, and with landlords by necessity, who   themselves are struggling to pull together the monthly mortgage payment and are posting extra   rooms in their houses on Craigslist to bring in extra cash  During normal times, about   125 million households would be created each year, but that figure now stands at roughly   June 21–22, 2011 153 of 282              750,000  If falling prices cause buyers of all ages to delay purchases, prices will be pushed even   lower  One possible method of halting this rightward shift in supply is to intervene with   homeowners before delinquency and move them away from the entry point to the foreclosure   pipeline  Properly structured short sales are one way this could be explored  In addition,   interventions that consist of government purchases of vacant properties in the foreclosure   pipeline could also slow a rightward supply shift and a downward demand shift   To sum up, both declining home values and more, and more longer-term, unemployment   are weighing on confidence and consumption  The effects of this dampening seem to be more   evident because growth in GDP is not robust enough to mask them  It’s like the turbulence you   feel on an airplane, which is always worrisome, but is all the more worrisome when the plane is   flying closer to the ground  Alternatively understood, the behaviors that are emerging from the   intersection of the housing market, unemployment, and confidence impose social costs that are   showing up in slow consumption and slow growth in ways that are now unmasked and ways that   we are only beginning to understand  We don’t completely understand these interactions of   depressed indicators, but they seem entirely relevant to our assessment of economic conditions   and the future path of our economy    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the outlook described in   alternative B out of an abundance of hope that the serious downside risks to economic growth do   not materialize  I also support the policy prescription in alternative B   However the economic books and posterity judge the effects of this Committee’s historic   purchases of $600 billion of Treasury securities, one legacy of the large-scale asset program that   both the advocates and the critics agree on is that this program took place against a backdrop of   weak macroeconomic data in the United States; suboptimal fiscal policy; modest, at best, growth   in gross domestic product; high joblessness; and a flat housing market  Part of the rationale for   the LSAP was that it would stimulate, or at least counteract, slow economic growth through the   transmission effects of low interest rates  However, when the LSAP began last November, there   followed a rigorous bout of Treasury selling, sending yields sharply higher  Predictably, rates   then moved down, after peaking at 377 percent in February  Rates on benchmark 10-year notes   are now back below 3 percent, compared with 248 percent before the start of purchases  Where   rates would have been in the absence of the LSAP is questionable  But regardless of whether, in   the absence of LSAP, rates would have been higher and deflationary pressures would have taken   hold, we do know that lower interest rates have not translated into vastly accelerated business   investment or momentous consumption  From this perspective, the argument for more QE of a   similar size and composition is questionable  Some argue that the LSAP was too modest, but   June 21–22, 2011 191 of 282              even if it was right-sized for the economy as we saw it then, it seems to me that identical   monetary policy accommodation that would be aimed directly at interest rates on Treasuries and   mortgage rates may not be the prescription for today’s problems  Instead, I think a different   response should now be considered that addresses with precision the portions of the economy   that are clogged   What does such a response look like?  I’m not sure I know, but am heartened by some of   the ideas put forward by many here today and yesterday  I can think of a couple of guideposts,   though, that could help steer us  First, I think we need a hypothesis that identifies where the   congestion is occurring  My present view is that we have low interest rates, which should be   capable of spurring economic growth, but that something else is gumming up the transmission    That something may be an econometric view of consumer confidence that is weighted too much   toward the wealth effects of shareholder equity and too little toward the wealth effects of home   values  That something may be the absence of value-maximizing behavior in the behavior of   servicers and investors  That something may be decisionmaking by the conservator of Fannie   Mae and Freddie Mac that is not leading to sustainable loan modifications  We may determine,   ultimately, that the only congestion is one of a rational lag in recovery, or we may determine that   there is congestion and decide there is nothing that is within the realm of the Federal Reserve to   be done about it  But we certainly can’t come to any conclusion until we try to reach a   consensus about what is gumming up the system   Second, we need to understand that while it may not be our responsibility or   congressionally-given right to act out of the box, it is our responsibility to think out of the box    We need to be actively involved in fertilizing the ideas that our staffs bring forward   June 21–22, 2011 192 of 282              Third, we need to think about temporal interconnections between trends  We’ve talked a   lot about them in the last day  For example, if unemployment stays high for an extended period   of time, or, in other words, if the number of long-term unemployed increases or the average   amount of time a person is out of a job increases, does this affect consumer confidence?  Does   this increase the number of homes put into foreclosure?  Or if interest rates are low for an   extended period of time, what yield-chasing activities are resulting in a more destabilized   financial system?  And when do we move beyond monitoring and become regulatorily concerned   and poised to act?  These are but some questions and guideposts that could keep us on the   forefront of making sure that we continue to generate cutting-edge ideas about what our   economy is experiencing, with potential applications to what we are choosing to do about it  It   seems to me that the considerable expertise around this table is needed more than ever to press us   forward in a joint exploration of what ails this economy and whether we’re going to think about   doing something within our power about it  Thank you    Just on the “up or down”  I don’t think it’s hugely problematic, but   anytime we talk about adjustments, we don’t say “up or down”  Just here we talk about   adjustments “up or down”  So the question is  When we are silent as to “up or down,” does it   suggest only one way?  Are we leaning a certain way on this particular adjustment in number 5   because we’ve indicated “up or down,” whereas in number 4, we have referred to adjustments   without saying “up or down”?  "
9021,2011-08-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to say I have found the internal   dialectic of the conversation here very informative, as it began with the English–Sack memo  I   appreciated the framework of options that they set out and then the subsequent clarification that   came through after the Kocherlakota–Lacker set of memos   I want to say that I, too, am most comfortable with options 1 through 5, although unlike   what seems to be the consensus view, I did find myself puzzled and challenged with some of the   operational questions that even 1 through 5 would pose  I had scratched in the margins of my   memo questions like, “What does it mean for a haircut to be consistent with historical norms,   when in fact there has not ever been a US default of Treasuries or a significant downgrade by   rating agencies?”  I asked myself, operationally, how the Desk is going to decide on any   particular purchase whether it’s going to accept defaulted or nondefaulted securities  How would   the Desk determine whether the per-dealer limit would be loosened?  So those are, I know,   answerable questions, but ones that I think are embedded in even options 1 through 5   There are two takeaways for me about this episode that come from a contextual   perspective  One is how market functioning is distinct from, but also interacts with, the dual   August 1, 2011 48 of 53              mandate, particularly in a context of fiscal stalemate  That, I think, is a generalizable description   of one of the big challenges we have  The other takeaway for me is how the business-as-usual   approach, which has very comforting and calming kinds of properties, really does fade into the   appearance of problematic positions, such as monetizing the debt or interfering with market   function or bailing out particular sectors or promoting moral hazard  I think it’s something that   we will probably continue to grapple with in decisions ahead   In terms of the other options that are not 1 through 5, I think they present significant and   considerable challenges, primarily on the communications side  I don’t view these challenges as   absolute bars, but I do think that they are significant and would require significant care in   executing  Thank you  "
9045,2011-08-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  To me, the economy appears to be faltering,   and the probability that this faltering exposes us to increased sensitivity and vulnerability has   risen materially  Labor market conditions are certainly weaker than in June  Although the   unemployment rate ticked down last month, I don’t see any good news in the labor market   situation  For one thing, I think discouraged workers are holding down the unemployment rate    Indeed, the household survey indicates that the share of the working-age population that is now   employed stands at 581 percent, the lowest level since 1983  In addition, more-forward-looking   indicators of labor demand, like the number of temporary employees or the claims figures, are   not at all encouraging  According to the Labor Department, there are 46 unemployed workers   for every job opening, and these job figures were added in the middle of July before the debt   ceiling debate and before stocks began their steep descent  The economy may not be falling   back into recession, but neither does it appear to be growing at the 3 percent rate many had   hoped to see in the second half of the year   One of the theories suggested in the Tealbook to explain the notable weakness is that the   self-equilibrating tendency of the economy has been greatly weakened by the damage resulting   from the financial crisis  This theory is only partially plausible to me, and here is my evaluation   of it  Consumer and business confidence are not recovering the way they usually do following a   downturn, and this lack of confidence could be, as it seems to be already, snowballing into a self-  reinforcing cycle of anxiety  Businesses are hunkering down, weakening the job market further,   and consumers, in turn, are launching their own programs of austerity, curbing the spending the   economy needs to grow  If you think through the usual determinants of consumption—  disposable income, employment, stockholder wealth effects, housing wealth effects, and   August 9, 2011 78 of 162              confidence—they all are currently a drag on consumer spending growth, and it’s not obvious to   me how they are going to get turned around   Most disturbingly, the interactions among these factors seem to be dragging down   economic growth even more  For example, I have a neighbor with an elite MBA but a job that   doesn’t need one, and she is so embarrassed about the real possibility of losing her home that she   used to call me repeatedly when I was the banking commissioner, pleading for secrecy but   needing a sustainable modification  On this past Saturday morning, when I went to retrieve my   newspaper in the yard, she drove by in her car and stopped to chat  I asked her how she was   doing, and she said something like, “Thank goodness I squandered my savings fighting   foreclosure so I don’t have investments to tank after the debt deal that won’t get us anything”    [Laughter]  That formulation kind of took my breath away, so we talked about the weather  But   her remark makes me wonder about the self-correcting part of the staff’s possible hypothesis  If   the components of consumption are weak and households don’t expect much improvement, what   moves the economy back to its trend level of growth?  It may well be that the overhang of   private debt needs to be reduced before we get a sustainable recovery  After all, taking a long   look back, personal debt had become a cornerstone of economic and capital market activity    While initially consumer debt existed at the fringes of the economy, the prevalence of   installment loans, national mortgage markets, and credit cards permitted consumers to borrow   against money they did not have  As the future of middle-class incomes becomes much less   stable, the logic of borrowing against such hypothetical future incomes begins to unravel  In the   run-up to the crisis, credit was closing the gap between the haves and the have-nots, but without   rising real wages and with a burst credit bubble, vast amounts of debt remain  If debt   deleveraging takes about seven years, we’re smack in the middle of slower growth, with more to   August 9, 2011 79 of 162              come, and the question becomes less about what the outlook for the economy is and more about   how monetary policy can help with the pace of this debt deleveraging   There are two dynamics that I think will hold back growth for a while  First, households   and businesses don’t have confidence in the future and so they’re not willing to spend money and   take risks right now  Second, households need to deleverage and aren’t willing to borrow in   order to spend ahead of their incomes  If I’m right about these, the economy isn’t going to   recover quickly on its own and is going to need considerable policy support  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Now, before we take alternative B off the   table with the statement on forward guidance, I want to say a couple of things in support of it    August 9, 2011 132 of 162              First of all, I think it’s appropriately forceful but accurate in its characterization of the incoming   data  It now slightly de-emphasizes the role of temporary factors in the first-half slowdown  I   think the slow economic growth in the first half of this year extends beyond the factors that   we’ve labeled as transitory  Weaker growth in disposable personal income, to me, signals a   protracted slowdown in consumer spending, particularly given the persistently low level of   consumer confidence  Nonetheless, I think that the pickup in inflation over the first half of this   year is a transitory phenomenon, and I think that inflation will be subdued over the medium term    In fact, it appears to me as if a moderation in inflation is already under way, especially given that   energy prices have decreased significantly from their peaks during the spring  And as we’ve   heard today, both survey- and market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have   changed little, on balance, over the course of the year  There’s going to continue to be   considerable slack in labor markets over coming quarters, which will continue to exert   significant restraint on wages and prices   Now, the statement of forward guidance  Like you, Mr Chairman, I think that   alternative B without the statement of forward guidance runs the risk of communicating that the   Committee is unable or unwilling to merely clarify its anticipation of responding to this   protracted slowdown  Because I think that an important source of the weakness in the economy   is that households and businesses don’t have confidence that things will get better, I have   reservations about a statement that leaves the impression that we cannot or will not clarify our   anticipation  If we choose not to clarify our anticipation, as in alternative B without any   additional language, I think we need to explain why more clearly  Otherwise, we run the risk of   creating confusion   August 9, 2011 133 of 162              I recognize that one problem is that not everybody on this Committee agrees on the   diagnosis or the treatment plan for the ailing economy, but we can’t let our lack of consensus   cause us to confuse the public  At this point, we run the risk of giving the impression either that   we can’t do anything or that we won’t do anything, and that we will not clarify our anticipation,   which I fear would exacerbate the lack of confidence in the economy  So I think we should   consider sending a stronger signal with our language about how long we are prepared to keep   rates low  I’d be very supportive of clarifying our forward guidance and believe that this would   be a significant step, not in terms of monetary accommodation, but in terms of providing greater   transparency about our overall strategy and about the policy path that we see as most appropriate   for fostering our dual mandate  So I think it would be helpful to include something  And here,   again, this language that was circulated—to me, all that it does is really describe with more   specificity the economic conditions that are likely to warrant the continuation of an exceptionally   low funds rate  It also provides some loose indication of the time horizon over which we expect   those conditions to prevail  In sum, even if I thought that not clarifying our anticipation would   most likely end with us successfully fulfilling the dual mandate in the future, I find it prudent to   clarify now, not because the language is going to have a big impact, but because the fragile state   of the economy at the moment makes it very vulnerable to any new negative shocks or the   worsening of ongoing shocks, and clarifying our anticipation may help on the margin  "
9071,2011-09-20,"  Yes  Just a question, Brian, regarding the New York policy survey  In   terms of the probabilities of additional policy actions, we are seeing a relatively high probability   on providing SOMA guidance, and I was wondering if you could talk about your sense of what   the participants in this survey are looking for  I think you said that they seem to be looking for   explicit guidance on the path of the balance sheet, but of course, we’ve put out principles   regarding how we would conduct an exit strategy  So my question is whether you can shed any   light on what else they seem to be looking for   September 20–21, 2011 15 of 290               Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, here is my view regarding the efficacy   of balance sheet tools  A maturity extension program, for example, can reduce duration risk,   putting downward pressure on term premiums and thereby longer-term interest rates  I don’t   doubt that this channel works  To me, the fundamental question is not so much whether longer-  term interest rates are sensitive to changes in the balance sheet, but to what degree economic   activity is sensitive to changes in longer-term interest rates  I assume that when we ascertain the   efficacy of policy tools tied to the balance sheet, this latter question is of primary importance    The ultimate value of balance sheet tools, after all, is whether they produce the desired effect,   and only the desired effect, on economic growth, employment, and price stability   At this point, I’m concerned that there are frictions inhibiting the transmission between   longer-term interest rates and economic growth, so that determining the appropriate sizing of   balance sheet actions and effectively communicating our policy decisions publicly have   enhanced urgency  As I’ve noted before, the effectiveness of this Committee’s actions has been   affected adversely by the difficulty and slow pace of household balance sheet repair and   restructuring  If times were normal, we would expect a smooth transmission to occur such that   decreases in interest rates would encourage households to purchase houses, cars, and other   consumer goods  Because of household balance sheet problems, this channel is likely severely   attenuated   Second, as we all know, there’s an excess supply of housing, the elimination of which is   not proving very sensitive to interest rates  In past expansions, residential construction has been   September 20–21, 2011 106 of 290              a vital component of recovery  This has not, obviously, been the case in this recovery, and I   suspect that even if we could set 30-year rates at zero, we would still not see much new   construction until the excess housing supply is eliminated  Third—and this is an additional   factor clogging, so to speak, the transmission of low interest rates to greater economic growth—  is the role played by the general lack of confidence and uncertainty plaguing households and   businesses  Whether these are due to the threat posed by European sovereign debt and European   banks or other sources, the lack of confidence and increase in perceived risk discourage   households from undertaking substantial new spending and businesses from expanding payrolls,   productive capacity, and inventory holdings, no matter how low interest rates are  Because of   these factors, and there are others that we are all aware of, our monetary policy strategy has to   be, it seems to me, less piecemeal and more coordinated  The challenge with balance sheet tools   is that we run the risk of pushing on a string or not appropriately sizing our responses if we don’t   think through how we believe these clogs, or friction points, get addressed and how they   constrain our need to respond going forward  I am fully aware that many, if not all, of these   obstacles are not within the realm of monetary policy  But to my mind, that means it’s our   responsibility to clarify for others where these fixes need to happen in order to improve   confidence, enhance the sensitivity of growth to interest rates, and make our policies potentially   more effective   All that said, I believe that policy tools tied to the Fed’s balance sheet have been closely   associated with declines in interest rates at the long end of the yield curve  And we have seen   some discernible effects on things like credit conditions, confidence, relative asset prices,   liquidity, and bank lending  Moreover, although I’m concerned that growth might not be as   sensitive to interest rates as it has been historically, I don’t think that the responsiveness is so   September 20–21, 2011 107 of 290              small as to make the policy useless  Rather, I think there is still room to bring down the longer   end of the yield curve in such a way as to produce some shifts in economic growth  Just last   week, shortly after mortgage rates had tumbled to the lowest levels in at least four decades, an   increase in mortgage applications suggested at least some response from homebuyers   I’ll be brief on the subject of reducing IOER, except to note that while I take seriously the   concerns expressed by some on the Committee regarding IOER, I wonder about the public   perception of continuing to pay what is perceived as a high rate on reserves when rates on   Treasury bills are close to zero  I find the perception problem among the American public   exacerbated by the fact that many foreign branches currently hold unusually large reserves    Ultimately, we should gauge the effectiveness of this tool by the amount of growth it could   produce as compared with our other tools and whether this amount of growth is worth pursuing   in light of the probability of unintended consequences  The costs of this option, it seems to me,   mostly relate to money market functioning, and those costs are worse the greater the decrease in   IOER  Mitigating some of these costs is an option to not cut to zero  So if we decide not to   pursue this avenue with a modest decrease in the IOER, I remain concerned with the appearance   problems regarding the Committee’s hesitation to use this tool   As to the communication tools, I think they hold potential  I’m positively inclined to the   proposal of providing more-explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s longer-run   objective for inflation and its projection of the level to which the unemployment rate will   converge over time  This will provide more-explicit, quantitative information about the   Committee’s reaction function and will serve to ground it with the communication regarding π*   and u*  My view is that we need to endeavor to improve public confidence—not, of course, by   distorting our description of the true state of the economy, but by creating through our   September 20–21, 2011 108 of 290              communications the credible expectation that we have a series of maneuvers that will move the   economy closer to the goals set in our statutory mandate  To the extent that businesses, the   markets, households, and the public understand where we are heading, and assuming we can   assure them we are credible, the greater will be our ability to nudge forward growth in the   context of price stability  I think these communication tools are a way forward in improving   mean expectations, which contribute to reductions in uncertainty and gains in confidence  As   long as we can put in place words and actions that enhance their credibility, that they are in   essence contracts we are establishing, to signal to economic agents that we are anticipating using   other tools, as appropriate, to manage to these levels, then I would be favorably disposed  This   task strikes me as exceedingly difficult, and yet the extraordinary nature of our times demands   we try    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The good news is that the economy has not   fallen off a cliff despite the confidence shock that was precipitated by the debt ceiling impasse,   the downgrade of the US sovereign rating, the worsening of the debt crisis in Europe, and   financial market volatility that has occurred since the time of the August meeting  We have   staggered through August without a financial collapse  That said, to me we look stuck  The   recent unemployment report shows an economy with little momentum  Payrolls were flat in   August, the workweek fell, and aggregate hours worked in the private sector have declined over   the past few months   September 20–21, 2011 175 of 290              Businesses are likely holding back on hiring because they are unsure when their   customers will fully return  Meanwhile, consumers are still coping with the sharp loss of wage   growth and wealth, driven now by a triple whammy  low rates of disposable income growth,   drops in home equity, and, now, hits in terms of volatility in the stock market  Consumers are   also coping with an uncertain future  Indeed, discretionary consumer spending, a category that   excludes housing, food, and health care and includes things like restaurant meals, entertainment,   education, and most durable goods, is still down 12 percent more than three years after the   business cycle peak  Going back decades, such spending has never remained weak for that long    Moreover, consumer spending is showing no signs of returning to the growth rates we saw   during the recoveries of the 1980s and 1990s  In this environment, it seems quite likely that both   firms and households will be easily frightened by any new adverse economic news, be it gas   prices that are remaining stubbornly high or unease about policymakers’ abilities to reach   consensus on important issues   At the same time, measures of inflation seem to me to indicate stability  The 12-month   change in core PCE prices is around 1½ percent  Moreover, longer-run inflation expectations   from the Michigan survey continue to hover in the same range they’ve occupied for some time,   and inflation compensation from TIPS markets has fallen recently   It appears that the ongoing weakness in the labor market is keeping inflation in check,   and that there’s not much risk of an unhinging of inflationary expectations that would feed into a   dangerous wage–price spiral  That said, there remains the worry that persistently high   unemployment could push up the structural unemployment rate in the long run, leading to a   situation where the labor market outcomes that are consistent with price stability are much less   satisfactory  At present, it’s my view that we’re probably a long way from that occurring  To be   September 20–21, 2011 176 of 290              sure, some estimates suggest an increase in the structural unemployment rate of up to   1 percentage point, and that has already happened  But most estimates still put the structural   level far below the actual level of unemployment  However, if labor market conditions don’t   begin to improve sometime soon, structural unemployment could rise further  In particular, the   unusually high share of long-term unemployed—with the share of those unemployed for   27 weeks and longer now at 43 percent, well above the 15 percent historical average—raises   concerns that workers will at some point begin to find it difficult to reenter employment as their   skills decay   The possibility that the long-term unemployed will reduce our country’s future growth   potential is exacerbated the longer high long-term unemployment exists  From this perspective,   the long path to recovery is relevant  In most recoveries, the ratio of residential investment to   GDP jumps and provides a significant impetus to the recovery, but this has certainly not   happened in this recovery, and I’m hard-pressed to see how it will happen anytime soon  As a   result, I expect it will be quite some time before the unemployment rate comes down in any   significant way  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Persistent weakness in labor markets,   accompanied by the significant risk that sustained high unemployment could push up the   September 20–21, 2011 242 of 290              structural unemployment rate in the longer term, suggests to me that continued accommodation   is warranted  However, in order to make a notable difference to the economy, a sizable action is   needed in my view, well beyond the Twist described in alternative B  While I agree with the   qualitative features of this plan—removing duration risk from the market without increasing the   size of the balance sheet—it is unlikely that the magnitude we are considering by itself will   deliver an impulse sufficient to get the economy out of the doldrums  The largest boost to   economic growth I’ve seen for this action is ½ percentage point, and even this modest number   may end up being too high  At a 10-year yield of 2 percent, much of the impact on longer-term   interest rates is now probably discounted, and while it’s still early, I would be surprised if this   move alone would have a significant positive impact on the economy  Nonetheless, at this   juncture I think we need to do all we can to raise mean expectations of growth  From this   perspective, I note that Committee participants with the help of staff have brought forward very   interesting variations in the tools we have, and I believe that these variations could be useful in   nudging the economy to greater growth   Before briefly commenting on certain specific portions of alternative B, I want to say that   contingency plans are important  We should do contingency planning  But we also have to do   what we can to keep these contingencies from hurting us now, by creating the conditions now for   stronger economic growth by inoculating, so to speak, the economy or partially insuring it from   the impact of greater harm later on  For example, if the situation worsens in Europe and dollars   become more of a safe haven leading to appreciation, clearly we would see our net exports   declining, and, all else being equal, we would be led to weaker economic growth, which brings   us back to where we are now and the ultimate challenges that we are looking at  Obviously I’m   discounting here the effect of greater financial disruption  But I do want to make sure that we   September 20–21, 2011 243 of 290              don’t use the necessary steps regarding contingency planning as just a way of kicking the can   down the road in terms of what we can be doing now  In terms of that, I am heartened by a lot of   the different suggestions that have been made  I think that Narayana’s suggestion about moving   from a date certain to duration has particular virtues in these times  It would be something, too,   that would not require us to change language with the rapidity that we currently do, and that   suggestion has potential   In terms of 3′ versus 3, I’m sensitive to Jim’s concern regarding stimulus fatigue  Most   of us remember that one reaction to QE2 was the fixation on the total program size, the notion   that what was done in QE2 was government spending of a magnificent magnitude  If we’re of   the view that this level of analytical understanding in the public hasn’t changed much, we may   want to consider repositioning how we as individuals communicate this and how our press   people present it  On the reference to housing in paragraph 4, I want to just remind us all that it   is the failure of the housing market to bounce back that is a significant factor in holding back   economic growth  While it may not be time to do this now, I would favor the slight   enhancement in mortgage market conditions that is implied by paragraph 4 in alternative B  I   don’t think that there is really something to watch here or that we need to wait in terms of   understanding what’s going on in the housing market  But I do feel sensitive to the concerns that   we may want to analyze more closely the effect regarding credit allocation and the real   improvement that would come through such action  I want to say something about paragraph 6   and the bracketed language regarding the fact that “the Committee discussed the range of policy   tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability” and   note in deciding whether to include that language that it does appear to be the truth  [Laughter]    Finally, I close by saying that in terms of the inflation language, I am moved by the current   September 20–21, 2011 244 of 290              structure that paragraph 1 continues to be where things are now, and that we put in paragraph 2   the Committee’s views regarding what will happen to what we are seeing  I would be fine   adding the language “appearing to moderate”  Thank you  "
9100,2011-11-01,"  Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman  One question, Michael, from an   operational perspective on the nominal income targeting, and that has to do with whether the   activity component of nominal income is known in a timely way and as a reliable data point   sufficient to permit adjustment    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I think flexible inflation targeting can   be consistent with the dual mandate  Unlike the Committee’s current approach of constrained   discretion, flexible inflation targeting is more optimal if it involves conditional commitments   November 1–2, 2011 89 of 282              referencing both parts of the dual mandate and indicating how policy rates will be adjusted going   forward  Constrained discretion, on the other hand, means that the Committee proceeds on a   meeting-to-meeting basis and remains unwilling to promise future accommodation via   communication  With this current approach, the Federal Reserve will not meet its employment   goal for a long time and may be at risk of undershooting its inflation goal as well  Moreover, the   continued use of constrained discretion means that the funds rate begins to increase in 2014 even   though unemployment is well above the natural rate and inflation is below 2 percent  I respond   to question 1 by believing a framework of flexible inflation targeting can be structured to be   better aligned with the dual mandate and more likely to lead to optimal results that are better   achieved with commitment strategies that reference both employment and inflation  In terms of   articulating a framework, I see no downside and can imagine developing a statement on the   policy framework similar to that used for the exit strategy statement   The staff memo on alternative frameworks describes the superiority of commitment   strategies  The memo makes clear that there are risks in such strategies, most notably risks   related to the possibility that the commitment strategies would perform less well if their   credibility were significantly questioned, and that there are challenges in the use of such   strategies, most notably the challenge of communication  Even the most stimulative policies   considered do not imply significant overshooting of inflation above a possible long-run goal of   2 percent  I believe that the commitment strategies are superior, but only with a strong caveat    That caveat is the imperative of a well-developed and well-tested and multifaceted   communication strategy  Unfortunately, to date we have not put enough effort into framing such   a communication strategy, and the results have been negative and troubling to this institution and   November 1–2, 2011 90 of 282              to the Committee  The launch of the second LSAP, for example, was met with a barrage of   mostly uninformed negativity, which may have undermined its effectiveness   Paragraph 4 in alternative A1 presents three strategies with increasing commitment and   accommodative value  The first option is the least transparent, contains the lowest commitment,   and accordingly, would provide the least accommodation  The third option is the most   transparent, contains the greatest commitment, and accordingly, I would expect it to provide the   most accommodation  The latter two options could bring about a noticeably faster fall in   unemployment than under the baseline outlook while keeping inflation in the neighborhood of   2 percent  Whichever of these options is chosen, there should be a corresponding   communication program set forth for the Committee to discuss and debate  In addition to this   enhanced forward guidance, which looks more like the third option for paragraph 4 in alternative   A1 and less like the first option for paragraph 4 in alternative A1, the staff memo describes two   other commitment strategies  price-level targeting and nominal income targeting  Both of these   strategies are shown by staff to be more optimal under various models, including FRB/US, than   the Committee’s existing strategy  I appreciate how critical credibility is to the execution and   success of these commitment strategies and appreciate the scale and creativity that would be   involved in the crafting of a comprehensive communication strategy   Again, I don’t view the communication challenge as insurmountable  Rather, I would   venture to say that communication thought of as a strategy is a challenge that needs more serious   debate and piloting  From this perspective, I believe the communication challenge to be just as   intense for our current framework and choice of policy actions  There’s continued risk to the   credibility of the Federal Reserve in a decision to continue to engage in constrained discretion   November 1–2, 2011 91 of 282              because we have not described to the public why we are choosing to engage in what we have   decided is a suboptimal strategy   Model simulations suggest that nominal income targeting could provide considerable   stimulus under the modal outlook and would perform well in a severe downturn or in response to   an unexpected sustained rise in inflationary pressures  Accordingly, if the credibility challenges   could be overcome with a meaningfully robust and comprehensive communication program, I   would view us as remiss in meeting the dual mandate if we were not to consider it   Finally, I should attempt to be concrete about what I think a communication plan   includes  At the very least, we need to be able to explain the expected transmission of the action    I was stunned when talking to a group of bankers after one of them said to me, “Please stop  Just   stop  What can we do to get you all to just cease?”  This kind of question makes it obvious that   our actions are not completely understood and suggests that we focus resources on a   communication plan both through the SEP and through a coordinated strategy that can explain   how our policy actions are expected to work and how they may fall short  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy remains mired in the worst   slump since that of the 1930s  While recent readings on retail sales, capital goods orders and   shipments, and nonresidential construction have turned up, important indicators of near-term   economic activity remain downbeat  Business surveys point to continued caution, conditions in   the labor market have not brightened, and gains in industrial production, excluding the motor   vehicle supply chain, remain sluggish  These disappointing indicators likely reflect the fact that   the factors that have been restraining the pace of the recovery are still in place  The large   overhang of vacant housing units remains, credit availability remains impaired, and risk   premiums remain elevated  In the interest of time, I won’t comment on the European situation or   the housing situation or the fiscal situation  I also won’t comment on drug use among non–  purple squirrels  Instead, I just want to talk for a minute about consumer sentiment, which is   another factor likely continuing to hold back the recovery   November 1–2, 2011 184 of 282              Confidence measures are at historic lows, and recent measures of confidence remain   exceedingly low, probably due to households’ concerns about low future income and wealth,   which tend to depress consumption  Despite last week’s report showing a 05 percent increase in   real consumer spending in September, a welcome surprise for sure, I’m not optimistic that   households are ready to be an engine of growth for this economy  For one thing, the September   increase was not accompanied by rising incomes  Rather, real disposable income edged down in   September and has increased only very modestly over the past 12 months  The resulting   downdrift in the saving rate to around 4 percent in the third quarter might be interpreted as a sign   that households are feeling optimistic again, but the lousy consumer sentiment numbers and the   lack of any improvement in home equity values suggest that this is very unlikely to be the case   and that consumer spending will be subdued going forward   The lack of any meaningful increase in real incomes for the vast majority of households   suggests that many are feeling pretty strapped, even those who have jobs and are not under   water  This is evident in the spreading discourse about income inequality in the country, which   the Chairman has been asked about  Many of us are receiving personally addressed letters to our   homes from protesters, and I have the one that I received just yesterday  Page 1 reads, “End the   Fed”  This is typical because I do get one a day, and this is Occupy Muskegon  Many of the   Reserve Bank presidents, too, I know, are dealing with Occupy Wall Street protesters in their   cities and at their Banks  Regardless of how any of us feel about the merits of the 99–1 critique,   we have to acknowledge that this is not only a cost of a lack of aggregate demand, a cost of long-  term unemployment, but also an additional factor that is affecting social cohesion, dignity, and   American optimism   November 1–2, 2011 185 of 282              In sum, the pace of consumer spending is up, but the low level of sentiment, volatility in   the stock market, and tepid gains in employment and income projected for the coming years   continue to weigh on consumer spending and thus on overall economic activity  It’s hard to see   what string of events will eventually break this cycle, and as a consequence, I continue to expect   the pace of the recovery to be subpar  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Some of the incoming data indicate that the   downside risks have receded somewhat  But unemployment is still projected to decline only   gradually, and inflation is still projected to settle at or below mandate-consistent levels  The   economy is still in dire straits, with sentiment highly pessimistic  Again, I am not optimistic that   households, many of which have lower levels of disposable income, are yet ready to be an engine   of growth for this economy  We have not fallen off the cliff, but the margin of safety is not   wide  Downside risk is significant   November 1–2, 2011 229 of 282              First, I think that early cessation of the maturity extension program, as suggested in   alternative C, would be premature  It also would challenge the credibility of the Committee to   reverse a decision so quickly when economic indicators have not materially changed  In my   view, early cessation of the maturity extension program requires more-definitive data confirming   that the recovery has strengthened and that unemployment has begun to decline   I’m instinctively drawn to alternative A1 because, with the federal funds rate constrained   by the zero lower bound and with elevated downside risks to output, stronger forward guidance   seems prudent  But stronger forward guidance of any type requires a communication strategy in   order to be effective  In order to maximize the benefits of accommodation promised by such   stronger forward guidance, I’d like to understand what communication efforts would accompany   such an action  Once these communication plans are developed and considered, the option in   alternative A1 will be more credible to the public  Until then, staying the course, as in   alternative B, seems appropriate  But I am drawn to the need to update our reaction function in   paragraph 4 by reflecting the “six to seven quarters” language, which I think is more   commensurate with at least my economic outlook  I’m sensitive to President Kocherlakota’s   argument that keeping the “through mid-2013” language reduces the level of accommodation    So I look forward to the work of the subcommittee on communications to create for the full   Committee’s consideration a framework for enhanced forward guidance Thank you  "
9120,2011-11-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a couple of operational issues that are   suggested by the text that I thought would be worth getting some clarification on  First of all, I   was wondering whether we know the timing of other central bank announcements, if we were to   go forward with this   November 28, 2011 31 of 40               Thank you  Second, in terms of the process that is suggested in the   second paragraph of the resolution, there is a sentence in it that indicates that the “requests for   drawings on the foreign currency swap lines and distribution of the proceeds to US financial   institutions shall be initiated by the appropriate Reserve Bank and approved by the Chairman in   consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee”  One question I have on that process is   really about the statement of approval by the Chairman, and the question is whether that is an   “approved or denied,” or is the implication that it would be, in essence, “approved”?    So it’s “approved or denied”?    Okay  And in that same sentence, the idea about “distribution of the   proceeds to US financial institutions”—to come back to the earlier part of the conversation   regarding transparency, would the distribution of proceeds to US financial institutions be   disclosed?    Thank you  "
9141,2011-12-13,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Some of the news we’ve received over the   past several weeks has been pretty good  Consumers are buying motor vehicles and other goods   at a faster clip than we had expected, and consumer sentiment moved up off its recent lows  In   addition, the unemployment rate dropped and new claims for unemployment insurance have   been edging down  However, I’m not convinced that we’ve actually seen much sustainable   improvement in these two areas, and that’s what I’d like to focus on right now  I should also say   that we’ve seen zero improvement in the housing market, but I won’t discuss that today  A lot   December 13, 2011 75 of 198              has been said about Europe, and I won’t add anything to that discussion even though the   situation is critical to our country’s growth prospects   In the labor market, all indicators other than the unemployment rate are pointing to only   modest, if any, improvement  Job gains have been disappointing  Unemployment insurance   claims are only creeping lower, and hiring plans are pretty stagnant this year  Even the   unemployment rate declines don’t look that great  Of the ¾ percentage point decline in the   unemployment rate over the past year, about ¼ percentage point of it may be due to people   dropping out of the labor force when their unemployment benefits run out, and probably some   others are dropping out due to discouragement   The rest of the improvement is pretty paltry for a recovery  Two and a half years into the   recovery, there are still 24 million underemployed people  I think the decline in the   unemployment rate exaggerates the improvement in underlying conditions, and I wouldn’t be   surprised if the rate moves back up a bit in December  At the current pace of improvement, it   will be years before the labor market can be described in positive terms, and by that time we   might well have started to see a loss of skills and networks among the unemployed and   underemployed, which could cause a long-run erosion of the economy’s productive potential, an   outcome that we should all want to avoid   Turning to consumer spending, while I’d like to believe the surprisingly strong   consumption recently is going to continue, it just doesn’t seem sustainable given all the other   information  Real disposable personal income declined in both the second and third quarters—  not much recovery there  The latest data on services from the quarterly services survey were   also pretty weak in the third quarter  Consumer sentiment is still below the levels from last   spring  While it’s encouraging that sentiment has moved up from the panicky levels of the late   December 13, 2011 76 of 198              summer, it still remains at levels we usually see in recessions, and frankly, if the extremely low   numbers we saw in September were associated with households’ concerns about policymaker   paralysis, the current debate about the payroll tax cut and the failure of the supercommittee is not   likely to help   One piece of the sentiment data that seems especially downbeat is households’   expectations of their own income expectations  These figures have not budged from their lows at   the 2008 trough  If households don’t think incomes are going to improve, it’s hard to see why   they would begin to spend in earnest  Moreover, many households are still adapting to the   $7 trillion decline in household wealth, particularly the sharp drop in real estate wealth that   occurred over the past several years  Consumers probably are still trying to rebuild their nest   eggs and replenish their retirement accounts, and that will likely continue to curtail their   spending in the quarters ahead  With all of this pessimism weighing on households, I don’t   believe that the recent sharp drop in the saving rate, which now stands at 3½ percent, is really   sustainable  Rather, I expect household spending to be pretty unimpressive going forward  I’ll   stop there    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before I turn to my preference for policy   options, I note some discomfort in the way the labor market is characterized in each of the three   policy alternatives  Even in Alternatives A and B, the wording is that indicators point to some   improvement in overall labor market conditions, and that is too strong  As I said in my earlier   statement, although I am encouraged by the decline in the unemployment rate, I think it may be   temporary, and I am not particularly impressed with the direction of other labor market   indicators  I share some of President Kocherlakota’s concerns about an undue focus on the   unemployment rate to the detriment of other labor market indicators and look forward to further   discussions in this area   I will turn now to my policy preferences  Over the past year, observing the sluggish pace   of recovery and the disappointing progress we are making toward fulfilling our statutory   mandate, I have wondered whether the problem is that monetary policy is currently powerless to   December 13, 2011 106 of 198              address the weaknesses in the labor market or whether we have just been setting monetary policy   too tight, either because we underestimated how much monetary stimulus was needed this year   or because we are being overly cautious with our nontraditional tools   Regarding the first point, it seems to me that monetary policy surely is not as powerful as   it has been in the past  While I have confidence in our ability to affect longer-term interest rates,   the inability of already very low rates to stimulate housing demand suggests this usually   important transmission channel depends on factors that monetary policy is not equipped to   address  Monetary policy cannot, for example, address the various obstacles and frictions that   are limiting access to mortgage credit among creditworthy borrowers to refinancing, facilitate   deeds in lieu and short sales when remaining in the property is not viable, or improve the   incentives of mortgage servicers  Around this table, we have not been able to directly address   the ongoing problems in the US housing market, which continues to impede our economic   recovery  But this doesn’t mean that monetary policy is completely powerless  For me, this has   been one of the fundamental challenges I have struggled with during my time on this Committee   It occurred to me last night that monetary policy transmission might be analogous to the   problem of the plumbing of the kitchen sink  When you look into your sink in the morning and   see that the remnants of last night’s dinner have adhered to the drain, do you roll up your sleeves   and pull out the spaghetti and pieces of garlic bread, or do you blast the water from the faucet   harder to force it all down?  [Laughter]  The critics of more monetary policy accommodation are   probably people who don’t advocate the water-blast-from-above approach, but believe the   clogging culprits need to be removed first, one at a time, and, they might add, not by them    [Laughter]  The advocates of more monetary policy accommodation believe one big blast from   December 13, 2011 107 of 198              the water faucet might just do the trick, and if that blast is powerful enough, it will sweep away   all of the stubborn debris clinging to the sides   What we have learned since the crisis began is that it is pretty challenging to pull out all   of the flotsam and jetsam from the drain  You think you’ve got it all, and, lo and behold, it is not   just spaghetti and scraps of garlic bread, but also lettuce and coffee grinds  You may think it is   just last night’s feast, but when you are pulling it all out, you realize it is also the debris of   dinners past  Maybe the blast of water or several repeated blasts in succession could do the trick   instead  This is a homespun way of saying that there is a considerable amount of evidence that   we may be setting monetary policy too tight as we rely on others to clear the impediments to   growth   For instance, the simple policy rule prescriptions in the Tealbook are concluding that,   unconstrained, we should lower the fed funds rate a couple of percentage points, and the optimal   policy prescriptions are showing something similar  Moreover, these simple prescriptions are for   interest rates that have their usual stimulative effects on the economy  In the current   environment, when some transmission channels are clogged, you could argue that we should be   doing even more than these exercises imply   I am becoming persuaded that we need to be moving monetary policy in a more   accommodative direction in order to make more rapid progress in meeting our statutory mandate    In other words, we need to turn up the water stream  Even if we can’t get all conceivable   benefits of the traditional transmission channels, further expansionary monetary policy could still   have a positive effect on equity prices and household wealth  Lower interest rates might   stimulate business investment, and dollar depreciation would tend to increase the   competitiveness of domestically produced goods and services   December 13, 2011 108 of 198              For this meeting, I support Alternative B  It remains uncertain how much progress fiscal   policy makers and housing policy makers are making in clearing the drain  But the pace of these   efforts may be increasing  We need additional information to get a better sense of if and when   we should turn up the water again  I am also concerned that a move from us that we haven’t   clearly telegraphed and explained might be interpreted by markets as a sign that we think the   situation in Europe is, well, going down the drain—a signal we should not send right now    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, let me say that I share many of the   concerns expressed on this draft  I am particularly moved by the expressions of concern about   December 13, 2011 166 of 198              how interpreting the strategies set out in the text of this draft could cause us to perform less well   on one mandate than on the other   I will try to address this risk first before turning to the broader rationale for supporting   this draft  To restate Governor Tarullo’s concerns, as well as the concerns of others, as a   question  Does this statement urge us to continue on a path where we state allegiance to the full   mandate but underperform on the employment side?  In short, my anticipation is that the   interpretation of the statement could have this result, but the existence of the statement alone   should not  Whether there is a statement or not, as a Committee we don’t want to adopt a policy   thinking that it permits us to act as though we are much more opposed to inflation being   modestly above our target than to inflation being a similar amount below our target, or that it   permits us to favor parts of the statutory mandate to the detriment of other parts  In other words,   we should not adopt a statement that provides a fig leaf for us to act contrary to our statutory   mandate  There is some risk embedded in the statement if we use it as an excuse to not act to   achieve our statutory mandate  I am sensitive to this risk  But this is a risk that exists regardless   of whether or not we adopt the statement  These are the debates around this table, and statement   or no statement, they are going to continue to exist  As long as we have a statutory mandate, we   are going to be interpreting it and reinterpreting it   The reason to adopt this draft is to provide more transparency to the American public on   the Committee’s monetary policy goals  The value of transparency, as I see it, is to improve   accountability by spelling out how monetary policy is set to achieve our statutory goals  In a   democratic society, public institutions must be accountable for their decisions  We say we need   to be independent  But if we want to ensure that monetary policy is well insulated from short-  term political pressures, then we need to do everything we can to help the public understand the   December 13, 2011 167 of 198              rationale for our policy decisions  In effect, we can’t make arbitrary choices about whether to   provide or withhold such information  Rather, in order to sustain the public’s confidence, we   should strive to be as transparent as possible in our policy communications   Of course, we should aim for clarity as well  It would be terrific if we could gain   consensus about a loss function, but it seems clear that such initiatives will require substantial   time for development and consultation with the Committee  Thus, as Governor Yellen noted in   her opening remarks, rather than letting the best become the enemy of the good, it seems very   sensible to move ahead with publishing policy projections starting in January, with the   understanding that the subcommittee will be exploring other possible SEP enhancements in   coming months   To sum up, the first principle in the statement is not just boilerplate  In particular, while   the Chairman has frequently expressed a commitment to transparency in his public   communications, I am not aware that the Committee has ever done so in any formal statement     Moreover, it seems inadvisable for the strength of that commitment to depend solely on the   Chairman, as though we would be open to the possibility of reverting to a culture of opacity and   secrecy sometime down the road  Instead, the entire Committee has before it a historic   opportunity to express a commitment to strive for the highest degree of clarity and transparency   in the monetary policy communications that are relevant to our country  Thank you  "
9165,2013-10-16,"  I have one question    Yes, for Bill, and that has to do with the position we took in 2011   regarding money market funds, where my sense is that we weren’t particularly supportive of a   new liquidity facility  Has anything changed in terms of your assessment on the feasibility or   advisability of a new liquidity facility in terms of money market fund stability?
